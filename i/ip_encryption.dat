In 1992, both research and implementation began at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) on <b>IP</b> <b>encryption.</b> This NRL work ultimately led to the IP Security protocols standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

This MCU family is mostly interesting for their plenty of timers {{that can be used}} in motor control both for sensing and actuation, in particular, the multi-function timer pulse unit (MTU) designed for motor control and PWM generation and sensing.

40|$|International audienceSome {{protection}} techniques {{had been}} previously proposed for encryption blocks and applied to an AES <b>encryption</b> <b>IP</b> described at RT Level. One of these techniques had been validated by purely functional fault injections (i. e. algorithmic-level fault injections) against single- and multiple- bit errors. RT-Level fault injections have been performed recently on a few AES IPs and this paper summarizes the main results obtained, highlighting the new results and comparing the outcomes of the two fault injection levels...|$|R
50|$|A HAIPE is an <b>IP</b> <b>encryption</b> device, {{looking up}} the {{destination}} IP address of a packet in its internal Security Association Database (SAD) and picking the encrypted tunnel {{based on the}} appropriate entry. For new communications, HAIPEs use the internal Security Policy Database (SPD) to set up new tunnels with the appropriate algorithms and settings. By not supporting routing protocols the HAIPEs must be preprogrammed with static routes and cannot adjust to changing network topology. While manufacturers support centralized management of their devices through proprietary software, the current devices offer no management functionality through open protocols or standards.|$|E
5000|$|The key {{is derived}} {{by taking the}} low-order key size bits of gij mod p. The key Kij or Kijn {{is used as a}} master or key-encrypting key to provide <b>IP</b> packet-based <b>encryption</b> and authentication. An {{individual}} IP packet is encrypted (or authenticated) using a randomly generated packet key denoted as Kp. The packet key is in turn encrypted using Kij or Kijn. Since Kij or Kijn can be cached for efficiency, it allows traffic (that is, packet) keys to be modified very rapidly (if necessary even on a per-packet basis) without incurring the computational overhead of a public-key operation. Furthermore, since the keys are communicated in the packets themselves, {{there is no need to}} incur the overhead and complexity of a pseudo-session layer underneath IP. Figure B-5 shows an encrypted IP packet, using the two-step encryption procedure described above. Figure B-5 Encrypted Packet ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analysis}} of a dynamically reconfigurable processor is presented. The network processor incorporates a processor {{and a number of}} coprocessors that can be connected to the processor either directly or using a shared bus. The analysis investigates the configuration (in terms of co-processor distributions and interface), formulates the throughput that meets the network demands and the constraints of the platform (area, bus bandwidth, etc.) and takes into account the reconfiguration overhead. To find the configuration that meets the constraints, the platform is formulated into integer linear programming equations. Furthermore, the results of two case studies are presented, for a soft- and a hard- IP core processor, that uses three flows with different processing requirements (<b>IP</b> forward, <b>encryption</b> and media processing). In each case the number and the type of co-processors is shown in terms of the network distribution and the average packet size. Finally, the mapping of the framework in the Xilinx FPGA platform is discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|The current Internet Protocol (IP) {{provides}} no protection against eavesdropping or even TCP connection hijacking. The standard attempts to mitigate {{these problems are}} firewalls and cryptographic protocols. IPSEC is the IETF standard for network layer security. IPSEC provides cryptographic services that support combinations of authentication, integrity and confidentiality. It provides security services to protect client protocols of IP, and supports host-to-host, subnet-to-subnet and host-to-subnet security topologies. In this paper, we describe a highly modular STREAMS based IPSEC implementation that provides well defined interfaces to the <b>IP</b> protocol stack, <b>encryption</b> methods, and security management.

40|$|We {{describe}} an IP-layer anonymizing infrastructure, called ANON, which allows server addresses to be hidden from clients and vice versa. ANON uses a network resident set of IP-layer anonymizing forwarders that can forward <b>IP</b> packets with <b>encryption</b> and decryption applied to their source and destination addresses. Using ANON, a client can {{send and receive}} packets to and from application servers without knowing their IP addresses. We have designed and implemented a laboratory testbed for this anonymizing infrastructure. This paper gives {{an overview of the}} ANON architecture and its implementation, and describes its security threat models and our countermeasures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Network data is, currently, often {{encrypted}} {{at a low}} level. In addition, as it {{is widely}} supported, the majority of future networks will use low-layer (<b>IP</b> level) <b>encryption.</b> Moreover, current trends imply that future networks {{are likely to be}} dominated by mobile terminals, thus, the power consumption and electromagnetic emissions aspects of encryption devices will be critical. This paper presents several realizations {{of one of the most}} widely used encryption algorithm, the DES/TripleDES, both in software and in hardware. We present software implementations of the algorithm running on two of the state-of-the-art Intel IXP network processors and several hardware realizations based on a standard-cell library. The hardware platforms presented appear to be optimal. Moreover, by placing and routing those designs, we have also realized that the commercial ASIC synthesis tools cannot accurately predict the area and the performance of the placed & routed final netlist in such designs, since the ASIC implementations of the encrypted algorithms include a very large number of wires and a limited number of logic CMOS cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{many of the}} {{cryptography}} applications like password or <b>IP</b> address <b>encryption</b> schemes, {{symmetric cryptography}} is useful. In these relatively simpler applications of cryptography, asymmetric cryptography is difficult to justify {{on account of the}} computational and implementation complexities associated with asymmetric cryptography. Symmetric schemes make use of a single shared key known only between the two communicating hosts. This shared key is used both for the encryption as well as the decryption of data. This key has to be small in size besides being a subset of a potentially large keyspace making it convenient for the communicating hosts {{while at the same time}} making cryptanalysis difficult for the potential attackers. In the present work, an abstract Rossler nonlinear dynamical machine has been described first. The Rossler system exhibits chaotic dynamics for certain values of system parameters and initial conditions. The chaotic dynamics of the Rossler system with its apparently erratic and irregular characteristics and extreme sensitivity to the initial conditions has been used for the design of the cryptographic key in an attempt to increase the confusion and the challenge for the potential attackers.

SSH (Secure Shell) tunneling is one specific method that ensures a highly encrypted data link between computers on the Internet.

40|$|A {{compact and}} {{efficient}} {{implementation of the}} Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the desirable <b>encryption</b> <b>IP</b> core for any practical low-end embedded application. In this paper, we investigate various architectures for compact AES implementations in 0. 18 -um CMOS technology. We first investigate a new compact digital hardware implementation of AES s-boxes applying the discovery of linear redundancy in AES s-boxes. Although the new circuit has a small size, the speed of this implementation is also reduced. Encryption architectures without key scheduling employing four s-boxes and only one s-box are implemented using our new AES s-boxes, as well as based on other compact s-box structures. The comparison of six implementations indicates that the implementation using four s-boxes based on arithmetic operations in GF(2 4) has the best trade-off of area and speed. Therefore, using this s-box implementation, a complete encryptiondecryption architecture with key scheduling employing the four sbox structure is implemented. In order to be adaptive to various practical applications, we optimize the implementation with the four s-box structure to support five different operation modes...|$|R
