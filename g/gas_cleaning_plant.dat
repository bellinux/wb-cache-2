50|$|The regions near Tarnów {{were chosen}} for the {{construction}} of the factory, ca. 4 kilometres from the town centre, to the west. The management of particular departments under construction were mainly the students of professor Ignacy Mościcki, the director of the Institute of Physical Chemistry and Technical Electrochemistry at the University of Technology in Lviv and the counsellor of this university in 1925-1926. The majority of the fittings for production installations PFZA were purchased abroad, the rest from national producers. The starting material in the installation for ammonia synthesis preceded with <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>plant</b> was blast-furnace coke from which water gas was obtained in six generators. The heat and power plant was built for the needs of chemical production, which was equipped with a boiler room burnt with fine coal. The equipment of the steam department of the heat and power plant were six boiler assemblies. Turbine assemblies were mounted for electric power generation, which included 3 condensation turbines and 1 back pressure turbine. The installation of machines and heat and power plant devices was completed on 2 October 1929. This day is considered the final date of factory construction.In 1928, next to the nitric installations, the construction of the Department of Chlorine was started, which did not had any technological connection with the nitric part, with Billiter’s electrolysers that were launched in July 1930.|$|E

40|$|Today, waste {{incineration}} {{is a hot}} topic. Since 2002 there are regulations against land filling combustible materials. From 2005 the same applies for organic waste. Due to the new regulations, icineration with energy recovery has increased {{and will continue to}} grow. Waste incineration gerenates a lot of residues. The foucs of this report is the common pollutants Sulphur dioxide and Hydrochloric acid. To separate these from the Flue gas an adsorbent, often hydrated lime, is used. Huge amount of the adsorbent has {{to be added to the}} process to gain sufficient cleaning. A previous study has showed that the adsorbent conversion efficiency is very low, only around 25 %. The objective of this project is to optimize the adsorption process of HCl and SO 2 to gain a reduction of lime consumption and to make the process more efficient. This will be achieved by changing selected parameters of the process at Borås Flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>plant.</b> Reduced limestone consumption has double benefits; decreased purchase cost and decreased cost due to the land filling fee for filter ash is reduced. The project included the following assignments; a literature study, an interview to gather experience from plant operators, collection and evaluation of plant data. Plant data indicates that the plant operation has changed due to the modification of the process parameters. Theory has shown that humidity plays a key role in the process. High humidity makes the lime more active and reduces the consumption. High humidity can be achieved by lowering the flue gas temperature or adding water to the fuel. These two cases and a combination of them have been tested at the plant. The result has showed a reduction in consumption of lime. There are a lot of cost reductions to gain. A plant with the same size as Borås will with a 10 % decrease in lime consumption reduce the cost with appr. 300. 000 SEK. Plant data has indicated that a 25 % decrease in lime consumption is achievable. This will reduce Borås Energys' cost with appr. 720. 000 SEK. Sorbacal is a new product developed for flue gas cleaning. It is estimated to be 2 or 2 times more efficient than regular lime. There are siginificant economical benefits to gain if the product can withstand the expectations. Estimatons shows that a cost reduction as high as 1. 2 MSEK is achievable.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with solidification/stabilisation (S/S) process of {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) fly-ashes produced in the plant located in Ko�ice (Slovakia) by cementation with a special interest in binding leachable heavy metals. Waste incineration is a commonly used technique for waste processing and disposal connected to production of MSWI fly-ash. Fly-ash is classified as hazardous waste due to high heavy metals content, and very fine particles. Two types of MSWI fly-ashes, collected from the cyclones (assigned as C) and from the filters (assigned as F) of the flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>plant,</b> were studied. By the S/S process using Portland cement both the fly-ashes were stabilised and the highest fly-ash:cement ratio to prepare firm stabilised samples were found to be 1 : 1. 45 and 6 : 1 for the fly-ashes F and C, respectively. These differences were caused by different composition of the fly-ashes that significantly influence the S/S process, especially low chlorides content, and presence of sulphates and quartzin the fly-ash C and highchlorides and sulphides and low quartz content, absence of sulphates, and higher contents of lead and zinc in the fly-ash F. Special interest was paid on Ni, Cr, Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb leaching from both the non-stabilised and the stabilised MSWI fly-ashes. Ni showed the highest and Zn the lowest leaching ratios for both the non-stabilised MSWI fly-ashes. All the monitored heavy metals leached from both the stabilised MSWI fly-ashes in concentrations below 0. 03 mg. l- 1. The leachates of both the solidified MSWI fly-ashes showed a significant immobilisation of the heavy metals in the stabilised product with a decrease of the leaching ability by more than 99 %. The stabilised MSWI fly-ashes can bedeposited in landfills for inert waste...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiation}} doses to {{be expected}} {{in case of a}} hypothetical accident in the surroundings of the THTR- 300 have been calculated. Moreover the period of time available for countermeasures has been estimated. These data make possible the rational planning of adequate emergency countermeasures. As a characteristic accident sequence causing the maximum consequences, a sudden irreparable loss of core cooling at full power was assumed. This causes a slow increase in the temperature of the reactor core and the coolant gas pressure. In addition it is assumed that the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>plant</b> fails, and that the safety valve does not shut again after it has been opened by the rising coolant gas pressure 8 hours after the initiation of the accident. This sequence of events results in a slow loss of coolant gas accompanied by an unfiltered release of radioactivity through the stack lasting about two days. The expected frequency of such an accident is less than 10 $^{- 8 }$/year. When the safety valve opens, mainly noble gases and iodine will be released at first. Cesium and strontium only follow after more than 30 and 50 hours, respectively. The radiation doses were pessimistically estimated {{on the basis of the}} 'RSK/SSK-Störfallberechnungsgrundlagen' for an exposure time of 7 days. The thyroid dose nowhere exceeds 25 rem (lowest hazard class of the "Rahmenempfehlungen" of the Federal Ministry of the Interior), if the consumption of contaminated food is forbidden within 8 hours after the beginning of the accident. The whole body dose is mainly caused by the inhalation of strontium. It does not exceed 5 rem and therefore does not reach the upper limit of the lowest hazard class by far. This is also true of the bone dose. The estimated doses are to be considered as a kind of upper limit values which in case of a real accident would not be reached by far. In any case the development of the accident leaves ampletime for an analysis of the accident situation, the measurement of the actual radiation, and the initiation of adequate countermeasures...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{materials}} {{can be used}} as a valuable resource for reuse, recycling or energy recovery. In this paper a review on using waste as energy resource, done in the REMOWE project, included in the EU funded Baltic Sea Region Programme, is presented. Five main conversion paths have been identified; combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion and fermentation. Combustion and anaerobic digestion are mature and well-proven technologies for waste treatment but improvements are needed to make the processes more efficient as energy conversion processes. For anaerobic digestion feedstock pre-treatment, avoidance of inhibition, mixing, residues utilization, and monitoring and control are identified development areas. A more recent trend is development of dry digestion technology for the treatment of municipal waste. The possible improvements of the combustion process using waste as fuel includes plant efficiency, improved emission control and ash handling. Pyrolysis and gasification have been used for waste treatment but the technologies are still in the development stage. Identified development areas are process operation conditions, gas and by-product quality, <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> and <b>plant</b> efficiency. Studies comparing waste to energy systems found do not give a clear picture of what waste to energy technology that is most favourable. The results of the comparisons are dependent on the conditions chosen for the study such as location, economic activities, population, and possible system combinations.

40|$|Development {{efforts have}} been {{underway}} for decades to replace dry-gas cleaning technology with humid-gas cleaning technology that would maintain the water vapor content in the raw <b>gas</b> by conducting <b>cleaning</b> at sufficiently high temperature to avoid water vapor condensation and would thus significantly simplify the plant and improve its thermal efficiency. Siemens Power Generation, Inc. conducted a program with the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) to develop a Novel Gas Cleaning process that uses {{a new type of}} gas-sorbent contactor, the ''filter-reactor''. The Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning process described and evaluated here is in its early stages of development and this evaluation is classified as conceptual. The commercial evaluations have been coupled with integrated Process Development Unit testing performed at a GTI coal gasifier test facility to demonstrate, at sub-scale the process performance capabilities. The commercial evaluations and Process Development Unit test results are presented in Volumes 1 and 2 of this report, respectively. Two <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> applications with significantly differing <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements were considered in the evaluation: IGCC power generation, and Methanol Synthesis with electric power co-production. For the IGCC power generation application, two sets of <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements were applied, one representing the most stringent ''current'' <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements, and a second set representing possible, very stringent ''future'' <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements. Current <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements were used for Methanol Synthesis in the evaluation because these cleaning requirements represent the most stringent of cleaning requirements and the most challenging for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning process. The scope of the evaluation for each application was: (1) Select the configuration for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning Process, the arrangement of the individual <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stages, and the probable operating conditions of the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stages to conceptually satisfy the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements; (2) Estimate process material & energy balances for the major plant sections and for each <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stage; (3) Conceptually size and specify the major <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> process equipment; (4) Determine the resulting overall performance of the application; and (5) Estimate the investment cost and operating cost for each application. Analogous evaluation steps were applied for each application using conventional <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> technology, and comparison was made to extract the potential benefits, issues, and development needs of the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas <b>Cleaning</b> technology. The <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> process and related gas conditioning steps were also required to meet specifications that address plant environmental emissions, the protection of the gas turbine and other Power Island components, and the protection of the methanol synthesis reactor. Detailed material & energy balances for the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> applications, coupled with preliminary thermodynamic modeling and laboratory testing of candidate sorbents, identified the probable sorbent types that should be used, their needed operating conditions in each stage, and their required levels of performance. The study showed that Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning technology can be configured to address and conceptually meet all of the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements for IGCC, and that it can potentially overcome several of the conventional IGCC power plant availability issues, resulting in improved power plant thermal efficiency and cost. For IGCC application, Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning yields 6 % greater generating capacity and 2. 3 percentage-points greater efficiency under the Current Standards case, and more than 9 % generating capacity increase and 3. 6 percentage-points higher efficiency in the Future Standards case. While the conceptual equipment costs are estimated to be only slightly lower for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning processes than for the conventional processes, the improved power plant capacity results in the potential for significant reductions in the plant cost-of-electricity, about 4. 5 % for the Current Standards case, and more than 7 % for the Future Standards case. For Methanol Synthesis, the Novel Gas Cleaning process scheme again shows the potential for significant advantages over the conventional <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> schemes. The <b>plant</b> generating capacity is increased more than 7 % and there is a 2. 3 %-point gain in plant thermal efficiency. The Total Capital Requirement is reduced by about 13 % and the cost-of-electricity is reduced by almost 9 %. For both IGCC Methanol Synthesis cases, there are opportunities to combine some of the filter-reactor polishing stages to simplify the process further to reduce its cost. This evaluation has devised plausible humid-gas cleaning schemes for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning process that might be applied in IGCC and Methanol Synthesis applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether coal- or biomass-fired Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) {{power plants}} {{can serve as}} an {{economically}} viable future technology for providing clean electricity and heat in Germany. In the context of CO 2 emission reduction in power generation, energy conversion technologies that enable the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) need to be considered. IGCC is one such technology, as it utilizes coal or biomass but does not necessarily emit CO 2. We therefore investigate whether IGCC plants can, from an economic perspective, be an alternative to nuclear and/or conventional coal-fired power plants. Our research is undertaken {{with the help of}} scenario analysis. The possible shut-down of nuclear power stations as well as of outdated coal-fired power plants, together with the evolution of CO 2 prices, provides the starting point of our study. The option of hot <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> in IGCC <b>plants</b> is of particular interest, as it is expected to significantly enhance the efficiency of IGCC technology and allows for combined heat and power production (CHP). Corresponding supplementary earnings (incl. subsidies) are compared with an increase in specific investment costs. Besides the hot <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> advancement, we also investigate the injection of pure CO 2 (separated from the IGCC process) into oilfields, as it reduces the costs of CO 2 transport and storage through Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Based on the results, a judgement on the ability of IGCC technology to replace nuclear power stations and/or conventional coal-fired power plants in Germany is made. Net present values calculated provide decision-support for energy suppliers about the if and when to invest in IGCC plants. We find that only a partial substitution of current power plants by IGCC facilities is reasonable, e. g. for locational reasons, whereas a complete abandonment of IGCC technology seems to be unlikely from the current point of view.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is a {{comparison}} of different kinds of flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems of municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI). This comparison will be done with the aid of material flow analysis. In addition, investment costs will be taken into consideration. The main topic of the investigation is the relationship between type of flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> system and resulting material flow including auxiliary chemicals and solid residues. Material flow analyses are performed by model calculations. Data used for these calculations are representative of operating values for technical-scale plants. As starting point a model plant with grate firing is considered. For this plant 10 different flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems are analysed, 6 of them being equipped with a wet cleaning system. Additionally, 2 systems operating in a semi dry sorption and 2 systems operating in conditioned dry sorption are taken into account. The system boundaries for the material flow analysis performed include the entire flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> system, starting with the raw gas downstream of the boiler and ending downstream of the stack. The elements chlorine (Cl), sulfur (S), mercury (Hg), cadmium and lead are considered. As a result of this work, two flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> concepts seem to be very interesting for the construction of new plants: A plant with a wet flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> system equipped with fabric filter followed by a two-stage scrubber system generates small amounts of residues by low investment costs.
