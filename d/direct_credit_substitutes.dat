40|$|Past {{empirical}} studies …nd that the widerspread use of <b>credit</b> <b>substitutes</b> {{money as a}} means of payment. Since in‡ation is a tax on money, one would expect that people switch from money to credit more often as the in‡ation rate increases, which however is not supported by empirical evidence. This paper builds a model where money and credit coexist as means of payment. The model predicts that <b>credit</b> <b>substitutes</b> money at low rates of in‡ation, but complements money at high rates of in‡ation. Moreover, the introduction of credit improves the society’s welfare only when in‡ation exceeds a certain level...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} twin mandates of the GSE Act of 1992 : to <b>direct</b> mort-gage <b>credit</b> to neighborhoods {{that have been}} underserved by mortgage lenders and to <b>direct</b> mortgage <b>credit</b> to low-income and minority households. Using the Kansas City metropolitan area as a test site, data from the GSEs have been compared with non-GSE mortgage lenders to determine {{the performance of the}} GSEs in meeting these two objectives. This research finds that the GSEs have not performed as well as the conventional lenders. Independent of the use of the secondary mortgage market, borrowers are better served if <b>credit</b> is <b>directed</b> to them independent of location. The alternative approach of <b>directing</b> <b>credit</b> to underserved areas is helpful only insofar as it helps to <b>direct</b> <b>credit</b> to neighborhoods that are marginally less desirable than the neigh-borhoods deemed to be well served. This research focuses upon the twin directives given to the government-sponsored enter-prises (GSEs) for the purchase of single-family housing loans. The GSEs—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—are the two major secondary mortgage-market participants. At issue is evaluating the merits of two different approaches to aiding the flow of mortgage <b>credit.</b> The first <b>directs</b> <b>credit</b> to low-income homebuyers regardless of where they choose to live. The second approach <b>directs</b> <b>credit</b> to those neighborhoods that have not received their fair share of mortgage credit in the marketplace. Which approach best serves the public interest...|$|R
40|$|The motives behind {{government}} programs to provide <b>directed</b> <b>credit</b> to agricul-ture and industry {{can be traced}} to problems of asymmetric information in capi-tal markets and, consequently, to benefits from relaxing the constraints on financing. In agriculture, <b>directed</b> <b>credit</b> programs that help farmers accumulate sufficient wealth to own the land they cultivate may improve the allocation of resources. In industry, the benefits of government credit may include product and factor market externalities, as weU as the direct benefits from relaxing borrowing constraints. In both sectors, government credit can be useful in over-coming obstacles faced by private intermediaries when lending entails initial fixed costs that intermediaries cannot recapture. Whether government intervention in credit markets can achieve legitimate objectives depends on the mechanism chosen to imnplenent <b>directed</b> <b>credit.</b> In some cases influence-peddling and soft repayment constraints lead to inefficien-cies from government involvement. In other cases these problems are avoided by establishing credible mechanisms that ensure the proper allocation and repay-ment offunds. Evidence on industrial credit programs in Japan shows an apparent link between that country's success in <b>directing</b> <b>credit</b> to machine-tool producers and the decisionmaking process that governs the distribution of credit. R ecent research investigates the role that <b>directed</b> <b>credit</b> programs play in mitigating possible misallocations of capital caused by information asymmetries.

40|$|There {{is more or}} less a {{consensus}} that financial repression or the program of <b>directed</b> <b>credit</b> leads to low levels of bank profit and thereby threatens solvency of banks in the long run. Rationale of <b>directed</b> <b>credit</b> lies in the divergence between the patterns of private and social profitability in LDCs like India. This paper shows that, if allocation of bank credit conforms to the pattern of social profitability, as happens under a program of <b>directed</b> <b>credit,</b> a part of the additional gain to the society accrues to the banks as well in the form of additional profit. More precisely, this paper seeks to prove that free market conditions do not maximize bank profit in the context of LDCs like India, but a suitably designed program of <b>directed</b> <b>credit</b> does. Therefore, this paper argues, aggregate bank profit is not necessarily less in a regime of financial repression. Submitted for discussion paper series (2003),ERU,ISI,Kolkata.
