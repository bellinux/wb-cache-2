[...] Since 1991 bioremediation has been a suggested tactic to remove impurities from water such as alkanes, perchlorates, and metals. [...] The treatment of ground and surface water, through bioremediation, with respect to perchlorate and chloride compounds, has seen success as perchlorate compounds are highly soluble {{making it difficult to}} remove. [...] Such success by use of Dechloromonas agitata strain CKB include field studies conducted in Maryland and the Southwest region of the United States. [...] Although a bioremediation technique may be successful, implementation is not feasible as there is still much to be studied regarding rates and after effects of microbial activity as well as producing a large scale <b>implementation</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

50|$|Based on the {{algorithm}} of BEMD, the <b>implementation</b> <b>method</b> of FABEMD is really similar to BEMD, but the FABEMD approach just changes the interpolation {{step into a}} direct envelop estimation method and restricts the number of iterations for every BIMF to one.

The size of the filter will depend on the maxima and minima maps obtained from the input. The steps of the FABEMD algorithm are listed below.|$|E
