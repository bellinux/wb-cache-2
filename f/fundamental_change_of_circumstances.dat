40|$|Frustration {{of purpose}} is a defense to the {{enforcement}} of a contractual obligation. Legal systems generally provide this defense when an unforeseen event undermines a party’s purpose for entering into a contract. In many legal systems frustration of purpose is often treated and discussed jointly with the related doctrine of impossibility, which concerns situations where unforeseen events render impossible (practical impossibility) or far more burdensome (economical impossibility) {{the performance of the}} obligations specified in the contract. Although different in their substance, the economic analysis of the doctrines of frustration and impossibility share a common logic. In the following analysis we shall therefore treat these doctrines together. When unexpected contingencies occur during the performance of a contract, there may be a divergence between what parties have expressly agreed upon in the contract and what they have implicitly assumed was their contractual obligation in terms of assumption of risk. In other words, when there is a period of time between the conclusion of the contract and the performance of the parties, there may be a <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> that makes the performance of the contract far more burdensome, or even physically impossible, for one party, or that completely frustrates the purpose of the contract for one party. The event that causes the change is, as said, unexpected or unforeseen and is not explicitly referred to in the parties’ agreement. If it were in the parties’ agreement, the general rules on breach of contract would apply. In all of these cases, the overarching question is whether the burdened party should be obligated to perform (or, if her performance has become impossible, pay damages) or whether she may be allowed to escape contractual liability by resorting to one of several “contract defenses. ” Such defenses might include the rebus sic stantibus (“all the things thus standing”) clause under which a party’s obligation under the contract is required only when conditions are the same as they were when the contract was formed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the role of}} public international law in the debt crises of developing countries. More specifically, it explores whether the rules of treaty law, the law of State responsibility, and international human rights law provide any guidance for debtor States seeking relief from their official creditors in times of difficulties arising from exogenous shocks. This issue is of much importance {{in an era when}} crises are more common and interrelated than before. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to crises and, moreover, the total debt burden of developing countries has continued to increase steadily. Even though today there are some international mechanisms for resolving debt crises, such as the Paris and London Clubs and the HIPC Initiative, renegotiations continue to be based on ad hoc arrangements and political negotiations. Major creditors are generally much more powerful than their debtor countries. One {{reason for this is that}} there is no international regulation of sovereign insolvency and the role of litigation is small. Resolution of debt crises is disorderly and may come at a high cost for developing countries, as they are often deprived of their economic independence. Due to this unstructured nature of sovereign debt, many call for a more legally oriented practice. The three branches of international law that this thesis is interested in provide different approaches to debt. Firstly, treaty law concerns termination and suspension of international agreements. When the debtor faces difficulties, it may try to suspend the loan agreement on the grounds of <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> (rebus sic stantibus), for example, provided that the debtor’s burden has increased in an unforeseen manner. However, applying this ground is subject to strict requirements and, moreover, treaty law is relevant only for loan agreements governed by international law. Secondly, the law of State responsibility provides for legal justifications that a debtor State may invoke if it cannot pay its debts. While force majeure is limited to situations of material impossibility, the customary defence of necessity is more interesting in the context of sovereign debt. Under necessity, the breach of an obligation is justified, if it helps to safeguard an essential interest, such as the provision of essential public services. Recently, Argentina, for example, has invoked necessity in litigations relating to its default. However, so far, courts and tribunals have been reluctant to apply necessity in practice, as the requirements for applying the defence are very strict. The third area of interest, human rights, is somewhat different from the two others. Sovereign debt has important implications for human rights and heavy debt burdens have often been found to constitute an important obstacle for the realization of economic and social rights in particular. In many cases poor debtor States are not able to both service their debts and to take care of the basic needs of their citizens. Human right aspects are often overrun by creditor interests, even though debtor States have obligations to provide a minimum level of rights to their own people and States in general are obliged to respect and not to harm the realization of rights in other countries. The biggest challenge with rights-based arguments is the lack of enforcement mechanisms. All in all, even though debt crises are normally resolved in political negotiations, international law has some kind of a role to play in their resolution. Even though they are not perfectly suitable to debt crises, the above mentioned arguments nevertheless provide legal guidance and may assist debtors to seek justice against creditor countries and international financial institutions. Such a legal approach can also make the resolution of debt crises more fair to all parties...|$|E
40|$|The {{flexibility}} of long-term investment contracts is {{a benefit to}} both an investor and the state for mitigating the effect of an unforeseeable event which negatively impacts on {{the viability of the}} contract. However, the aspect of sanctity of contract has often prompted rigid provisions with the underlying rationale that this gives investors security and predictability. In contrast, by virtue of the principle of <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> new trend has come to life in the field of extractive industries consisting of inclusion in the contract a provision that provides for renegotiation or adaptation of the existing agreement. The reasoning behind the adoption technique is that parties should not be obliged to carry on a performance which would be unjustly onerous or fruitless due to a supervening unregulated event. The main criticism of this approach is that the claim for renegotiating an existing agreement which contains no renegotiation clause or insistence on a third party intervention for adapting such a contract amount to an undue interference. However, the manner in which contracts are negotiated in countries that exhibit poor governance or situation of army conflict challenges this view. The question asked is whether an unfair contract concluded with unelected government or leaders of military factions and subject to corruption can be allowed to survive without being revised. The DRC, realizing this problem, undertook to renegotiate some of its mining contracts with specific objectives, such as; investor respect of legislation, use of local resources, social responsibility clauses, and evaluation of the input of the partners taking into account the equity shareholding with the public party holding not less than 51 %. This has resulted in the termination and cancellation of certain contracts. Aggrieved investors filed several proceedings, but they dropped them, privileging an amicable settlement. Besides, the outcome of the renegotiation suggests that Congolese negotiators have not fully achieved the objectives set out {{at the start of the}} process. Against this backdrop, the dissertation found that the Congolese mining sector is governed by a broad range of regulations and corresponding supervisory bodies. Constant suspicions of illegally mining exploitation prevail on the sector as a result of the ill enforcement of the aforesaid regulations, corruption and mismanagement. This study also found that renegotiating an existing agreement is a common practice in commercial contracts. Major systems of law have dealt with when they confronted with the issue related to the non-performance of a contractual obligation. The stability of the contractual terms is must but, at the same time, a certain degree of flexibility is necessary to allow parties to adjust their relationship in case of imperfections, cultural differences or supervening of unforeseen events. However, to be effective, the renegotiation mechanism must be regulated for not fuelling unlimited demand of adaptation, therefore, instability of the contract. The renegotiation of mining contacts in DRC was extremely politicised. However, both investor and Congolese sides have benefited from that differently. The Congolese government gave preference to short-term profits result to the expenses of the long-term improvements. By comparison, the majority of investors have secured their assets. Others have even increased them. An examination of the amended agreement that have been disclosed so far reveals that a lot issues remain unresolved, particularly with regard to the reasons that prompted the renegotiation. Moreover, parties to the aforesaid process did not attempt to regulate future demands of adaptation. Based on these findings, the recommendation of the dissertation is that future mining agreements should include a renegotiation clause and regulate the intervention of a third party. The Congolese government should endeavour to lessen political interference throughout mining contract negotiations. It should also build negotiation skills among its representatives involved in that process. Investors should increase among them awareness of corporate social responsibility standards for preventing illegal exploitation of mining resources which, ultimately, results in triggering unilateral contract adjustment. The remaining issues in connection with the amended agreements should be resolved amicably for this approach is more likely to bring mutual satisfaction to both the Congolese state and investors.
