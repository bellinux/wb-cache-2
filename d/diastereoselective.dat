5|$|The Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky {{reaction}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction or CCR) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides, aziridines, and cyclopropanes. It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky. The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone, aldehyde, imine, or enone to produce the corresponding 3-membered ring. The reaction is <b>diastereoselective</b> favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry. The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins.|$|E

25|$|When the Pictet–Spengler {{reaction}} is performed with an aldehyde other than formaldehyde, a new chiral center is created. Several substrate- or auxiliary-controlled <b>diastereoselective</b> Pictet–Spengler reactions have been developed. Additionally, List et al. have published a chiral Bronsted acid that catalyzes asymmetric Pictet–Spengler reactions.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, R. A. Fernandes and P. Kattanguru have {{completed}} an improved total synthesis of (8S, 11R, 12R)- and (8R, 11R, 12R)-topsentolide B2 diastereomers in eight steps. In the paper, <b>diastereoselective</b> Roush allylation reaction {{was used as}} a key reaction in the total syntheis to introduce two chiral intermediate. And then the authors synthesized the two diastereomers through these two chiral intermediates.|$|E
25|$|A {{widely used}} method is the Evans' acyl oxazolidinone method. Developed {{in the late}} 1970s and 1980s by David A. Evans and coworkers, the method works by {{temporarily}} creating a chiral enolate by appending a chiral auxiliary. The pre-existing chirality from the auxiliary is then transferred to the aldol adduct by performing a <b>diastereoselective</b> aldol reaction. Upon subsequent removal of the auxiliary, the desired aldol stereoisomer is revealed.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of 2,3,5-substituted pyrroles {{was achieved}} by the recognition that such substrates bear the same substitution pattern as 2-substituted indoles, and an asymmetric hydrogenation system that is effective {{for one of these}} substrates might be effective for both. Such an analysis {{led to the development of}} a ruthenium(I)/phosphine/amine base system for 2,3,5-substituted N-Boc pyrroles that can give either dihydro or tetrahydropyrroles (pyrrolidines), depending on the nature of the pyrrole substituents. An all-phenyl substitution pattern leads to dihydropyrroles in very high yield (>96%) and essentially perfect enantioselectivity. Access to the fully hydrogenated, all-cis dihydropyrrole may then be accessible through <b>diastereoselective</b> heterogeneous hydrogenation. Alkyl substitution may lead to either the dihydro or tetrahydropyrrole, although the yields (>70%) and enantioselectivities (often >90%) generally remain high. The regioselectivity in both cases appears to be governed by sterics, with the less-substituted double being preferentially hydrogenated.|$|E
25|$|The first {{synthesis}} of atorvastatin at Parke-Davis {{that occurred during}} drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early enantioselective route to atorvastatin made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry {{of the first of}} the two alcohol functional groups via a <b>diastereoselective</b> aldol reaction. Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, process chemistry developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin's case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final drug substance, and hence establishing the first stereocenter became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of isoascorbic acid, an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of an enantioselective Nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of Nazarov cyclization reactions. To that end, several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts. <b>Diastereoselective</b> cyclizations are also known, in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization. Almost all of the attempts {{are based on the}} idea of torquoselectivity; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to [...] "rotate" [...] in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below.|$|E
2500|$|Hydroboration can {{be highly}} regio- and <b>diastereoselective</b> by using bulky dialkylborane {{compounds}} such as bis-3-methyl-2-butylborane (disiamylborane). Another dialkylborane that exhibits excellent selectivity is 9-borabycyclononane, commonly abbreviated as 9-BBN. [...] Relative to disiamylborane, 9-BBN is more sensitive to electronic influences. Additionally, 9-BBN allows shorter reaction time and higher regioselectivity.|$|E
2500|$|The C-B bonds {{generated}} by hydroboration are reactive with various reagents, {{the most common}} one being hydrogen peroxide. [...] Because the addition of H-B to olefins is stereospecific, this oxidation reaction will be <b>diastereoselective</b> when the alkene is tri-substituted. Hydroboration-oxidation is thus an excellent way of producing alcohols in a stereospecific and anti-Markovnikov fashion.|$|E
50|$|Stereoselective fluorinations may {{be either}} <b>diastereoselective</b> or enantioselective. <b>Diastereoselective</b> methods {{have focused on}} the use of chiral {{auxiliaries}} on the nucleophilic substrate.

50|$|The first total {{synthesis}} of gephyrotoxin {{was performed by}} Kishi and his co-workers, here they prepped an intermediate from L-pyroglutamic acid in 18 steps. Others {{have made it to}} the same intermediate in fewer steps but have included poorly <b>diastereoselective</b> steps. In 2008 Santarem and colleges reported total {{synthesis of}} Gephyrotoxin by the obtention of an enantionpure cis-2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidine. Unlike others that included a poorly <b>diastereoselective</b> step, this process allowed for the development of two stereogenic centers at the same time.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} modest {{stereoselectivity}} is the dehydrohalogenation of 2-iodo-butane which yields 60% trans-2-butene and 20% cis-2-butene. Since alkene geometric isomers are also classified as diastereomers, this reaction {{would also be}} called <b>diastereoselective.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Enantiopure, planar chiral {{chromium}} arene complexes can be synthesized using several strategies. <b>Diastereoselective</b> complexation of a chiral, non-racemic arene to chromium is {{one such}} strategy. In the example in equation (5), enantioselective Corey-Itsuno reduction sets up a <b>diastereoselective</b> ligand substitution reaction. After complexation, the alcohol is reduced with triethylsilane.(5)A second strategy involves enantioselective ortho-lithiation and in situ quenching with an electrophile. Isolation of the lithium arene and subsequent treatment with TMSCl led to lower enantioselectivities.(6)Site-selective conjugate addition to chiral aryl hydrazone complexes {{can also be used}} for the enantioselective formation of planar chiral chromium arenes. Hydride abstraction neutralizes the addition product, and treatment with acid cleaves the hydrazone.(7) ...|$|E
