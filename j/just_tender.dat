5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} examples of steam cooking {{have been found in}} Cochise County, Arizona, where steam pits were used for cooking about 10,000 years ago. [...] In China's Yellow River Valley, early steam cookers made of stoneware have been found dating back as far as 5000 BCE. From the eighth century CE, thin cypress strips were used to make steamers; today they are constructed from bamboo with slatted bases. The classic steamer has a chimney in the center, which distributes the steam among the tiers.In Western cooking, steaming is most often used to cook vegetablesit is rarely used to cook meats. However, steamed clams are prepared by steaming. With Chinese cuisine, vegetables are usually stir fried or blanched and seldom steamed. Seafood and meat dishes are steamed. For example: steamed whole fish, steamed crab, steamed pork spare ribs, steamed ground pork or beef, steamed chicken and steamed goose. Rice can be steamed too, although in Chinese cooking this is simply referred to as [...] "cooking" [...] rather than [...] "steaming". In Thailand steaming is the definition of minimalist cooking. Steaming fish in Thai-style gently cooks the fish until <b>just</b> <b>tender.</b> Wheat foods are steamed as well. Examples include buns and Chinese steamed cakes.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Carrots were cooked to the <b>just</b> <b>tender</b> {{stage in}} a {{saucepan}} and in a pressure saucepan for appropriate lengths of time to make them approximately equal in tenderness as determined {{by a panel of}} judges and the Kramer Shear Press. A third lot of carrots was cooked in a pressure saucepan for approximately twice as long to represent overcooked carrots. Judges and the Hunter Color Meter indicated that the carrots cooked in the saucepan were more typically red-orange and bright and the carrots overcooked in the pressure saucepan were more yellow and dull. Pigments extracted from the carrots from the three cooking treatments were chromatographed on a magnesia column and the principle fractions, α-carotene and β-carotene, eluted. The β-carotene was rechromatographed on an alumina column to separate it into all-trans-β-carotene and neo-β-carotene B. In absolute amounts, carrots cooked in the saucepan had the highest concentration of all-trans-β-carotene and the highest total of all-trans-β-carotene, neo-β-carotene B and α-carotene, followed by those carrots cooked in the pressure saucepan for 50 seconds, with those cooked in the pressure saucepan for two minutes being lowest in both all-trans-β-carotene and total carotenes. However, when the a-carotene, the neo-pcarotene B and the all-trans-β-carotene were considered as percentages of the total, the percentage of α-carotene remained constant in the three treatments. Carrots cooked in the pressure saucepan for two minutes had a lower percentage of all-trans-β-carotene and a higher percentage of neo-β-carotene B than did carrots from the other two treatments. Thus, longer cooking in the pressure saucepan caused greater conversion of the more vivid all-trans-β-carotene to the paler cis-isomer, neo-β-carotene B. This isomerization plus loss of total pigment accounts for the differences in color of the cooked carrots from the three treatments...|$|E

50|$|To cook fiddleheads, it is {{advised to}} remove the brown papery husk before washing in several changes of cold water, then boil or steam them.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention associated a number of food-borne illness cases with fiddleheads in the early 1990s. Although they did not identify a toxin in the fiddleheads, the findings of that case suggest that fiddleheads should be cooked thoroughly before eating. The cooking time recommended by health authorities is 15 minutes if boiled and 10 to 12 minutes if steamed. The cooking method recommended by gourmets is to spread a thin layer in a steam basket and steam lightly, <b>just</b> until <b>tender</b> crisp.|$|R

It has taken nearly a hundred years to bring the English and Americans into kindly and mutually appreciative relations, but I believe it has been accomplished at last.

It is another great step when England adopts our sewing-machines without claiming the invention--as usual. It was another when they imported one of our sleeping-cars the other day.
