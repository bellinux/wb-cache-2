5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

25|$|The buff striped keelback (Amphiesma stolatum) is {{a species}} of nonvenomous {{colubrid}} snake found across Asia. It is the sole species of genus Amphiesma. It is a typically nonaggressive snake that feeds on frogs and toads. It belongs to the subfamily Natricinae, and {{is closely related to}} water snakes and grass snakes. It resembles an Asian version of the American garter snake. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> common snake but is rarely seen.|$|E

25|$|Grey Friar is a {{fell in the}} English Lake District, {{it is one of}} the Coniston Fells and is {{situated}} 13 kilometres west-south-west of Ambleside. It reaches a height of 770 metres (2,526 feet) and stands to the north west of the other Coniston Fells, a little off the beaten track and tends to be the least visited of the group. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> large fell and forms the eastern wall of the Duddon Valley for several kilometres, in fact all drainage from Grey Friar goes to the Duddon Valley and not to Coniston Water.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous Filipinos have harbored {{their own}} {{religions}} {{long before the}} Spanish had arrived at their shores. Along with these religions, are corresponding burial practices to accompany such religions. Given that the Spanish occupancy in the Philippines had lasted almost four-hundred years, {{it would not be}} a rash assumption that Catholicism should have become widespread or have become the primary religion for the entire nation. This inference, however would be highly problematic as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> ways from the actual truth. Persisting through the Spanish occupation, indigenous Filipino tribes continued with their respective religions and hence, with their customary burial practices. The Spanish influence however, highly affected the religious traditions and customs in the areas surrounding large trade cities and the capital. These influences include the location of the burials, position of the body and decoration of burial goods to name a few.|$|E
25|$|This {{formation}} {{is widely used}} by Spanish, French and German sides. While it seems defensive to the eye, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> flexible formation, as both the wide players and the full-backs join the attack. In defense, this {{formation is}} similar to either the 4–5–1 or 4–4–1–1. It is used to maintain possession of the ball and stopping opponent attacks by controlling the midfield area of the field. The lone striker may be very tall and strong to hold the ball up as his midfielders and full-backs join him in attack. The striker could also be very fast. In these cases, the opponent's defense {{will be forced to}} fall back early, thereby leaving space for the offensive central midfielder. This formation is used especially when a playmaker is to be highlighted. The variations of personnel used on the flanks in this set-up include using traditional wingers, using inverted wingers or simply using wide midfielders. Different teams and managers have different interpretations of the 4–2–3–1, but one common factor among them all is the presence of the double pivot. The efficiency and the compactness that the double pivot provides makes it vital to have in the modern game. The double pivot is the usage of two holding midfielders in front of the defence.|$|E

Geology has not yet sorted this out. [...] So this article will examine what the puzzle looks like before the pieces are assembled, touching on what may [...] or may not [...] be parts of the answers, and showing that shadowy zone at the edge of knowledge. [...] Because geologists do not yet know even which pieces are relevant, a wide and even speculative view must be taken. [...] This is what science looks like at the edge, before it is tamed and neatly trimmed.|$|E
2500|$|Cary's {{report and}} the {{documents}} initially released had shown that, on 3 December 1963, nine days before Kenya formally declared independence, three wooden packing crates containing 1,500 highly sensitive government files were loaded on to a British United Airways flight bound for Gatwick. On the eve of Kenya's independence, Colonial Secretary Iain Macleod ordered that sensitive colonial-government documentation be destroyed or flown {{out of the country}} because its disclosure [...] "might embarrass Her Majesty's Government". [...] "Embarrassment hardly covers it," [...] remarked a Times editorial, noting that [...] "the covert history of colonial administration in Kenya bears comparison to the methods of torture and summary execution in the French war in Algeria." [...] In April 2011, the government officially admitted for the first time not merely to having relevant Mau Mau documents, but that it had a total of 8,800 files from 37 ex-colonies, which it would make public in batches from April 2012 to November 2013. The Times opined: [...] "Even given the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's apparent skill in such matters, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> feat to ignore 300 boxes of documents filling 110ft of shelving for almost half a century." ...|$|E

2500|$|Formed in {{the latter}} months of 1885 by Harvard seniors William Woodward Baldwin, Thomas Parker Sanborn, Alanson B. Houghton, George Santayana, William Morton Fullerton, and George Rice Carpenter, the {{magazine}} proposed to afford [...] "...a medium for the strongest and soberest undergraduate thought of the college...". These six men comprised the Monthly's initial staff, with Houghton as editor, Baldwin as business manager and the others acting as editors. [...] The initial October 1885 issue includes works by Sanborn, Santayana, Houghton, Fullerton the magazine's faculty adviser, Barrett Wendell, among others. Some of the essays in this issue {{which may have been}} felt controversial have no stated author. In regard to this issue, The Harvard Crimson observed that [...] "The unique form and general typographical make-up of the new monthly is extremely pleasing; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> departure from the form of any magazine we have seen. The table of contents consists of stories, sketches, criticisms, poems, editorials and book reviews, choice morsels for the most delicate palate. It was announced that a feature of each number would be an article from the pen of some prominent alumnus." ...|$|E
2500|$|The brick tea is {{packaged}} [...] {{either in}} the courtyard or in the street outside, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> complicated process. When the coolies bring it in from Ya'an, {{it has to be}} repacked before being consigned upcountry, for in a coolie's load the standard subunit is four bricks lashed together, and these would be the wrong shape for animal transport. So they are first cut in two, then put together in lots of three, leaving what they call a gam, which is half a yak's load. Tea {{which is going to be}} consumed reasonably soon is done up in a loose case of matting, but the gams, which are bound for remote destinations, perhaps even for Lhasa, are sewn up in yakhides. These hides are not tanned but are merely dried in the sun; when used for packing they are soaked in water to make them pliable and then sewn very tightly around the load, and when they dry out again the tea is enclosed in a container which is as hard as wood and is completely unaffected by rain, hard knocks, or immersion in streams. The Tibetan packers are a special guild of craftsmen, readily identifiable by the powerful aroma of untanned leather which they exude.|$|E
2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E
