500|$|Following the 2010 season, Kafka {{said that}} his goal for the 2011 offseason was to [...] "continue to learn the offense. I haven't {{mastered}} it by any means, the more study and preparation <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> better. Physically, I can work on my feet, my arm strength, and my timing and rhythm. There's a bunch of things I can work on, and I'm really excited to get to it." [...] Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said Kafka is the hardest working player in the NFL, but needs to get bigger and stronger. The Eagles reportedly received trade offers from other teams for Kafka prior to the 2011 NFL Draft but declined due to his potential. Kafka, in response, laughed and {{did not believe the}} rumors.|$|E
500|$|Vlasic {{spent the}} 1989 {{off-season}} recovering form his injury, while the Chargers added another quarterback to the roster upon drafting Billy Joe Tolliver. After {{working out with}} the team during the preseason, he started the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list. With the Chargers having a reliable starter in Jim McMahon, who had been signed to the team, Vlasic was kept on the list for the season. In 1990, McMahon was released and John Friesz was drafted out of the University of Idaho, leaving Vlasic to compete with Friesz and David Archer for the backup quarterback job. As the preseason began for the 1990 San Diego Chargers season, the team released Archer, and the plan was for Friesz to split backup quarterback duties during the preseason. After an impressive preseason by Vlasic and only a pedestrian one by Tolliver, Chargers coach Dan Henning named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys in the season opener, citing that he was [...] "steadier" [...] than Tolliver. After losing the game 1714, the switch was made back to Tolliver as the starting quarterback, and was eventually named starter {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this, Vlasic remained optimistic, saying, [...] "I feel confident in my ability, and I always have. I know <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> job done whatever the situation. I have to believe that." [...] Over the course of the 1990 season, Vlasic played in six games, completing 19 of 40 passes for 168 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 46.7.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Maroney competed at the Olympic Trials in San Jose, California. [...] After {{the first day of}} competition she said, [...] "I'm thankful that I'm even here. I knew I had to hit vault because it's the most important event for me to make the Olympic team." [...] Though she had falls on both bars and beam on day one, and a major loss of formation on bars during day two, she placed seventh in the all-around with a two-day combined score of 117.650. In event finals, she placed first on vault scoring 31.700 and fifth on floor scoring 29.700. Afterwards, Maroney was chosen {{as a member of the}} team that was sent to the 2012 Summer Olympics. [...] She said, [...] "This is the best feeling – it's just so amazing. I'm in shock right now. I think this will be the happiest I'll ever be in my life. [...] It's the absolute best feeling knowing that I trained so hard for this and all the hard things that I have accomplished and now to be on this team. [...] These girls are my best friends. [...] My team mate Kyla Ross, we have been best friends since we were six years old so it's just absolutely amazing to be going to the Olympics." [...] When asked about feeling pressure to win gold on vault at the Olympics, she replied, [...] "If I do my job I know <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> gold medal. [...] That's what they picked me to be on the team for, so I need to be confident about that." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1904, in {{his early}} twenties, Joyce emigrated {{permanently}} to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) Nora Barnacle. They lived in Trieste, Paris and Zurich. Though {{most of his adult}} life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of Ulysses, he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, [...] "For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to <b>the</b> heart of Dublin <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to <b>the</b> heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal." ...|$|R
