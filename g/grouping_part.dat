Part One of the Article sets out the rationale for the establishment of the FTAA and the structure of the negotiations. The section also identifies some elements of the unique nature of the proposed <b>grouping.</b> <b>Part</b> Two discusses the challenges facing Caribbean countries as they participate in multilateral trade negotiations, including the FTAA. In Part Three, the Article critically reviews {{the early stages of the}} integration process in the Caribbean and examines the most recent developments in the process, particularly in the context of the process of globalization and liberalization. This is followed by Part Four, which discusses the Caribbean 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the FTAA...|$|E
40|$|Linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) {{has become}} an {{important}} technique in unsupervised neural learning. Even though linear ICA yields meaningful results in many cases, it can provide a crude approximation only for general nonlinear data distributions. In this paper we study techniques where local ICA models are applied to data first grouped or clustered using some suitable algorithm. The <b>grouping</b> <b>part</b> is responsible for an overall coarse nonlinear representation of the underlying data, while linear ICA models of each group (cluster) are used for describing local features of the data. The goal is to represent the data better than in linear ICA in a computationally feasible manner. We study several grouping methods, including standard K-means clustering, self-organizing maps, and neural gas. We also present a general theoretical framework encompassing {{a large number of}} methods for representing data. These range from global, dense representation methods (for example global PCA or IC [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A new {{concurrent}} cell formation {{method for}} solving a Cell Formation (CF) {{problem in a}} Cellular Manufacturing System (CMS) is developed and proposed in this research. To solve such problem, conventionally a facility planner needs to classify parts into families and group machines into cells, respectively. However, existing methods for solving the CF problem are difficult and complicated. Moreover, efficient solutions {{of some of those}} methods are not guarantee. So, the efficient method based on two important performance measures, called Exceptional Elements (EE) and the Void Elements (VE) of a perfect grouping, are developed. Preemptive Fuzzy Goal Programming (P-FGP) is applied to these two performance measures for finding the efficient solution. The problems of <b>grouping</b> <b>part</b> family and machine cells can be simultaneously easily solved. Moreover, machines and parts grouping can also be adjustable to find preferred solutions by use of P-FGP. The numerical examples existed in the literatures are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model over the conventional method...|$|E

It was describing the genre of homepages online marketplaces that contituted the social function, the schematic structure and linguistics features. Purposive sampling was used in selecting the data. There were five homepages of online marketplaces in the internet that were selected as the data. They were Sephora, Walmart, Amazon, Ebay, and AliExpress. The data were analyzed by using descriptive qualitative method. After reading all part detail of the homepages then <b>grouping</b> <b>part</b> the homepages. After it segmenting each clause using Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) Transitivity analysis. From the analysis, there were 137 clauses found. From the clauses that have been analyzed, it found the social function of the homepages of online market was to promote and to persuade the readers or the buyers to read or to buy the products. Then the schematic structure was Navigation Link^Link to Homepage^Primary Location for Search^Main Content Column^ Additional Information,Contact information, Store Information and Copyright.

30|$|In recent years, {{competitive}} market conditions coerce manufacturing firms to enhance response times and flexibility in all operations. Flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) have been proved to respond this challenge positively {{because of their}} ability to produce a variety of parts using the same system in the shortest possible lead time. According to [Stecke (1983)], FMS is characterized as an integrated, computer-controlled, complex arrangement of automated material handling devices and computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools that can simultaneously process medium-sized volumes of a variety of part types. The highly integrated FMS offers the opportunity to combine the efficiency of transfer line and the flexibility of a job shop to best suit the batch production of mid-volume and mid-variety of products. However, flexibility has a cost, and the capital investment sustained by firms to acquire such systems is generally very high. Therefore, adequate planning of FMS during its development phase is pivotal so as to evaluate the performance of the system and justify the investment incurred. Prior to production, careful operational planning is essential to establish how well the system interacts with the operations over time. Hence, successful operation of FMS requires more intense planning as compared to any conventional production system. The decisions related to FMS operations can be broadly divided into pre-release and post-release decisions. Pre-release decisions include the FMS operational planning problem that deals with the pre-arrangement of jobs and tools before the processing begins, whereas post-release decisions deal with the scheduling problems. Pre-release decisions, viz machine <b>grouping,</b> <b>part</b> type selection, production ratio determination, resource allocation, and loading problems, must be solved while setting up an FMS. Amongst pre-release decisions, machine loading is considered {{as one of the most}} vital production planning problems since operational effectiveness of FMS largely depends on it. Loading problem, in particular, deals with allocation of jobs to various machines under technological constraints with the objective of meeting certain performance measures. Therefore, the problem is combinatorial in nature and happens to be non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard.|$|E
