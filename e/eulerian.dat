5|$|The duality between <b>Eulerian</b> and bipartite planar graphs can be {{extended}} to binary matroids (which include the graphic matroids derived from planar graphs): a binary matroid is <b>Eulerian</b> {{if and only if}} its dual matroid is bipartite. The two dual concepts of girth and edge connectivity are unified in matroid theory by matroid girth: the girth of the graphic matroid of a planar graph {{is the same as the}} graph's girth, and the girth of the dual matroid (the graphic matroid of the dual graph) is the edge connectivity of the graph.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no <b>Eulerian</b> circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} form of {{the problem}} asks for a path that traverses all bridges and also has the same starting and ending point. Such a walk is called an <b>Eulerian</b> circuit or an Euler tour. Such a circuit exists if, and only if, the graph is connected, {{and there are no}} nodes of odd degree at all. All <b>Eulerian</b> circuits are also <b>Eulerian</b> paths, but not all <b>Eulerian</b> paths are <b>Eulerian</b> circuits.|$|E
25|$|Some {{classes of}} matroid have been defined from {{well-known}} families of graphs, by phrasing a characterization of these graphs {{in terms that}} make sense more generally for matroids. These include the bipartite matroids, in which every circuit is even, and the <b>Eulerian</b> matroids, which can be partitioned into disjoint circuits. A graphic matroid is bipartite {{if and only if}} it comes from a bipartite graph and a graphic matroid is <b>Eulerian</b> if and only if it comes from an <b>Eulerian</b> graph. Within the graphic matroids (and more generally within the binary matroids) these two classes are dual: a graphic matroid is bipartite if and only if its dual matroid is <b>Eulerian,</b> and a graphic matroid is <b>Eulerian</b> if and only if its dual matroid is bipartite.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} of a 2-chain is necessarily an <b>Eulerian</b> subgraph, and every <b>Eulerian</b> subgraph {{can be generated}} in this way from exactly two different 2-chains (each {{of which is the}} complement of the other). It follows from this that the set of bounded faces of the embedding forms a cycle basis for the planar graph: removing the unbounded face from this set of cycles reduces the number of ways each <b>Eulerian</b> subgraph can be generated from two to exactly one.|$|E
25|$|Swarm {{algorithms}} {{follow a}} Lagrangian approach or an <b>Eulerian</b> approach. The <b>Eulerian</b> approach views the swarm as a field, {{working with the}} density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties. It is a hydrodynamic approach, and can be useful for modelling the overall dynamics of large swarms. However, most models work with the Lagrangian approach, which is an agent-based model following the individual agents (points or particles) that make up the swarm. Individual particle models can follow information on heading and spacing that is lost in the <b>Eulerian</b> approach.|$|E
25|$|In many situations, {{the mapping}} of average {{quantities}} from some <b>Eulerian</b> position x to a corresponding Lagrangian position α forms a problem. Since a fluid parcel with label α traverses along {{a path of}} many different <b>Eulerian</b> positions x, {{it is not possible}} to assign α to a unique x.|$|E
25|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, the (binary) cycle space of an undirected graph is the set of its <b>Eulerian</b> subgraphs.|$|E
25|$|Stanley {{introduced}} a generalization of the h-vector, the toric h-vector, which is defined for an arbitrary ranked poset, and proved {{that for the}} class of <b>Eulerian</b> posets, the Dehn–Sommerville equations continue to hold. A different, more combinatorial, generalization of the h-vector that has been extensively studied is the flag h-vector of a ranked poset. For <b>Eulerian</b> posets, it can be more concisely expressed {{by means of a}} noncommutative polynomial in two variables called the cd-index.|$|E
25|$|The Stokes drift is the {{difference}} in end positions, after a predefined amount of time (usually one wave period), as derived from a description in the Lagrangian and <b>Eulerian</b> coordinates. The end position in the Lagrangian description is obtained by following a specific fluid parcel during the time interval. The corresponding end position in the <b>Eulerian</b> description is obtained by integrating the flow velocity at a fixed position—equal to the initial position in the Lagrangian description—during the same time interval.|$|E
25|$|In modern language, Euler {{shows that}} the {{possibility}} of a walk through a graph, traversing each edge exactly once, depends on the s of the nodes. The degree of a node is the number of edges touching it. Euler's argument shows that a necessary condition for the walk of the desired form is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. This condition turns out also to be sufficient—a result stated by Euler and later proven by Carl Hierholzer. Such a walk is now called an <b>Eulerian</b> path or Euler walk in his honor. Further, if there are nodes of odd degree, then any <b>Eulerian</b> path will start at one of them and end at the other. Since the graph corresponding to historical Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have an <b>Eulerian</b> path.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>Eulerian</b> forms it is {{apparent}} that the assumption of an inviscid fluid, or no deviatoric stress, brings Cauchy equations to the Euler equations.|$|E
25|$|A mathematically sound {{basis for}} an {{unambiguous}} mapping between average Lagrangian and <b>Eulerian</b> quantities {{is provided by}} the theory of the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) by Andrews and McIntyre (1978).|$|E
25|$|Stokes' first {{definition}} of wave celerity has, for a pure wave motion, the mean {{value of the}} horizontal <b>Eulerian</b> flow-velocity ŪE at any location below trough level equal to zero. Due to the irrotationality of potential flow, together with the horizontal sea bed and periodicity the mean horizontal velocity, the mean horizontal velocity is a constant between bed and trough level. So in Stokes first definition the wave is considered from a frame of reference moving with the mean horizontal velocity ŪE. This is an advantageous approach when the mean <b>Eulerian</b> flow velocity ŪE is known, e.g. from measurements.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} graph theory, {{two of the}} nodes now have degree 2, {{and the other two}} have degree 3. Therefore, an <b>Eulerian</b> path is now possible, but it must begin on one island and end on the other.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} is {{by using the}} Lagrangian frame of reference, following the fluid parcels. The Lagrangian formulations show enhanced convergence, {{as compared to the}} formulations in both the <b>Eulerian</b> frame, and in the frame with the potential and streamfunction as independent variables.|$|E
25|$|More generally, the Stokes drift {{velocity}} {{is the difference}} between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a fluid parcel, and the average <b>Eulerian</b> flow velocity of the fluid at a fixed position. This nonlinear phenomenon is named after George Gabriel Stokes, who derived expressions for this drift in his 1847 study of water waves.|$|E
25|$|If a graph G has an Euler cycle, that is, if G is {{connected}} {{and has an}} even number of edges at each vertex, then the line graph of G is Hamiltonian. However, not all Hamiltonian cycles in line graphs come from Euler cycles in this way; for instance, the line graph of a Hamiltonian graph G is itself Hamiltonian, regardless of whether G is also <b>Eulerian.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{vorticity}} confinement (VC) {{method is}} an <b>Eulerian</b> technique {{used in the}} simulation of turbulent wakes. It uses a solitary-wave like approach to produce a stable solution with no numerical spreading. VC can capture the small-scale features to within as few as 2 grid cells. Within these features, a nonlinear difference equation is solved {{as opposed to the}} finite difference equation. VC is similar to shock capturing methods, where conservation laws are satisfied, so that the essential integral quantities are accurately computed.|$|E
25|$|The {{last four}} {{equations}} describe {{the evolution of}} slowly varying wave trains over bathymetry in interaction with the mean flow, and {{can be derived from}} a variational principle: Whitham's averaged Lagrangian method. In the mean horizontal-momentum equation, d(x) is the still water depth, i.e. the bed underneath the fluid layer is located at z=–d. Note that the mean-flow velocity in the mass and momentum equations is the mass transport velocity , including the splash-zone effects of the waves on horizontal mass transport, and not the mean <b>Eulerian</b> velocity (e.g. as measured with a fixed flow meter).|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, it {{was shown}} that for finite-amplitude waves the {{convergence}} of the Stokes expansion depends strongly on the formulation of the periodic wave problem. For instance, an inverse formulation of the periodic wave problem as used by Stokes – with the spatial coordinates as a function of velocity potential and stream function – does not converge for high-amplitude waves. While other formulations converge much more rapidly, e.g. in the <b>Eulerian</b> frame of reference (with the velocity potential or stream function {{as a function of the}} spatial coordinates).|$|E
25|$|By Veblen's theorem, every <b>Eulerian</b> {{subgraph}} {{of a given}} graph can be decomposed into simple cycles, subgraphs {{in which}} all vertices have degree zero or two and in which the degree-two vertices form a connected set. Therefore, it is always possible to find a basis in which the basis elements are themselves all simple cycles. Such a basis is called a cycle basis of the given graph. More strongly, it is always possible to find a basis in which the basis elements are induced cycles or even (in a 3-vertex-connected graph) induced cycles whose removal does not separate the remaining graph.|$|E
25|$|Explorer 1 changed {{rotation}} axis after launch. The elongated body of {{the spacecraft}} had been designed to spin about its long (least-inertia) axis but refused to do so, and instead started precessing due to energy dissipation from flexible structural elements. Later it was understood that on general grounds, the body {{ends up in the}} spin state that minimizes the kinetic rotational energy for a fixed angular momentum (this being the maximal-inertia axis). This motivated the first further development of the <b>Eulerian</b> theory of rigid body dynamics after nearly 200 yearsto address this kind of momentum-preserving energy dissipation.|$|E
500|$|A {{connected}} {{planar graph}} is <b>Eulerian</b> (has even degree at every vertex) if {{and only if}} its dual graph is bipartite. A Hamiltonian cycle in a planar graph [...] corresponds to a partition of the vertices of the dual graph into two subsets (the interior and exterior of the cycle) whose induced subgraphs are both trees. In particular, Barnette's conjecture on the Hamiltonicity of cubic bipartite polyhedral graphs is equivalent to the conjecture that every <b>Eulerian</b> maximal planar graph can be partitioned into two induced trees.|$|E
2500|$|The cycle space, also, has an {{algebraic}} structure, but a {{more restrictive}} one. The union or intersection of two <b>Eulerian</b> subgraphs may fail to be <b>Eulerian.</b> However, the symmetric difference of two <b>Eulerian</b> subgraphs ...|$|E
2500|$|A graph G, {{or one of}} its subgraphs, {{is said to be}} <b>Eulerian</b> if each of its {{vertices}} has an {{even number}} of incident edges (this number is called the degree of the vertex). This property is named after Leonhard Euler who proved in 1736, in his work on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, that a connected graph has a tour that visits each edge exactly once if and only if it is <b>Eulerian.</b> However, an <b>Eulerian</b> subgraph {{does not need to be}} connected; for instance, the empty graph, in which all vertices are disconnected from each other, is <b>Eulerian.</b> [...] The cycle space of a graph is the collection of its <b>Eulerian</b> spanning subgraphs.|$|E
2500|$|This {{algorithm}} {{looks at}} things differently {{by using a}} result from graph theory which helps improve on the LB of the TSP which originated from doubling {{the cost of the}} minimum spanning tree. Given an <b>Eulerian</b> graph we can find an <b>Eulerian</b> tour in [...] time. So if we had an <b>Eulerian</b> graph with cities from a TSP as vertices then we can easily see that we could use such a method for finding an <b>Eulerian</b> tour to find a TSP solution. By triangular inequality we know that the TSP tour can be no longer than the <b>Eulerian</b> tour and as such we have a LB for the TSP. Such a method is described below.|$|E

2500|$|To {{improve our}} lower bound, we {{therefore}} need {{a better way}} of creating an <b>Eulerian</b> graph.
