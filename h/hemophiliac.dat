5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a <b>hemophiliac,</b> he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} psychological {{factors associated with}} coping and adjustment in hemophilia, a chronic condition characterized by recurrent pain.;Mild (n = 23) and severe (n = 26) <b>hemophiliacs</b> were compared with rheumatoid arthritic (n = 22) patients and pain-free controls (n = 30) on personality, health beliefs, perceived social support, and experimental pain perception. Pain history, pain coping strategies and disability were compared among medical groups. <b>Hemophiliacs</b> 2 ̆ 7 psychological functioning was within normal limits. <b>Hemophiliacs</b> and arthritics made similar attributions about health control from powerful others, despite <b>hemophiliacs</b> 2 ̆ 7 stronger internality. Medical groups reported greater family support than did controls, but {{did not differ in}} their perceptions of support from friends.;Disability of severe <b>hemophiliacs</b> was low-moderate and intermediate between rheumatoids and milds. Chronic arthritic pain in hemophilia was equal in intensity to that of rheumatoid arthritis, but less interfering. In contrast, acute hemorrhagic pain was rated higher in intensity and disruptiveness. Relative to comparison groups, <b>hemophiliacs,</b> particularly milds, were less responsive to experimental pain. <b>Hemophiliacs</b> used more adaptive strategies in coping with their arthritic pain than did rheumatoids, but did not differ from each other in strategies used for acute bleed pain.;Hierarchical regressions indicated that some psychological variables contributed directly to the prediction of <b>hemophiliacs</b> 2 ̆ 7 physical and psychosocial adjustment, whereas others showed a moderating effect with disease severity. Perceived social support from family and friends differentially predicted specific aspects of functioning. Support from friends influenced depression and hemorrhagic pain independently of disease severity. Both types of support interacted with disease severity to predict physical dysfunction, whereas family support also exerted moderating effects on depression. Health locus of control, pain control, and self-efficacy beliefs did not predict pain or functioning. Clinical pain intensity was predicted by hypochondriasis, anxiety and depression, whereas only harmavoidance predicted experimental pain perception. Neither avoidant nor attentional strategies facilitated coping with chronic or hemorrhagic pain, although catastrophizing about hemorrhagic pain predicted greater physical and psychosocial dysfunction.;Thus, <b>hemophiliacs</b> appeared to be coping adequately with the stressors of their condition. The possible facilitating role of the pain experience of hemophilia, strong family support and absence of catastrophizing are discussed...|$|R

Three weeks later, on [...] "Bloody Sunday", at least 92 people were killed by Cossack troops during a demonstration, and a month later Olga's uncle, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, was assassinated. Uprisings occurred throughout the country, and parts of the navy mutinied. Olga supported the appointment of the liberal Pyotr Stolypin as prime minister, and he embarked on a programme of gradual reform, but in 1911 he was assassinated. The public unrest, Michael's elopement, and Olga's sham marriage placed her under strain, and in 1912, while visiting England with her mother, she suffered a nervous breakdown.

In the present study, we analyzed the effect of HLA-B* 5101 on clinical outcome for Japanese <b>hemophiliacs</b> who had been infected with HIV- 1 before 1985 and had been recruited in 1998 for this study. HLA-B* 5101 (+) <b>hemophiliacs</b> exhibited significantly slow progression.

40|$|This study updates {{estimates}} of the cumulative incidence of AIDS among Italian patients with congenital coagulation disorders (mostly <b>hemophiliacs),</b> and elucidates the role of age at seroconversion? type and amount of replacement therapy, and HBV co-infection in progression.

The independence of factors associated to faster progression was assessed by multivariate analysis.
