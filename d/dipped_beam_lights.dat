40|$|Abstract. The low <b>beam</b> <b>light</b> optical {{configuration}} of high brightness LED headlamp is designed in this paper. When we design low <b>beam</b> <b>light,</b> three same optical units are overlapped to achieve sufficient luminous flux. LED optical source is arranged and packaged into a LED by using multi-chip in linear array. Each unit uses multi-ellipsoid reflector to converge light issued by multi-chip high-power LED light source, which covers partial light to form by light-dark blocking {{some of the}} light baffle to form an cut-line, the light is converged through optical lens to obtain the light-type that low <b>beam</b> <b>light</b> requires. The application of ASAP software implements the simulation, and the test results show that this design meets the national standard of low <b>beam</b> <b>light...</b>|$|R
50|$|A feature often {{included}} {{as part of}} such a tester is a method by which {{the intensity of the}} beam can be measured. This is achieved with a light meter or Lux meter which is incorporated within the assembly itself. This can be used to not only measure the intensity of the <b>dipped</b> <b>beams</b> but also to measure and compare the full beam intensity.|$|R
