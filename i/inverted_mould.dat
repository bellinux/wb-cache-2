40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to study the {{variation}} of secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) of Al-Si-Cu-Mg-(Fe/Mn) alloys with the cooling rate and composition. Sand casting trials {{were carried out}} in Al-Si-Cu-Mg-(Fe/Mn) alloys with varying compositions of Si, Cu and Fe using an <b>inverted</b> <b>mould.</b> Alloys were prepared in an induction furnace at about 730 ºC and triple-plate castings were cast using chills {{at the bottom of}} the plates for promoting directional solidification. Thermal information was acquired using pre-installed thermocouples through the mould wall. Optical microscopy studies were implemented to study the variation of secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) as a function of chemical composition and cooling rate. The relationships between cooling rate and SDAS were plotted for the alloys and SDAS decreased with an increase in cooling rate and also with the increase in alloy composition...|$|E
40|$|The conference theme “Momenting the Memento” {{focused on}} six areas of enquiry – Body, Calligraphy, Craft, Dress, Imagery and Space. ‘Absence’ {{was one of}} 26 {{installations}} and was positioned in the crypt of the Santa Croce. ‘Absence’ {{is the culmination of}} traditional leatherwork techniques combined with contemporary mould making practices, incorporating the <b>inverted</b> silicone <b>mould</b> into the finished piece. The purpose of the absence collection is to explore the extent to which personal possessions can be used to harbor emotions by transforming inanimate object into a personal reliquary or shrine. Objects were chosen that related to particular specific people. Drawing upon personal possessions such as jewellery, garments and luggage that had been abandoned artefacts were created from <b>inverted</b> <b>moulds</b> and solid components to identify the space in which a person leaves behind. The positioning of the work alongside specific individual crypts within the Santa Croce allowed a relatable dialogue between possession and owner to take place, resulting in the artefacts being displayed {{along the length of the}} crypt...|$|R
5000|$|Chester : Voiced by Matt Crocco. Chester {{was born}} in Las Vegas, raised by a tap dancing tribe (S1E1). A typical stoner, his head is an <b>inverted</b> rubber <b>mould</b> for a Buddha figurine, his eyelashes are plastic {{sunflower}} petals, and a sweater sleeve composes most of his body. This gives him a distinct shape, resulting in a vacant smile {{and the appearance of}} innards in his mouth. His eyes are the same as Olly's, with the addition of large, petal-like eyebrows. Chester announces the beginning of the show, though he is not skilled at the task, occasionally referring to Sifl & Olly by the wrong names (such as Starsky and Hutch), or simply refusing to perform the announcement. Usually laughs softly as he talks. Chester considers himself a Don Juan, though the other characters imply that Chester has never been with a woman. He is very forgetful, often forgetting that he lives in the studio, that he is on a television show, or that the fans in the [...] "Letters to Chester" [...] segments aren't in the studio. He is obsessed with cereal, and it is implied that he eats it constantly, though he is rarely seen doing so on screen. He collects water, which he proudly proclaims to possess the entire set of (in the form of ice, steam, and regular water). He occasionally wanders into other skits, usually while eating a sandwich, and often doesn't realize that the skits aren't real (such as thinking that he had wandered into space while entering the set of a Star Wars parody). He is occasionally sold or traded by Olly, such as being sold to a freak show for $20 or used to pay Sifl's debt to the mafia.|$|R
