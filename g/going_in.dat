The sheriff forbids anyone from <b>going</b> <b>in</b> the woods and hunting the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy in the woods. They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E

Many other cities in central Crete subsequently joined Rhodes and Knossos against Hierapytna and Olous. Now under attack on two fronts, Hierapytna surrendered.|$|E

5|$|Cross-fertilization between {{board games}} {{and video games}} continued.

Even Sins of a Solar Empire was {{inspired}} by the idea of adapting the board game Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century into a real-time video game. <b>Going</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of Sid Meier's Civilization in 2002, completely different from the board game that had inspired the computer game in the first place.|$|E

In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E

For the most part, both sides were armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern {{weaponry}} at the Ottoman military's disposal. Initially, the battle was <b>going</b> <b>in</b> Shamdin's favor and a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against the Kurds. As a result, Shamdin's forces were dealt a decisive blow and commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle.|$|E

The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so for the first time in November 1940.|$|E

A long pass from Huxford down the right flank was headed by Shutt into Hamilton's path. He beat three defenders and, despite the fact he was stumbling, shot past Notts County goalkeeper Ward, with the ball <b>going</b> <b>in</b> after hitting the crossbar. It had been Bradford's first shot of the game. Steve Finnan had County's first chance after 14 minutes but shot straight at Bradford keeper Jonathan Gould. Minutes later, City had two successive chances through Shutt and Youds, but the first was blocked and the second went wide. During this spell of play, County's two central defenders Murphy and Gary Strodder both received yellow cards. Just before half-time, Shutt {{had the chance to}} double City's lead but his weak shot hit Ward's ankles after good work by Kiwomya.|$|E

A complete departure from her previous studio album American Life (2003), the album includes influences of 1970s and 1980s disco, as well as modern-day club music. Initially, she began working with Mirwais Ahmadzaï for the album, but later felt that their collaboration was not <b>going</b> <b>in</b> the direction she desired.

McPake then made a goal-line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' keeper Mark Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared but he got the ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|E

5|$|The Palisades Interstate Parkway {{begins at}} the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Passengers from the upper level of the GWB can {{directly}} get on the PIP northbound, while passengers from the lower level of the bridge must travel through GWB Plaza on US9W before getting on the parkway. Passengers riding northbound on the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) must be in local lanes to directly get on the PIP. Once the PIP leaves the GWB, it proceeds north along the New Jersey Palisades, past the Englewood Cliffs Service Area. Unlike service areas further north along the parkway, there are two in Englewood, one for northbound drivers and one for southbound drivers. The others are in the center median shared by drivers <b>going</b> <b>in</b> both directions. There are also three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades near {{the northern tip of}} the island of Manhattan at the Harlem River. After this, the PIP parallels US9W and the Hudson River for its entire run in New Jersey. All four exits in New Jersey are either with US9W, or within mere feet of the route.
