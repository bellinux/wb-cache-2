25|$|ABS-CBN Film Restoration Project is {{a digital}} film {{restoration}} project of ABS-CBN Corporation {{in partnership with}} Central Digital Lab. The project is headed by Leo Katigbak of ABS-CBN Film Archives and Manet Dayrit of Central Digital Lab. The goal of the project is to digitally restore and remaster select Filipino films from the archives of ABS-CBN. Since {{the beginning of the}} project in 2011, the project has successfully digitized, restored, and remastered over one hundred Filipino films into a 1080p or 2K <b>Digital</b> <b>Cinema</b> <b>Package</b> format with a maximum resolution of 2048x1080 pixels at 24 frames per second. These films have been released through a wide array of platforms including limited theatrical runs, film festivals, free-to-air and cable television, DVDs, pay per view, and over-the-top content platforms such as iTunes. All of the restoration process are done by Central Digital Lab in the Philippines with the exception of Kakabakaba Ka Ba? and Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos which were commissioned by ABS-CBN to be restored abroad by L’Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna, Italy and was supervised by Davide Pozzi. All copyrights to the films restored and remastered are owned in perpetuity by ABS-CBN Corporation.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, SMPTE {{introduced}} the D-Cinema Digital Leader; a picture {{version of the}} countdown leader for use with Digital Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM) files. [...] The DCDM is the penultimate step {{to the creation of}} the <b>Digital</b> <b>Cinema</b> <b>Package</b> (DCP). Unlike the previous film standards, no provision is made for changeover cue marks because digital cinema files are continuous.|$|E
5000|$|The audio in {{a typical}} <b>Digital</b> <b>Cinema</b> <b>Package</b> (DCP) is 5.1 {{channels}} of discrete audio, {{and that is the}} preferred audio configuration, although up to 7.1 channels is acceptable. The minimum for a non-mono configuration of the audio shall be three channels as Left, Centre, Right (a Left/Right configuration is not acceptable in a theatrical environment).|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{original}} version which was in full HD resolution (1920×1080), the stereoscopic version was rendered in <b>Digital</b> <b>Cinema</b> <b>Package</b> (DCP) 2K flat resolution (1998×1080), a slightly wider aspect format which required adjustment of the camera lens parameter in every shot. Many scenes in {{the original}} production files used flat 2D matte paintings which were integrated into the rendered images during the compositing phase. For the 3D production each matte painting had to be manipulated or entirely recreated into versions for each eye.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{repackaging}} of the <b>cinema</b> <b>package</b> in September 2002, the <b>cinema</b> <b>package</b> {{formerly known}} as CINEBOX now has new channels named Ciné Box, Ciné comic (formerly Rire), Ciné Polar (formerly Polar) and Ciné Fx.|$|R

At the same time Cutting Room created {{a partnership with the}} film lab at Stockholm Post Production AB utilizing their ability to scan film up 2K and 4K resolution for a <b>Digital</b> <b>Cinema</b> <b>Package</b> (DCP).

50|$|In June 2005, at CinemaExpo, Doremi showed for {{the first}} time a {{playback}} of a <b>Digital</b> <b>Cinema</b> <b>Package</b> (DCP). The package was prepared by the Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI). Shortly after, Doremi looked to master a complete movie in digital. Universal Studios gave Doremi and Fotokem the authorization to master the upcoming movie Serenity in digital and have it ready by opening day. Doremi and Fotokem rose to the challenge despite many hurdles and showed the movie mastered on the DMS-2000, played on the DCP-2000 in September 2005, at Fotokem screening room. Shortly after, the movie was shown at the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) on a 75-foot screen, to rave reviews.|$|E
50|$|The {{post-production}} of many {{feature films}} is now carried out using a digital intermediate workflow, {{in which the}} uncut camera negative is scanned, editing and other post-production functions are carried out using computers, and an internegative is burnt out to film, from which the release prints are struck in the normal way. This procedure eliminates at least one generation of analogue duplication and usually results in a significant higher quality of release prints. It has the further advantage that a <b>Digital</b> <b>Cinema</b> <b>Package</b> can be produced as the final output in addition to or instead of film prints, meaning that a single post-production workflow can produce all the required distribution media.|$|E

To analyze the performance of these objective metrics for <b>digital</b> <b>cinema</b> applications, a subjective visual quality assessment in <b>digital</b> <b>cinema</b> environments using contents from the <b>Digital</b> <b>Cinema</b> Initiative (DCI) Standard Evaluation Material has been conducted in a previous study.
