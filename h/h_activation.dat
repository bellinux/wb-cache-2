These osteoblasts produce FN extracellular matrix (ECM) known to regulate adhesion, differentiation, and function in adherent cells. Changes in bone ECM and osteoblast cell shape occur in spaceflight. To determine whether altered FN matrix is a factor in causing these changes in spaceflight, quiescent osteoblasts were launched into microgravity and were then sera activated with and without a 1 -gravity field. Synthesis of FN mRNA, protein, and matrix were measured after activation in microgravity. FN mRNA synthesis is significantly reduced in microgravity (0 -G) when compared to ground (GR) osteoblasts flown in a centrifuge simulating earth's gravity (1 -G) field 2. 5 <b>h</b> after <b>activation.</b> However, 27. 5 <b>h</b> after <b>activation</b> {{there were no significant differences}} in mRNA synthesis.

These results demonstrate that FN is made by sera-activated osteoblasts even during exposure to microgravity.

40|$|Abstract—H ions are {{powerful}} modulators of cardiac function, liberated during metabolic activity. Among their physiological effects is a chemical gating of cell-to-cell communication, caused by H-mediated closure of connexin (Cx) channels at gap junctions. This protects surrounding tissue from the damaging effects of local intracellular acidosis. Cx proteins (largely Cx- 43 in ventricle) form multimeric pores between cells, permitting translocation of ions and other solutes up to 1 kDa. The channels {{are essential for}} electrical and metabolic coordination of a tissue. Here we demonstrate that, contrary to expectation, H ions can induce an increase of gap-junctional permeability. This occurs during modest intracellular acid loads in myocyte pairs isolated from mammalian ventricle. We show {{that the increase in}} permeability allows a local rise of [H]i to dissipate into neighboring myocytes, thereby providing a mechanism for spatially regulating intracellular pH (pHi). During larger acid loads, the increased permeability is overridden by a more familiar H-dependent inhibition (H inactivation). This restricts cell-to-cell H movement, while allowing sarcolem-mal H transporters such as Na/H exchange, to extrude the acid from the cell. The H sensitivity of Cx channels therefore defines whether junctional or sarcolemmal mechanisms are selected locally for the removal of an acid load. The bell-shaped pH dependence of permeability suggests that, in addition to H inactivation, an <b>H</b> <b>activation</b> process regulates the ensemble of Cx channels open at the junction. As well as promoting spatial pHi regulation, <b>H</b> <b>activation</b> of junctional permeability may link increased metabolic activity to improved myocardial coupling, the better to mee...|$|E

The cluster-continuum solvation model is employed to account for both specific and long-range interactions with the methanolic medium. A large number of mechanistic scenarios consisting of microsolvated transition states inclusive of explicit methanol molecules have been considered to unravel the role of methanol in the crucial cyclometalation deprotonation (C <b>H</b> <b>activation)</b> {{as well as in}} the reductive elimination steps besides that in the other steps of the reaction. A cooperative C <b>H</b> <b>activation,</b> assisted by both methanol and palladium-bound acetate, involving a relay proton transfer has been identified as a vital mechanistic event. Most importantly, the generally proposed inner-sphere reductive elimination (ISRE) transition states are found to be more than 6 (CCSD(T)) to 9 (DFT, M 06) kcal/mol higher than the corresponding outer-sphere (OSRE) equivalent. The methoxide bound to palladium is introduced to the ortho aryl carbon in the case of ISRE, while a hydrogen-bonded methanol is deprotonated by the palladium-bound acetate ligand as it gets simultaneously attached to the ortho carbon in the OSRE mechanism. In most of these steps, a relay proton transfer facilitated by the explicitly bound methanol molecules is identified as responsible for the additional stabilization of the crucial transition states in the mechanistic course. These results underscore the importance of specific interactions with the polar protic solvent molecules in reactions such as the title reaction while attempting to derive meaningful mechanistic insights...|$|E

Using whole cell electrophysiology in brain slices, we employed 2 mM Cs+ (an I h antagonist) to isolate the role of I h in spontaneous firing and cold activation in neurons recorded with either control or I h agonist (cyclic AMP) -containing artificial intracellular fluid. I h did {{not contribute to the}} membrane potential (V m) and spontaneous firing at 20 °C. Although voltage-clamp analysis confirmed that cooling inhibits I h, its lack of involvement in setting baseline firing and Vm precluded its ability to regulate cold activation as hypothesized. In contrast, neurons dialyzed with cAMP exhibited greater baseline firing frequencies at 20 °C due to I <b>h</b> <b>activation.</b> Our hypothesis was supported when the starting level of I h was enhanced by elevating cAMP because cold activation was converted to more ordinary cold inhibition. These findings indicate that situations leading to enhancement of I h facilitate firing at 20 °C, yet the hyperpolarization associated with inhibiting a depolarizing cation current by cooling blunts the net V m response to cooling to oppose normal cold-depolarizing factors.

Moreover, epidermal growth factor, which induced a transient (1 <b>h)</b> <b>activation</b> of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in MDCK cells, only slightly increased integrin alpha (2) expression and failed to trigger cell scattering. Conversely, HGF induced a sustained (at least 12 <b>h)</b> <b>activation</b> of ERK in the cells, Expression of constitutively active ERK kinase (MEK) in MDCK cells led to increased expression of integrin alpha (2) even in the absence of HGF stimulation.
