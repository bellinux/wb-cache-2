50|$|There are 5 {{pieces to}} each <b>Fillet</b> weld <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Root, Toe, Face, Leg and Throat. The {{root of the}} weld {{is the part of}} deepest {{penetration}} which is the opposite angle of the Hypotenuse. The toes of the weld are essentially the edges or the points of the hypotenuse. The face of the weld is the outer visual or hypotenuse that you see when looking at a fillet weld. The legs are the opposite and adjacent sides to the triangular fillet weld. The leg length is usually designated as the size of the weld. The throat of the weld is the distance {{from the center of the}} face to the root of the weld. Typically the depth of the throat should be at least as thick as the thickness of metal you are welding.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFillet discolouration, {{commonly}} <b>known</b> <b>as</b> bruising, is {{an unintended}} and undesirable consequence in many commercial fishing operations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to develop a method to objectively measure and characterize the size and location of discolouration patterns that are currently observed in the fillets of commercially harvested yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) on the east coast of Canada. To accomplish this, an image processing program was developed to analyse fillet discolouration patterns. Total discoloured area and percent fillet coverage were measured and compared to total bruise weight and percent bruise weight attained from manual assessment. Results revealed that bruising was evident in 86. 5 % of the fish sampled. Of all the parameters measured, fish weight was the only parameter correlated with bruise weight. Bruise area ranged from 0 to 124. 5 cm 2, with a mean of 12. 1 cm 2 (s. d. = 21. 4), and accounted for an average of 4. 3 % of fillet area. Bruises were not uniformly distributed on any of the fillet sides. Results revealed a strong tendency for bruising to occur at the anterior dorsal region of the <b>fillet,</b> commonly <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the “nape”. Functional explanations for this finding are provided, including recommendations for future research...|$|R

5000|$|Dry-aged beef is beef {{that has}} been hung or placed on a rack to dry for several weeks. After the animal is {{slaughtered}} and cleaned, it is hung as a full or half carcass. Primal (large distinct sections) or sub primal cuts, such <b>as</b> strip <b>loins,</b> rib eyes, and sirloin, are placed in a refrigerator unit, also <b>known</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "hot box". This process involves considerable expense, as the beef must be stored near freezing temperatures. Subprimal cuts can be dry aged on racks either in specially climate-controlled coolers or within a moisture-permeable drybag. Moreover, only the higher grades of meat can be dry aged, as the process requires meat with a large, evenly distributed fat content. Because of this, dry-aged beef is seldom available outside of steak restaurants and upscale butcher shops or groceries. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, {{as well as the}} tenderization of the meat texture.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationships between various estimates of marbling in Jersey and Limousin crossbred steers with intramuscular fat percentage (IMF%) as determined by solvent extraction. The correlations between IMF% and various marbling scores ranged from 0. 67 to 0. 79. AUS-MEAT, MSA or USDA scoring systems were correlated, and ranked animals similarly. However, the best correlation with IMF% was found to be with the AUS-MEAT marbling score. When the range of IMF% was assigned to different scores within each system, the AUS-MEAT and USDA systems were similar whereas MSA scores had a higher concentration of fat per score and a broader range of concentrations. The only factors influencing assessment of marbling were IMF% and breed. Other traits, such <b>as</b> <b>loin</b> temperature, eye muscle area, melting point, fat colour and meat colour were not significant. Jersey cross steers had higher marbling scores (1. 9 vs 0. 8) and IMF% (6. 4 vs 4. 4 %) than Limousin cross. A breed by sire interaction in marbling was also detected...|$|R

40|$|Competition {{in global}} pork markets has {{increased}} as trade barriers have opened {{as a result}} of free trade agreements. Japanese prefer both loin and Boston butt, while Chinese prefer pork offal. Frozen pork has increased in terms of imports into China. Japanese consumers consider pork meat origin along with pork price when making purchase decisions. While the Chinese prefer a strong tasting pork product, South Korean consumers show very strong preferences to pork that is higher in fat. Therefore, South Korean consumers have a higher demand for pork belly and Boston butt. Consequently, the supply and demand of pork in Korea is hardly met, which means that importation of high fat parts is inevitable. In Korea there is lower preference toward low fat parts such <b>as</b> <b>loin,</b> picnic shoulder, and ham. During the economic depression in South Korea there have been observable changes in consumer preferences. There remains steep competition among the pork exporting countries in terms of gaining share in the international pork market.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionUreteric colic {{frequently}} presents <b>as</b> <b>loin</b> to groin {{pain and}} {{accounts for a}} significant proportion of emergency urological admissions. However, a number of differential diagnoses should be considered in a systematic approach when assessing patients. Presentation of caseWe report a case of a 30 year old man admitted with severe unilateral loin to groin pain following lumbar specific weightlifting exercises. After a significant delay due to initial mis-diagnosis he was diagnosed with acute paravertebral lumbar compartment syndrome (PVCS) and managed conservatively. DiscussionExertional PVCS is a rare and potentially life threatening condition arising following lumbar specific exercise that has only been recorded a handful of times previously. Patients typically present with intractable lumbar pain and rhabdomyolysis 6 – 12 h following exercise. Due to initial diagnostic delay our case was managed conservatively with fluid resuscitation and monitoring of renal function. ConclusionAssessment of patients with loin pain requires a systematic approach. PVCS is a rare cause of lumbar back and loin pain but one that should be considered, particularly in active young males. Early diagnosis is key to prevent the potential sequalae of untreated rhabdomyolysis. There is currently no consensus on management option for PVCS with only a few cases being reported in the literature. We describe successful management with supportive non operative treatment...|$|R
