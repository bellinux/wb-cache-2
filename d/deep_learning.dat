40|$|Deeper {{learning}} is a term that gained {{a lot of attention}} lately. Deeper learning involves pupils spending more time on subjects by using their knowledge and competences to solve authentic problems in order to make learning last. New and interesting opportunities have presented themselves with the introduction of ICTs in schools, and in particular with game-based learning (GBL). Within game-based learning, a particular sub-genre is learning through sandboxes. Sandboxes offer much in terms of adaptability and possible approaches to English teaching, and seem to be compatible with problem-based learning (PBL) and with CLIL: content and language integrated learning. However, there are few examples on how <b>deeper</b> <b>learning</b> could be realized in the classroom, and as yet no studies have been published on the use of sandbox games to facilitate for <b>deeper</b> <b>learning.</b> This thesis explores some of the theoretical framework for <b>deeper</b> <b>learning</b> and how it connects to PBL, CLIL, and GBL. Three different scenarios are presented, with suggestions for how these can be implemented in classrooms in ways that also develop English skills. Although these scenarios are imagined, they are also concrete and developed to fit different levels of competence within the structure of a typical Norwegian classroom. The following discussion argues that sandbox games {{can be used as a}} method for facilitating <b>deeper</b> <b>learning</b> in subjects such as English in ways that are both relevant and feasible within contemporary Norwegian school structure...|$|R
