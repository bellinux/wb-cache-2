5|$|Shortly {{after moving}} in, Eddy became close to another student, Daniel Spofford. He was 33 {{years old and}} married when he joined her class; he later left <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope that he might marry Eddy, but his {{feelings}} were not reciprocated. Spofford and seven other students agreed to form an association that would pay Eddy a certain amount a week if she would preach to them every Sunday. They called themselves the Christian Scientists' Association.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp {{was still}} living with his common-law wife, Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1880 census, {{but she had a}} growing {{addiction}} to the opiate laudanum. There are no contemporary Tombstone records that indicate a relationship between Marcus and Earp, but Earp certainly knew her, because both Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{discharged}} Palatine Theodore Csanád {{and restored}} Julius Kán {{in the second}} half of 1222. The following year, Pope Honorius urged Andrew to launch a new crusade. If the report of the Continuatio Claustroneuburgensis is reliable, Andrew took the cross to show that he intended launch a new crusade, but no other sources mention this event. Andrew planned to arrange a new marriage for his eldest son, Béla, but Pope Honorius mediated a reconciliation between Béla and <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autumn of 1223. This angered Andrew, and Béla fled to Austria. He returned in 1224, after the bishops persuaded Andrew to forgive him.|$|E
5|$|Béla {{separated}} from <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of}} 1222 upon his father's demand. However, Pope Honorius refused to declare the marriage illegal. Béla accepted the Pope's decision and took refuge in Austria from his father's anger. He returned, together with his wife, only after the prelates had {{in the first half}} of 1223 persuaded his father to forgive him. Having returned to his Duchy of Slavonia, Béla launched a campaign against Domald of Sidraga, a rebellious Dalmatian nobleman, and captured Domald's fortress at Klis. Domald's domains were confiscated and distributed among his rivals, the Šubići, who had supported Béla during the siege.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1881, Marcus found Behan in {{bed with}} the wife of a friend and kicked him out, {{although}} she still used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. Earp had a common-law relationship with Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, a commonly used opiate and painkiller. There are no contemporary records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. But Earp and Marcus certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp both had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E
50|$|The {{names of}} Pratap Rana's wives were Vidya and Jeet. They both died before 1950. His two films were named after <b>his</b> <b>wives.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> two films, 'Vidya' and 'Jeet', the heroines, played by Suraiya were called 'Vidya' and 'Jeet' respectively.|$|R

5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> musical.|$|E
5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that because he and <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by him) be treated as the income of both him and his wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the assignment agreement should also determine the federal income tax effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should be taxed to him).|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner {{played an}} active role in the 2008 {{government}} conflict with the agricultural sector, when Cristina Kirchner introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports that raised custom taxes to soybean exports to 44%. At that time, he became president of the Justicialist Party and publicly supported <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict; Kirchner accused the agricultural sector of attempting a coup d'état. He spoke in support of a bill to set the taxes by law at a demonstration at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Many senators who had supported the government rejected the proposal, and the voting was tied 36–36. Vice-President Julio Cobos, president of the Chamber of Senators, cast the decisive vote in opposition to the measure.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Tracy joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, at {{the time}} Hollywood's most prestigious studio. His career flourished {{with a series of}} hit films, and in 1937 and 1938 he won {{consecutive}} Oscars for Captains Courageous and Boys Town. By the 1940s, Tracy was one of the studio's top stars. In 1942, he appeared with Katharine Hepburn in Woman of the Year, beginning a popular partnership that produced nine movies over 25 years. Tracy left MGM in 1955, and continued to work regularly as a freelance star, despite an increasing weariness as he aged. His personal life was troubled, with a lifelong struggle against alcoholism and guilt over his son's deafness. Tracy became estranged from <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, but never divorced, conducting a long-term relationship with Katharine Hepburn in private. Towards the end of his life, Tracy worked almost exclusively for director Stanley Kramer. It was for Kramer that he made his last film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner in 1967, completed just 17 days before Tracy's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Hergé was {{assisted}} by Edgar Pierre Jacobs, {{an artist who}} worked as part of Studios Hergé. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friend's - Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves {{at the bottom of}} page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
