5|$|The current {{trend of}} {{enhancing}} {{security at the}} cost of passenger and baggage handling efficiency at international airports is expected to continue in the future. This places financial burden on airports, risks the flow of servicing processes, and has <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> privacy of passengers.

5|$|Carroll {{received}} a commission from Calvert as the colony's Attorney General on July 18, 1688, and {{arrived in the}} colony in October 1688. En route, Carroll changed his family motto from In fide et in bello forte (strong in faith and war) to Ubicumque cum libertate (anywhere {{so long as there}} be freedom). Soon after he left, the Protestant William of Orange invaded England, James II fled, and Parliament—which had been leery of James' Catholicism—recognized William and his wife Mary as the new King and Queen two weeks after Carroll's arrival in Maryland. This event, known as the Glorious Revolution, had profound <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future of the Maryland colony and for Carroll.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech {{had entered}} into {{the main part of}} its {{schedule}} after three dominating wins. Upcoming engagements with Vanderbilt, Pittsburgh, and Centre were said to determine the season's outcome. Pittsburgh and Centre–but Pittsburgh especially, were the biggest opponents. Vanderbilt was seen as the warm up act to these two, for it was far superior to any of Tech's prior games. The first game of the year to have direct <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Southern championship, it was cited by some as the most interesting southern contest of the week.|$|E
5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E
5|$|Initially, geneticists {{assumed that}} the {{junction}} would adopt a parallel rather than antiparallel conformation, because that would place the homologous duplexes in closer alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the antiparallel conformation, a finding that was considered controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The antiparallel structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 the <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> in vivo structure remained unclear, especially {{the structure of the}} junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{travelled}} to Massachusetts to {{face the}} New England Patriots at Foxboro Stadium in Week 17. The game was a de facto home game, as many Giants fans made the trip up to Foxborough to sell the stadium out. The game had no playoff <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Giants, who could not surpass the 49ers for the #1 seed in the NFC playoffs. The Giants rushed for a season-high 213yards, led by Hostetler's 82yards on 10 carries. The Patriots' Jason Staurovsky missed a potential game-tying 42-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, and Hostetler then ran a 30-yard bootleg on a key third-down play to allow the Giants to run out the clock and secure the victory, 13–10.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi regime {{began to}} persecute Jews {{soon after the}} seizure of power. Hess's office was partly {{responsible}} for drafting Hitler's Nuremberg Laws of 1935, laws that had far-reaching <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Jews of Germany, banning marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and depriving non-Aryans of their German citizenship.

The council continued {{for more than a}} year, and eventually moved to other cities; although several times they seemed close to negotiating a conclusion to the crisis, a successful agreement remained beyond their reach. They also offered Gebhard a sum of money to relinquish his claim, which he refused on the high moral grounds of religious principle.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor {{therefore}} has important <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> concept of dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended {{from a common}} ancestor). The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who {{compiled a list of}} cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of Herrerasaurus by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common ancestor, and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of Herrerasaurus also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.|$|E
