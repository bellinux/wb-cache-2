5|$|Headquartered at the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center is {{tasked with}} {{forecasting}} {{the risk of}} severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in the contiguous United States. It issues convective outlooks, mesoscale discussions, and watches {{as a part of}} this process. Convective outlooks are issued for the following eight days (issued separately for Day1, Day2, Day3, and Days 4–8), and detail the risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes during the given <b>forecast</b> <b>period,</b> although tornado, hail and wind details are only available for Day 1. Days 2 and 3, as well as 4–8 use a probabilistic scale, determining the probability for a severe weather event in percentage categories.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center also is {{responsible}} for issuing fire weather outlooks (FWD) for the continental United States. These outlooks are a guidance product for local, state and federal government agencies, including local National Weather Service offices, in forecasting the potential for wildfires. The outlooks issued are for Day 1, Day 2, and Days 3–8. The Day 1 product is issued at 4:00 a.m. Central Time and is updated at 1700Z, and is valid from 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 2 outlook is issued at 1000Z and is updated at 2000Z for the <b>forecast</b> <b>period</b> of 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 3–8 outlook is issued at 2200Z, and is valid from 1200Z {{two days after the}} current calendar date to 1200Z seven days after the current calendar date.|$|E
5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after tomorrow, and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the <b>forecast</b> <b>period</b> increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E
30|$|It is {{observed}} {{that there is}} a depletion mechanism under the primary recovery phase (Do_Nothing). The pressure drop of 225 psi and a total pressure of 1576 psia were observed {{at the end of the}} <b>forecasting</b> <b>period.</b> It seems from the pressure trends that CO 2 injection process slightly contributes to stabilizing the pressure, and as such the reservoir pressure in the <b>forecasting</b> <b>period</b> is following the same trend as that of the Do_Nothing case. A pressure drop of 172 psi and a total pressure of 1629 psia were observed at the end of <b>forecasting</b> <b>period.</b> On the contrary, the CO 2 -WAG process was found to be a successful injection strategy to maintain the field pressure at 1830 psi at the end of the <b>forecasting</b> <b>period.</b> These results are aligned with the performance of CO 2 -WAG published earlier by Caudle and Dyes (1958) and Mousavifar et al. (2012). The field gas oil ratios (FGOR) in MSCF/STB of all three cases are plotted in Fig.  8 d.|$|R

Rather than rising to nearly 12% GDP over the <b>forecast</b> <b>period</b> (through 2080) as forecast in 2009, the 2015 forecast has Medicare costs rising to 6% GDP, comparable to the Social Security program.|$|E
500|$|While {{the track}} errors {{associated}} with forecasting the hurricane {{were lower than}} the errors in the period between 1992 and 2001, Elida's intensity proved {{to be hard to}} predict, leading to large errors in NHC forecasts. The errors in the <b>forecast</b> <b>period</b> except for the 72‑hour period were worse than the long-term average. The large errors in intensity forecasts were blamed on the rapid intensification of the hurricane to [...] winds and the unsteady weakening after reaching peak intensity.|$|E

30|$|Form Fig.  8 e, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that the FWCT by the primary (Do_Nothing) process gradually increases to almost 0.18 and then started to decrease with the same rate until the value of 0.03 is reached at the end of <b>forecasting</b> <b>period.</b> The trend of the FWCT in of the CCO 2 was like Do_Nothing case between 24 and 35 years, but its decline rate was much slower, reaching 0.13  at the end of simulation run. The FWCT in the CO 2 -WAG case increased at a higher rate compared to the other two cases. However, it gave a manageable FWCT level during the <b>forecasting</b> <b>period,</b> thereby not affecting the superior recovery performance of the process. Table  14 compares simulated vectors of all three cases at the end of <b>forecasting</b> <b>period</b> (20  years).

EqCs are usually estimated when applying this approach but EqCs are also prone to forecasting failures because of equilibrium-mean changes. We focus on examining {{the effects of}} breaks during the <b>forecasting</b> <b>period,</b> for which several methods are explored. We found that forecasts of consumption growth improve when we recursively update estimates of the EqCs. Moreover, including a broken trend and the soybean price, each as an “outside variable”, only for the <b>forecasting</b> <b>period</b> to recursively adjust forecasts, we achieved much better accuracy...|$|R

[...] During this time, the AVN model was extended {{to the end of}} the <b>forecast</b> <b>period,</b> eliminating the need of the MRF and thereby replacing it. [...] In late 2002, the AVN model was renamed the Global Forecast System (GFS). [...] The German Weather Service has been running their global hydrostatic model, the GME, using a hexagonal icosohedral grid since 2002. The GFS is slated to eventually be supplanted by the Flow-following, finite-volume Icosahedral Model (FIM), which like the GME is gridded on a truncated icosahedron, in the mid-2010s.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} {{numerical}} weather prediction began in the 1920s {{through the efforts of}} Lewis Fry Richardson, who used procedures originally developed by Vilhelm Bjerknes to produce by hand a six-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. [...] It was not until the advent of the computer and computer simulations that computation time was reduced to less than the <b>forecast</b> <b>period</b> itself. The ENIAC was used to create the first weather forecasts via computer in 1950, based on a highly simplified approximation to the atmospheric governing equations. In 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby's group at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used the same model to produce the first operational forecast (i.e., a routine prediction for practical use). Operational {{numerical weather prediction}} in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. [...] In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere; this became the first successful climate model. Following Phillips' work, several groups began working to create general circulation models. [...] The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.|$|E

40|$|Forecasts {{of prices}} can help {{industries}} in their risk management. This {{is especially true}} for Japanese logs, which experience sharp fluctuations in price.

40|$|Sub-daily {{ensemble}} rainfall forecasts {{that are}} bias free and reliably quantify forecast uncertainty {{are critical for}} flood and short-term ensemble streamflow forecasting. Post processing of rainfall predictions from numerical weather prediction models is typically required to provide rainfall forecasts with these properties. In this paper, {{a new approach to}} generate ensemble rainfall forecasts by post processing raw NWP rainfall predictions is introduced. The approach uses a simplified version of the Bayesian joint probability modelling approach to produce forecast probability distributions for individual locations and <b>forecast</b> <b>periods.</b> Ensemble <b>forecasts</b> with appropriate spatial and temporal correlations are then generated by linking samples from the forecast probability distributions using the Schaake shuffle. The new approach is evaluated by applying it to post process predictions from the ACCESS-R numerical weather prediction model at rain gauge locations in the Ovens catchment in southern Australia. The joint distribution of NWP predicted and observed rainfall is shown to be well described by the assumed log-sinh transformed multivariate normal distribution. Ensemble forecasts produced using the approach are shown to be more skilful than the raw NWP predictions both for individual <b>forecast</b> <b>periods</b> and for cumulative totals throughout the <b>forecast</b> <b>periods.</b> Skill increases result from the correction of not only the mean bias, but also biases conditional on the magnitude of the NWP rainfall prediction. The post processed forecast ensembles are demonstrated to successfully discriminate between events and non-events for both small and large rainfall occurrences, and reliably quantify the forecast uncertainty. Future work will assess the efficacy of the post processing method for a wider range of climatic conditions and also investigate the benefits of using post processed rainfall forecast for flood and short term streamflow forecasting...|$|R
