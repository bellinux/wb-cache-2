Asked to comment on why he thought Sam had proven so popular with viewers, Chambers responded: [...] "No idea! I just try to turn up on time and learn my lines. I love playing Sam and finding different ways of doing things. It's a roller-coaster of emotions and storylines - some are not as <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> as others and it's always a challenge to find the most natural and interesting way to deliver." ...|$|E

Their natural docility made them peculiarly <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> and train while in hand; the real difficulty was that their life was so entirely different from their home, {{that there was no}} guessing how deep the training went, and, on every voyage, some fishes slipped through the meshes of the net, though some returned again, and others never dropped from their Bishop's hands. But he was becoming anxious to spare some of his scholars the trial of a return to native life; and, as the season had been healthy, he ventured on leaving twenty-seven pupils at St. Andrew's with Mr. and Mrs. Pritt, among them George and Sarah Sarawia.|$|E

On the other hand, it would have been comparatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> it {{in the case of a}} yacht. They had but to row alongside, to seize and gag them before they had time to utter a cry, and then to carry them below.
