I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> most black people to be honest, they ain’t thought a day in their life about those stupid statues. What we as black people need to do: We {{need to worry about}} getting our education, we need to stop killing each other, we need {{to try to find a}} way to have more economic opportunity and things like that. Those things are important and significant. You know, I’m wasting time and energy [...] screaming at a neo-Nazi, or [...] ‘Man, you’ve got to take this statue down.'” ...|$|E
500|$|Each night {{following}} the shows, the musicians and Dowd would [...] "grab some beers and sandwiches" [...] {{and head to}} Manhattan's Atlantic Studios {{to go over the}} performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. [...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn't {{want to go back and}} overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit. [...] "That was our pinnacle," [...] said Dickey Betts later.

500|$|Between {{the ages}} of eight and sixteen, Ted {{suffered}} the traumas of Rosemary's failed lobotomy and the deaths of Joseph Jr. in war and Kathleen in an airplane crash. Ted's affable maternal grandfather, John F. [...] "Honey Fitz" [...] Fitzgerald, was a former mayor of Boston, a congressman, and an early political and personal influence. Ted spent his four high school years at Milton Academy prep school in Massachusetts, where he received B and C grades and finished 36th {{in a class of}} 56 when he graduated in 1950. Ted did well at high school football there, playing on the varsity his last two years; the school's headmaster later described his play as: [...] "absolutely fearless ... he would have tackled an express train to New York <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> ... he loved contact sports". He also played on the tennis team and was in the drama, debate, and glee clubs.|$|E

500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked.</b> I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rick Bentley of the Ventura County Star {{said that}} it was unusual for a cartoon creator to select a wallaby as a main character.

Tom Kenny cited Looney Tunes and SCTV as influences for the show, and also stated [...] "I'm sure <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> Joe Murray or Mr. Lawrence or any of those guys, especially in terms of animation, the weirdest cartoons would of course be our favorites—those weird '30s Fleischer brothers Betty Boop cartoons and stuff like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{question}} of the relationship between beliefs and knowledge, Armstrong defends a [...] "weak acceptance" [...] of the belief condition, namely that if a person can be said to know some thing p, he or she believes p.
