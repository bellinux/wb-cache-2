40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Boron and boron {{compounds}} {{have been}} long used for pressure treatment, dip-diffusion, and remedial treatments of wood {{because of their}} proven efficacy against fungi and insects. These materials are especially attractive because their high water solubility promotes deeper penetration into wood. Other useful properties of boron include its neutral pH, non-corrosiveness, lack of color or odor, and little or no effect on wood strength. Boron also has low-mammalian toxicity and minimal environmental effects. However, high water solubility limits outdoor applications because the boron will leach from the wood when it is exposed to rain or is in direct soil contact. Boron is widely used as a component in external remedial pastes, primarily as disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT). This boron compound has higher water solubility and only remains in wood 3 to 7 years after application.

50|$|Boron (B) is the {{chemical}} element with atomic number 5, occurring as 10B and 11B. At standard temperature and pressure, boron is a trivalent metalloid that has several different allotropes. Amorphous boron is a brown powder {{formed as a}} product of many chemical reactions. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a high melting point and exists in many polymorphs: Two rhombohedral forms, α-boron and β-boron containing 12 and 106.7 atoms in the rhombohedral unit cell respectively, and 50-atom tetragonal boron are the most common. Boron has a density of 2.34−3. Boron's most common isotope is 11B at 80.22%, which contains 5 protons and 6 neutrons. The other common isotope is 10 at 19.78%, which contains 5 protons and 5 neutrons. These are the only stable isotopes of boron; however other isotopes have been synthesised. Boron forms covalent bonds with other nonmetals and has oxidation states of 1, 2, 3 and 4.Boron does not occur naturally as a free element, but in compounds such as borates. The most common sources of boron are tourmaline, borax, Na2B4O5(OH)4·8H2O, and kernite, Na2B4O5(OH)4·2H2O. it is difficult to obtain pure boron. It can be made through the magnesium reduction of boron trioxide, B2O3. This oxide is made by melting boric acid, B(OH)3, which in turn is obtained from borax. Small amounts of pure boron can be made by the thermal decomposition of boron bromide, BBr3, in hydrogen gas over hot tantalum wire, which acts as a catalyst. The most commercially important sources of boron are: sodium tetraborate pentahydrate, Na2B4O7 · 5H2O, which is used in large amounts in making insulating fiberglass and sodium perborate bleach; boron carbide, a ceramic material, is used to make armour materials, especially in bulletproof vests for soldiers and police officers; orthoboric acid, H3BO3 or boric acid, used in the production of textile fiberglass and flat panel displays; sodium <b>tetraborate</b> <b>decahydrate,</b> Na2B4O7 · 10H2O or borax, used in the production of adhesives; and the isotope boron-10 is used as a control for nuclear reactors, as a shield for nuclear radiation, and in instruments used for detecting neutrons.|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) {{has been}} used for decades for the determination of different classes of pharmaceuticals in different sample matrices because of its advantageous high separation efficiency and fast analysis time. However, the major disadvantage of CE is its poor detection sensitivity. In the current work, the improvement in detection sensitivity of CE has been extensively studied and applied for the determination of two classes of pharmaceutical compounds. Electrokinetic supercharging (EKS), a powerful preconcentration technique in CE, has been studied for the analysis of seven non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The separation selectivity was optimised via adjustment of the concentration of the separation buffer (<b>disodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> pH 9. 20) and the amount of methanol as an organic modifier. Different EKS parameters, including injection voltage, injection time, and amounts of leading and terminating electrolytes were studied. The optimised conditions allowed detection sensitivity to be improved by 2, 400 -fold when compared to field-amplified sample stacking (FASS) and the limits of detection (LODs) were down to 50 ng/L. A valuable modification to the EKS system, namely counter-flow EKS (CF-EKS), has been developed in order to decrease the amount of the interfering sample matrix involved in the system, hence, larger amount of analytes could be concentrated. Computer simulation studies were undertaken {{in order to understand the}} trends in sensitivity enhancement from EKS to CF-EKS. After assigning the optimal counter pressure and injection voltage in CF-EKS, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed for optimising the injection time and the amount of terminating electrolyte. Upon comparison with FASS, the optimal conditions of CF-EKS allowed the sensitivity to be enhanced by 11, 800 -fold and the LODs were decreased to 10. 70 ng/L for the studied NSAIDs. The on-line hyphenation of EKS-CE with the highly precise electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was for the first time investigated, and then applied for the determination of five acidic hypolipidaemic drugs. The separation was performed in a co-electroosmotic flow (co-EOF) mode using the EOF reversal agent hexadimethrine bromide (HDMB) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 9. 00. An ANN was developed for the optimisation of the separation selectivity, and the EKS-ESI-MS system provided enhancement in detection sensitivity of 1, 000 -fold when compared to FASS. The LODs for the studied hypolipidaemic drugs were decreased to 180 ng/L. Simultaneous separation of charged and neutral hypolipidaemic drugs was made possible by the application of micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Ammonium bicarbonate pH 8. 50 was used as a separation electrolyte and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as a micelle-forming agent. In order to enhance the detection sensitivity in MEKC, three on-line preconcentration strategies, namely sweeping, analyte focusing by micelle collapse (AFMC) and simultaneous FASS-sweeping were investigated and applied for the determination of eight hypolipidaemic drugs.

In the south – western {{parts of the}} Kerman province, such as the Khatoonabad area (east {{of the city of}} Shahr –e –Babak) and Robat – Marvast basin (west of Shahr – e – Babak), there are several borate deposits. They can be seen mainly in Sanandaj – Sirjan depressions and they occur as borate bearing nodules beneath a thin layer of soil. In general, boron considerably reduces the thermal expansion of glass, provides good resistance to vibration, high temperatures and thermal shock, and improves its toughness, strength, chemical resistance and durability. It also greatly reduces the viscosity of the glass melt. These features, and others, allow it to form superior glass for many industrial and specialty applications (Garrett, 1998). In the past, the ancient residents used them as co-melting matters. Ulexite which is frequently found in the Khatoonabad playa (at 30 km South East of Shahr Babak) have Jewel properties (Ghaedi et al., 2014). Materials and methods After reviewing and Library Studies, geological field studies on the borate deposits were carried out from Shahr – e – Babak Playa. In order to take better samples, several pits were excavated with a depth of 30 cm to 1 meter so that borate minerals became apparent. X-ray diffraction analysis (IMIDRO, Karaj), and ICP AES (ALS CHEMEX, Canada) methods were carried out on representative samples taken from the studied area. Discussion Field observations show that in the studied areas, borate bearing basins are fed by rivers which have originated from Sanandaj – Sirjan metamorphic rocks, Nain – Baft colored mélanges and igneous rocks of Urumieh – Dokhtar magmatic belt. Borate minerals also occur in fibrous aggregates and massive forms. Mineralogy XRD results show that the studied borate minerals mainly belong to the hydrated borates and contain ulexite, borax, gowerite, sassolite and inyoite. Geochemichal data indicate that the boron is the dominant constituent in the studied playa. Borate minerals are divided into two groups of hydrated and non-hydrated borate category (Palache et al., 1952.; Garrett, 1998). Both hydrated and non-hydrated borate minerals have been formed in the Shahr-e-Babak playa. Hydrated borate in the study areas: Hydrated borates are those borates in which water molecules are involved (Garrett, 1998). In the studied area, the hydrated borate minerals include: Borax, Ulexite, Inyoite, Gowerite. Non-hydrated borate in the study areas: In the Shahr-e-Babak playa, Sassolite non-hydrated borate minerals are abundant. According to the XRD analyses performed on samples from the study areas, the hydrated borate minerals are more important minerals. The main economic valuable minerals include: 1 - Ulexite (NaCaB 5 O 9. 8 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Triclinic. Point Group: 1 (Ghose et al., 1978). In the Shar – e - Babak playa, ulexite occurs as deposits with massive, cauliflower-like nodules and fibrous textures. 2 - Borax (Na 2 B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 • 8 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m. Crystals are commonly short to long prismatic [001] (Levy and Lisensky, 1978). In the studied borate samples, it can be found in association with the other borate minerals, and often occurs in the form of salt marsh. 3 - Gowerite (CaB 6 O 8 (OH) 4 • 3 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m (Erd et al., 1959). In the Khatoonabad samples, it was found as prismatic and spherical crystals along with ulexite. 4 - Inyoite (CaB 3 O 3 (OH) 5 • 4 H 2 O) : Crystal Data: Monoclinic. Point Group: 2 /m (Christ, 1953). This mineral has been detected in the studied area by XRD. Sassolite (H 3 BO 3) : Crystal Data: Triclinic. Point Group: 1 and as scaly pseudohexagonal crystals (Allen and Kramer, 1957). This mineral is found frequently in the Marvast Playa. Geochemistry Geochemical data indicate that in the studied playa, boron is very abundant. Good correlation between the elements, such as B and Ca confirms the formation of Calcium bearing borate mineral in the studied areas. Origin Field observations show that in the studied areas, borate bearing basins are fed by rivers which have originated from the Sanandaj – Sirjan metamorphic rocks, Nain – Baft colored mélanges and igneous rocks of the Urumieh – Dokhtar magmatic belt. Result The XRD results show that the studied borate minerals mainly are hydrated ones and contain ulexite, borax, gowerite, sassolite and inyoite. Geochemichal data confirm the frequency of boron in the playa. Good correlation between the elements such as B and Ca verifies the formation of Calcium bearing borate mineral in the studied areas.

Choosing non-denaturing conditions, we developed a several purification schemes {{in order to obtain}} αSyn from human erythrocytes, enabling researchers to employ biophysical techniques in order to elucidate its native structure and properties. ### Introduction Here we introduce a novel way of purifying human α-Synuclein from human erythrocytes, leaving the physiological conformation of the protein intact. This methology has been also successfully applied to human neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing wt human α-Synuclein as well as to COS- 7 cells transiently overexpressing wt and mutant forms of α-Synuclein. The overall purification is divided in three general steps: An ammonium sulfate preciptation giving a crude protein solution, a bulk purification which can be adjusted to the exact sample properties (volume, cell type, cross contamination) utilizing alternatively 3 different methods (AX, HIC, covalent chromatography), and a polishing step giving pure protein after size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1). **Figure 1 : Flow diagram of the purification scheme** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ### Reagents **General reagents/disposables**: 1.

Instead of freshly drawn blood, older samples can be employed. The ratio of α-Synuclein/Hemoglobin in those samples can be drastically reduced however, making the purification more challenging * 3 D 5 cells:* A. It has to be made sure that the cell lysate does not heat up too much during sonication. Short sonication steps with incubation of the sample on ice in between are therefore recommended. B. In cell culture cell lysates, a 25 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 pre-precipitation step can be beneficial to remove unwanted protein. If HIC is employed for the bulk purification, this is not necessary since the respective binding buffer already contains approx. 25 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and thereby eliminates contamination before the column is loaded **Ammonium sulfate precipitation**: In erythrocyte lysate, washing the 50 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 pellet in 55 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 solution is highly recommended. Since Hemoglobin stays soluble until 60 - 65 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4, the washing steps provide a cheap and easy method to eliminate large amounts of contaminating Hemoglobin. **Bulk purification** The exact method of bulk purification has to be decided {{by the nature of the}} sample. In general, the HIC gave the highest purity but lowest yield. If high trough-put is needed, the Sepharose 6 B method should be applied. If large amounts of Hemoglobin are present, AX is recommended. If a particular sample has low purity with one of the chosen methods, an additional step utilizing one of the other methods can be employed. A: HIC advantages: Fast, cheap, best purity, (NH 4) 2 SO 4 in binding/elution buffer stabilizes folding. Disadvantages: Low binding capacity, struggles with high amounts of contaminating Hemoglobin. Results can be inconsistent depending on the exact sample. Has sometimes to be applied twice to effectively purifiy all α-Synuclein out of solution. B: AX advantages: Fast, cheap, good binding affinity, Hemoglobin does not bind (making it very effective in separating α-Synuclein and Hemoglobin). Disadvantages: High amounts of NaCl in elution buffer can destabilize α-Synuclein, causing it to precipitate. Transthyretin and α-Synuclein elute very close to each other making thorough removal of blood plasma prior to erythrocyte lysing necessary. Has sometimes to be applied twice to effectively purifiy all α-Synuclein out of solution. C: Instead of Sepharose 6 B gel medium, Sepharose 4 B can be used. Sepharose 6 B has shown to have a better binding capacity, while Sepharose 4 B packed columns can be easier reactivated. Sepharose 6 B advantages: Simple and consistent, good for large sample volumes, high yield, removes both Transthyretin and Hemoglobin from erythrocyte lysate samples very effectively. Since no high pressures/high flow rates, no buffer gradient and no monitoring of UV-absorption or conductivity are needed, it can be done with a simple peristaltic pump. Disadvantages: Expensive gel media, no pre-packed columns commercially available, regeneration of column time consuming. **Size Exclusion Chromatography (Superdex 200) **: Instead of a Superdex 200 column, Superdex 75, Superose 12 and Sephacryl 200 -HR were also successfully employed. The advantage of the Superdex 200 gel medium is the ability to separate Hemoglobin from α-Synuclein in contrast to the above mentioned media. ### Anticipated Results **Yield** From 40 ml of freshly drawn packed red blood cells, up to 0. 5 mg α-Synuclein can be recovered. ** 2 SO 4 precipitation** As seen in Fig. 2, α-Synuclein usually precipitates between 30 and 45 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4. Human Hemoglobin should stay soluble until 60 %. **Figure 2 : Ammonium sulfate precipitation of α-Synuclein from cell lysate** ![Fig 2]([URL] "Fig 2 ") *SDS-PAGE Western blot (C 20) of α-Synuclein. Cell lysate (erythrocyte) was treated step wise with increasing (NH 4) 2 SO 4 concentrations, the resulting pellet was taken up in PBS and analyzed*. **Chromatography** *HIC (HiTrap Phenyl HP) :* α-Synuclein should elute between a conductivity of 135 - 110 mS/cm (~ approx. 0. 7 M (NH 4) 2 SO 4) (Fig. 3 A). *AX (HiTrap Q HP) :* α-Synuclein should elute between a conductivity of 30 - 35 mS/cm (~ approx. 300 mM NaCl) (Fig. 3 B). *SEC (Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL) :* α-Synuclein should elute around 13. 5 ml (Fig. 3 C). **Figure 3 : Example FPLC chromatograms of α-Synuclein purifications and WB analysis of fractions** ![Fig 3]([URL] "Fig 3 ") - *A: Chromatogram of HIC purification of α-Synuclein from human erythrocytes.

No. 151 - 1901) * *Covalent chromatography (Sepharose 6 B, XK 16 / 100) :* α-Synuclein should be completely found in the clear flow-trough. Hemoglobin should be completely bound to the column and then be eluted with DTT (Fig. 4). **Figure 4 : Separation of Hemoglobin and α-Synuclein via covalent chromatography** ![Fig 4]([URL] "Fig 4 ") - *A: SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis of different aliquots of purification scheme utilizing a Sepharose 6 B column.

After applying the procedure the purity of the sample should be > 95 % (measured by densitometry of Coomassie stain). **Figure 5 : Coomassie stain of different purification steps** ![Fig 5]([URL] "Fig 5 ") *SDS-PAGE Coomassie stain analysis of aliquots taken from different stages of purification*. ### Associated Publications **α-Synuclein occurs physiologically as a helically folded tetramer that resists aggregation**.
