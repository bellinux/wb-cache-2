40|$|Grid {{technology}} enables {{resource sharing}} among a massive number of dynamic and geographically distributed resources. The significance of such environments {{is based on}} the aptitude of grid members to look across multiple grids for resource discovery and allocation. Parallel to grid, agents are autonomous problem solvers capable of self-directed actions in flexible environments. As grid systems require self-sufficiency, agents may be the means by which to achieve a robust autonomy infrastructure. In this direction we propose a resource discovery method of interoperable grid agents which travel within Virtual Organizations (VOs) and by capturing resource information regarding their action domain; they update the internal data of each <b>grid</b> <b>member.</b> Moreover we propose that resource discovery is a systematic and continually updating process that occurs within a VO and allows information exchange to happen. This exchange takes place between various community members at a pre-defined interval, aiming to distribute internal knowledge about the domain...|$|E
40|$|The work herein {{continues}} {{the effort of}} achieving inter-cooperation between several Virtual Organisations (VOs) by utilising a heuristic genetic algorithm for resource discovery within such environments. The discovery process {{is based on an}} ad hoc strategy where each participant acts as an individual, detached from any centralized topologies articulated by VOs. The method is extended to an inter-collaborative	   model wherein discovery is derived from data extracted from a member snapshot profile. The primary challenging goal in building an ad hoc grid is supplying each <b>grid</b> <b>member</b> with specific directions for continuously maintaining information related to each community participant. Such information is stored at each VO member public profile and is available for advertising on the resource discovery process. The proposed approach will be able to define a collaborative model within a community domain and extend it to an inter-communication environment. To define these models it is essential to share a common understanding of the structure among community members. A way to achieve it is by utilizing Genetic Algorithms which offer a way to correlate VO members ’ roles and actions into a genetic chromosome of information and be able to be composed in a common format and be shared among VO participants. Consequently, by mimicking the same processes that nature uses, we deliver a case scenario of genetic algorithms in order to assist the resource discovery among inter-cooperated VOs...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the choice of}} stellar population for use as the Astrometric Grid for the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). SIM depends on the astrometric stability of about 2000 stars, the so called Grid, against which the science measures are referenced. Low metallicity, and thus relatively high luminosity K giants are shown to be the population of choice, when available. The alternative, nearby G dwarfs, are shown to be suseptable to unmodeled motions induced by gas-giant planetary companions, {{should there be a}} significant population of such companions. Radial velocity filtering is quite efficient in selecting <b>Grid</b> <b>members</b> from the K giants with yields exceeding 50 % if filtering at 30 m/s (1 -sigma) is available. However if the binary fraction of the G dwarfs approaches 100 % as some studies suggest, the yield of stable systems would be in the range of 15 % at best (with 10 m/s filtering). Use of the initial SIM measurement as a final filter is shown not to be critical in either case, although it could improve the yield of stable <b>grid</b> <b>members.</b> For a <b>Grid</b> composed of weak-lined K giants, the residual contamination by large unmodeled motions will amount to about 3 % (and rises to about 6 % if a 60 m/s radial velocity criterion is used). The selective introduction of quadratic terms in the proper motion solutions during the post-mission phase of data reduction can reduce contamination to a remarkable 1 % or better in either case. Analytic estimates based on circular orbits are developed which show how these results come about. Comment: 42 pages including 13 eps figures. To be published Sept 2002 in PAS...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we outline a constructivist {{approach}} to raising a literacy/numeracy [LN]-embedding team’s {{awareness of their}} meaning-making in their context of work. Using grid methodology from personal construct psychology, we first formulated elements for construct elicitation. These elements, couched {{in the form of}} eight LN-embedding scenarios, comprised four which captured embedding practices consistent with LN teaching principles, and four which did not. We proceeded to dyadic elicitation using a random selection of eight pairs of these scenarios. For each pair, we elicited the most significant constructs from three team members (recording approximately 50 constructs per person). Each team member selected the ten constructs they judged to be most significant in their meaning-making in the LN-embedding context. These were put into individual ratings <b>grids,</b> and each <b>member</b> of the team then used their ten constructs to rate each of the eight scenarios (producing 80 ratings per person). The poles of the 7 -point rating scale coincided with the poles of the constructs. Using the SPSS package, we performed correlational analyses on these ratings. Each team member’s correlation matrix became an agenda for discussing the direct and inverse relationships among constructs in their <b>grids.</b> Using each <b>member’s</b> <b>grid,</b> we discussed these relationships to illustrate critical-reflective meaning-making in context. We conclude that this approach may be used in a professional development context to raise enabling educators’ awareness of their meaning-making in embedding LN in vocational education. We recommend the approach because it takes the meaning-making of a specific person as a stepping stone into raising his/her awareness of LN processes and practices...|$|R
