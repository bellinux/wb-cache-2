5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a new <b>Data</b> <b>Processing</b> Division to centralize the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E

5|$|Dataflow {{programming}} languages describe {{systems of}} operations on data streams, and {{the connections between}} the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E
40|$|Synchronization of <b>data</b> stream <b>processing</b> has a {{significant}} impact on performance of systems where processing of long sequences of data items needs to be done simultaneously. In earlier works on stream processing, synchronization has been discussed to a limited extent or has been completely overlooked. This work describes a formal model of synchronization in a <b>data</b> stream <b>processing</b> network. We use a notation of <b>data</b> stream <b>processing</b> networks to identify circumstances that necessitate synchronization. We also express processing of groups of data items in terms of database transactions within a <b>data</b> stream <b>processing</b> network. A technique similar to timestamp ordering of database transactions is used to solve the problems. A solution is presented as a set of rules that govern processing of groups of data items. A proof of correctness has been provided for the strategy used to solve the problems...|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{computer}} users and manufacturers were becoming {{concerned about the}} rising cost of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new programming languages were proliferating at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.|$|E
5|$|On May 28 and 29 of 1959 (exactly {{one year}} after the Zürich ALGOL 58 meeting), a meeting was held at the Pentagon to discuss the {{creation}} of a common programming language for business. It was attended by 41 people and was chaired by Phillips. The Department of Defense was concerned about whether it could run the same <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> programs on different computers.

5|$|The Port of Rijeka Authority {{operates}} a traffic control centre, {{located in the}} new passenger terminal. The traffic control system comprises an Electronic Chart Display and Information System using radar sensors and an Automatic Identification System, as well as additional systems such as a VHF system, hydrometeorological data, Closed-circuit television monitoring of the port and <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> systems. In 2011, the port authority was commended as one of top four port authorities of the year globally.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once picked out, and still more to track the Sprints {{on their way to the}} interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center <b>Data</b> <b>Processing</b> System (DCDPS).|$|E
5|$|The {{satellite}} {{was also}} {{equipped with a}} data collection system (DCS) to collect information from remote, individually equipped ground stations and to relay the data to central acquisition stations. Due to the orbit of the satellite, data could be obtained at a minimum of every 12 hours. No <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> or signal multiplexing occurred on the satellite. The design of the DCS came from the Nimbus-3 platform, then known as the interrogation, recording, and location system (IRLS).|$|E

5|$|At that time, {{the group}} had {{generated}} sales of 620 million Deutsche Mark and employed 22,600 employees. In the mid-1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Due to the economic crisis, the company encountered significant difficulties {{for the first time}} at the beginning of the 1970s, meaning the company even had to introduce short-term work. The crisis also affected the company’s tights sales, which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued only three years later. At the same time, Triumph International began for the first time to produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or lycra.|$|E
5|$|<b>Data</b> <b>processing</b> {{led to the}} {{acquisition}} of 24,943 data points that suggested that some body transited, or crossed in front of (and briefly dimmed), WASP-15 every 3.7520 days. Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM photometer at the La Silla Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements. Analysis confirmed {{the presence of a}} planet that was later designated WASP-15b.|$|E

5|$|On 15 May 1971, the DISCOM was reorganized and {{designated}} as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Cavalry Division Support Command. Most major subordinate {{units of the}} DISCOM had returned from Vietnam in 1971 and were stationed at Fort Hood. By the end of June 1971, the DISCOM was a large command composed of HHC, Support Command, 15th Adjutant General Company/Band, 15th Medical Battalion, 15th Supply and Transport Battalion, 27th Maintenance Battalion, 8th Engineer Battalion, 315th Composite Support Battalion, 15th Finance Company (the latter two units had been transferred from the 1st Armored Division), and the 15th <b>Data</b> <b>Processing</b> Unit.|$|E
5|$|The <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> yielded four {{monochrome}} images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One {{image was}} designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E
5|$|The {{interceptor}} {{would lose}} maneuverability as it {{climbed out of}} the atmosphere and its aerodynamic surfaces became less effective, so {{it would have to be}} directed onto the target as rapidly as possible, leaving only minor fine tuning later in the engagement. This required that accurate tracks be developed for both the warhead and outgoing missile very quickly in comparison to a system like Nike B where the guidance could be updated throughout the engagement. This demanded new computers and tracking radars with much higher processing rates than the systems used on earlier Nikes. Bell suggested that their transistor offered the solution to the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> problem.|$|E
