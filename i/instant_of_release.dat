This study aimed to identify and compare performance-related kinematic variables associated with both seated throwing techniques. Twenty-nine non-disabled males (21. 9 ± 2. 6 years) performed 12 maximal throws using a 1 -kg ball in two conditions (no-pole and pole). Automatic 3 D-kinematic tracking (150 Hz) and temporal data were acquired. There {{was no significant difference}} between ball speeds at the point <b>of</b> <b>release</b> between conditions (no-pole = 12. 8 ± 1. 6 m/s vs. pole = 12. 9 ± 1. 5 m/s). There were four kinematic variables that were strongly correlated with ball speed when throwing with or without an assistive pole. These variables were elbow flexion at the start phase (pole r =. 39 and no-pole r =. 41), maximum shoulder external rotation angular velocity during the arm cocking phase (pole r =. 42), maximum shoulder internal rotation angular velocity during the arm acceleration phase (pole r =. 47), and should internal rotation angular velocity at the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> ball <b>release</b> (pole r =. 40). The pole clearly influenced the throwing technique with all four strongly correlated variables identified in this condition, compared to only one during the no-pole condition. When using the pole, participants produced significantly higher shoulder internal rotation angular velocities during the arm acceleration phase (pole = 367 ± 183 /s vs. nopole = 275 ± 178 /s, p. 05) and at the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> ball <b>release</b> (pole = 355 ± 115 /s vs. no-pole = 264 ± 120 /s, p. 05), compared to throwing without the pole.

50|$|The bombsight {{problem is}} the need to {{determine}} the exact spot in the air where the bombs should be dropped to hit a target on the ground. Due to the acceleration of gravity, bombs follow a roughly parabolic path, the steepness being defined by the forward speed of the aircraft at the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> <b>release.</b> The distance the bombs travel between being dropped and hitting the ground is known as the range, it {{is a function of the}} speed and the time to fall, the later a function of altitude. The bomber attempts to manoeuvre along a line toward the target and then drop the bombs at the instant they are that distance, the range, from the target. The location at that instant is known as the drop point. Simple trigonometry can calculate the angle that the target would appear at when the aircraft was at the drop point. This is known as the range angle or drop angle, and was typically looked up from a set of pre-computed tables or using a simple mechanical calculator. The bombsight is then set to that angle, and the bomb aimer drops the bombs when the target passes through the sights.|$|E

40|$|Baseball and {{softball}} pitch types are distinguished by {{the path and}} speed of the ball which, in turn, {{are determined by the}} angular velocity of the ball and the velocity of the ball center at the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> from the pitcher’s hand.

This study addresses these shortcomings by introducing a highly miniaturized, wireless inertial measurement unit (IMU) that is embedded in both baseballs {{and softball}}s.

Experimental results from ten pitches, five thrown by one softball pitcher and five by one baseball pitcher, demonstrate that this sensor technology can deduce the magnitude and direction of the ball’s velocity at release to within 4. 6 % of measurements made using standard mocap.

40|$|In {{this article}} we will explore the bombing {{techniques}} used by the United States Army during World War II {{in order to produce}} a maximum impact on targets. We will demonstrate through calculations of differential equations how the speed of the plane, linear distance the plane is from the target, and altitude of the plane determines the time that the bombs must be deployed. Intro During World War II the role of the bombardier was critical in the accuracy of placing the free falling bombs on target. The conditions needed were: altitude, true airspeed, bomb ballistics, trail, actual time of fall, ground speed, and drift. The altitude, which is controlled by the pilot, determines the amount of time the bomb is free falling. The pilot also controls the true airspeed which gives the bomb its initial forward velocity and in turn affects the trail (horizontal distance that the bomb is behind the plane upon impact). The bomb ballistics such as the size, shape, and density determine the air resistance the bomb will encounter as it falls. The actual time of fall is the length of time the bomb is sustained in the air from the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> to the instant o...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} how compensatory control of the shooting arm changed under the interacting constraints of task expertise and shooting distance. Expert, intermediate and novice male basketball players (n= 10 in each group) performed 30 shots from three distances (4. 25, 5. 25 and 6. 25 metres). The dependent variables included shooting performance together with variability of the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints at the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> ball <b>release.</b> A significant main effect for expertise was observed for both shooting performance and shoulder joint variability at ball release. No significant main effects for expertise were found for either wrist or elbow joint variability at release. Quadratic regression analyses revealed greater compensatory control of the shooting arm for the expert participants compared to their intermediate and novice counterparts. The level of compensatory control shown also persisted with increasing shooting distance regardless of level of expertise. Findings are harmonious with existing data on movement variability during dynamic throwing tasks, specifically demonstrating how expert performers exploited variability in a functional manner to satisfy the constraints of the tas...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the hammer}} throw is to project the hammer as far as {{possible}} and, major contributing factor to throw success is the speed of the hammer at the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> <b>release.</b> The thrower accelerates the hammer to the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> by performing turns across the hammer throw circle, during which time the hammer's linear speed fluctuates. The first two studies of this thesis were concerned with ascertaining how an athlete could improve speed development in the hammer throw while the third study was focused on development and validation of a system that would facilitate direct measurement of speed development in the training environment. Study one focused on assessing the relationship between the hammer's linear speed and the thrower applied cable force. This was done to identify how cable force magnitude and direction affects the speed development, specifically losses. Speed losses occur when the tangential component of the cable force (tangential force) is negative. The loss of speed caused by the negative tangential force can be reduced in two ways: by decreasing the magnitude of the negative tangential force itself or by decreasing the amount time that it acts for. Results {{of this study indicate that}} it is more effective for a thrower to decrease the magnitude of the negative tangential force. Throwers can do this by reducing either the cable force magnitude or by the angle between the cable force and linear hammer velocity. The findings presented here indicate that the most effective way to minimise the impact of negative tangential force is to reduce the angle. Study two was concerned with identifying how a thrower could alter their technique so as to lead to a reduction in the size of losses in speed. In this study, the relationship between speed losses and movement of the throwers thorax relative to the pelvis (thorax-pelvis separation angle) was investigated. The results of this study indicate that throwers should aim to reduce the size of the thorax-pelvis separation angle during double support, specifically during turn two and the second last turn. This was found to result in a smaller loss in speed during the subsequent single support phase. The aim of study three was to develop and validate a method that would facilitate accurate feedback of linear hammer speed within the training environment as this would allow athletes and coaches to implement the technique changes outlined in study two and assess how these changes affect hammer speed. The most accurate way to determine hammer speed is via hammer three-dimensional position data; however, current methods of collecting these data do not allow provision of immediate feedback. In this study, a method that would allow speed to be determined from cable force information was sought as methods that allow immediate feedback on cable force data have already been validated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProper {{pitching}} mechanics are {{imperative for}} developing {{different types of}} pitches (e. g., fastball vs. breaking ball) and for preventing injury. Different pitch types are distinguished by the path (i. e. break) and speed of the ball which, in turn, are dictated by the angular velocity of the ball and the velocity of the ball center at the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> from the pitcher's hand. While radar guns effectively measure ball speed, they provide no information {{about the direction of}} the velocity of the ball center, the angular velocity of the ball, or the way in which these quantities change during the throw. These quantities can, in principle, be calculated using high-speed video-based motion capture (mocap), but doing so requires measurements in a controlled lab environment taken by a skilled technician. Moreover, mocap is unlikely to accurately resolve the angular velocity of the ball which is crucial to understanding pitching. This paper addresses these shortcomings by presenting an instrumented ball containing a miniature, wireless inertial measurement unit (IMU) to measure ball dynamics on the field of play. Measurements reveal that this technology can deduce the magnitude and direction of the ball's velocity at release to within 4 % when benchmarked against mocap. Moreover, the IMU directly measures the angular velocity of the ball for pitches that remain within the measurement range of the associated angular rate gyros...|$|E

Two S-VHS camcorders (60 field · s- 1) were used to record the performance of 15 males of different classes. Each subject performed 6 - 10 throws and the best two legal throws from each subject were selected for analysis. Three-dimensional kinematics of the javelin and upper body segments at the <b>instant</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> and during the throw (delivery) were determined. The selection of kinematic parameters that were analyzed in this study was based on a javelin throw model showing the factors that determine the measured distance of a throw. The average of two throws for each subject was used to compute Spearman rank correlation coefficients between selected parameters and measured distance, and between selected parameters and the functional classification. The speeds and angles of the javelin at release, ranged from 9. 1 to 14. 7 m · s- 1 and 29. 6 to 35. 8 º, respectively, were smaller than those exhibited by elite male able-bodied throwers. As expected, the speed of the javelin at release was significantly correlated to both the classification (p< 0. 01) and measured distance (p< 0. 001). Of the segmental kinematic parameters, significant correlations were found between the trunk inclination at release and classificatio...|$|E
40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} ways of reducing the production cost of lignocellulosic ethanol are to increase the ethanol yield and the concentration in the fermentation broth. This can be facilitated by co-fermentation of glucose and xylose from agricultural residues such as wheat straw, due to the high amount of xylose in the hemicelluloses in these materials. Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) of steam-pretreated wheat straw (SPWS) with and without the addition of liquefied wheat meal (LWM) was performed using the pentose-fermenting yeast, TMB 3400. The highest overall ethanol yield in batch operation, of around 70 %, equivalent to an ethanol concentration of 43. 7 g L- 1, was achieved using SPWS with 7. 5 % water-insoluble solids (WIS) and addition of LWM with 1 % WIS. Using SPWS with a higher WIS (10 %) resulted in a decreased yield, 60 %, although the concentration of ethanol increased to 53. 0 g L- 1. SSCF of 7. 5 % straw was also performed with a single (after 20 h) or fed-batch addition of 1 % WIS LWM (after 20, 24 and 28 h) resulting in an increase in both ethanol yield and concentration compared to the reference, without wheat meal addition, but no significant difference compared to the batch experiments. The addition of wheat meal to SSCF did not improve xylose utilization significantly, probably due to the <b>instant</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> glucose from the liquefied meal, which hampers the uptake <b>of</b> xylose. The <b>instant</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> glucose was shown to be caused by the high amylase activity of the beta-glucosidase enzyme preparation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
