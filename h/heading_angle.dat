The <b>heading</b> <b>angle</b> σ is the angle between north and the horizontal component of the velocity vector, which describes which direction the aircraft is moving relative to cardinal directions. The flight path angle γ is the angle between horizontal and the velocity vector, which describes whether the aircraft is climbing or descending.

40|$|Different {{models have}} been able to account for {{different}} features of the data on grid cell firing properties, including the relationship of grid cells to cellular properties and network oscillations. This paper describes a model that combines elements of two major classes of models of grid cells: models using interactions of oscillations and models using attractor dynamics. This model includes a population of units with oscillatory input representing input from the medial septum. These units are termed <b>heading</b> <b>angle</b> cells because their connectivity depends upon <b>heading</b> <b>angle</b> in the environment as well as the spatial phase coded by the cell. These cells project to a population of grid cells. The sum of the <b>heading</b> <b>angle</b> input results in standing waves of circularly symmetric input to the grid cell population. Feedback from the grid cell population increases the activity of subsets of the <b>heading</b> <b>angle</b> cells, resulting in the network settling into activity patterns that resemble the patterns of firing fields in a population of grid cells. The properties of <b>heading</b> <b>angle</b> cells firing as conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells can shift the grid cell firing according to movement velocity. The pattern of interaction of oscillations requires use of separate populations that fire on alternate cycles of the net theta rhythmic input to grid cells...|$|E
