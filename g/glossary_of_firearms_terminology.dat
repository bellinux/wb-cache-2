40|$|This master´s thesis {{collects}} vocabulary {{from the}} field <b>of</b> modern <b>firearms</b> and their accessories in English and Czech languages and forms it into a dictionary which compares the specialized translation with the translation that is provided by a technical dictionary. The theoretical part focuses on explaining the basic terminology {{from the field}} of lexicography, it introduces a brief look at the development and typology of dictionaries and the process of forming a dictionary. Detailed examination of technical and electronic dictionaries is provided and description of the specific aspects <b>of</b> <b>firearm</b> <b>terminology.</b> The practical part presents the specialized resources used in this work, the process of creating and layout of the dictionary which is the final product of this thesis.

5000|$|A firearm's {{chamber and}} barrel become {{pressure}} vessels for brief periods. In <b>firearm</b> <b>terminology,</b> a proof test {{is a test}} wherein a deliberately over-pressured round is fired from a firearm in order to verify that the firearm is not defective and will not explode on firing. The firearm is inspected after the test, {{and if it is}} found to be in sound condition, then it is marked with a [...] "proof mark" [...] to indicate that it has been proofed (not proven). In many jurisdictions a proof test and valid proof mark are required for the sale <b>of</b> <b>firearms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In <b>firearms</b> <b>terminology,</b> the <b>firearm</b> {{receiver}} or firearm {{frame is}} the part <b>of</b> a <b>firearm</b> which provides housing for the hammer, bolt or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel. [...] The receiver is often made of forged, machined, or stamped steel or aluminium; {{in addition to these}} traditional materials, modern science and engineering have introduced polymers and sintered metal powders to receiver construction.|$|R
50|$|In <b>firearms</b> <b>terminology,</b> {{an action}} is the {{mechanism}} that handles the ammunition (loads, locks, fires, and extracts the cartridges) or the {{method by which}} that mechanism works. Breech-loading weapons have actions; actions are technically not present on muzzleloaders, as all loading is done by hand. The mechanism that fires a muzzle-loader is called the lock.|$|R
50|$|In <b>firearms</b> <b>terminology,</b> fluting {{refers to}} the removal of {{material}} from a cylindrical surface, usually creating grooves. This is most often {{the barrel of a}} rifle, though it may also refer to the cylinder of a revolver or the bolt of a bolt action rifle.In contrast to rifle barrels and revolver cylinders rifle bolts are normally helically fluted, though helical fluting is sometimes also applied to rifle barrels.|$|R

40|$|The program {{plans for}} Former Soviet Union National Nuclear Materials Control and Accounting (MC and A) Systems Enhancements {{call for the}} {{development}} <b>of</b> an English/Russian <b>Glossary</b> <b>of</b> MC and A terminology.

This report summarizes the status of the production <b>of</b> this <b>glossary,</b> the most recent copy of which is attached to this report. The glossary contains over 950 terms and acronyms associated with nuclear material control and accounting for safeguards and nonproliferation.
