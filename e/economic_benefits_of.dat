5|$|Teller {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and best-known advocates for {{investigating}} non-military uses of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under Operation Plowshare. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.|$|E

5|$|Because of the <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> good {{telecommunication}} infrastructure, {{there is}} increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Scotland {{became one}} of the {{commercial}} and industrial centres of the British Empire. With tariffs with England now abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with Colonial America. However, the <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3million. Some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815. The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776–83), when it sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began {{to make up for the}} loss of the tobacco business, reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750–1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>economic</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> {{a certain}} {{development}} process or particular activity is usually unknown and indeed hard to predict. However, the cost-effectiveness of process improvements is {{of paramount importance}} and the question how profitable certain activities are needs to be answered. Within a large-scale commercial organization, we were challanged with the task to quantify the <b>economic</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> isolated test and development environments. To answer this question we defined a generic process model based on absorbing Markov chains that allows to analyze the <b>economic</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> software process variations. This model exposes conflicts between process steps and reiterations of development activities and thereby provides a highly flexible tool for the investigation of the effects of changes to a development process on its overall performance. This model was used to predict the impact of isolated testing on the overall effort and duration of projects at BMW. The results obtained correspond well with the perception of experienced developers and gives a detailed explanation for the effects. Besides this, {{it can be used to}} analyze various other economic aspects of software development processes and yields an interesting alternative for cost estimation...|$|R
