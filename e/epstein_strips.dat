40|$|Surface domain {{patterns}} in electrical steel, which appear under rotational magnetisation, were noted to be {{comparable to those}} which are observed under high compressive stress. This paper presents comparison of peak to peak magnetostriction of <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> under high compression magnetised along rolling and transverse directions, and disc samples under rotational and uniaxial magnetisation with no external stress applied. Good correlation was found between magnetostriction measurement results obtained in the rolling direction of non-oriented <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> under high compression and disc samples under rotational magnetisation. Also {{it was observed that}} the rotational magnetostriction of grainoriented electrical steel is greater than its uniaxial value under compressive stress...|$|E
40|$|Magnetostriction in non-oriented {{electrical}} steel {{is a source}} of vibration of electrical machine cores. This paper covers measurements of magnetostriction in a disc sample of non-oriented {{electrical steel}} under unidirectional and two-dimensional magnetisation conditions, close to those occurring in electrical machine stator cores for use in analysis of core vibration. A comparison with magnetostriction measured in conventional <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> is presented. The characterisation of magnetostriction of the disc sample provides better versatility under closer magnetisation conditions present in machine core...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of sample thickness and grain size of Conventional Grain-Oriented (CGO) and High Permeability Grain-oriented (HGO) steels on Magnetic Barkhausen Noise (MBN) of <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> has been examined. It {{might be expected}} that MBN decreases with increasing sample thickness due to eddy current damping but the measurements show that the average domain width, hence the grain size influences MBN in strips less than 0. 35 mm thick. From 0. 35 mm and above, both strip thickness and domain width influence MBN in CGO and HGO...|$|E
40|$|Magnetostriction data of non-oriented {{electrical}} steel {{is needed for}} calculation of deformation and vibration of electrical machine cores. It is characterised on various sample shapes using several measurement techniques which may give different results. In this paper, measurement results of AC magnetostriction of two commercial non-oriented steels magnetised at angles to the rolling direction in standard <b>Epstein</b> <b>strip</b> and disc samples are presented. Magnetostriction measured in disc samples magnetised in a twodimensional magnetisation system revealed that the highest magnetostriction in the sheet plane may not occur along the magnetisation direction if the material is anisotropic. Sample geometry also caused differences of magnetostriction measured in the Epstein and disc samples due to the form effect. The results show that magnetostriction measured in <b>Epstein</b> <b>strip</b> form should be used with caution for calculation of core deformation and vibration of large electrical machines...|$|R
40|$|The {{extended}} {{modeling of}} the magnetic properties of GO (Grain Oriented) electrical steel is {{presented in this paper}} which is based on a set of standard and scaled-down Epstein frames and a proposed two-level weighted processing of Epstein data, including the mean magnetic path length, specific magnetization loss and exciting power. The effects of excitation frequency, strip angle and ambient temperature on the results obtained from the Epstein frames are investigated. It is shown that using the proposed Epstein combination and the two-level weighted processing method is an efficient way of building a model for determining magnetic losses more realistically, hence, improving the value of <b>Epstein</b> <b>strip</b> measurement data...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties, {{namely the}} iron losses {{and the relative}} permeability, of SiFe electrical steel laminations after mechanical and laser cutting are studied. Mechanical cutting with guillotine shears and cutting by means of fiber and CO 2 lasers are considered. The magnetic measurements are conducted on the Epstein frame for frequencies of 50, 100 and 200 Hz. The specimens also include <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> with 1, 2 and 3 additional cutting edges along their length, {{in order to increase}} the cutting effect and the characterization data. Mechanical cutting results in more than 20...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{numerical}} model {{for the evaluation of}} electromagnetic fields in one steel lamination under the influence of a rotating magnetic flux, taking into account anisotropy effects. For this purpose, a detailed material model, described by a differential permeability tensor, is included in the macroscopic electromagnetic field calculations in one lamination. The study leads to a more realistic numerical modeling of the electromagnetic phenomena inside electric and magnetic conducting laminations due to anisotropy effects. The model has been verified experimentally by the reconstruction of the coenergy function starting from unidirectional measurements on <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> cut along different directions with respect to the rolling direction and by the comparison of measured and calculated H loci for circular flux excitations...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetostriction}} of <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> of 0. 30 mm thick grain oriented {{electrical steel}} cut using three techniques was measured under longitudinal applied stress. Commercially available guillotining, electrical discharge machining, and laser cutting techniques were used. The parameter {{used to determine}} their effect was the stress shift of the peak to peak magnetostriction. The increase in the magnetostriction, especially under compressive stress, {{is related to the}} appearance of domain stress patterns on the strip surface. Hence, to investigate and correlate the cutting stress with the shift of the curve of magnetostriction against stress, static domain observations were carried out. The results from the magnetostriction under stress measurements show that all utilized cutting techniques set up compressive stress in the strips indicated by a shift of magnetostriction stress sensitivity curves, stress domain patterns on the strips surface, and distortion of B-H loop characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Magnetostriction is {{a source}} of {{vibration}} and acoustic noise of electrical machines and it can be highly anisotropic even in non-oriented electrical steel. Understanding of magnetostriction under magnetisation and stress conditions present in stator core laminations can help predict the core vibration and radiated noise. Anisotropy of magnetostriction of a 0. 50 mm thick non-oriented steel investigated in <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> cut at angles to the rolling direction was much higher than the anisotropy of its magnetic and elastic properties because magnetostriction arises directly from magnetic domain processes. Magnetostriction of a disc sample of the 0. 50 mm thick steel was measured under ID and 2 D magnetisation and compared with that of a 0. 35 mm thick steel with different anisotropy level. A 2 D magnetostriction model and an analytical simple domain model were used to explain the experimental results. 2 D magnetostriction is dependent on the magnetostrictive anisotropy and the ratios of the transverse to longitudinal magnetostriction. AC magnetostriction measured in the disc samples was larger than in the <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> due to the form effect. An induction motor model core was constructed from the 0. 50 mm thick steel for measurements of localised flux density and deformation. Core deformation due to Maxwell forces was calculated. Magnetostriction and specific power loss of the core material under magnetisation conditions present in the core was measured. The localised loss in the stator teeth, tooth roots and back iron differed from their average value by 52 %, 19 % and 36 % due to the magnetic anisotropy. Magnetostriction was estimated to be about 55 % and 80 % of the radial deformation at the tooth root and back iron regions respectively. Stator teeth deformed asymmetrically and the magnitude of the space harmonics increased due to the magnetostrictive anisotropy. The measurement results inferred that 2 D magnetostriction can be predicted from the magnetostrictive anisotropy and vice versa. Also, core deformation and vibration of large machines, where segmented stator core laminations are used, can be estimated analytically with the knowledge of 2 D magnetostriction of the core material...|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} {{of the effect of}} plastic deformation on the calculated excess loss component (anomalous-loss) supports the concept of loss separation. Magnetic losses and Barkhausen noise of nonoriented electrical steel sheets were measured on <b>Epstein</b> <b>strips</b> taken from a single coil of 0. 8 % Si nonoriented electrical steel. Sheets were extracted in the annealed condition, without any skin pass and with a grain size of 18 mu m. This material was cold rolled in order to obtain sets of samples with true strain from 2 % up to 29 %. X-ray diffraction was used to estimate the dislocation density. The analysis of magnetic properties was performed by Barkhausen noise measurements and also by analyzing the hysteresis loops obtained from Epstein frame measurements for different inductions and different frequencies (including the quasi-static regime for hysteresis loss measurements). These data allowed us to observe that most of the well known total loss increase with plastic deformation is due to an increase in the hysteresis loss component, while excess loss decreases to become negligible. This behavior can be explained if it is assumed that the plastic deformation lead to {{an increase in the number}} of domain walls per unit volume, thereby decreasing the excess loss. Barkhausen peak area increases with plastic deformation, reproducing results taken from samples of different silicon content...|$|E
