40|$|The {{development}} of atherosclerosis {{is closely related}} to excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERs). <b>Equol</b> reportedly protects against cardiovascular disease; however, the underlying mechanism for this protection remains unknown. Herein, the mechanisms contributing to the atheroprotective effect of <b>equol</b> were addressed using apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without <b>equol.</b> <b>Equol</b> intervention reduced atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta in HFD-fed apoE-/- mice. Plasma lipid analysis showed that <b>equol</b> intervention reduced triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol and increased HDL-cholesterol. Additionally, <b>equol</b> administration decreased lipid accumulation in the liver. Simultaneously, <b>equol</b> treatment inhibited cell apoptosis induced by t-BHP and thapsigargin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, <b>equol</b> treatment attenuated palmitate, t-BHP or thapsigargin-induced upregulation of ER stress markers, including p-PERK, p-eIF 2 α, GRP 78, ATF 6 and CHOP proteins expression. The same tendency was also observed in aortic lysates in apoE-/- mice fed with <b>equol</b> plus HFD compared with HFD alone. Moreover, <b>equol</b> treatment dose dependently activated the Nrf 2 signaling pathway under oxidative stress. Additionally, elevation of Nrf 2 induction was found in aortic lysates in apoE-/- mice fed with a HFD diet containing <b>equol</b> compared with a HFD diet without <b>equol.</b> Importantly, Nrf 2 siRNA interference induced CHOP and attenuated the effect of <b>equol</b> to inhibit t-BHP mediated CHOP induction, furthermore, abrogated cell apoptosis induced by t-BHP, suggesting a role for Nrf 2 in the protective effect of <b>equol</b> in HUVECs.

40|$|Background and purpose: <b>Equol</b> is {{the main}} active {{intestinal}} metabolite of the isoflavone daidzein and is postulated {{to be responsible for}} the cardiovascular benefits of soy. Cerebral vascular effects of <b>equol</b> are unknown. We compared the vasorelaxant and antioxidant effects of <b>equol</b> and daidzein in carotid and basilar artery of normal and hypertensive rats. Experimental approach: Relaxant responses to <b>equol</b> and daidzein were measured in the isolated carotid artery and in the basilar artery in vivo. Effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition, high extracellular K+, endothelial removal and gender on responses to <b>equol</b> were investigated in carotid arteries. Antioxidant activity was assessed as the reduction of NADPH-induced superoxide levels. Hypertension was induced using angiotensin II (0. 7 mg/kg per day for 14 days). Key results: In normotensive rats, <b>equol</b> displayed vasorelaxant activity similar to daidzein. The relaxant effect of <b>equol</b> was independent of an intact endothelium, NOS activity, K+ channels and gender. In the basilar artery, where superoxide levels are higher, <b>equol</b> exerted weak antioxidant effects, whereas effects of daidzein were insignificant. During hypertension, equol-induced vasorelaxation was preserved, whereas relaxant responses to daidzein were impaired.

40|$|Background: The {{estimated}} {{intake of}} soy isoflavones from a meal {{has been based}} on the content in a food, but the health effects of soy isoflavones are possibly affected by their bioavailability. In this study we have evaluated the isoflavone bioavailability after the intake of three kinds of soy foods and a commercial soy isoflavone supplement, and examined whether the isoflavone bioavailability is different between <b>equol</b> producers and non-producers. Methods: Healthy female subjects (n =  20; 9 <b>equol</b> producers, 11 <b>equol</b> non-producers) aged between 20 and 26  y participated in this study. To assess the bioavailability of isoflavones, <b>equol</b> producers and non-producers consumed three kinds of soy foods (tofu, fermented soybeans: natto in Japanese, soy milk) and a soy isoflavone supplement containing 75  mg isoflavones together with breakfast. Urine was collected for 24  h, and the amounts of urinary excretions of daidzein, genistein, and the metabolite <b>equol</b> were measured. The intra- and inter-individual variations in the bioavailability of isoflavones were also examined. Results: The bioavailability of daidzein following the consumption of tofu, natto, soy milk, and soy isoflavone supplement were 66. 9 %, 45. 2 %, 65. 7 %, and 57. 9 %, respectively, and the bioavailability of genistein following the consumption of these soy products were 33. 7 %, 24. 4 %, 31. 2 %, and 17. 7 %, respectively. The bioavailability of daidzein and genistein was significantly greater in <b>equol</b> non-producers than <b>equol</b> producers, especially following the consumption of soymilk. In the <b>equol</b> producers, the 24  h urinary excretion of <b>equol</b> was significantly greater after the intake of soy isoflavone supplement than after the intake of natto or soymilk. The analysis of relative reliability of intra- and inter-individual variations suggested that bioavailability of isoflavones is less variable following soymilk intake than soy isoflavone supplement. Conclusions: The results in this study suggest that bioavailability of isoflavones are different between <b>equol</b> producers and non-producers, because the 24  h urinary excretion of <b>equol</b> in the <b>equol</b> producers were significantly lower than those in the <b>equol</b> non-producers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To determine: {{in vitro}} binding {{affinity}} of <b>equol</b> for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT), in vitro effects of <b>equol</b> treatment in human prostate cancer (LNCap) cells, and in vivo effects of <b>equol</b> on rat prostate weight and circulating levels of sex steroid hormones. Methods First, in vitro <b>equol</b> binding affinity for 5 alpha-DHT was determined using 14 C 5 alpha-DHT combined with cold 5 alpha-DHT (3. 0 nM in all samples). These steroids were incubated with increasing concentrations of <b>equol</b> (0 - 2, 000 nM) and analyzed by Sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography. 14 C 5 alpha-DHT peak/profiles {{were determined by}} scintillation counting of column fractions. Using the 14 C 5 alpha-DHT peak (0 nM <b>equol)</b> as a reference standard, a binding curve was generated by quantifying shifts in the 14 C 5 alpha-DHT peaks as <b>equol</b> concentrations increased. Second, equol's in vitro effects on LNCap cells were determined by culturing cells (48 hours) {{in the presence of}} increasing concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle-control), 5 alpha-DHT, <b>equol</b> or 5 alpha-DHT+equol. Following culture, prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were quantified via ELISA. Finally, the in vivo effects of <b>equol</b> were tested in sixteen male Long-Evans rats fed a low isoflavone diet. From 190 - 215 days, animals received 0. 1 cc s. c. injections of either DMSO-control vehicle (n = 8) or 1. 0 mg/kg (body weight) of <b>equol</b> (in DMSO) (n = 8). At 215 days, body and prostate weights were recorded, trunk blood was collected and serum assayed for luteinizing hormone (LH), 5 alpha-DHT, testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol levels. Results Maximum and half maximal <b>equol</b> binding to 5 alpha-DHT occurred at approximately 100 nM and 4. 8 nM respectively. LNCap cells cultured in the presence of 5 alpha-DHT significantly increased PSA levels. However, in the presence of 5 alpha-DHT+equol, <b>equol</b> blocked the significant increases in PSA levels from LNCap cells. In vivo <b>equol</b> treatment significantly decreased rat prostate weights and serum 5 alpha-DHT levels but did not alter LH, testosterone, and estradiol levels. Conclusions <b>Equol</b> administration appears to have potential beneficial effects for prostate health and other 5 alpha-DHT mediated disorders. <b>Equol</b> administration: reduces PSA levels from LNCap cells under 5 alpha-DHT stimulation, decreases rat prostate size, decreases serum 5 alpha-DHT levels and androgen hormone action, while not altering other circulating sex steroids or LH levels. </p...|$|E

The present study evaluated the prebiotic effects of DFAIII on <b>equol</b> production and on plasma cholesterol concentrations {{related to the}} changes in <b>equol</b> production. We compared plasma <b>equol</b> concentrations at 10. 00 and 18. 00 hours and faecal isoflavone excretion in three groups of seven rats (male Wistar-ST strain, 6 weeks old) fed a basal diet or a DFAIII or fructooligosaccharide (15 [*]g/kg diet) diet containing 1 [*]g soya isoflavones/kg diet for 20 [*]d. <b>Equol</b> concentrations in the DFAIII group were {{higher than in the}} control and fructooligosaccharides groups, especially in the later phase of the light period (18. 00 hours) throughout the experiment. Daizein and genistein concentrations did not change between the diet groups. The faecal ratios of equol:daidzein were very high in all groups, but the ratios were higher in the DFAIII group than the control and fructooligosaccharide groups on day 3, and this tendency continued throughout the experiment. On day 20, the plasma total cholesterol concentration was lowest in the DFAIII group. Additionally, the cholesterol concentrations were inversely correlated to plasma <b>equol</b> concentration in all the rats. In conclusion, DFAIII efficiently enhanced plasma <b>equol</b> concentrations, which may be associated with an increase in <b>equol</b> production and a decrease in <b>equol</b> degradation by enterobacteria.

Our purpose {{in this study}} was to determine whether <b>equol,</b> a soy isoflavone, could prevent RTV-induced endothelial dysfunction in porcine pulmonary arteries and in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC). Fresh porcine pulmonary artery rings were treated with 15 μmol/L of RTV and/or <b>equol</b> in concentrations of 0. 1, 1, and 10 μmol/L for 24 h. A control was set with no amount of <b>equol</b> or RTV administered. Based on myograph tension analysis, RTV significantly reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to bradykinin in the artery rings compared with untreated vessels, whereas the antioxidant <b>equol</b> effectively reversed the RTV effect in a concentration-dependent manner. RTV also reduced the contraction of artery rings in response to thromboxane A(2) analogue U 46619 and this reduction was blocked by <b>equol.</b> In addition, RTV treatment significantly reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in both porcine pulmonary arteries and HPAEC, whereas <b>equol</b> effectively blocked RTV-induced eNOS downregulation. Furthermore, RTV significantly increased superoxide anion production, whereas <b>equol</b> reversed this effect of RTV in porcine pulmonary arteries. Thus, the antioxidant <b>equol</b> effectively protects vascular function from the detrimental effects of HIV PI RTV in both porcine pulmonary arteries and HPAEC via a reduction in the vasomotor dysfunction, eNOS downregulation, and oxidative stress induced by RTV.

We conducted a survey using patients with PCa to assess the relationship between serum concentrations of isoflavone aglycones and frequency of soybean products consumption in patients with PCa. We measured the serum concentrations of daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and <b>equol</b> in 99 PCa patients, in addition to conducting a survey using a self administrated questionnaire that included the frequencies of various food item consumptions. If serum concentrations of <b>equol</b> were at a value less than 0. 5 ng/mL, they were classified as an <b>equol</b> non producer, and the other patients were classified as <b>equol</b> producers.

Sprague–Dawley rats (n[*]=[*] 40 – 41 per group) were fed a soy-free AIN- 93 G diet or an AIN- 93 G diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg of S-(−) <b>equol</b> or R-(+) <b>equol</b> beginning day 35. On day 50, mammary tumors were induced by dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and thereafter, animals were palpated for number and location of tumors. On day 190, animals were killed and mammary tumors were removed and verified by histology, and the degree of invasiveness and differentiation was determined. S-(−) <b>equol</b> and R-(+) <b>equol</b> plasma concentrations measured on days 35, 100 and 190 by tandem mass spectrometry confirmed diet compliance and no biotransformation of either diastereoisomer. In this model, S-(−) <b>equol</b> had no chemopreventive action, nor was it stimulatory. In contrast, R-(+) <b>equol</b> compared with Controls reduced palpable tumors (P[*]=[*] 0. 002), resulted in 43 % fewer tumors (P[*]=[*] 0. 004), increased tumor latency (88. 5 versus 66 days, P[*]=[*] 0. 003), and tumors were less invasive but showed no difference in pattern grade or mitosis. Both enantiomers had no effect on absolute uterine weight but caused a significant reduction in body weight gain. In conclusion, the novel finding that the unnatural enantiomer, R-(+) <b>equol,</b> was potently chemopreventive warrants investigation of its potential for breast cancer prevention and treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background Isoflavone {{containing}} {{soy protein}} {{has been associated}} with beneficial health effects. <b>Equol,</b> a gut bacterial metabolite of the isoflavone daidzein, has been hypothesized to be the cause of the effectiveness of isoflavones. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of 100 mg/day soy isoflavone supplementation for 3 months on the ability to produce <b>equol</b> in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. Method A pre-post experimental study was conducted to assess the effects of 100 mg/day soy isoflavone supplementation on <b>equol</b> production capability and the proportion of <b>equol</b> producers to non-equol producers in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. A total of 39 subjects received 1 supplement tablet containing 100 mg soy isoflavones (genistein, daidzein) for 3 months. Determination of serum genistein, daidzein, and <b>equol</b> concentrations was performed twice at baseline and at 3 months post-supplementation using high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrophotometry (HPLC-MS). <b>Equol</b> producer status was determined by the detection of a serum <b>equol</b> concentration of 5 µg/L. Results Mean genistein and daidzein concentrations at baseline were 86. 2 ± 68. 4 ìg/L and 16. 7 ± 18. 6 ìg/L, respectively. The proportion of <b>equol</b> producers was 69. 2 %. After 3 months of soy isoflavone supplementation the serum concentrations of genistein and daidzein significantly increased to 161. 0 ± 5. 8 ìg/L (p= 0. 000) and 49. 9 ± 40. 4 ìg/L (p= 0. 000), respectively, and the proportion of <b>equol</b> producers also significantly increased (100. 0 %). Conclusion Soy isoflavone supplementation was capable of increasing the serum concentrations of isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) and the equol-producing capacity of postmenopausal women with osteopenia...|$|E
40|$|S-(-) <b>equol,</b> {{a natural}} {{product of the}} {{isoflavone}} daidzein, {{has been reported to}} offer cytoprotective effects with respect to the cardiovascular system, but how this occurs is unclear. Interestingly, S-(-) <b>equol</b> is produced by the human gut, suggesting a role in physiological processes. We report that treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and EA. hy 926 cells with S-(-) <b>equol</b> induces ARE-luciferase reporter gene activity that is dose and time dependent. S-(-) <b>equol</b> (10 – 250 nM) increases nuclear factor-erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) as well as gene products of Nrf 2 target genes heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) and NAD(P) H (nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate) quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO 1). Endothelial cells transfected with an HA-Nrf 2 expression plasmid had elevated HA-Nrf 2, HO- 1, and NQO 1 in response to S-(-) <b>equol</b> exposure. S-(-) <b>equol</b> treatment affected Nrf 2 mRNA only slightly but significantly increased HO- 1 and NQO 1 mRNA. The pretreatment of cells with specific ER inhibitors or PI 3 K/Akt (ICI 182, 780 and LY 294002) increased Nrf 2, HO- 1, and NQO 1 protein, impaired nuclear translocation of HA-Nrf 2, and decreased ARE-luciferase activity. Identical experiments were conducted with daidzein, which had effects similar to S-(-) <b>equol.</b> In addition, DPN treatment (an ERb agonist) induced the ARE-luciferase reporter gene, promoting Nrf 2 nuclear translocation. Cell pretreatment with an ERb antagonist (PHTPP) impaired S-(-) equol-induced Nrf 2 activation. Pre-incubation of cells followed by co-treatment with S-(-) <b>equol</b> significantly improved cell survival in response to H 2 O 2 or tBHP and reduced apoptotic and TUNEL-positively-stained cells.

40|$|Soy isoflavones {{and their}} metabolites, with estrogenic activity, have been {{considered}} candidates for reducing postmenopausal bone loss. In this study, we examined the effect of dietary <b>equol,</b> a bioactive metabolite of the soy isoflavone daidzein, on <b>equol</b> tissue distribution, bone parameters, and reproductive tissue activity using an adult ovariectomized (OVX) rat model. An 8 -wk feeding {{study was conducted to}} compare 4 dietary treatments of <b>equol</b> (0, 50, 100, 200 mg/kg diet) in 6 -mo-old OVX female Sprague-Dawley rats. A dose response increase in tissue <b>equol</b> concentrations was observed for serum, liver, kidney, and heart, and a plateau occurred at 100 mg equol/kg diet for intestine. In OVX rats receiving 200 mg equol/kg diet, femoral calcium concentration was greater than those receiving lower doses but was still less than SHAM (P < 0. 05), and other bone measures were not improved. Tibia calcium concentrations were lower in OVX rats receiving 100 and 200 mg equol/kg diet compared with the OVX control rats. Trabecular bone mineral density of tibia was also lower in equol-fed OVX rats. At this dietary <b>equol</b> intake, uterine weight was higher (P < 0. 05) than in other OVX groups but lower than the SHAM-operated intact rats. The 200 mg/kg diet dose of dietary <b>equol</b> significantly increased proliferative index in the uterine epithelium. Dietary <b>equol</b> had no stimulatory effect on mammary gland epithelium. We conclude that in OVX rats, a dietary <b>equol</b> dose that had modest effect on bone also exerts mild uterotropic effects...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCow’s milk {{contains}} bioactive secondary {{phenolic compounds}} that are formed by bovine’s gut bacterial flora from plant phenolic compounds. <b>Equol,</b> a metabolite of daidzein, {{is one such}} secondary compounds of biological interest. The potential of phenolic compounds in milk as dietary antioxidants and their distribution within the milk matrix were examined. The <b>equol</b> concentrations, total phenolic contents, and antioxidant activity (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity and inhibition of F 2 -isoprostanes formation by human neutrophils in vitro) were measured and compared in commercial cow’s milk of varying lipid contents. The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity and ability to inhibit F 2 -isoprostanes formation in vitro increased with the concentrations of phenolic compounds and <b>equol</b> in the milk. <b>Equol</b> and total phenolic compound concentrations correlated positively with the milk lipid concentrations. Separate experiments using homogenized and non-homogenized milk showed that dairy <b>equol</b> and phenolic compounds distributed to larger extent in the lipid fraction than in the aqueous fraction of cow’s milk.

40|$|Background: The {{reduction}} in estrogen synthesis during menopause heightens {{the risk of}} development of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. Isoflavone (daidzein and genistein) interventions in postmenopausal women have reduced bone loss, and improved the serum lipid profile, which may {{reduce the risk of}} fracture and incidence of cardiovascular disease. However, skeletal benefits are inconsistent across interventions. This is partly a result of population heterogeneity in enteric bacterial daidzein metabolism – only ~ 30 % of Caucasian women produce <b>equol,</b> a daidzein metabolite. <b>Equol</b> is more bioactive than its precursor and <b>equol</b> producers have more consistently shown skeletal benefits from isoflavone supplementation. Few interventions have accounted for <b>equol</b> production in postmenopausal study populations. Additionally, there is limited knowledge on how prebiotic foods, such as green kiwifruit, modulate daidzein-metabolising bacteria and <b>equol</b> production in humans. This pilot study aimed to assess bone turnover in response to isoflavone supplementation, and to determine the proportion of <b>equol</b> producers in postmenopausal women. Objectives: The main objective was to measure the effect of short-term daily isoflavone supplementation alone or with the addition of green kiwifruit on biochemical markers of bone resorption, urinary deoxypyridinoline, plasma crosslinked C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and plasma undercarboxylated osteocalcin in postmenopausal Caucasian women. A secondary objective was to measure the effect of isoflavones and kiwifruit on serum lipid profile. Additionally, <b>equol</b> production was determined in this population and assessed as a main effect. Methods: This randomised crossover pilot study recruited 33 healthy postmenopausal Caucasian women, 1 - 10 years postmenopausal, and randomly allocated participants to treatment group A (n= 16) or B (n= 17) for a 16 -week intervention. There were two consecutive 6 -week treatment periods with a 2 -week lead-in period at intervention commencement and a 2 -week washout period between treatments. These treatments prescribed either: (1) daily isoflavone supplementation (50 mg/day aglycone daidzein and genistein) alone or (2) with two green kiwifruit. Group A and B completed both treatments in opposite order. At treatment baseline and endpoints the following were measured (four time points) : bone markers, serum lipid profile and both serum and urinary daidzein and <b>equol.</b> The hormones, serum follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol and thyroid-stimulating hormone, were also measured at baseline and endpoint to monitor potential adverse effects of isoflavones. Results: <b>Equol</b> producers made up 30 % of this study population (<b>equol</b> producers n= 10; non-equol producers n= 30). Serum <b>equol</b> rose significantly in <b>equol</b> producers. Plasma undercarboxylated osteocalcin decreased by 15. 5 % after the kiwifruit and isoflavone treatment and increased by 10. 8 % after the isoflavone only treatment. There were no changes in plasma C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen or urinary deoxypyridinoline. In non-equol producers high-density lipoprotein cholesterol declined by an average of 4. 9 % with each treatment; there was no change in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in <b>equol</b> producers following isoflavone treatment alone, and an 8. 3 % increase in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol following the combined kiwifruit and isoflavone combined. There were no other changes to the lipid parameters or hormones. Conclusions: An aglycone isoflavone dose of 50 mg/day did not reduce bone resorption in the postmenopausal women in this study. Kiwifruit consumption decreased plasma undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels possibly due to the vitamin K content of green kiwifruit; however, alternative bioactive components in kiwifruit may have modulated this effect. The isoflavone treatment inhibited a decline in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in <b>equol</b> producers and had synergistic effect with kiwifruit, which increasing this parameter. <b>Equol</b> and the carotenoid lutein from green kiwifruit may potentially modulate systemic inflammation. Kiwifruit may have a prebiotic effect in <b>equol</b> producers as shown by the increase in log ratio of daidzein to <b>equol,</b> but this requires further study. This <b>equol</b> producer subgroup was too small to detect a change the markers of bone resorption. Larger long-term studies are required to delineate the skeletal and cardiovascular effects of isoflavones and <b>equol</b> production in postmenopausal women...|$|E
40|$|<b>Equol,</b> first {{isolated}} from equine urine in 1932 and identified 50 {{years later in}} human urine as a metabolite of the soy isoflavones, daidzin and daidzein, is produced by intestinal bacteria in some, but not all, adults.

40|$|<b>Equol,</b> one of {{the main}} {{metabolites}} of daidzein, is a chiral compound with pleiotropic effects on cellular signaling. This property may induce activation/inhibition of the estrogen receptors (ER) a or b, and therefore, explain the beneficial/deleterious effects of <b>equol</b> on estrogen-dependent diseases. With its asymmetric centre at position C- 3, <b>equol</b> can exist in two enantiomeric forms (R- and S-equol). To elucidate the yet unclear mechanisms of ER activation/inhibition by <b>equol,</b> we performed a comprehensive analysis of ERa and ERb transactivation by racemic <b>equol,</b> as well as by enantiomerically pure forms. Racemic <b>equol</b> was prepared by catalytic hydrogenation from daidzein and separated into enantiomers by chiral HPLC. The configuration assignment was performed by optical rotatory power measurements. The ER-induced transactivation by R- and S-equol (0. 1 – 10 µM) and 17 b-estradiol (E 2, 10 nM) was studied using transient transfections of ERa and ERb in CHO, HepG 2 and HeLa cell lines. R- and S-equol induce ER transactivation in an opposite fashion according to the cellular context. R-equol and S-equol are more potent in inducing ERa in an AF- 2 and AF- 1 permissive cell line, respectively. Involvement of ERa transactivation functions (AF- 1 and AF- 2) in these effects has been examined. Both AF- 1 and AF- 2 are involved in racemic <b>equol,</b> R-equol and S-equol induced ERa transcriptional activity. These results could be of interest to find a specific ligand modulating ER transactivation and could contribute to explaining the diversity of <b>equol</b> actions in vivo...|$|E
