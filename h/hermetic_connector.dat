50|$|Walter Werner Fischer, a {{pioneering}} Swiss engineer, founded {{the company in}} 1954 in Morges, Switzerland. The company developed the very first sealed connector and, in 1962, took out an international patent on its proprietary push-pull locking system, which became a standard in connector technology. In 1964 it developed the world’s first <b>hermetic</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the contacts, connector insert and body. A true <b>hermetic</b> <b>connector</b> provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. Waterproof connectors prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., molding, potting and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting rubber gaskets and compression seals at the contract region {{as well as at the}} cable entry.|$|E
40|$|The Lightning Arrestor Connector (LAC), part “M”, {{presented}} {{opportunities to}} improve the processes used to fabricate LACs. The A## LACs were the first production LACs produced at the KCP, after the product was transferred from Pinnellas. The new LAC relied on the {{lessons learned from the}} A## LACs; however, additional improvements were needed to meet the required budget, yield, and schedule requirements. Improvement projects completed since 2001 include <b>Hermetic</b> <b>Connector</b> Sealing Improvement, Contact Assembly molding Improvement, development of a second vendor for LAC shells, general process improvement, tooling improvement, reduction of the LAC production cycle time, and documention of the LAC granule fabrication process. This report summarizes the accomplishments achieved in improving the LAC Production Readiness...|$|E

The {{results for the}} following areas are presented: (1) cost of FCC versus standard round cable, (2) qualification status, (3) size of wire available in FCC, (4) {{availability of}} <b>hermetic</b> <b>connectors</b> for FCC, (5) conversion from flat cable to round cable and visa versa, (6) availability of shielded flat cable for RF usage, (7) termination techniques, and (8) repair techniques...|$|R
40|$|Fiber Sensors {{are poised}} {{to be used in}} future LEPs. The three primary {{vehicles}} for fiber sensors are Department 1, Joint Test Assembly (JTA), and Shelf Life (SL). The National Security Enterprise (NSE) community plans to incorporate optical sensors or systems into these vehicles. Additionally, hermetic sealing of optical systems is required if optical technology is to be integrated into LEP and future weapons applications. Hermetic seals will reduce the long-term risk of contamination which can degrade or incapacitate optical components. This study was funded through the Kansas City Plant&#x 27;s (KCP) ESC work package between 2007 and 2009 to develop optical sensors, identify commercial fiber sensors and <b>hermetic</b> <b>connectors,</b> and qualify these sensors against likely weapon lifetime environments...|$|R
40|$|A {{straightforward}} {{measurement technique}} provides for correction of thermal-electromotive-force (thermal-EMF) errors introduced by temperature gradients along the pins of non-thermocouple-alloy <b>hermetic</b> feedthrough <b>connectors</b> for thermocouple extension wires that must pass through bulkheads. This technique {{is an alternative}} to the traditional technique in which the thermal-EMF errors are eliminated by use of custom-made multipin <b>hermetic</b> feedthrough <b>connectors</b> that contain pins made of the same alloys as those of the thermocouple extension wires. One disadvantage of the traditional technique is that it is expensive and time-consuming to fabricate multipin custom thermocouple connectors. In addition, the thermocouple-alloy pins in these connectors tend to corrode easily and/or tend to be less rugged compared to the non-thermocouple-alloy pins of ordinary connectors. As the number of thermocouples (and thus pins) is increased in a given setup, the magnitude of these disadvantages increases accordingly. The present technique is implemented by means of a little additional hardware and software, the cost of which is more than offset by the savings incurred through the use of ordinary instead of thermocouple connectors. The figure schematically depicts a typical measurement setup to which the technique is applied. The additional hardware includes an isothermal block (made of copper) instrumented with a reference thermocouple and a compensation thermocouple. The reference thermocouple is connected to an external data-acquisition system (DAS) through a two-pin thermocouple-alloy <b>hermetic</b> feedthrough <b>connector,</b> but this is the only such connector in the apparatus. The compensation thermocouple is connected to the DAS through two pins of the same ordinary multipin connector that connects the measurement thermocouples to the DAS...|$|R
40|$|A Closed Brayton {{cycle power}} {{conversion}} {{system has been}} developed to support the NASA fission surface power program. The goal is to provide electricity from a small nuclear reactor heat source for surface power production for lunar and Mars environments. The selected media for a heat source is NaK 78 with water as a cooling source. The closed Brayton cycle power was selected to be 12 kWe output from the generator terminals. A heat source NaK temperature of 850 K plus or minus 25 K was selected. The cold source water was selected at 375 K plus or minus 25 K. A vacuum radiation environment of 200 K is specified for environmental operation. The major components of the system are the power converter, the power controller, and the top level data acquisition and control unit. The power converter with associated sensors resides in the vacuum radiation environment. The power controller and data acquisition system reside in an ambient laboratory environment. Signals and power are supplied across the pressure boundary electrically with <b>hermetic</b> <b>connectors</b> installed on the vacuum vessel. System level analyses were performed on working fluids, cycle design parameters, heater and cooling temperatures, and heat exchanger options that best {{meet the needs of}} the power converter specification. The goal is to provide a cost effective system that has high thermal-to-electric efficiency in a compact, lightweight package...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the design and fabrication of a hermetic LTCC package for an optical MEMS chip designed for space applications. The package must ensure electrical and optical connections, mechanical positioning, atmosphere control, and finally low thermally induced stress on the MEMS during final packaging operation. The package consists of a 10 -layer LTCC case with a recessed cavity for the MEMS chip, and glass lid (with antireflection coating and thin-film metallisation for soldering) for optical I/O. The chip is mechanically attached {{to the bottom of}} the cavity with a silicone adhesive, and electrically connected through gold wire bonds. The gold wire bonding pads are routed through the LTCC module to a MegArray BGA <b>connector.</b> <b>Hermetic</b> closure of the cavity is carried out by soldering the glass lid onto the case in a controlled atmosphere. The two main difficulties involved in such a package are the high electrical connection density (400 connections) and low-temperature hermetic sealing. LTCC design rules for small-pitch lines, thick- and thin-film materials selection, screen-printing, lamination techniques and soldering methods are described in this article...|$|R
40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} Dzero Superconducting Solenoid Platinum RTD, Carbon Glass RTD, and Helium level gage instrumentation values upon receipt at Fermilab. This note {{is concerned with}} the internal instrumentation, the external instrumentation can easily be repaired if any problems arise. The Solenoid was Purchased from Toshiba and shipped from the Kehin Works in Japan. The Solenoid was received at Dzero May 12, 1997. The Solenoid was shipped in three large components. They are the Solenoid, Control Dewar, and Chimney. There are 2 main instrumentation port areas where all the internal instrumentation is available to the outside world. These 2 places are the top of the Control Dewar and the North end of the Solenoid. These two instrumentation feedthrough area's have Cyocera <b>hermetic</b> feedthrough port <b>connectors</b> welded into place. The Cyocera connector can and does mate with the Burndy Bantom cable end connector of the same pin/socket number. Since the Hermetic feedthrough and cable connector are different manufacturers, the pin layout pattern is not the same. The Toshiba drawings show both manufacturers pin numbers. The Dzero engineering notes show only the Burndy pin numbers...|$|R
40|$|Laser-induced damage {{mechanisms}} {{that can occur}} during high-intensity fiber transmission have been under study {{for a number of}} years. Our particular interest in laser initiation of explosives has led us to examine damage processes associated with the transmission of Q-switched, Nd:YAG pulses at 1. 06 {micro}m through step-index, multimode, fused silica fiber. Laser breakdown at the fiber entrance face is often the first process to limit fiber transmission but catastrophic damage can also occur at either fiber end face, within the initial entry segment of the fiber, and at other internal sites along the fiber path. Past studies have examined how these various damage mechanisms depend upon fiber end-face preparation, fiber fixturing and routing, laser characteristics, and laser-to-fiber injection optics. In some applications of interest, however, a fiber transmission system may spend years in storage before it is used. Consequently, an important additional issue for these applications is whether or not there are aging processes that can result in lower damage thresholds over time. Fiber end-face contamination would certainly lower breakdown and damage thresholds at these surfaces, but careful design of <b>hermetic</b> seals in <b>connectors</b> and other end-face fixtures can minimize this possibility. A more subtle possibility would be a process for the slow growth of internal defects that could lead to lower thresholds for internal damage. In the current study, two approaches to stimulating the growth of internal defects were used in an attempt to produce observable changes in internal damage thresholds. In the first approach test fibers were subjected to a very high tensile stress for a time sufficient for some fraction to fail from static fatigue. In the second approach, test fibers were subjected to a combination of high tensile stress and large, cyclic temperature variations. Both of these approaches were rather arbitrary {{due to the lack of}} an established growth mechanism for internal defects. Damage characteristics obtained from fibers subjected to each of these aging environments were compared to results from fresh fibers tested under identical conditions. A surprising result was that internal damage was not observed in any of the tested fibers. Only breakdown at the fiber entrance face and catastrophic damage at both end faces were observed. Fiber end faces were not sealed during the accelerated aging environments, and thresholds at these faces were significantly lower in the aged fibers. However, most fibers transmitted relatively high pulse energies before damaging, and a large fraction never damaged before we reached the limits of our test laser. The absence of any observable affect on internal damage thresholds is encouraging, but the current results do not rule out the possibility that some other approach to accelerated aging could reveal a growth mechanism for internal defects...|$|R
