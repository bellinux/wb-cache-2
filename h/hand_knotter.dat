50|$|The Barber-Colman Company was a {{manufacturer}} of textile and milling machinery from its founding in 1894 until the 1980s. Howard Colman organized the company in Rockford, Illinois with capital from W. A. Barber. Early successes with their <b>Hand</b> <b>Knotter</b> and Warp Tying Machine allowed the company to expand internationally, manufacturing goods in five states and three countries. The company moved to Loves Park in the 1950s, but struggled {{following the death of}} Walter Colman in 1983. Eurotherm Controls, Inc. currently holds the rights to the company name.|$|E
50|$|Howard Colman came to Rockford, Illinois from Wisconsin {{to open a}} {{metalworking}} {{shop for}} his prototype textile machine. He partnered with Wisconsin investor W. A. Barber and founded Barber & Colman in an office above the Spengler Brothers machine shop in the Water Power District. In 1900, Colman invented the <b>Hand</b> <b>Knotter,</b> which could quickly and easily tie knots in string. It was in such high demand that Barber & Colman were able to open their own plant in 1902. Within years, they had branches in Boston and England. Colman's Warp Tying Machine, introduced in 1904, was also a great success. This machine automated the process of passing threads {{through the eyes of}} heddles. Companies could reduce their workforce for this operation from fifteen to two workers. Also in 1904, the company was officially incorporated as the Barber-Colman Company.|$|E
