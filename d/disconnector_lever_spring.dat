40|$|Capacitive {{coupling}} is {{most commonly}} used in NEMS/MEMS or in Scanning Probe Techniques to either induce a displacement or to detect an external interaction applied to the micro/nanosystem. A parabolic elastic deformation of the sensor signs a capacitive interaction as the applied voltage is varied. In this paper, we present detailed force measurements performed in the submicron range with a picoNewton sensitivity, and using a UHV AFM and a silicon microlever equipped with a metallized microsphere,. A complete treatment of the sensor sphere/plane geometry enables one to detect quantitatively a V 4 departure from the parabolic behaviour. This shows that using this setup allows to detect the increased deformation of a lever much before the mechanical instability. More importantly, this effect must be carefully taken into account if sphere/plane absolute separations are to be quantitatively measured {{on the basis of}} electrostatic calibration. To our knowledge, this behaviour in AFM is reported for the first time. We believe that it is relevant for the description of NEMS/MEMS behaviour. Moreover, it provides a method to accurately measure the <b>lever</b> <b>spring</b> constant without any direct contact...|$|R

This leads to innovation in the automotive industry that will lead to better and more environmentally friendly cars. This report presents a concept on a pushing counter <b>lever</b> <b>spring</b> which provides the same characteristics of force curve as a diaphragm spring in a pressure plate of a car has. The mechanism is to be used for long-term testing and evaluating clutch pedals. The work describes the development process and the manufacture of a prototype.

Excel is a great help at the theoretical calculation of the mechanism and to evaluate the theory behind the concept. The result shows how to simulate a diaphragm spring in the pressure plate in a car for long-term testing of clutch pedals.

The novel SPST switch architecture employs electrothermal hydraulic microactuators.

Having simple assembly, many of the inherent problems associated with the more traditional suspension bridge and cantilever beam type architectures can be overcome. In principle, low ON-state insertion loss, high OFF-state isolation and high RF signal power handling characteristics can be achieved with careful design. Using Ansoft`s HFSS software, a 40 to 60 GHz prototype was developed. The simulated ON-state insertion loss and return loss are 1. 2 dB and 23. 8 dB, respectively, at 50 GHz; while OFF-state isolation is 30. 1 dB at 50 GHz. Preliminary small-signal measurements, from DC to 8. 5 GHz, show encouraging results. I...|$|R

Rather than discouraging the use of the <b>spring</b> <b>lever</b> by the fireman, Ramsbottom's valve encouraged this. Rocking the lever freed up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat. Even if the fireman held the lever down and increased the force on the rear valve, there was a corresponding reduction of force on the forward valve.|$|R
