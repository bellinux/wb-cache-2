5|$|Rosendale is {{underlain}} by a shale {{member of}} the Martinburg Formation called Martinburg shale, deposited as early as 500 million years ago; Martinburg shale also lines {{the bottom of the}} Rondout Creek as it flows through the town. A conglomerate of the Shawangunk Formation was deposited over the Martinburg layer approximately 425 million years ago. The conglomerate is in turn covered by High Falls Shale, a reddish shale formed by mud flats. Subsequent streams left a layer of gray Binnewater Sandstone above the shale. After the sandstone was deposited, the region experienced folding and faulting, and was submerged in a shallow sea. This allowed the creation of <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestone</b> roughly 390 million years ago, specifically the Rondout Formation and New Scotland Formation. The Rondout Formation's dolostone member, formed during the upper Silurian, was mined throughout the village because of its ability to form natural cement. The region experienced repeated glaciation, and large amounts of till and alluvium were deposited during the Wisconsonian glaciation.|$|E

After a long hiatus follow 8-20 m of transgressive Cenomanian consisting of green, glauconitic marls rich in oysters and sandy, alveoline-bearing limestones. The Cenomanian is concordantly overlain by 55-65 m of Turonian strata divided into the nodular, chalky limestones of the Ligérian and the rudist-bearing limestones of the Angoumian. This is followed by 50-65 m of Coniacian — mainly hard, <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestones.</b> The sequence finishes with 45-60 m of chalky, glauconitic Santonian, in places rich in oyster debris.|$|R

60|$|Before {{starting}} for Donkia pass on {{the following}} morning, we visited some black rocks which rose from the flat {{to the east of}} the lake. They proved to be of <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestone,</b> the strata of which were much disturbed: the strike appeared in one part north-west, and the dip north-east 45 degrees: a large fault passed east by north through the cliff, and it was further cleft by joints running northwards. The cliff was not 100 yards long, and was about 70 thick; its surface was shivered by frost into cubical masses, and glacial boulders of gneiss lay on the top. The limestone rock was chiefly a blue pisolite conglomerate, with veins and crystals of white carbonate of lime, seams of shale, and iron pyrites. A part was compact and blue, very crystalline, and full of encrinitic fossils, and probably nummulites, but all were too much altered for determination.|$|E

50|$|The Lias {{started with}} a {{transgression}} that {{is more important than}} the advances of the Muschelkalk and Keuper seas. Its total thickness varies between 150 and 400 m. The sea level kept rising during the Hettangian and <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestones</b> were deposited; this trend reversed later on into a regression leaving evaporites (rock salt and anhydrite with some calcareous interlayers). At the edge of the basin and in the eastern Pyrenees, argillaceous limestones and banded dolomites with layers of anhydrite settled out; the dolomites transformed upon dissolution of the anhydrite into monogenic breccias. The regression continued during the Lower Sinemurian, sedimenting intra- and supra-tidal banded limestones and dolomites. In the Upper Sinemurian (Lotharingian), more open-marine conditions established themselves due to a renewed sea-level rise; in deeper parts of the basin, <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestones</b> developed, whereas, on high ground, oolithic limestones accumulated. The Middle Lias (Pliensbachian) started off transgressive as well with fine-grained detrital, limey to marly sediments (ferruginous oolites, <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestones</b> and marls) that change over to marls. In the eastern Pyrenees, pyrite-bearing claystones formed due to a badly oxygenated environment; they contain a very diverse fauna of ammonites belonging to the French southeastern domain, whereas the ammonite population on the Atlantic side is rather monotonous. During the Upper Lias (Toarcian), the sea reached a high stand, continuing with the fine-grained detrital sedimentation and depositing black pelagic marls (marnes noires and schistes esquilleux). Towards the end of the Lias, regressive tendencies again became noticeable.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Molar tooth is {{a series}} of peculiar, ptygmatically folded and spar-filled cracks in {{fine-grained}} carbonates of Precambrian age. This sedimentary structure appears to be limited in time and space. Our field studies in northern Canada and a survey of literature on Precambrian carbonates worldwide indicates that such features are localized to mid/inner ramp and shallow platform paleoenvironments of Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic age (ca. 1500 – 650 Ma) with only sporadic occurrences in older and younger strata. As such they are equivalent in terms of texture, location, and abundance to the ubiq-uitous shallow subtidal, <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestones</b> of the Phanerozoic. The amount of synsedimentary calcite spar in molar tooth, in excess of 50 % of individual beds and 5 – 25 % of entire formations, is further roughly equivalent to the amount of calcite in calcareous benthic invertebrates in these younger rocks. Thus, there is an evolving trend in such facies through geologic time; Archean–Paleoproterozoic 5 massive seafloor precipitates; Mesoproterozoic–Neoproterozoic 5 molar-tooth mud-stones and grainstones; Phanerozoic 5 burrowed and <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestones...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{sedimentary}} sequence {{drilled in}} the basin starts with the La Quinta Formation, that is found in a widespread area across northern Colombia and Venezuela. The formation of sandstones, basalts, conglomerates and volcanic ash was deposited in a lacustrine depositional environment in a rift basin setting related to the break-up of Pangea and has been dated to the Late Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous, 160 to 140 Ma. The formation is time-equivalent with the Girón Formation of the Eastern Ranges. The Early Cretaceous Río Negro Formation, a unit composed of sandstones, conglomerates and siltstones, is very variable in thickness {{in the basin}} and associated with continental sedimentation on rift shoulders to a post-rift setting. The formation is time-equivalent with the Tibasosa Formation of the Eastern Ranges and the Tambor Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley. The <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestones</b> and shales of the Lagunitas Formation, lower member of the Cogollo Group, contain beds of dolomite and are indicative of a shallow, saline environment. The formation is correlated with the Rosablanca Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley and western Eastern Ranges and the Tibú Formation of the Maracaibo Basin. The unit is the deepest source rock for the oils in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin. The upper member of the Cogollo Group, the Aguas Blancas Formation, presents a large lateral variability in lithologies. Black biomicrites and <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestones</b> are indicative of a middle to outer platform environment, while sandy shales and glauconitic sandstones indicate a shallow marine environment. The variation in lithologies and organic content of this source rock formation is associated with basinal relative sea level changes and the organic-rich strata to the Aptian anoxic event, dated to approximately 120 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|During Muschelkalk times, the sea {{advanced}} again, but reached {{only the}} North Pyrenean Zone and the Basque country. The resulting sediments left behind are 20 to 100 m of dolomitic cellular <b>limestones,</b> grey <b>fossiliferous</b> <b>limestones,</b> and wavy limestones.

About 220 m million years ago (during the Carnian) evaporites settled out in lagoons and grabens—variegated, gypsum-bearing, iron-rich clays, gypsum, anhydrite, dolomitic marls, dolomites, rock salt as well as potassium and magnesium salts occur. The evaporites served later as major decollement horizons. At the limit, Upper Triassic/Hettangian doleritic tholeiites (ophites) formed in the Pyrenees and in the southern Aquitaine Basin, indicating further movements along the fracture zones (submarine fissure eruptions and sills in unsolidified Keuper sediments).|$|R
