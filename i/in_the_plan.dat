5|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1967 to its abolition in 1992, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation created {{by far the}} largest and most ambitious of the British new towns: indeed its objective was to build a new city of 250,000 people. Many of Britain's most acclaimed building and landscape architects contributed to what was to be a show-piece of British design. Unlike previous new towns, Milton Keynes has a preponderance of privately funded development but these developments were subject to an exacting design brief in line with the design principles laid out <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Plan</b> for Milton Keynes.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 the United States {{announced}} the Marshall Plan initiative {{to help rebuild}} postwar Europe and thus gain more political power there. After initially welcoming the idea of Poland's participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> the Polish government declined the American offer under pressure from Moscow. Also, following the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, Poland was forced by the Soviet Union {{to give up its}} claims to compensation from Germany, which as a result paid no significant compensation for war damages, either to the Polish state or to Polish citizens. Poland received compensation in the form of land and property left behind by the German population of the annexed western territories.|$|E

5|$|On 26 March 1917, the 7th Brigade—of {{which the}} 26th Battalion was part—was tasked with {{the capture of}} Lagnicourt.

An artillery barrage opened up on the village at 05:15 and continued for twenty minutes, allowing the infantry to close <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> was that Cherry's company would storm the village itself while the battalion's other companies encircled it. For the assault, Cherry split his company into two sections; he commanded one section himself and placed the other under Lieutenant William Frederick Joseph Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état led to {{a sudden}} change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> of attack and confronted the Twelfth Army {{with a number of}} {{difficult}} problems. According to the 28 March Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via Niš toward Belgrade. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise. By the evening of 5 April, the forces intended to enter southern Yugoslavia and Greece had been assembled.|$|E
5|$|Also {{included}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> is {{an outline}} for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, {{a campaign of}} Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, {{the state}} highway system was {{restructured}} completely, incorporating numbers instead of names. The Olympic Highway became State Road9, the Pacific Highway became State Road1, the National Park Highway absorbed the Naches Pass Highway and remained State Road5, and the Inland Empire Highway became State Road3, but its branch from Dayton to Clarkston remained {{a branch of}} the now non-existent Inland Empire Highway. A system of national highways that improved on the concept of auto trails was formed in late 1925. The final plan for the system—which became the U.S. routes—was approved on November11, 1926. One of the routes included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was US410, which extended from US101 in Aberdeen to US95 in Lewiston, Idaho. Parts of US410 were concurrent with other new highways, including US99 from Olympia to Tacoma and US97 in Yakima. In 1937, the state highway system changed to a primary and secondary system. US410 remained the same, but its concurrent state highways had their designations changed by the state. State Road9 became Primary State Highway9 (PSH9), State Road1 and US99 became PSH1, State Road5 became PSH5, State Road3 became PSH3, and the Inland Empire Highway branch from Dayton to Clarkston became a branch of PSH3.|$|E
5|$|PA 106 was {{originally}} an alignment of PA47 designated in 1927. This alignment stretched from US 11 in Kingsley to the intersection with US 6 in Carbondale. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> for the U.S. Highway System from November 11, 1926, the road between Wyalusing and Carbondale {{was to be}} a part of US 6 while US 106 was to run from US 6 in Wyalusing to the New York border at the Delaware River in Narrowsburg via Scranton. By 1928, US 6 and US 106 switched alignments between Wyalusing and Carbondale. The piece of US 106 that is now PA 106 began in the community of Kingsley and went to the city of Carbondale. The route remained intact for almost 45 years. On December 3, 1971, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the elimination of the US 106 designation. On March 14, 1972, US 106 was decommissioned and replaced with PA 706 between US 6 in Wyalusing and US 11 south of New Milford, PA 106 between US 11 in Kingsley and US 6 in Carbondale, and PA 652 between US 6 in Indian Orchard and the Delaware River. The remainder of the route was removed from concurrencies with US 11 between south of New Milford and Kingsley and US 6 between Carbondale and Indian Orchard. Signs were changed by April of that year.|$|E
5|$|Porte {{kept the}} pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow {{member of the}} L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 when he could not climb Monte Grappa with the leaders on the day. On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began to creep back {{into the top of}} the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of the climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plan</b> de Corones time trial, closing his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E

5|$|Sound Transit {{revisited}} the routing issue during community {{meetings in}} 1997 and 1998, proposing an alternate route through Eastlake, South Lake Union, and the Seattle Center if engineering of the Capitol Hill tunnel would jeopardize the project's budget. The project's draft environmental impact statement, released in December 1998, {{determined that the}} Capitol Hill tunnel would be feasible and recommended its inclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> Sound Transit proposed that Capitol Hill's cut and cover station be located under Broadway south of East John Street, with several entrances to serve nearby Seattle Central Community College and the Broadway business district. From the station, trains would continue south to a station in First Hill before entering the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel; and north under Portage Bay to the western University District. An additional Capitol Hill station, near Broadway and East Roy Street, was proposed by Seattle representatives but {{left out of the}} preferred alternative due to cost concerns. In November 1999, Sound Transit finalized its preferred alternative, adding a crossover north of Capitol Hill station near East Thomas Street.|$|E
5|$|The M {{class was}} {{authorized}} by Plan Z in 1939, though design work started {{as early as}} 1936; these ships were intended {{to serve as the}} reconnaissance units for the commerce raiding squadrons envisioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> The Navy placed very high requirements for long range, heavy armament, armor proof against guns of the ships' caliber, and high speeds, which forced the designers to compromise crucial aspects of the design, including the armor and armament, both of which were too weak. This led the design staff to rework the plans for the last two ships to rectify some of these flaws. Work began on the first two ships in 1938, but the outbreak of war in September 1939 forced the Navy to abandon work on warships that could not be completed quickly. As a result, those two ships were scrapped and the remaining four were never laid down.|$|E
