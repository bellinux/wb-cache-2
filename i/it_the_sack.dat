50|$|The city soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a hotbed of anti-Savoy republican agitation. Genoa was the centre of an important reform movement that made constant pressure on Piedmont to grant freedom of the press and more liberal laws. The citizens of the republic could not stand the role of subjects of an absolute monarchy, wanting to be Italian rather than Piedmontese and relations with Piedmont improved with the war against Austria. However, after the defeat in the First War of Independence and the armistice of Salasco, the Genoese, fearing the loss of freedom and independence as a concequence of a peace imposed by Austria, rose up and hunted the Piedmontese garrison. After the uprising the troops of the general Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora moved against the city, besieged, bombarded and sacked <b>it</b> (<b>the</b> <b>Sack</b> of Genoa). With the rise of the Risorgimento movement, the Genoese turned their struggles from Giuseppe Mazzini's vision of a local republic into a struggle for a unified Italy under a liberalised Savoy monarchy. In 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi set out from Genoa with over a thousand volunteers to begin the conquest of Southern Italy among them was Nino Bixio. Today a monument is set on the rock where the patriot departed from, Quarto dei Mille.|$|E

60|$|Then {{he called}} all the tailors {{in the kingdom}} together, and made them sit down for {{fourteen}} days sewing at a sack. When it was finished, he made the strong man who had uprooted the trees take <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> {{on his shoulder and}} go with him to the King. Then the King said, 'What a powerful fellow that is, carrying that bale of linen as large as a house on his shoulder!' and he was much frightened, and thought 'What a lot of gold he will make away with!' Then he had a ton of gold brought, which sixteen of the strongest men had to carry; but the strong man seized it with one hand, put <b>it</b> in <b>the</b> <b>sack,</b> saying, 'Why don't you bring me more? That scarcely covers the bottom!' Then the King had to send again and again to fetch his treasures, which the strong man shoved into <b>the</b> <b>sack,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> was only half full.|$|R

Antoine Lancelot sent {{a report to the}} Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres concerning a sketch he had received about a work concerning William the Conqueror. He had no idea whether the original was a sculpture or painting though he mooted it could be a tapestry. Despite his further enquiries he discovered no more.|$|R

Given an analytic P-ideal I we investigate the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Sack,</b> <b>the</b> I-bounding, I-dominating and ω^ω-bounding properties of a given poset P.

50|$|All {{this came}} to an abrupt end on May 6, 1527, when the {{soldiers}} of Charles V entered the Leonine City and mercilessly plundered <b>it,</b> so starting <b>the</b> <b>Sack</b> of Rome.

60|$|The angry Scoodler at once {{picked off}} his head and hurled <b>it</b> at <b>the</b> Rainbow's Daughter; but the shaggy man was expecting that, and caught the head very neatly, putting <b>it</b> in <b>the</b> <b>sack,</b> which he tied at the mouth. The body of the guard, not having the eyes of its head to guide it, ran {{here and there in}} an aimless manner, and the shaggy man easily dodged <b>it</b> and opened <b>the</b> door. Fortunately {{there was no one in}} the big cave at that moment, so he told Dorothy and Polly to run as fast as they could for the entrance, and out across the narrow bridge.|$|R
5|$|The {{war ended}} with a peace treaty which {{confirmed}} the Bulgarian domination on the Balkans, restored the status of Bulgaria as a most favoured nation, abolished the commercial restrictions and obliged the Byzantine Empire to pay annual tribute. Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and Strandzha to Bulgaria. In exchange, the Bulgarians released the captured Byzantine soldiers and civilians, who were allegedly 120,000. The peace treaty remained in force until Leo VI's death in 912 although Simeon I did violate <b>it</b> following <b>the</b> <b>Sack</b> of Thessaloniki in 904, extracting further territorial concessions in Macedonia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{designation}} of the Empire as [...] "Byzantine" [...] is a retrospective idea: it began only in 1557, {{a century after}} the fall of Constantinople, when German historian Hieronymus Wolf published his work Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ, a collection of Byzantine sources. The term did not come in general use in the Western world before the 19th century , when modern Greece was born. The end of the continuous tradition of the Roman Empire is open to debate: the final point was the capture of Constantinople in 1453 AD, while some place <b>it</b> at <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> of Constantinople by the crusaders in 1204.|$|R

50|$|With all {{the claims}} presented, another note in <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> is opened. <b>It</b> reveals <b>the</b> stranger's plot and {{his desire for}} revenge.

50|$|Two brothers, one rich, one poor, {{served as}} soldiers, but the poor {{one had to}} become a farmer to escape his poverty.

The rich brother gave the king many great presents, and the king gave him the turnip in return. Angry, the rich brother hired murderers and lured his brother on a path, but when the murderers were going to hang the poor brother, they heard someone singing, and they threw the poor brother into a sack and hanged it, before running off. The poor brother worked a hole in <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> and saw <b>the</b> man, who was a student. He told him that <b>it</b> was <b>the</b> <b>Sack</b> of Knowledge, and he was learning marvelous things in <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> student asked to change places with him.

[...] To her surprise, however, Hemmingway tossed the blanket aside, and pointing to the floor, which was already filmed with water, ran to the still warm stove, detached it from its pipe, and threw <b>it</b> overboard. <b>The</b> <b>sack</b> of flour, bacon, molasses, and sugar, and all the heavier articles followed <b>it</b> into <b>the</b> stream. Relieved of their weight the cabin base rose {{an inch or two}} higher. Then he sat down and said, [...] "There! that may keep us afloat for that 'couple of hours' you speak of.

60|$|When we {{drew near}} to its frontiers {{messengers}} met us from Pharaoh bearing letters {{in answer to}} those which we had sent with the tidings of our coming. These contained little but ill news. <b>It</b> seemed that <b>the</b> Great King with a countless host had taken all the cities of the Delta and, after a long siege, had captured Memphis and put <b>it</b> to <b>the</b> <b>sack,</b> and that <b>the</b> army of Egypt, fighting desperately by land and upon the Nile was being driven southwards towards Thebes. Pharaoh added that he proposed to make his last stand at the strong city of Amada, since he doubted whether the troops from Lower Egypt would not rather surrender to the Easterns than retreat further up the Nile. He thanked and blessed us for our promised aid and prayed that it might come in time to save Egypt from slavery and himself from death.|$|R

John took the horse to bring <b>it</b> home, and <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> which <b>the</b> carpenter carried his tools in, to put <b>it</b> in. <b>The</b> carpenter went to work and made them benches and stools to sit on, such as the wood he could get would afford, and a kind of table to dine on.|$|R

50|$|The Bembine Tablet, the Bembine Table of Isis or the Mensa Isiaca (Isiac Tablet) is an {{elaborate}} tablet of bronze with enamel and silver inlay, most probably of Roman origin but imitating the ancient Egyptian style. It was {{named in the}} Renaissance after Cardinal Bembo, a celebrated antiquarian who acquired <b>it</b> after <b>the</b> 1527 <b>sack</b> of Rome. Thereafter it was used by antiquarians to penetrate the meaning of hieroglyphics, which were not authentically deciphered until the 19th century. Owing to these prior misconceptions, the tablet became of importance to western esoteric traditions.|$|R
50|$|The game starts {{when one}} player picks up <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> and tosses <b>it</b> to <b>the</b> chest of another player, who {{allows it to}} fall to his feet so he can kick it, and play begins.

The object {{of the game is}} to keep <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> off <b>the</b> ground for as long as possible. If every player gets a touch to <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> before <b>it</b> hits <b>the</b> ground, <b>it</b> is called a 'hack'.

Aimery, however, not knowing of the diversion to Constantinople, raided Egypt in advance of the expected invasion. Both Isabella and Aimery died in 1205 and again an underage girl, Isabella and Conrad's daughter Maria of Montferrat, became queen of Jerusalem. Isabella's half-brother John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut governed as regent until 1210 when Maria married an experienced French knight, John of Brienne. Maria died in childbirth in 1212, and John of Brienne continued to rule as regent for their daughter Isabella II.|$|R
