5|$|Since the Separatists are {{secretly}} {{building a}} battle droid army, Palpatine uses {{the situation to}} have himself granted <b>emergency</b> <b>powers.</b> Palpatine feigns reluctance to accept this authority, promising to {{return it to the}} Senate once the crisis has ended. His first act is to allow the creation of a clone army to counter the Separatist threat; this results in the opening salvo of the Clone Wars. With the galaxy now at war as Sidious planned, Dooku brings him the secret plans for a new superweapon.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{refused to}} hold the reunification elections, {{on the basis that}} the State of Vietnam was not a {{signatory}} to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself <b>emergency</b> <b>powers.</b> Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the {{government}} was involved in launching Gutt's monetary reform plan {{as well as the}} disarming of the resistance as part of the transition to stability. A major crisis emerged within {{the government}} over the refusal of the Front de l'Indépendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Armés (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through <b>emergency</b> <b>powers</b> allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} and technology demonstration requirements to achieve emergency-power capability for a civil helicopter are documented. The goal for <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> {{is the ability}} to hover with one engine inoperative, transition to minimum-power forward flight, and continue to a safe landing where <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> {{may or may not be}} required. The best method to obtain <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> is to augment the basic engine power by increasing the engine's speed and turbine-inlet temperature, combined with water-alcohol injection at the engine inlet. Other methods, including turbine boost power and flywheel energy, offer potential for obtaining <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> for minimum time durations. Costs and schedules are estimated for a {{research and}} development program to bring <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> through a hardware-demonstration test. Interaction of engine emergency-power capability with other helicopter systems is examined...|$|R

5000|$|With regular generators, an {{automatic}} transfer switch is used to connect <b>emergency</b> <b>power.</b> One side is connected to both the normal power feed and the <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> feed; {{and the other side}} is connected to the load designated as emergency. If no electricity comes in on the normal side, the transfer switch uses a solenoid to throw a triple pole, single throw switch. This switches the feed from normal to <b>emergency</b> <b>power.</b> The loss of normal power also triggers a battery operated starter system to start the generator, similar to using a car battery to start an engine. Once the transfer switch is switched and the generator starts, the building's <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> comes back on (after going off when normal power was lost.) ...|$|R

In times of public emergency, the Governor may exercise <b>emergency</b> <b>powers,</b> including the mobilization of these military forces. In the area of criminal justice, the Governor may grant pardons to criminals, commute the sentences of prisoners, or remit fines and forfeitures imposed on people who have been convicted, jailed, or fined for violations of state laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Mobutu {{launched}} a second coup d'état against {{the central government}} and took personal <b>emergency</b> <b>powers.</b> Once established as the sole source of political power, Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance. In 1967, to illustrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party under Mobutu's revised constitution. In 1971, the state was renamed Zaire and {{efforts were made to}} remove all colonial influences. He also nationalised the remaining foreign-owned economic assets in the country. By the time of its disestablishment, Zaire was characterised by widespread croneyism, corruption and economic mismanagement.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1970 a large protest {{took place}} outside the North Vietnamese and PRGSV embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops {{withdraw}} from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies {{and set them}} on fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, who was in Paris at the time, contemplated between returning to quell the situation, and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, thinking that he could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969. Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that night after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead. On 18March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume <b>emergency</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{emergency}} lights, {{emergency lighting}} {{is not a}} type of light fixture; it is a pattern of the building's normal lights that provides a path of lights to allow for safe exit, or lights up service areas such as mechanical rooms and electric rooms. Exit signs, Fire alarm systems (that are not on back up batteries) and the electric motor pumps for the fire sprinklers are almost always on <b>emergency</b> <b>power.</b> Other equipment on <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> may include smoke isolation dampers, smoke evacuation fans, elevators, handicap doors and outlets in service areas.

5|$|Sihanouk, {{hearing of}} the turmoil, headed for Moscow and Beijing in order to demand that the patrons of PAVN and the Viet Cong exert {{more control over their}} clients. On 18 March 1970, Lon Nol {{requested}} that the National Assembly vote {{on the future of the}} prince's leadership of the nation. Sihanouk was ousted from power by a vote of 92–0. Heng Cheng became president of the National Assembly, while Prime Minister Lon Nol was granted <b>emergency</b> <b>powers.</b> Sirik Matak retained his post as deputy prime minister. The new government emphasized that the transfer of power had been totally legal and constitutional and it received the recognition of most foreign governments. There have been, and continue to be, accusations that the U.S. government played some role in the overthrow of Sihanouk, but conclusive evidence has never been found to support them.|$|E

Once declared, the governor may exercise his or her additional <b>emergency</b> <b>powers.</b> At any time, the governor (through executive order) or the state legislature (through concurrent resolution) may declare an end to the state of emergency and suspend the governor's <b>emergency</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E
