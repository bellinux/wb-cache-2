The Saints' roster was reduced to 53 players, and Tolliver was among those cut.

The singing abilities of the cast (Chalke in particular) came under some fire, but most critics agreed that most were competent, and that anything beyond that simply did not matter. Reyes and Faison were the only members of the cast (besides the Broadway star D'Abruzzo) to receive praise for their singing abilities. In general, the final assessments were positive.

Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as the only Spurs members to earn the honor.

40|$|Focal {{epithelial}} hyperplasia <b>Heck</b> lesions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Turkish patient {{were shown}} to contain papillomavirus-specific DNA, which was molecularly cloned into bacteriophage lambda. It proved {{to be related to}} human papillomavirus (HPV) type 6 DNA and HPV type 11 DNA. Reassociation kinetics revealed <b>a</b> cross-hybridization <b>of</b> 4 and 3 %, respectively.
