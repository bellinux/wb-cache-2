40|$|In view of {{the recent}} {{recognition}} of widespread Late Paleozoic remagnetization f Devonian formations across North America, we undertook a reinvestigation f the Upper Devonian Perry Formation of coastal Maine and adjacent New Brunswick. Thermal <b>demagnetization</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> from the redbeds yielded a characteristic direction (D = 166 ° l = 4 °) that fails a fold test. Comparison of the corresponding paleopole (312 ° E, 41 °S) with previously published Paleozoic poles for North America suggests that the sediments were remagnetized in the Late Carboniferous. After the removal of a steep, northerly component, the volcanics also reveal a shallow and southerly direction (D = 171 °, 1 = 25 ° without tilt correction). No stability test is available to date the magnetization of the volcanics; however, similarity {{of several of the}} directions to those seen in the sediments raises the suspicion that the volcanics are also remagnetized. Although the paleopole without tilt correction (303 °E, 32 °S) could be taken to indicate an early Carboniferous age for the remagnetization, scatter in the data suggests that the directions are contaminated by the incomplete removal of a steeper component due to present-day field. Thus, {{it is more likely that}} the volcanics were remagnetized at the same time as the sediments. Isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition curves, blocking temperatures, coercivities and reflected light microscopy indicate that the magnetization is carried by hematite in the sediments and by both magnetite and hematite in the volcanics. It is therefore likely that the remagnetization f the Perry Formation involved both thermal and chemical processes related to the Variscan/Alleghenian orogeny. Ou...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{microscopic}} investigation {{of how the}} magnetic domain structure in ultrathin films changes after direct excitation by single ultrashort laser pulses. Using photoelectron emission microscopy in combination with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism in the resonant absorption of soft x rays, we find that individual laser pulses of ≈ 60 fs duration and a central wavelength of 800 nm lead to clear changes in the domain structure of a Co layer of three atomic monolayers thickness in an epitaxial Co/Cu/Ni trilayer on a Cu(001) single-crystal substrate.

40|$|Ancient remanences are {{retained}} by the Early Silurian (429 + 6 /- 5 Ma) mafic volcanics of the Springdale Caldera (five sites) and the overlying red beds (seven sites). Dual polarity magnetizations are obtained by thermal <b>demagnetization</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> {{from the red}} beds, whereas single polarity directions are observed in the volcanics. High unblocking temperatures indicate hematite as the remanence carrier in both the volcanics and sediments. These high-temperature, characteristic remanences are easily isolated and pass both the tilt and conglomerate tests; {{they are likely to}} be of primary Silurian age. Characteristic declinations are predominantly northerly and northeasterly, and indicate significant structural rotations on a local scale. When the results of the red beds and the volcanics are combined they show characteristic inclinations that are shallower than those of the correlative Botwood Group (ca. 36 [deg] vs. 43 [deg]) but not nearly as shallow as those reported from the King George IV Lake area (0. 5 [deg]). Mean inclinations obtained from the Springdale red beds are, however, significantly shallower than those of the Springdale volcanics. The same difference can be seen in other previous Silurian paleomagnetic studies of central Newfoundland. We infer that an inclination error affects the red bed magnetizations of the Springdale Group, Botwood Group (Wigwam Formation) and rocks of the King George IV Lake area. Therefore, the results from Silurian red beds should not be used to determine paleolatitudes for central Newfoundland. The mean paleolatitude of the Springdale Group volcanics is 30 [deg]. The mean paleolatitudes for both the Springdale volcanics and Botwood volcanics (Lawrenceton Formation) are indistinguishable within paleomagnetic error limits from the predicted paleolatitude of Newfoundland on the northeast-trending North American margin. Thus, no detectable post-Silurian displacement is shown by the volcanics of the Springdale Group with respect to cratonic North America...|$|R

The samples used in these experiments were approximately 1 -inch in diameter and 1 -inch in length and were oriented in the field using a sun compass. The lava flow (referred to as E 1) is 5 meters thick and the samples were drilled every half-meter through its thickness. The direction of the magnetic field immediately prior to the eruption of E 1, pointing steeply upward and NW is recorded by the underlying flow W 7. The field direction following the eruption of E 1, shallow and SE, is defined by a series of overlying lava flows all with the same paleomagnetic direction. All the lava flows formed during a polarity reversal of the geomagnetic field. The sample from nearest the flow base contains a single characteristic magnetization identical to that of the underlying flow. Seven samples from the interior of the flow contain composite magnetizations. The high temperature component (acquired first during cooling) is similar to the direction recorded by the flow base. The lower temperature components (acquired later as cooling progressed) drift closer to the direction of the overlying flow. The sample from the flow top was apparently completely remagnetized by the heat from the overlying flow. These paleomagnetic data are very similar to those gathered from Steens Mountain, Oregon. Steens Mountain data are interpreted as evidence for very rapid field change of 3 ? per day. If a similar rate is recorded by the Sheep Creek samples, then cooling from 680 ?C to 375 ?C took approximately 27 days...|$|R

The only other direction sometimes present is one aligned near to the present dipole field axis, notably as a high temperature component of reversed polarity in 7 samples (D = 177. 9 °, I = − 26. 9 °) obtained from 2 sites in weathered outcrop. The Upper Proterozoic to Cambrian (?) Mejeria red sandstone unit, equivalent to the Adrar CO 10, although apparently unweathered has multicomponent magnetization.

A high temperature component can be isolated in 11 samples but the directions are randomly distributed. Comparison of the Gneiguira paleopole with other middle to late Paleozoic poles from Africa and Australia suggests that either it represents a Carboniferous remagnetization or that the south paleomagnetic pole for Gondwana already was off southern Africa by the Devonian.

40|$|Marine {{rocks of}} the Santa Rosalía basin, Baja California Sur, were sampled {{in a pilot}} study to {{determine}} their suitability for magnetostratigraphy and geochronology {{with the goal of}} providing an age constraint on Gulf of California rifting. Progressive <b>demagnetization</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> from the Boleo Formation, the earliest marine sequence overlying the deeply eroded basement, reveals a high-coercivity characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) in addition to a low-coercivity overprint. The ChRM appears to be a primary magnetic remanence with stratigraphically bound normal- and reversed-polarity directions. A single ^(40) Ar/^(39) Ar isotopic age of 6. 76 ± 0. 90 Ma (2 σ) was obtained for the cinta colorada, a tephra deposit of reversed paleomagnetic polarity within the Boleo Formation. The age of the cinta colorada is refined by calculating isotopic age probabilities for each of the reversed-polarity intervals of the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) in the ± 2 σ range 5. 86 – 7. 66 Ma. The interval with the highest probability is 6. 57 – 6. 94 Ma. In conjunction with the isotopic age, preliminary magnetostratigraphy of the Boleo Formation is correlated with the GPTS in order to further delineate the onset of marine sedimentation. The most likely correlation yields an age of 6. 93 – 7. 09 Ma (GPTS subchron C 3 Bn) for the base of the Boleo Formation and 6. 14 – 6. 27 Ma for the top. This correlation, indicating an average sedimentation rate of 28 ± 4 cm/k. y., could be significantly altered if a more thorough magnetostratigraphy proved the existence of additional polarity intervals in the Boleo Formation. However, even if the isotopic age of the cinta colorada is used as the only age constraint, the result is consistent with data from the northern Gulf of California and shows that rifting started much earlier than the ca. 3. 6 Ma commencement of sea-floor spreading {{at the mouth of the}} Gulf of California. The deposition of the Boleo Formation was probably related to an early phase of gulf rifting caused by a change in Pacific–North American plate motions...|$|R

The change in pore water sulfate with depth in the sediment tends to be {{in step with the}} decrease in magnetization intensity, indicating the link between sulfate reduction and magnetite dissolution.

This Hauterivian pole from Egypt shows reasonable consistency with its coeval poles rotated from the main tectonic units to Northeast Africa. It reveals that in Early Cretaceous: 1. Northeast Africa was equatorial, lying just south the Equator. Cairo, which is now at 30 °N, was at − 1. 5 ° paleo-latitude. 2. The Azimuth of the African Plate was NE–SW, about 30 ° clockwise with respect to the present-dayN–S trend. Comparing this Hauterivian pole to that of the Wadi Natash basalts [107 ± 4 Ma], which was at [55 °N/ 250 °E] during the Albian, the African Plate seems to have rotated counter-clockwise about 10 ° with Northeast Africa moving northwards [Cairo was moving from 1. 5 °S to 1. 5 °N] within the equatorial zone, during the Early Cretaceous...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{magnetic}} properties <b>of</b> 22 <b>samples</b> from DSDP Leg 83 to determine the origin of remanence {{and its relationship to}} such problems as the tectonic and chemical evolution of the section, the depth of the magnetized layer, and the applicability of magnetic properties of ophiolites to the marine crust. The magnitude of natural remanence has fairly typical values in the uppermost part of the section, falls two to three orders of magnitude in the transition zone, and returns to values slightly less than the upper part in the dike complex. This behavior reflects, for the most part, variations in the amount of magnetic minerals present. Directional behavior is highly variable throughout the section and often shows complexity even on the level <b>of</b> a single <b>sample.</b> Curie temperature measurements and preliminary opaque petrography indicate that the remanence is chemical in origin and probably involves a resetting of the original thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) direction. Selective destructive <b>demagnetization</b> <b>of</b> four breccia <b>samples</b> shows that the remanence of the clasts was acquired prior to consolidation and did not change significantly thereafter. There are also indications that some of the remanence may be carried by secondary magnetic phases. A comparison <b>of</b> these <b>samples</b> with comparable ophiolite rocks is equivocal, with similarities in remanence characteristics but differences in magnetic mineralogy. As for magnetic anomalies, the transition zone is too weakly magnetized to contribute significantly. The available data on the dike complex are inconclusive and their contribution is still open to debate...|$|R
40|$|We present palaeomagnetic secular {{variation}} and relative palaeointensity estimates from multiple sediment cores {{recovered from a}} varved lake sediment sequence in Kalksjon, a lake in central west Sweden. Alternating field <b>demagnetization</b> <b>of</b> discrete <b>samples</b> reveals natural remanent magnetizations dominated by a stable, single component. Magnetic grain size indicators-which include Day plots and first-order reversal curves-indicate that the main carrier of the natural remanence is single-domain magnetite throughout the varved sequence, which extends to similar to 9200 cal. yr BP. The millennial-scale features of the Kalksjon relative palaeointensity, inclination and declination data are well matched against the Fennoscandian master curves FENNORPIS and FENNOSTACK, and a global dipole moment reconstruction curve. There is evidence, however, of environmental bias in the relative palaeointensity estimates during specific time intervals. We find that bias is particularly pronounced during the early Holocene, specifically between similar to 9000 and 7800 cal. yr BP. During this period the bias is apparent {{as a series of}} relative palaeointensity cycles, with a wavelength of similar to 300 years. Some bias is also evident between 7800 and 3200 cal. yr BP. By comparing Kalksjon's smoothed relative palaeointensity data with the reconstructed geomagnetic field intensity from C- 14 on timescales longer than 500 years-thereby removing the effect of relatively high frequency environmental bias in the early Holocene-we suggest that a distinct peak in intensity at centred on similar to 8700 cal. yr BP is a true feature of the geomagnetic field. A minimum at similar to 7400 cal. yr BP and a maximum at similar to 2500 cal. yr BP are also robust features. Our main conclusion is that sedimentary-based relative palaeointensity reconstructions must be carefully assessed if short-term, centennial variations are to be examined...|$|R

40|$|ODP Leg 199 was {{designated}} to collect sediments along a latitudinal transect in the Pacific Ocean {{to better understand}} Paleogene sedimentation patterns and the system of equatorial currents. At ODP Sites 1218 through 1220, the magnetic record of the Paleogene Equatorial sediments extends back to Polarity Chron C 20 r (Middle Eocene), providing an unprecedented record of Paleogene magnetostratigraphy in Equatorial Pacific sediments. Paleomagnetic data were acquired on the JOIDES-Resolution pass-through cryogenic magnetometer from archive halves of core sections. Ongoing analysis on u-channels corroborates the polarity pattern obtained on the shipboard magnetometer. Natural Remanent Magnetization was measured at 5 -cm intervals for each core section, and was followed by four to five steps <b>of</b> alternating field <b>demagnetization</b> up {{to a maximum of}} 15 or 20 mT. In addition, shipboard and shore-based measurements <b>of</b> discrete <b>samples</b> were also carried out, including alternating field and thermal demagnetization. All measured lithologies, including an upper red clay, radiolarian ooze and nannofossil ooze/chalk yield reproducible results and have a moderate magnetization intensity, well above the noise level of the cryogenic magnetometer. Stepwise <b>demagnetization</b> <b>of</b> discrete <b>samples</b> indicates that the Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) is stable and well defined for the most part of the sedimentary record. The obtained high-resolution magnetic stratigraphy allows to cross-calibrate magnetic reversal stratigraphy with biostratigraphy, including the placement of the Eocene-Oligocene and Oligocene-Miocene boundaries. Overall, results from Leg 199 provide the first complete magnetobiostratigraphic record for the Middle Eocene through the Pliocene in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean. A particularly important aspect of Leg 199 was to establish the latitudinal plate motion of the Equatorial Pacific, based on paleomagnetic data. ChRM directions for the demagnetized discrete samples are used to construct the paleolatitudinal evolution of Leg 199 sites. A progressive northward displacement of the Pacific Plate in the Paleogene, which places the equatorial mound of biogenic sediment in northern latitudes and moves sediments out of the high sediment flux area, is established from the analysis of paleomagnetic inclinations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceExcursions of the {{geomagnetic}} field are likely even more frequent than reversals and thus {{must be seen}} as a major characteristic of the geodynamo. The Laschamp event discovered in lava flows of Massif central (France) is the youngest and the most studied field excursion. Its geomagnetic origin has been controversial due to the existence of self-reversal processes. Taking advantage of new dated sites, the initial aim of this work was to find additional flows with intermediate or reverse directions but also to investigate the magnetic properties of normal polarity flows surrounding the event. This study combines thermal and alternating field <b>demagnetization</b> <b>of</b> 272 <b>samples</b> from 21 units including 12 new localities and 12 K–Ar datings of main units. No new site with intermediate or reverse polarity was found. Ten sites have a normal polarity and all sites studied at Olby, Louchadière and Royat display intermediate but scattered directions. Magnetic mineralogy is characterized by primary titanomagnetite, variable amounts of titanomaghemite and almost pure magnetite. We confirmed that reverse polarity flows are affected by self-reversals but we found that this is also the case for normal flows. A direct consequence is that self-reversals cannot be taken as responsible for the reverse directions but they likely contribute to generate dispersion. However the overall coherency of the directions indicates that this process was limited and despite complex magnetization, the geomagnetic origin of the Laschamp in the Chaîne des Puys is not questioned. All volcanic pole positions (VGPs) published so far show significant scatter but they remain consistent with each other. Interestingly, they do not coincide with the longitudinal loops seen in the sedimentary records and are compatible with a dominant non-dipolar field geometry. New K–Ar datings provide a coherent chronology of the successive polarities. The 37 ka old reverse directions of the Olby flow are chronologically consistent with the 41. 9 kyr old normal polarity flows preceding the event. The Royat flow is only marginally intermediate and indicates {{that the end of the}} event was not younger than 33. 3 ka in the Chaîne des Puys...|$|R
