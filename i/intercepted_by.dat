5|$|After the Georgia kickoff, Glennon {{was again}} <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> Tony Taylor, who earned his second {{interception}} {{on the day}} and created Glennon's third turnover. Taylor returned the ball 16yards to the Tech one-yard line, setting up an easy touchdown for the Bulldogs. With 6:54 remaining, Georgia took a 31–21 lead over Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|The USAAF XIX Tactical Air Command had {{established}} a strong presence in northeast France and was supporting the U.S. 3rd Army. JG 53 was to knock out its airfields. Some 26 Bf 109s took off but were <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> 12 P-47s of the 367th Fighter Squadron, 358th Fighter Group. The P-47s claimed 13 destroyed, one probable and six damaged for no losses. On the way home at 09:20, III./JG 53 were <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> 366th Fighter Squadron. Altogether, III./JG 53 lost 10 Bf 109s and one damaged to the 358th Fighter Group. Of the 25 III./JG 53 Bf 109s that took part, 11 were shot down representing 40% of the attacking force.

5|$|Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, {{the letter}} was <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> {{government}} spies and copied before being sent to its destination.

5|$|Alabama started spring {{practice}} on March 16 and concluded 15 practices later on April 20 with the annual A-Day game. In the annual A-Day {{game at the}} conclusion of spring practice, the White team composed of offensive starters defeated the Crimson team of defensive starters 17–14. The White team opened on offense and scored a touchdown on their first possession on a 40-yard AJ McCarron pass to Kenny Bell. After Nick Perry intercepted a Blake Sims pass on the first Crimson possession, the White team extended their lead to 10–0 on a 29-yard Adam Griffith field goal. Both offenses then struggled {{for the remainder of the}} first half with turnovers for the Crimson team coming on a second Perry interception of a Sims pass, an Alec Morris fumble recovered by Dillon Lee, and on a Cooper Bateman pass <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> Landon Collins. The White team had turnovers on a Kenny Bell fumble recovered by C. J. Mosley and on the last play of the first half when a McCarron pass was <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> Vinnie Sunseri and returned 86-yards for a touchdown that made the halftime score 10–7.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the application to Mediterranean stocks {{of a set}} of model-based indicators, being developed for monitoring the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The work constitutes an application of the methodology, as such the results should not be used as representative of the CFP implementation in the Mediterranean. This document is mainly constituted of R code, showing how the indicators can be computed and presenting a set of diagnostics and stability tests. The models tested were a linear model, a linear mixed effects model with random <b>intercept</b> <b>by</b> stock, a GAMM with random <b>intercept</b> <b>by</b> stock and a GAMM with random <b>intercept</b> <b>by</b> Mediterranean GSA and species. The stability tests were designed to evaluate the estimates of recent (2003 - 2013) time series of trends in SSB and annual mean values of F/Fmsy.

5|$|Bahadur Shah (—) (14 October 1643–27 February 1712), {{the seventh}} Mughal emperor of India, ruled from 1707 {{until his death}} in 1712.

From 1696 to 1707, he was governor of Akbarabad (later known as Agra), Kabul and Lahore.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Malaysian Marine Police boats {{entered the}} waters around Pedra Branca on several occasions. However, both Malaysia and Singapore acted with restraint, the Singapore Navy having been given strict {{instructions}} not to escalate matters. In 1989, the then Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad made an unannounced {{visit to the}} vicinity of the island. His boat was <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> Singapore naval vessels.

50|$|Illegitimate {{receivers}} {{can benefit}} <b>by</b> <b>intercepting</b> signals to locate prey, or, {{if they are}} parasites or parasitoids, <b>by</b> <b>intercepting</b> signals to locate host organisms. In addition to locating prey <b>by</b> <b>intercepting</b> signals given <b>by</b> the prey organism, some animals use the signals of other predators to find carcasses that they can scavenge off of. Other organisms benefit by illegitimately receiving the signals of rivals and using this information to improve their own chances of winning in competition for resources, including mates.|$|R
50|$|The ship uses SharpEye I-Band (X-band) and E/F-Band (S-band) radars from Kelvin Hughes with MantaDigital {{tactical}} display software.

5|$|Ivall's Cottage, a Grade II listed {{building}} since 1985, is located opposite the post box {{near the village}} green. The cottage was originally built during the 16th century, with late 18th century and early 19th century additions with contemporary extensions at the sides. The cottage is built from red brick and flint in Flemish bond, with cambered openings {{on the ground floor}} with a part-thatched, part-tiled roof.

5|$|Leg before wicket (lbw) {{is one of}} {{the ways}} in which a batsman can be {{dismissed}} in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> any part of the batsman's body (except the hand holding the bat). The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E
5|$|Leigh-Mallory {{claimed the}} Big Wings had {{destroyed}} entire formations of enemy aircraft upon seeing them. He even claimed the RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements. In the afternoon battle, {{he claimed that}} the Wing could not get into position {{to break up the}} bombers in time and was <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> German fighters. Still, while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further 40. He claimed another 18 damaged for the loss of 14 and six pilots.|$|E

5|$|On 22 January 1945 Z31, Z34 and Z38 laid {{mines in}} Magerøya, Laafjord, and Brei Sounds. On 25 January, Z31, Z34, and Z38 sailed out of Tromsø, making for the Baltic. On 28 January, while off the Sognefjord, the three destroyers were <b>intercepted</b> <b>by</b> a {{squadron}} of British ships, including the light cruisers Diadem, and Mauritius. During the battle, one of Z38s funnels caught fire, splitting a boiler tube. After this Z38 broke off from the battle, and made for Kiel alongside Z34.

5|$|On 9 July the Allies invaded Sicily in Operation Husky.
