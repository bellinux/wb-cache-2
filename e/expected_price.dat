5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Genesis, Sega's Consumer Products Research and Development Labs led by manager Tomio Takami were tasked with {{creating}} a CD-ROM add-on for the system, which became the Sega CD. The Sega CD was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much random-access memory (RAM), and sell for about JP¥20,000 (or US$150). In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami's team planned for the device to feature hardware scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega's arcade games, which required the use of a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP). However, two changes made later in development contributed to the final unit's higher than <b>expected</b> <b>price.</b> Because the Genesis' Motorola 68000 CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD's new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated into the add-on. In addition, upon hearing rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to the TurboGrafx-CD, which would bring its available RAM from 0.5 Mbit to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega decided to increase the Sega CD's available RAM from 1 Mbit to 6 Mbit. This proved {{to be one of the}} greatest technical challenges during development since the Genesis' access speed was initially too slow to run programs effectively. The cost of the device was now estimated at $370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers would be willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art machine. Sega partnered with JVC, which had been working with Warner New Media to develop a CD player under the CD+G standard, to develop the Sega CD.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of his}} {{preparations}} for the Perryville offensive, General Braxton Bragg divided Mississippi into several commands: Major General Earl Van Dorn was given command of the District of the Mississippi, centered in Vicksburg, and Major General Sterling Price was given the District of the Tennessee, covering northwestern Mississippi and northeastern Alabama. Bragg <b>expected</b> <b>Price</b> to prevent the Union forces of Ulysses S. Grant and William Rosecrans in western Tennessee from reinforceing the Union forces in Kentucky, and expected Van Dorn to cooperate with Price. Price interpreted Bragg's orders as to mean {{that he was to}} attack the Union forces. Van Dorn, however, choose to move against the Union forces threatening Vicksburg and launched an attack on Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which failed; he then proposed a joint attack with Price on Corinth. Price by this time had decided not to wait for Van Dorn but moved against Iuka, capturing the town on September 14. Two Union columns, commanded by Grant and Rosecrans, converged on Iuka on September 19; Price attacked Rosecrans' force and due to poor communications and an acoustic shadow Grant failed to attack in concert. When he discovered that Grant was approaching from the northwest, Price decided to retreat before he was surrounded.|$|E

S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and others who analyze and forecast ag-ricultural production. Soybeans are an important crop in all major farming regions east of the Great Plains, including the northeastern United States. Northeast acreage of soybeans has increased faster than the area of grains since 1970 and now ranks second to corn grain in acreage among major field crops (Figure 1). Soybean production in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania more than tripled from 10. 6 million bushels in 1970 to 37. 7 million in 1989, doubling the region’s share of U. S. production from 1 % to 2 %. Most previous research on soybean acreage re-sponse used crop prices as explanatory variables in acreage response equations, For example, Gard-ner used corn and soybean futures prices and the previous (lagged) season-average prices as proxies for <b>expected</b> <b>prices</b> in soybean acreage response equations.

The outside-sample performance of the model is tested against the pure time-series model used to formulate <b>expected</b> <b>prices,</b> and is shown to have a smaller mean square error than that of the time-series model. Thus the model provides comparatively efficient forecasts and, unlike models constructed in their reduced form, permits consideration of key behavioral relationships in commodity markets.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} sequential auctions where an individual’s value for {{a bundle of}} objects is either {{greater than the sum}} of the values for the objects separately (positive synergy) or less than the sum (negative synergy). We show that the existence of positive synergies implies declining <b>expected</b> <b>prices.</b> When synergies are negative, <b>expected</b> <b>prices</b> are increasing. There are several corollaries. First, the seller is indi¤erent between selling the objects simultaneously as a bundle or sequentially when synergies are positive. Second, when synergies are negative, the expected revenue generated by the simultaneous auction can be larger or smaller than the expected revenue generated by the sequential auction. In addition, in the presence of positive synergies, an option to buy the additional object at the price of the …rst object is never exercised in the symmetric equilibrium and the seller’s revenue is unchanged. Under negative synergies, in contrast, if there is an equilibrium where the option is never exercised, then equilibrium prices may either increase or decrease and, therefore, the net e¤ect on the seller’s revenue of the introduction of an option is ambiguous. Finally, we examine two special cases with asymmetric players. In the …rst case, players have distinct synergies. In this example, even if one player has positive synergies and the other has negative synergies, it is still possible for <b>expected</b> <b>prices</b> to decline. In the second case, one player wants two objects and the remaining players want one object each. For this example, we show that <b>expected</b> <b>prices</b> may not necessarily decrease as predicted by Branco (1997). The reason is that players with singleunit demand will generally bid less than their true valuations in the …rst period. Therefore, there are two opposing forces; the reduction in the bid of the player with multiple-demand in the last auction and less aggressive bidding in the …rst auction by the players with single-unit demand...|$|R
