Common formulations of the clique problem include <b>finding</b> a maximum clique (a clique with the largest possible number of vertices), <b>finding</b> a maximum weight clique in a weighted graph, listing all maximal cliques (cliques that cannot be enlarged), and solving the decision problem of testing whether a graph contains a clique larger than a given size.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background As neurophysiologic tests may {{not reveal}} the extent of brachial plexus injury at the early stage, the role of early {{radiological}} work-up has become increasingly important. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the concordance between the radiological and clinical <b>findings</b> with the intraoperative <b>findings</b> in adult patients with brachial plexus injuries. Methods Seven consecutive male patients (median age 33; range 15 - 61) with brachial plexus injuries, caused by motor cycle accidents in 5 / 7 patients, who underwent extensive radiological work-up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography myelography (CT-M) or both were included in this retrospective study. A total of 34 spinal nerve roots were evaluated by neuroradiologists at two different occasions. The degree of agreement between the radiological <b>findings</b> of every individual nerve root and the intraoperative <b>findings</b> was estimated by calculation of kappa coefficient (К-value). Using the operative <b>findings</b> as a gold standard, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the clinical <b>findings</b> and the radiological <b>findings</b> were estimated. Results The diagnostic accuracy of radiological <b>findings</b> was 88 % compared with 65 % for the clinical <b>findings.</b> The concordance between the radiological <b>findings</b> and the intraoperative <b>findings</b> was substantial (К = 0. 76) compared with only fair (К = 0. 34) for the clinical <b>findings.</b> There were two false positive and two false negative radiological <b>findings</b> (sensitivity and PPV of 0. 90; specificity and NPV of 0. 87). Conclusions The advanced optimized radiological work-up used showed high reliability and substantial agreement with the intraoperative <b>findings</b> in adult patients with brachial plexus injury. </p...|$|R
