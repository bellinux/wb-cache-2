In particular, the paper considers the benefits such web pages might have in terms of research ethics and argues that research project <b>Home</b> <b>Pages</b> can provide a very straightforward, practical means of addressing a number of ethical issues related to both on-line and off-line research. Limitations to the use of research project <b>Home</b> <b>Pages</b> are also discussed and conclusions are drawn about the value of establishing appropriately designed research project <b>Home</b> <b>Pages</b> as an integral component of social research protocols. <b>Home</b> <b>Pages,</b> Research Governance, Research Ethics, Internet Research...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} my {{dissertation}} research on personal <b>home</b> <b>pages.</b> It {{focuses on the}} design of AniAniWeb, a server-based system for authoring personal <b>home</b> <b>pages.</b> AniAniWeb builds on a wiki foundation to address many of the limitations of static technologies used to author personal <b>home</b> <b>pages.</b> This article motivates the technical hypotheses behind AniAniWeb and reflects on these hypotheses, based on a two year study of adopters using AniAniWeb in academia, a prominent vocational setting where personal <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> are important. In particular, I reflect on two broad categories: 1) the usefulness of wiki features (wiki authoring, wiki mark-up, and interaction / collaboration) to authoring personal home pages; 2) the other features (structure, designing looks, and access control) needed to make a wiki approach to personal <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> viable...|$|R

Interestingly, the shippers did not address their environmental requirements on LSPs on their general <b>home</b> <b>pages,</b> but rather on their specific environmental or CSR <b>home</b> <b>pages,</b> and in their environmental/CSR reports.|$|R

In May 2013, YouTube {{launched a}} pilot program to begin offering some content providers the ability to charge $0.99 per month or more for certain channels, but the vast majority of its videos would remain free to view. In February 2014, Susan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube.|$|E
5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a <b>home</b> <b>page</b> on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a study of visual, verbal and visual-verbal {{communication}} on the <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> of three English-language online newspapers from different national cultures. Important similarities in the visual-verbal structure of news stories and <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> between the three newspapers are identified. Each newspaper demonstrates a similar tendency towards atomization of news texts with which readers interact over short time scales, and a tendency towards greater consistency in the visual-verbal design of news across longer timescales.

Although commerce and marketing functions are growing, they may be of minor importance in the evolving Internet strategies of corporations. The research presented here examined the functions of corporate <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> in the United States, Germany, and Japan, guided by theories in management studies and communications technology research. Results suggest that image creation rather than marketing, cost control, stakeholder relations, or disclosure is the major function of corporate <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> in each of the countries studied. This raises the question of why image creation is so important. ...|$|R

30|$|The <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> have, as {{described}} above, {{the potential to}} illustrate {{a wide spectrum of}} environmental practices as offered and required on the logistics market. This is mainly due to their potential to reach a large number of stakeholders (see, e.g. [4]). However, an analysis based only on <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> clearly lacks the fuller picture that a case study provides [1]. In order to take another type of stakeholder perspective, namely a very clear relationship perspective including only LSPs and shippers, the research for this paper also includes a case study. The two differing perspectives of <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> and cases were believed to offer deeper insight into environmental practices as parts of offerings and requirements than would the methods do alone.|$|R
