I have had no claims to make, only that I am instructed that I am the Lord's messenger... Early in my youth I was asked several times, Are you a prophet? I have ever responded, I am the Lord's messenger. I know that many have called me a prophet, but I have made no claim to this title." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know, but {{hoped it}} might be the next-door dog.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and {{proceeded}} to hint {{that it would be}} advisable for him to go below now and take a rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you do not}} understand," [...] she answered, {{smiling at}} him. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish to be}} forgotten. Only--just at that moment, it sounded natural enough--and today--I think that I am a little ashamed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} idea of {{falling in love with}} him. In spite of what <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope that <b>I</b> can help it. And then I feel to him just as though he were my brother. I've got almost to know what it would be to have a brother." ...|$|R
60|$|Bun. <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> Because <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not find}} it {{commanded}} in the Word of God.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know, but {{we could}} try a dog and see. So he sent out an aide-de-camp to give the order to add the dog.|$|E
6000|$|... "What could I say? Of course <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know. I {{suppose he}} was meditating whether you would live here {{and ask him}} to dinner on Sundays!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not see how}} a {{blind man}} could be a guide: but at that he laughed aloud, and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle.|$|E
60|$|Bun. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{desire to}} demean {{myself in the}} world, both as becometh {{a man and a}} Christian.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not think}} this {{too much for}} twelve hours, if the {{intellectual}} character of the entertainment was correspondingly high.|$|R
6000|$|There, without doubt, was old Brother John with {{a wreath}} of flowers--I noted in disgust {{that they were}} orchids--hanging in a bacchanalian fashion from his dinted sun-helmet over his left eye. He was in a furious rage and reviling Bausi, who {{literally}} crouched before him, and I was in a furious rage and reviling him. What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not remember, but he said, his white beard bristling with indignation while he threatened Bausi with {{the handle of the}} butterfly net: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand." [...] The {{feeling of}} having scored a point made Derek {{feel a little}} better. [...] "I admit it. Your {{behaviour}} is incomprehensible. Where did you meet this fellow?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand, and he {{said what}} he wanted was my true name, for he guessed I picked up this one since I stole my last chickens. They all laughed loudly at that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, miss, my {{brother-in-law}} brought it home, {{and told me}} it was just a scrap that was left over, and he was free to have, though <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wonder the lady did not want to keep it in case of an accident happening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am full of {{imaginary}} tortures,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} <b>I</b> {{could be any}} more uncomfortable if they were real ones. What must <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{to get rid of}} them?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Four or {{five weeks}} later, Al {{comes over to}} me and says, When {{are you going to do}} the next fold-in? And <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> have another fold-in. That was it! So he said, Come on, you can come up with {{something}} else. I wracked my brain, and the only thing I could come up with was Nixon face was hidden within curtain folds. That one really set the tone for what the cleverness of the fold-ins has to be. It couldnt just be bringing someone from the left to kiss someone on the right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see where}} the joke comes in there either!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel {{particularly}} pleased with him for saying such things. He laid {{his hand on my}} arm, and said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{answered}} Barton, {{his voice}} sinking to {{a tone of}} reluctant horror--"well, your poor friend was murdered! That's what I meant when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not blame the jury; they could have given no other verdict than they did on the evidence of my partner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He damned {{himself if}} he did not love an Irish drummer better than any of the breed. [...] "The Prince has no more religion," [...] said this pious enthusiast, [...] "than one of my coach-horses." [...] . He asked me if I knew Jemmy Dawkins. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not. [...] "He could give you an account of them," [...] said he, [...] "but Lord Marischal has given the true {{character}} of the Prince, and certified under his hand to the people of England what a scoundrel he is {297} [...] . The Prince had the canaille of Scotland to assist him, thieves, robbers, and the like. [...] "' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{three o'clock}} {{on the morning}} of the twenty-first of June, we were awakened and {{notified}} that the Azores islands were in sight. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not take any interest in islands at three o'clock in the morning. But another persecutor came, and then another and another, and finally believing that the general enthusiasm would permit no one to slumber in peace, I got up and went sleepily on deck. It was five and a half o'clock now, and a raw, blustering morning. The passengers were huddled about the smoke-stacks and fortified behind ventilators, and all were wrapped in wintry costumes and looking sleepy and unhappy in the pitiless gale and the drenching spray.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} didn't mean to shoot Mr. Stubbs," [...] said Toby, with {{moistening}} {{eyes as he}} spoke of his pet, [...] "an' I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{to you in the}} woods." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] he said. [...] "I say, I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> about lying. <b>I</b> {{was rather}} sick {{that you should}} think I wrote that rot you showed me. I hope you don't mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} German, but Mrs. Colesworthy knows the language well, and, {{stepping up to}} the man, she said (she afterward told me {{the meaning of the}} words that passed between them): [...] "Are you Dr. Hildstein?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't, {{but that}} doesn't count," [...] {{answered}} Harry. [...] "We {{have to follow}} it, anyway. I remember when I got my first deer. Dad was with me, and before I fired he asked if I thought I could hit it where I wanted. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> {{and he told me}} to make sure, because if the beast got away with a bullet in it I'd have to trail it until it dropped." [...] He stopped with a significant laugh. [...] "As it happened, we followed it close on three hours, through the thickest kind of bush, and--I wasn't so big then--it was mighty hard work {{to get back to the}} ranch afterward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did {{not seem}} to mind much," [...] the {{merchant}} said. [...] "Horses are good and abundant in Navarre, and when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not like to take advantage of his strait, he only laughed and said he had three or four others as good at home. He did say, though, {{that he would like to}} know if it was to be in good hands. I assured him that on that ground he need not fear; for that I had bought it for a young gentleman, nearly related to the Countess de Laville. He said that was well, and seemed glad, indeed, that it was not to be ridden by one of the brigands into whose hands he fell." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the report}} of the pistol both Mr. Langely and Mr. White came running to where I was, and I {{explained}} the suspicious circumstances to them, whereupon Mr. Langely suggested that {{it might have been a}} shark that I had seen, vast quantities of which voracious animals dwell in those and the neighboring waters. I did not controvert what he said, although I knew beyond a doubt that it was a craft of some sort which I had discovered--possibly a canoe, for the dip of the paddle, which I had distinctly seen in the phosphorescence of the water, appeared first upon the one side of the wake and then upon the other, as the blade was dipped into the water from side to side; so although, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not undertake to controvert Mr. Langely's opinion, I was mightily discomposed in my own mind concerning the business.|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand, Sir John; but, as <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} {{we should all be}} told until the blow is ready to be struck, as they would be afraid that some one might inform against them, if time and {{opportunity}} were granted them." ...|$|R
6000|$|De Stancy entered saying, 'I have ridden across for ten minutes, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> would <b>do,</b> {{to know if}} {{everything}} is easy and straightforward for you. There will be time {{enough for me to}} get back and prepare if I start shortly. Well?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well!' cried Tom, 'I {{am glad to}} hear it; I am overjoyed to hear it. I am {{sure there}} is not, when you say so in that manner. You won't take it ill, John, that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> just now!' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} buy a diploma for an invalid friend at home who had never traveled, and whose desire all his life has been to ascend Mont Blanc, but the Guide-in-Chief rather insolently refused to sell me one. I was very much offended. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not propose to be {{discriminated}} against on the account of my nationality; {{that he had just}} sold a diploma to this German gentleman, and my money was a good as his; I would see to it that he couldn't keep his shop for Germans and deny his produce to Americans; I would have his license taken away from him at the dropping of a handkerchief; if France refused to break him, I would make an international matter of it and bring on a war; the soil should be drenched with blood; and not only that, but I would set up an opposition show and sell diplomas at half price.|$|E
6000|$|... "There again! Another {{stick of}} the penknife, when she pretended to pat my head: {{and that is}} because <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not like the society of {{children}} and old women (low be it spoken!). No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" [...] and {{he pointed to the}} prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head: [...] "and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old as you, I was a feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one sentient point {{in the middle of the}} lump. Yes: does that leave hope for me?" ...|$|E
60|$|The third {{dream was}} the most {{interesting}} and personal. Some one came to me {{to ask me to}} help in the deliverance of a company of Italian prisoners who were to be ransomed for money. I said I had no money. They answered, Yes, I had some that belonged to me as a brother of St. Francis, if I would give it up. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know even that I was a brother of St. Francis; but I thought to myself, that perhaps the Franciscans of Fésole, whom I had helped to make hay in their field in 1845, had adopted me for one; only I didn't see how the consequence of that would be my having any money. However, I said they were welcome to whatever I had; and then I heard the voice of an Italian woman singing; and I have never heard such divine singing before nor since;--the sounds absolutely strong and real, and the melody altogether lovely. If I could have written it! But I could not even remember it when I woke,--only how beautiful it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I can't {{say that}} I forgive her. How {{is a man}} to forgive such treatment? If <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> you wouldn't believe me. I will keep out of her way, {{and that will be}} better for her than {{forgiving}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> never <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was, <b>did</b> <b>I?</b> And Friday ain't all, neither. I had {{a rotten}} bad dream last night--dreampt about rats." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{turns out}} that Machree is innocent, {{evidenced}} by his confession, 'I didn't <b>do</b> nothing... <b>I</b> didn't <b>do</b> nothing! Like <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>do</b> nothing!'. Because of this, Daffy and Porky are sentenced to twenty {{years in prison for}} false arrest (thirty years actually, as Porky states so afterwards).|$|R
