40|$|Abstract: Durability {{and stress}} injury of {{concrete}} bridge were increasingly prominent {{on the bridge}} structure now, the use and safety performances of bridge have been significantly affected. "Applicable <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> configuration " can effectively solve these problems, "applicable <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> " include durability, mechanical properties, enforceability and economy. Impact factors of applicable <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> configuration structural include environmental, vehicle load and material. Combined with the meaning and impact factors of applicable <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> configuration, the proportion of main configurations in whole configurations of concrete bridge {{and the weight of}} various factors were identified, and the contents and methods of applicable <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> configuration were determined, which laid the foundation for study of applicable <b>and</b> <b>durable</b> configurations of concrete bridge...|$|R

5|$|The Pro-Line {{series was}} <b>durable</b> <b>and</b> fault-tolerant, with many models lasting for years. However, because they used {{solid-state}} amplifiers, {{they are not}} as highly regarded as the older tube-based Leslies, because they lack the characteristic sound when the amp is overdriven.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{economic}} foundations of Byzantium was trade, fostered by the maritime character of the Empire. Textiles must have been {{by far the most}} important item of export; silks were certainly imported into Egypt, and appeared also in Bulgaria, and the West. The state strictly controlled both the internal and the international trade, and retained the monopoly of issuing coinage, maintaining a <b>durable</b> <b>and</b> flexible monetary system adaptable to trade needs.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{beautification}} plan for the Midway Plaisance, Time was constructed from {{a new type of}} molded, steel-reinforced concrete that was claimed to be more <b>durable</b> <b>and</b> cheaper than alternatives. It was said to be the first of any kind of finished work of art made of concrete. Before the completion of Millennium Park in 2004, it was considered the most important installation in the Chicago Park District. Time is one of several Chicago works of art funded by Benjamin Ferguson's trust fund.|$|E

Later, in times of Casimir III the Great, there was also a visible division between the old voivodeships of Poznań and Kalisz.|$|E
5|$|A real {{physical}} tessellation is a tiling made {{of materials}} such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing <b>durable</b> <b>and</b> water-resistant pavement, floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art {{such as in the}} decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.|$|E

5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be <b>durable</b> <b>and</b> hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} the Rova's {{buildings}} possessed unique design features. The modest wood building then known as Manjakamiadana was also called Felatanambola ("Silver Hands") for the hand-shaped sculptures crafted from melted silver piastres and attached {{to each of the}} building's four tandrotrano (roof horns)—an architectural design element formed from the crossed gable beams that extended past the roof line of all traditional aristocratic Merina houses. Felatanambola's decorative silver hands were later affixed to the roof horns of Besakana. Another distinctive building from this period was called Bevato ("Many Stones") because its foundation was atypically composed of stone blocks. Manatsara was said to be the most well constructed of the many houses because it was built using ambora (Tambourissa parrifolia), an extremely <b>durable</b> <b>and</b> rot-resistant indigenous hardwood, rather than a traditional wood called hazomena (Weinmannia rutenbergii). According to oral history, Manatsara was treasured by Andrianampoinimerina and the house was quite old but still well preserved in the mid-19th century when Queen RanavalonaI decided to recover its interior walls with wood taken from Sihanaka country.|$|E
