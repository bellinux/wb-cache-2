5000|$|Inverted repeats {{are often}} {{described}} as [...] "hotspots" [...] of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomic instability. Long inverted repeats are deemed to greatly influence {{the stability of the}} genome of various organisms. This is exemplified in E. coli, where genomic sequences with long inverted repeats are seldom replicated, but rather deleted with rapidity. Again, the long inverted repeats observed in yeast greatly favor recombination within the same and adjacent chromosomes, resulting in an equally very high rate of deletion. Finally, a very high rate of deletion and recombination were also observed in mammalian chromosomes regions with inverted repeats. Reported differences in the stability of genomes of interrelated organisms are always an indication of a disparity in inverted repeats. The instability results from the tendency of inverted repeats to fold into hairpin- or cruciform-like DNA structures. These special structures can hinder or confuse DNA replication and other genomic activities. Thus, inverted repeats lead to special configurations in both RNA and DNA that can ultimately cause mutations and disease.The illustration shows an inverted repeat undergoing cruciform extrusion. DNA in the region of the inverted repeat unwinds and then recombines, forming a four-way junction with two stem-loop structures. The cruciform structure occurs because the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> self-pair to each other on their own strand.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the SBTS {{is similar to the}} Tn5 transposon system, however the enzyme and gene sequences are eukaryotic in nature as opposed to prokaryotic. The system's tranposase can act in trans as well as in cis, allowing a diverse collection of transposon structures. The transposon itself is flanked by <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences,</b> which are each repeated twice in a direct fashion, designated IR/DR sequences. The internal region consists of the gene or sequence to be transposed, and could also contain the transposase gene. Alternatively, the transposase can be encoded on a separate plasmid or injected in its protein form. Yet another approach is to incorporate both the transposon and the transposase genes into a viral vector, which can target a cell or tissue of choice. The transposase protein is extremely specific in the sequences that it binds, and is able to discern its IR/DR sequences from a similar sequence by three base pairs. Once the enzyme is bound to both ends of the transposon, the IR/DR sequences are brought together and held by the transposase in a Synaptic Complex Formation (SCF). The formation of the SCF is a checkpoint ensuring proper cleavage. HMGB1 is a non-histone protein from the host which is associated with eukaryotic chromatin. It enhances the preferential binding of the transposase to the IR/DR sequences and is likely essential for SCF complex formation/stability. Transposase cleaves the DNA at the target sites, generating 3' overhangs. The enzyme then targets TA dinucleotides in the host genome as target sites for integration. The same enzymatic catalytic site which cleaved the DNA is responsible for integrating the DNA into the genome, duplicating the region of the genome in the process. Although transposase is specific for TA dinucleotides, the high frequency of these pairs in the genome indicates that the transposon undergoes fairly random integration.|$|E
40|$|The nickel {{resistance}} determinant ncrABCY {{was identified}} in Leptospirillum ferriphilum UBK 03. Within this operon, ncrA and ncrC encode two membrane proteins that form an efflux system, and ncrB encodes NcrB, which belongs to an uncharacterized family (DUF 156) of proteins. How this determinant is regulated remains unknown. Our {{data indicate that}} expression of the nickel resistance determinant is induced by nickel. The promoter of ncrA, designated pncrA, was cloned into the promoter probe vector pPR 9 TT, and co-transformed with either a wild-type or mutant nickel resistance determinant. The results revealed that ncrB encoded a transcriptional regulator that could regulate the expression of ncrA, ncrB, and ncrC. A GC-rich <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> was identified in the promoter pncrA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and footprinting assays showed that purified NcrB could specifically bind to the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> of pncrA in vitro; this was confirmed by bacterial one-hybrid analysis.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was {{performed with the}} use of physical techniques, to determine the nature and organization of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> in nuclear DNA fragments from Physarum polycephalum. From the average size of foldback duplexes (550 nucleotide pairs), and the foldback duplex yield as determined by treatment of DNA with S 1 deoxyribonuclease followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography, it is estimated that there are at least 25000 foldback sequences in the Physarum genome. Foldback DNA molecules exhibit properties intermediate between single-stranded DNA and native duplexes on elution from hydroxyapatite with a salt gradient. In addition, thermal-elution chromatography of foldback DNA from hydroxyapatite crystals shows that foldback duplexes are less stable than native DNA. These properties can be explained on the basis that <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> are mismatched when in the foldback configuration. The results of experiments in which the binding of foldback DNA molecules to hydroxyapatite was determined, by using fragments of different single-chain size, agree with previous studies indicating that <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> are located, on average, every 7000 residues throughout the Physarum genome.

In general, Fur proteins bind with high affinity to a 19 -bp <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> known as the Fur box. An alignment of 19 operator sites recognized by Bacillus subtilis Fur revealed a different conserved 15 -bp (7 - 1 - 7) <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> present twice within this 19 -bp consensus sequence. We demonstrated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays that this 7 - 1 - 7 <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> comprises a minimal recognition site for high-affinity binding by Fur. The resulting revised consensus sequence is remarkably similar to a related 7 - 1 - 7 <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> recognized by PerR, a Fur paralog. Our analysis of the affinity and stoichiometry of DNA binding by B. subtilis Fur, together with a reinterpretation of previously described studies of Escherichia coli Fur, supports a model in which the 19 -bp Fur box represents overlapping recognition sites for two Fur dimers bound to opposite faces of the DNA helix. The resulting recognition complex is reminiscent of that observed for the functionally related protein DtxR. Like Fur, DtxR contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, recognizes a 19 -bp <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence,</b> and has a typical DNase I footprint of ∼ 30 bp.

This approach provides a sensitive assay to determine which adenovirus terminal sequences are required in cis for replication Plasmids carrying deletion mutations within cloned adenovirus terminal sequences have been studied to map the replication origin. The replication origin is contained entirely within the first 67 by of the adenovirus inverted terminal repeat (ITR). This region could be further subdivided into two functional domains: a minimal replication origin and an adjacent auxilliary region which boosted the efficiency of replication by more than 100 - fold. The minimal origin occupies the first 18 to 21 by and includes sequences conserved between all adenovirus serotypes. The adjacent auxilliary region extends past nucleotide 36 but not past nucleotide 67, and contains the binding sites for nuclear factor I and nuclear factor III.

40|$|Abstract Background Wheat gluten has unique {{nutritional}} {{and technological}} characteristics, {{but is also}} a major trigger of allergies and intolerances. One of the most severe diseases caused by gluten is coeliac disease. The peptides produced in the digestive tract by the incomplete digestion of gluten proteins trigger the disease. The majority of the epitopes responsible reside in the gliadin fraction of gluten. The location of the multiple gliadin genes in blocks has to date complicated their elimination by classical breeding techniques or {{by the use of}} biotechnological tools. As an approach to silence multiple gliadin genes we have produced 38 transgenic lines of bread wheat containing combinations of two endosperm-specific promoters and three different <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> to silence three fractions of gliadins by RNA interference. Results The effects of the RNA interference constructs on the content of the gluten proteins, total protein and starch, thousand seed weights and SDSS quality tests of flour were analyzed in these transgenic lines in two consecutive years. The characteristics of the <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> were the main factor that determined the efficiency of silencing. The promoter used had less influence on silencing, although a synergy in silencing efficiency was observed when the two promoters were used simultaneously. Genotype and the environment also influenced silencing efficiency. Conclusions We conclude that to obtain wheat lines with an optimum reduction of toxic gluten epitopes one needs {{to take into account the}} factors of <b>inverted</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> design, promoter choice and also the wheat background used.

To dissect the molecular components involved in chloroplast mRNA 3 ' end processing and stability, a spinach chloroplast protein extract containing mRNA 3 ' end processing activity was fractionated by FPLC and RNA affinity chromatography. The purified fraction consisted of several proteins and was capable of processing the 3 ' ends of the psbA, rbcL, petD and rps 14 mRNAs. This protein fraction was enriched for a 28 kd RNA-binding protein (28 RNP) which interacts with both the precursor and mature 3 ' ends of the four mRNAs. Using specific antibodies to this protein, the poly(A) RNA-derived cDNA for the 28 RNP was cloned and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence for the 28 RNP reveals two conserved RNA-binding domains, including the consensus sequences RNP-CS 1 and CS 2, and a novel acidic and glycine-rich N-terminal domain. The accumulation of the nuclear-encoded 28 RNP mRNA and protein are developmentally regulated in spinach cotyledons, leaves, root and stem, and are enhanced during light-dependent chloroplast development. The general correlation between accumulation of the 28 RNP and plastid mRNA during development, together {{with the result that}} depletion of the 28 RNP from the chloroplast protein extract interferes with the correct 3 ' end processing of several chloroplast mRNAs, suggests that the 28 RNP is required for plastid mRNA 3 ' end processing and/or stability...|$|E
