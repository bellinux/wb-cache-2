2500|$|Lee {{released}} a third EP of covers in May 2014, {{to celebrate his}} 92nd birthday, called Metal Knight, {{in addition to a}} cover of [...] "My Way", it contains [...] "The Toreador March", inspired by the opera Carmen, and the songs [...] "The Impossible Dream" [...] and [...] "I Don Quixote" [...] from the Don Quixote musical Man of La Mancha. Lee was inspired to record the latter songs because, [...] "as far as I am concerned, Don Quixote is the most metal fictional character that I know". His fourth EP and third annual Christmas release came in December 2014, as he put out [...] "Darkest Carols, Faithful Sing", a playful take on [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". He explained: [...] "It's light-hearted, joyful and fun... At my age, {{the most important thing for}} me is to keep active by doing things that I truly enjoy. I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> am going to be around, so every day is a celebration, and I want to share it with my fans." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{is in your}} room, sir. He {{seems very}} impatient. He has been out {{two or three times}} to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> thought you would be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By all that's lucky! An' last, can {{you handle}} guns? We 'ain't {{had a good}} shot on this range fer Lord <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long.</b> <b>I</b> used to hit plumb center with a rifle. My eyes are pore now. An' my son can't hit a flock of haystacks. An' the cowpunchers are 'most as bad. Sometimes right hyar where you could hit elk with a club we're out of fresh meat." ...|$|R
60|$|Her husband awoke with a start, {{and said}} to her, 'Unhappy woman, what have you done? Three days more and this unholy spell would have fallen from me, and now, who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> {{may have to go}} about in this disgusting shape? I must leave you at once, and we shall not meet again until you have worn out three pairs of iron shoes and blunted a steel staff in your search for me.' So saying he disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am An-Tak, the Galu," [...] {{replied the}} man. [...] "Luata alone <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> have been here--maybe ten moons, maybe ten moons three times"--it was the Caspakian {{equivalent}} of thirty. [...] "I {{was young and}} strong when they brought me here. Now I am old and very weak. I am cos-ata-lu--that is why they have not killed me. If I tell them the secret of becoming cos-ata-lu they will take me out; but how can I tell them that which Luata alone knows? ...|$|R
6000|$|... thus {{taking up}} again {{the reader with}} whom I began, letting him <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> must have watched this {{favourite}} vessel, and inviting him to rest his mind as mine is resting.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> shall stay," [...] said he; [...] "but I cannot {{say that}} my visit will be {{influenced}} {{one way or the}} other by such a rumour as that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I intended; so I do intend; {{but still}} I must leave {{it for a}} while. I'm going about business, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> may be away. I go on Saturday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't grudge me {{a little}} pleasure, Philip? You see, it's the last time I shall {{be able to go}} {{anywhere}} for <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long,</b> and <b>I</b> had promised." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{hope you}} are not {{thinking}} of leaving us soon, knight?' said I, with perfect sincerity; for I liked him, as a most amusing companion. 'Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy, perhaps,' continued he. 'Why, man, I have been given over any time these four years; {{and there was always}} a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation. Who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> may keep you waiting?' and he DID keep me waiting some little time longer than at that period there was any reason to suspect.|$|R
60|$|I {{could say}} no more; the painful {{recollections}} pressed so heavily upon my poor shattered mind and frame, that both failed once more. I fainted again, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> lay insensible.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{how can you}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> was gone, or how far I went to land Hurry, seein' {{you were}} not with us, and the {{distance}} was so great, {{to say nothing of}} the night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't really <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} sitting here," [...] said Islington, [...] "or whether I have not been {{actually}} asleep and dreaming. It seemed too lovely a morning to go to bed. But you?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was eager}} to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> {{had lived in the}} wilderness; how often I had fought against the savages, and such like simple questions, all of which I {{answered}} until he was come to an end.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Marco Puig and filmed in a desert near Los Angeles, California. The video premiered on AOL's PopEater on November 6, 2009. [...] Allen told Billboard magazine, [...] "The video looks great. It was really fun shooting it-we shot it from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. so it was an all-night thing with no breaks. [...] set up like a digital clock, but it's huge, it's this monstrous thing-like 25 feet tall and who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long.</b> <b>I</b> get to hold a flare, which was pretty cool. I ended up throwing it at people on set." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{did they}} do, all the chaps I knew, the chaps in the clubs with whom I'd been cheek by jowl for heaven <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long?</b> <b>I</b> was not beholden {{to them for}} anything, and when I slipped out {{there was not one}} of them to drop me a line and say, 'How are you, old man? Anything I can do for you?' For several weeks it was: 'What's become of Ferguson?' After that I became a reminiscence and a memory. Yet every last one of them knew I had nothing but my salary and that I'd always lived a lap ahead of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little while}} ago. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long.</b> Anyway, <b>I</b> saw him lyin' {{dead on the}} porch. An' say, pard, I've got to rustle. Send Bill up quick as he comes. Tell him Sampson wants to turn over all his stock an' then light out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] Tavernake replied. [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> shall be in New York. If I am {{here for a}} few days, I shall take my chance at finding you at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you asked}} me {{a little while ago}} whether I had left the Church, I let you think I had. I am still {{connected}} with St. John's, but I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> shall continue to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{long did}} it take you? I found it out before I ever spoke to her. I met her the other day in Saint Peter's; I knew it then. I knew it--do you want to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> have known it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hugh can wait," [...] he declared, as {{he passed}} his arm through Olive's. [...] "This is my last night on shore for heaven <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> and <b>I</b> am going to take Olive off to see my {{photographs}} of the Scorpion. Old Wilcock handed them to me out of his drawer this afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perry, you ARE mad," [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Why, the Lord only <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} away. I {{have been to}} other lands, {{discovered}} a new race of humans within Pellucidar, seen the Mahars at their worship in their hidden temple, and barely escaped with my life from them and from a great labyrinthodon that I met afterward, following my long and tedious wanderings across an unknown world. I must have been away for months, Perry, and now you barely look up from your work when I return and insist {{that we have been}} separated but a moment. Is that any way to treat a friend? I'm surprised at you, Perry, and if I'd thought for a moment that you cared no more for me than this I should not have returned to chance death {{at the hands of the}} Mahars for your sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>longed</b> {{to make a}} {{study of}} that glorious work," [...] she answered. [...] "Don't be hard on a poor artist who takes her {{opportunity}} when she finds it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} {{day of the}} month it is," [...] said Scrooge. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> {{have been among the}} Spirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite a baby. Never mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> {{might not}} have dreamed on in this way, if Bruno hadn't {{suddenly}} roused me. [...] "Oh, come here quick!" [...] he cried, {{in a state of}} the wildest excitement. [...] "Catch hold of his other horn! I ca'n't hold him more than a minute!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{doors of}} my house!" [...] {{answered}} the Fleming--"do I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> may call that, or any house upon earth, my own? Alas, my daughter, we came hither to fly from {{the rage of}} the elements, but who knows how soon we may perish by the wrath of men!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>know,</b> Mr. Slope, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} officiating as a clergyman in this city?" [...] Mr. Slope's wish was now nearly fulfilled. Mr. Harding had become angry, {{and it was}} {{probable}} that he might commit himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> not <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> lay in my fever," [...] George resumed. [...] "When I {{awoke to}} my senses, my dear Florac was gone. He {{and his company}} had been {{despatched}} on an enterprise against an English fort on the Pennsylvanian territory, which the French claimed, too. In Duquesne, when I came {{to be able to}} ask and understand what was said to me, there were not above thirty Europeans left. The place might have been taken over and over again, had any of our people had the courage to return after their disaster.|$|R

6000|$|I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> {{had been}} asleep when I was roused by a shake on my shoulder. The room was pitch dark, and I felt a hand {{suddenly}} clapped over my mouth. Then a strong smell of whisky and tobacco saluted my nostrils, and a whisper stole into my ear-- ...|$|E
6000|$|I sat {{holding his}} hand, {{stroking}} it. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> sat there; I had put my coat and waterproof under him. He was [...] "wet through," [...] of course; {{there was little}} use in what I did. What could I do with him? how bring him to a warm and dry place? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oho, Mr. Butler," [...] {{said the}} Duke, [...] "I find you are growing jealous; but it's rather {{too late in}} the day, for you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> have admired your wife. But seriously, there is betwixt them one of those inexplicable likenesses which we see in countenances, that do not {{otherwise}} resemble each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good and kind. I wish to Heaven that I were going to Marlshire with you. If you only <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>long</b> to see her again. I {{think that it would}} break my heart if {{anything}} happened to separate us," [...] and his lips quivered at the thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll see to it, of course," [...] said Northwick. [...] "I'm {{going away}} in the morning, and <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> just <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> shall be gone." [...] Northwick {{satisfied}} his mechanical scruple against telling a lie by this formula; and in its shelter {{he went on to}} give Elbridge instructions about the management of the place in his absence. He took some money from his pocket-book and handed it to him for certain expenses, and then he said, [...] "I want to take the five o'clock train, that reaches Ponkwasset at nine. You can drive me up with the black mare." ...|$|R

And {{after that}} we'll go somewhere else, and have supper where the people are still smarter and still shadier; and then we'll go to Covent Garden Ball. Oh, you don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>long</b> {{to go on the}} rampage sometimes! I get so tired of propriety." ...|$|R
