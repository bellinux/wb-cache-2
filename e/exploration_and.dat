5|$|Geothermal {{projects}} have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At {{the early stages}} of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending. Projects moving forward from the identification, <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing.|$|E
5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E

5|$|As the Doctor is a pacifist {{and did not}} use {{the guns}} {{commonly}} found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay. Much of the first game was based around stealth, <b>exploration,</b> <b>and</b> puzzle-solving. The Doctor was also equipped with his sonic screwdriver, but as this was often used as a skeleton key in the show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> {{production}} continued {{to expand and}} stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E
5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free from the ice in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exploration</b> <b>and</b> {{colonisation}} of North and South America {{resulted in}} the introduction into Europe of such crops as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc, while the principal Old World livestock – cattle, horses, sheep and goats – were introduced into the New World {{for the first time}} along with wheat, barley, rice and turnips.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay in Silent Hill 3 resembles closely {{that of its}} two predecessors, {{the three}} main {{gameplay}} elements being combat, <b>exploration,</b> <b>and</b> puzzle-solving. Combat, as well as exploration, takes place in third-person view, with the player able to equip weapons found throughout the game. Heather may also block and perform side-step maneuvers to avoid enemies. As series staples, the flashlight and radio return, the latter of which crackles when monsters are within close proximity.|$|E
5|$|In June 1992, American President George H. W. Bush and Russian {{president}} Boris Yeltsin {{agreed to}} co-operate on space exploration by signing the Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the <b>Exploration</b> <b>and</b> Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes.

5|$|Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye, {{visited the}} Red River Valley in the 1730s to help open {{the area for}} French <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> trade. As French explorers entered the area, a Montreal-based company, the North West Company, began trading with the Métis. Both the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company built fur-trading forts; the two {{companies}} competed in southern Manitoba, occasionally resulting in violence, until they merged in 1821 (the Hudson's Bay Company Archives in Winnipeg preserve {{the history of this}} era).|$|E
5|$|Taking {{place in}} a fictional open-world environment, the story of Blue Dragon focuses on five friends (Shu, Jiro, Kluke, Zola, and Marumaro) as they travel across the world to confront Nene, the evil ruler of the Grand Kingdom.

The game follows a traditional role-playing design, based around <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> turn-based combat.|$|E

5|$|Telengard, a BASIC port of {{the earlier}} PDP-10 game DND, and Dungeons of Daggorath, both {{released}} in 1982, introduced real-time gameplay. Earlier dungeon crawl games had used turn-based movement, in which the enemies only moved when the adventuring party did. Tunnels of Doom, produced the same year, introduced separate screens for <b>exploration</b> <b>and</b> combat. Dragon Quest is most commonly claimed as the first role-playing video game produced for a console, though journalist Joe Fielder cites the earlier Dragonstomper.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 book Rising Above the Gathering Storm by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine {{noted the}} White House Astronomy Night {{indicated}} an emphasis by the Obama Administration towards support {{for education in}} the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM fields). The New Moon: Water, <b>Exploration,</b> <b>and</b> Future Habitation, written in 2014 by Arlin Crotts, observed this event and the inclusion of NASA's Lunar Electric Rover in the First inauguration of Barack Obama reflected an emphasis on the importance of science education.|$|E
5|$|The Church also celebrates several {{holidays}} {{in honor}} of characters drawn from fiction and popular culture, such as Monty Python, Dracula, and Klaatu.
