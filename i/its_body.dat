5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of <b>its</b> <b>body</b> weight in prey per day.|$|E

5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far back on <b>its</b> <b>body,</b> the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, {{but it can}} use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against <b>its</b> <b>body</b> like a bird ("avian folding"), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making <b>its</b> <b>body</b> length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool <b>its</b> <b>body</b> as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium {{was much}} smaller than the sudamericids Gondwanatherium and Sudamerica, and <b>its</b> <b>body</b> mass is {{estimated}} to have been about 70g (2.5oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, Ferugliotherium has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction of wear on the teeth indicates that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.|$|E

5000|$|Gymnotus choco, {{commonly}} known as the cuchillo (Spanish for [...] "knife"), is an electric knifefish. G. choco is distinguished from its cogenerate species group by a color pattern possessing pale yellow bands oriented obliquely, wherein the interband margins are wavy or even irregular; one to three Y-shaped dark bands occur on <b>its</b> <b>body's</b> posterior section; and its pale bands do not extend above the fish's lateral line on <b>its</b> <b>body's</b> anterior two-thirds. G. choco is most similar to G. paraguensis from the Pantanal in Brazil and Paraguay. From the latter, it is distinguished by having a narrower mouth, a more cylindrical body, and a longer preanal distance.|$|R

5|$|H. reaumuri {{differs from}} other desert {{woodlice}} {{in a number}} of respects. It is crepuscular, while other species are nocturnal. Apart from at the highest temperatures, it is also positively phototactic (is attracted to sunlight), while other species are negatively phototactic (move away from bright light). Compared to other woodlice, H. reaumuri walks in an unusual manner, with <b>its</b> <b>body</b> held high off the ground.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the Suffolk {{was often}} criticised for its poor feet, having hooves {{that were too}} small for <b>its</b> <b>body</b> mass.

5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} <b>its</b> <b>body</b> mass {{at a rate}} {{of about}} 1% a day, much slower than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. This is thought to be because the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and <b>its</b> <b>body</b> is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{and other}} large fishes, in {{particular}} the great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), prey upon the roughtail stingray.

5|$|Some turbellarians have {{a simple}} pharynx lined with cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually {{in the middle of}} their undersides.
