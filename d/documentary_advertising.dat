40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{that the media}} can affect our perceptions, views and tastes on a wide-range of issues. The mass media in it various forms (newspapers, television & radio, the internet and Twitter) and formats, have a far reaching influence through, for example news programmes, <b>documentaries,</b> <b>advertising</b> and entertainment. At {{the same time the}} media can also be seen as a channel for agencies responsible for public health to get their messages across to the population. Public health agencies are always searching for ways to disseminate health information and messages to their intended audiences. These are, of course, global concerns, but as both public health and the media are part of the society in which they operate there will be locally specific issues and considerations. To date most of the research into the media and public health has been conducted in high-income countries, and there has been very little research in Nepal on the interaction of public health and health promotion with the media. This overview paper highlights some of the key issues that public health practitioners, media editors and journalists, health policy-makers and researchers could consider...|$|R

50|$|In 2006, the {{shutdown}} of Talitres’ historical distributor Chronowax weakened the label {{and made it}} vulnerable.

30|$|In {{this study}} {{almost all the}} {{respondents}} said that they have heard about HIV/AIDS. This is very much similar with (Goel and Pandey 1997), (Klepp and Lugoe 1999) in Tanzania. While comparing the knowledge on HIV/AIDS (Khan 2002) showed that when 17 % of adolescent of Bangladesh {{had ever heard of}} AIDS; Indians and Nepalese reported 37 % and 25 % respectively. His study was reflected on the general adolescent population of these countries, which is not similar with our study as because we have concentrated on a group of population in Dhaka city who are provided with more facilities to get information from mass media. Mass media exposure such as Radio and TV was positively associated with having knowledge on HIV/AIDS among the adolescent. The exposure to such media can communicate knowledge on AIDS in music, news reports, songs, dramas, <b>documentaries</b> and <b>advertising</b> and can profoundly influence attitudes and behavior of people (Khan 2002). The splendid contribution of mass media is also shown in a mass media project using a TV program to teach adolescent in Zaire about HIV/AIDS awareness (Convisser 1992). Regarding the source of information, Radio and TV were reported as a major source of information on HIV/AIDS by our respondents. This is quite similar with (Goel and Pandey 1997) and (Khan 2002). More over 21 % of the respondents in our study, cited that they first came to know about HIV/AIDS from the health personnel. This shows the effectiveness of various programs implemented by the Govt. of Bangladesh in association with international and national NGOs in health sector.|$|R
5000|$|The awards were {{presented}} annually by the Australian Film Institute (AFI) as the [...] (more {{commonly known as}} the AFI Awards), [...] "to recognise and honour outstanding achievement in the Australian film and television industry." [...] They were instituted in 1958, [...] "as a way to improve the impoverished state of Australian cinema", and was part of the Melbourne International Film Festival (known then as the Melbourne Film Festival) until 1972. The first AFI Awards ceremony consisted of seven fields: <b>Documentary,</b> Educational, <b>Advertising,</b> Experimental Film, Public Relations and Teaching, and an Open category for other films which didn't fit in the aforementioned categories. Between 1958-1980, submitted films {{were presented}} with a gold, silver or bronze prize, and in some circumstances, a Grand Prix award, which was the highest honour a film could receive. Additionally, films were also presented with a gold or silver medallion for technical achievements, and films which didn't receive a prize were given a certificate of honourable mention. From the awards inception to 1968, documentary and educational films were the only films submitted for awards due to few feature films produced in Australia, but in 1969, Jack and Jill: A Postscript became the first feature film to receive an award from the AFI, with a silver prize in the [...] "Open" [...] category, and is considered a winner in the Best Film category of the current awards. Up until 1970, prizes were handed out in recognition of the film and production, rather than achievements of individual filmmakers and crafts people. However, from 1971 special achievement awards were introduced to recognise actors, directors, screenwriters, musicians, editors and cinematographers in feature films, and from 1975, an additional cash prize was given per achievement. In 1977 feature film categories became competitive, while non-feature films continued to be awarded the gold, silver and bronze prizes until 1981, when they also became competitive. In 1976 the awards were broadcast live on television {{for the first time on}} the Nine Network at the Hilton Hotel in Melbourne. In 1986 television categories were introduced, presenting awards for mini-series and telefeatures before expanding to dramas, comedies and documentaries in the 1990s.|$|R
