5|$|Although one of {{the more}} fantastic {{elements}} of science fiction <b>is</b> <b>central</b> to the film, Carruth's goal was to portray scientific discovery in a down-to-earth and realistic manner.

5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and <b>is</b> <b>central</b> to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|Genomics <b>is</b> <b>central</b> to malaria research. With the {{sequencing}} of P.falciparum, {{one of its}} vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can be studied. Another new application of genetic technology {{is the ability to}} produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission.|$|E

5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes <b>is</b> <b>central</b> to the initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source {{and nature of the}} infection). Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the short}} story The Harbor-Master, by Robert W. Chambers, the {{discovery}} and attempted recovery of the last known pair of great auks <b>is</b> <b>central</b> to the plot (which also involves a proto-H.P. Lovecraftian element of suspense). The story first appeared in Ainslee's Magazine (Aug 1889) and was slightly revised {{to become the first}} five chapters of Chambers' episodic novel In Search of the Unknown, (Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York, 1904).|$|E
5|$|Innis's {{theories}} of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: {{he had a}} profound influence on critical media theory and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication <b>is</b> <b>central</b> to social change and transformation.|$|E

5|$|Newton's {{derivation}} of Proposition 43 {{depends on}} his Proposition 2, derived {{earlier in the}} Principia. Proposition 2 provides a geometrical test for whether the net force acting on a point mass (a particle) is a central force. Newton showed that a force <b>is</b> <b>central</b> {{if and only if}} the particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times as measured from the center.|$|E

5|$|The Bible <b>is</b> <b>central</b> in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|The acetyl group, {{formally}} {{derived from}} acetic acid, {{is fundamental to}} all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it <b>is</b> <b>central</b> to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the fatty acids), acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides. However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|E

5|$|While anti-statism <b>is</b> <b>central</b> to {{all forms}} of anarchism, some schools of anarchism also oppose other forms of {{authority}} {{in the conduct of}} human relations. Anarchism is compatible with various economic systems, and there are capitalist, geoist, mutualist, and socialist forms. Anarchism is usually considered a far-left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism or participatory economics.|$|E
