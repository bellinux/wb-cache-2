Increasingly global payment schemes guarantee broad acceptance, and the available technologies and standardization efforts are making transactions more reliable, convenient, and inexpensive for merchants. Perhaps the most important factor, however, in the success of card-based New <b>Terminals,</b> New Trends <b>Financial</b> <b>terminals</b> have become the vehicle for delivering a range of new services from payment-products companies. Terminals are no longer simple card-reading machines. They have become sophisticated computing devices capable of performing transactions, managing inventories, and running business applications. This changing role is clearly indicated by the new terminology used to describe terminals: formerly known as point-of-sale (POS) devices, they are now called point-of-interaction (POI) systems. POI systems must now communicate faster and more easily (e. g., with USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi®, or Bluetooth®). They must support several concurrent applications and handle a plurality of card types (payment cards, loyalty cards, etc.) ...|$|R

The club's location in Melbourne's working class inner western suburbs and the poor quality of facilities at its home ground at the Western Oval were hindering its ability to gain corporate support; in fact, the ground's grandstand had been declared a fire hazard in 1988, and the club was already facing pressure to play its games elsewhere.

40|$|Environmental, {{social and}} {{economic}} attributes are important for the sustainability of a farming system. Comparing farming systems by considering only expected profitability ignores differences in both sustainability and in the riskiness of system returns. Further, in choosing between farming systems, the ability to survive various risks and shocks and con-tinue {{in the future is}} important, i. e., system resilience and persistence are important aspects of sustainabil-ity. Yet resilience and persistence have seldom been directly considered in evaluations of economic sus-tainability.

The relative sustainability of alternative systems under changing assumptions about future technology and price regimes was examined in terms of <b>terminal</b> <b>financial</b> position. The risk efficiency of the same alternatives was also compared. The results illustrate possible conflicts between pursuit of risk efficiency versus sustainability.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{importance}} of port choice and container terminal selection for deep-sea container carriers. The paper focuses on the research question: on what basis do deep-sea container operators select container ports (strategy) and container <b>terminals</b> (<b>financial</b> reasons) in the Hamburg-Le Havre range over others? In answering this research question, three dimensions are addressed in detail: the buying decision characteristics; port choice strategy; and terminal selection. The results show that strategic considerations at company level are important. For port choice the most important criteria from a carrier's perspective are: availability of hinterland connections; reasonable tariffs; and immediacy of consumers (large hinterland). In addition to these criteria, shipping lines attach great value to often neglected factors, such as feeder connectivity, environmental issues and the total portfolio of the port. The study reveals that port selection and terminal selection {{are not the same}} with terminal selection criteria mainly depending on: handling speed; handling costs; reliability; and hinterland connections. The analysis also brought forward that the decision making is different per container carrier, per trade and per port type, implying that a one size fits all approach is not relevant...|$|R

The facility must have adequate services to support users, such as taxi operators, commuters, tenants, traders and the general city dwellers. Construction of the terminal will be funded by government’s budget allocated to upgrading of public transport. The facility will subsequently generate an income through rent from shops, kiosks, hotels and other commercial activities, allowing the <b>terminal</b> <b>financial</b> sustainability. It must promote safety and convenience to the commuter thereby improving comfort. The terminal must offer a public transport infrastructure that will be more advantageous than private transportation, eventually encourage medium and high income population sectors to start using public transportation. Sustained flow of passengers will increase economic opportunity to traders. The methodology for the research of this dissertation {{will be based on}} the grounded theory. Factual information will be gathered from similar projects that have been built in recent years and are located around the country. These terminals have allowed South African culture to adapt itself to these types of interventions.

40|$|Background] End-of-life (EOL) care imposes heavy {{economic}} {{burdens on}} patients and health insurers. Little {{is known about}} the association between the types of EOL care and healthcare costs for cancer patients across various providers. [Objective] To explore the association of healthcare expenditures with benchmarking indicators of aggressive versus palliative care among terminally ill cancer patients, from the perspective of health insurers. [Design] Cross-sectional retrospective study using health insurance claims data. [Setting/participants] Cancer patients who had died in Kyoto prefecture, Japan, between April 2009 and May 2010. [Main outcome measure] Claims data were analyzed using multilevel generalized linear models to examine whether aggressive care and palliative care were associated with expenditures during the last 3 months of life, after adjusting for patient characteristics, hospital characteristics and other non-indicator procedures. [Results] We analyzed 3143 decedents from 54 hospitals. Median expenditure per patient during the last 3 months was US$ 13 030. Higher expenditures were associated with the aggressive care indicators of higher mortality at acute-care hospitals and use of chemotherapy in the last month of life, {{as well as with the}} palliative care indicators of increased hospice care and opioid use in the last 3 months of life. However, increased physician home care in the last 3 months was associated with lower expenditure. [Conclusions] Indicators of both aggressive and palliative EOL care were associated with higher healthcare expenditures. These results may support the coherent development of measures to optimize aggressive care and reduce the <b>financial</b> burdens of <b>terminal</b> cancer care...|$|R

There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing , it was barely breaking even; {{it was in fact}} [...] in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency. After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. (Since 1982, TSR Inc. had conformed to the recommendations of the American Management Association by adding three [...] "outside" [...] directors to the board, increasing its size to six.) Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck. Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the <b>financial</b> problems were <b>terminal</b> and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a new AD book, Unearthed Arcana, a compilation of material culled from Dragon Magazine articles. And he quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, Saga of Old City, featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, Lorraine Williams.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{contributing}} {{to the study of}} the valuation of insurance liabilities and the management of the assets backing these liabilities. It consists of four parts, each devoted to a specific topic. In the first part, we study the pricing of a classical single premium life insurance contract with profit, in terms of a guaranteed rate on the premium and a participation rate on the (<b>terminal)</b> <b>financial</b> surplus. We argue that, given the asset allocation of the insurer, these technical parameters should be determined by taking explicitly into account the risk management policy of the insurance company, in terms of a risk measure such as the value-at-risk or the conditional value-at-risk. We then design a methodology that allows us to fix both parameters in such a way that the contract is fairly priced and simultaneously exhibits a risk consistent with the risk management policy. In the second part, we focus on the management of the surrender option embedded in most life insurance contracts. In Chapter 2, we argue that we should model the surrender time as a random time not adapted to the filtration generated by the financial assets prices, instead of assuming that the surrender time is an optimal stopping time as it is usual in the actuarial literature. We then study the valuation of insurance contracts with a surrender option in such a model. We here follow the financial literature on the default risk and in particular, the reduced-form models. In Chapter 3 and 4, we study the hedging strategies of such insurance contracts. In Chapter 3, we study their risk-minimizing strategies and in Chapter 4, we focus on their ``locally risk-minimizing' strategies. As a by-product, we study the impact of a progressive enlargement of filtration on the so-called ``minimal martingale measure'. The third part is devoted to the systematic mortality risk. Due to its systematic nature, this risk cannot be diversified through increasing the size of the portfolio. It is thus also important to study the hedging strategies an insurer should follow to mitigate its exposure to this risk. In Chapter 5, we study the risk-minimizing strategies for a life insurance contract when no mortality-linked financial assets are traded on the financial market. We here extend Dahl and Moller’s results and show that the risk-minimizing strategy of a life insurance contract is given by a weighted average of risk-minimizing strategies of purely financial claims, where the weights are given by the (stochastic) survival probabilities. In Chapter 6, we first study the application of the HJM methodology to the modelling of a longevity bonds market and describe a coherent theoretical setting in which we can properly define the longevity bond prices. Then, we study the risk-minimizing strategies for pure endowments and annuities portfolios when these longevity bonds are traded. Finally, the fourth part deals with the design of ALM strategies for a non-life insurance portfolio. In particular, this chapter aims at studying the risk-minimizing strategies for a non life insurance company when inflation risk and interest rate risk are taken into account. We derive the general form of these strategies when the cumulative payments of the insurer are described by an arbitrary increasing process adapted to the natural filtration of a general marked point process and when the inflation and the term structure of interest rates are simultaneously described by the HJM model of Jarrow and Yildirim. We then systematically apply this result to four specific models of insurance claims. We first study two ``collective' models. We then study two ``individual' models where the claims are notified at a random time and settled through time. (ACTU 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R
