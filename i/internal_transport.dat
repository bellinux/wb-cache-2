5|$|Arévalo {{took office}} on 15 March 1945, inheriting {{a country with}} {{numerous}} social and economic issues. Despite Ubico's policy of using unpaid labor to build public roads, <b>internal</b> <b>transport</b> was severely inadequate. 70% {{of the population was}} illiterate, and malnutrition and poor health were widespread. The wealthiest 2% of landowners owned nearly three quarters of agricultural land, and as a result less than 1% was cultivated. The indigenous peasants either had no land, or had far too little to sustain themselves. Three quarters of the labor force were in agriculture, and industry was essentially nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} {{frequent}} bus connections to {{other cities in}} Jordan, {{as well as to}} major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. <b>Internal</b> <b>transport</b> is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theatre in the city centre. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.|$|E

This type of pollen transport allows for more rapid pollen loading than the agglutination as it omits the step of nectar addition.|$|R

The bus service is the only route operated by Valley Travel, the transport arm of Merlin Venture, and follows a circular clockwise route around the estate.|$|E
25|$|A Committee of Experts deemed Brussels {{to be the}} {{one option}} to have all the {{necessary}} features for a European capital: a large, active metropolis, without a congested centre or poor quality of housing; good communications with other member states' capitals, including to major commercial and maritime markets; vast <b>internal</b> <b>transport</b> links; an important international business centre; plentiful housing for European civil servants; and an open economy. Furthermore, it was located on the border between the two major European civilisations, Latin and Germanic, and was at the centre of the first post-war integration experiment: the Benelux. As a capital of a small country, it also could not claim to use the presence of institutions to exert pressure on other member states, it being more of a neutral territory between the major European powers. The Committee's report was approved of by the Council, Parliament and Commissions, however the Council was still unable to achieve a final vote on the issue and hence put off the issue for a further three years despite all the institutions now leading in moving to Brussels.|$|E

25|$|The Army had confiscated {{approximately}} 46,000 rural boats. The policy severely disrupted river-borne {{movement of}} labour, supplies and food, and compromised the livelihoods of boatmen and fishermen. Transport was generally unavailable to carry seed {{and equipment to}} distant fields or rice to the market hubs, leaving farmers in great difficulty. Transport costs rose, and the sudden stoppage of commerce not only caused some local industries to collapse, but also struck local areas with a supply shock on rice and fish, Bengal's two staple foods. The Army took no steps to distribute food rations {{to make up for}} the interruption of supplies. Moreover, artisans and other groups who relied on boat transport to carry goods to market were offered no recompense whatsoever; neither were rice growers nor the network of migratory labourers. The large-scale removal or destruction of rural boats, indispensable vehicles in the <b>internal</b> <b>transport</b> system of districts such as Khulna, 24Parganas, Bakargunj and Tipperah, caused a near-complete breakdown of the existing transport and administration infrastructure and market system for movement of rice paddy.|$|E
500|$|For such a rural area, {{the smaller}} villages of the Peak are {{relatively}} {{well served by}} <b>internal</b> <b>transport</b> links. [...] There are many minibuses operating from the main towns and villages (Buxton, Bakewell, Matlock, Hathersage, Castleton, Tideswell and Ashbourne) out to the small villages.

500|$|Sponges do {{not have}} the complex immune systems of most other animals. [...] However they reject grafts from other species but accept them from other members of their own species. [...] In a few marine species, gray cells play the leading role in {{rejection}} of foreign material. When invaded, they produce a chemical that stops movement of other cells in the affected area, thus preventing the intruder from using the sponge's <b>internal</b> <b>transport</b> systems. If the intrusion persists, the grey cells concentrate in the area and release toxins that kill all cells in the area. The [...] "immune" [...] system can stay in this activated state for up to three weeks.|$|E
40|$|Competitiveness {{in global}} markets {{requires}} the ongoing identification and full utilization of improvement potential. To cut costs {{by means of}} process optimization, logistics service providers {{need to focus on}} efficient planning [...] not only for external but also for <b>internal</b> <b>transports.</b> This contribution will demonstrate that significant reductions in <b>internal</b> <b>transports</b> at one of the Deutsche Post World Net's main parcel sorting centers can be achieved by applying the robust solution of a modified three-dimensional linear assignment model. The proposed MILP model minimizes necessary manual transportation effort by layout modifications. Additionally, it takes into account the specific characteristics and requirements of the parcel sorting center. The large-scale model is hierarchically decomposed and all resulting models are solved using MILP software. Uncertain data concerning the structure and quantities of transportation demand over time are considered adequately by applying robustness criteria. The transportation effort of the robust solution is close to every scenario-optimal objective value. The achieved reduction of manual transportation effort leads to a significant increase in runtime quality, to a decrease in costs and to a balanced utilization of the sorting and distribution unit. The approach proposed is not only valuable for parcel sorting centers operated by Deutsche Post World Net; it can also be generally applied to develop robust solutions in an uncertain dynamic decision situation.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{concerns}} {{mass transport}} in anaerobic biofilms, formed under upflow liquid velocities {{similar to the}} prevailing conditions in anaerobic reactors used for wastewater treatment. During biofilm formation under liquid velocities of 1. 5 and 13. 2 m/h, internal mass transfer coecients were routinely measured. Mass transfer coecients attained pseudo steady-state values between 2 – 4 10 ÿ 3 m/h, no dependence being observed between bulk flow and <b>internal</b> mass <b>transport</b> rates. However, a transient variation in the liquid velocity from 1. 5 up to 13. 2 m/h, imposed after the biofilm had reached the steady-state, increased the <b>internal</b> mass <b>transport</b> by 20 % on average. This result suggests that periodic changes in the bulk fluid velocity {{can be used as}} a tool to increase the transport of soluble substrates inside already formed biofilms, although the eect seems to be limited. # 199...|$|R
