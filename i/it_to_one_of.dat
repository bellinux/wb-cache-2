The British Band was reduced to roughly 500 people by this time, including about 150 warriors. The warriors fought with the Americans while the Native noncombatants frantically tried to cross the river. Many made <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the two nearby islands, but were dislodged after the steamboat Warrior returned at noon, carrying regulars and Menominees allied with the Americans.|$|E

By the time Fringe division reaches his home, they find the man, a shapeshifter, already dead.|$|E

25|$|In October 1870, a hawker, Jeremiah McCormack, accused {{a friend}} of the Kellys, Ben Gould, of {{stealing}} his horse. Gould wrote an indecent note to give to McCormack's childless wife, that was used to wrap two calves' testicles. Kelly passed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his cousins to give to the woman. When McCormack confronted Kelly later that day, Kelly punched him in the nose, causing McCormack to fall. Kelly was arrested for his part in sending the calves' parts and the note and for assaulting McCormack. He was sentenced to three months' hard labour on each charge.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his service}} in Shu {{in both the}} central {{government}} and regional administrations, Lü Yi was known for being highly competent, professional and efficient in his working style. On a personal level, he led a simple and frugal lifestyle, and was known for being humble, modest and reserved in speech. However, he was also criticised for being inflexible and overly strict in applying the laws, and for his preference for bureaucracy over talent. Towards {{the end of his}} career, even though he made <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the highest offices – Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令) – in the central government, he remained a very unpopular figure at the commandery and county levels.|$|E

When he climbs the mast to repair an antenna lead, he sees an oncoming tropical storm. When the storm arrives, he runs before the wind. He intends to bring the boat into a hove-to position, but when crawling to the bow to hoist the storm jib, he is thrown overboard and regains the deck after a long struggle. The boat capsizes, turtles after a further 180-degree roll and is dis-masted, {{and most of the}} equipment is destroyed. With the boat badly holed and sinking, the man abandons ship in an inflatable life raft, salvaging whatever he can to survive.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 5 saw astronauts Nick Patrick and Bob Behnken {{perform the}} mission's first spacewalk, which began on time at 02:17 UTC. Their first {{task was to}} move the payload bay of Endeavour and prepare and release launch locks on the Tranquility module and Cupola. Once Behnken and Patrick were clear of its path, the Tranquility module {{was moved to the}} port side of the Unity node using the space station's robot arm. Before Tranquility was {{installed}} the spacewalkers removed Dextre's ORU platform and secured <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the truss segments to function as a backup for a platform to be installed on STS-132. Once the new module was in place, the spacewalkers proceeded to connect temporary heater and data cables between Unity and Tranquility. Behnken and Patrick were ahead of the timeline so they were also able to complete some get-ahead tasks. The spacewalk was completed six and a half hours later, on Friday, 08:49 UTC. After the spacewalk, other crew members completed transfer-related tasks. The transfers are now over halfway complete.|$|E

500|$|Apparently {{scientists}} are still discovering {{hundreds of new}} {{plant and animal species}} there every year, which goes to show that there is still so much we don't know about the region. I just fell in love with it; it gets under your skin. Woodside Petroleum are planning to build one of the world's biggest LNG (liquified natural gas) processing plants on the Kimberley coast, just north of Broome. They would be drilling for the gas out at sea and bringing it onshore at this plant, which would just be devastating for the region. The question everyone is asking is, why not process it offshore or pipe <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the mining towns down south that already have the infrastructure in place?

500|$|... "Fading" [...] {{is a song}} by Barbadian {{recording}} artist Rihanna from her fifth studio album, Loud (2010). The song was written by Jamal Jones and Ester Dean, whilst production of the song was completed by Jones under his production name, Polow da Don. Musically, the song samples Irish instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Enyas [...] "One by One", whilst lyrically, the song is about leaving {{a man in a}} relationship. After Loud had strong digital download sales in the United Kingdom, [...] "Fading" [...] charted at number 187 on that country's singles chart in November 2010. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised da Don's production, but one critic criticized Rihanna for copying herself and failing to create something different. Some critics also compared <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Rihanna's previous singles, [...] "Take A Bow". The song has also been performed on select dates of the Loud Tour (2011).|$|E

500|$|In 1794, {{during the}} failed Kościuszko Uprising {{which led to}} the final {{partition}} of Poland a year later, Prussian troops captured Kraków. In the following year, on King Frederick William II's orders, the treasure vault of the Wawel Castle was looted and the crown jewels taken to Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland), then to Berlin, and finally to Königsberg (now Kaliningrad in Russia). Between 1809 and 1811 most of the jewels were melted down, but some, including Szczerbiec, were put up for sale. The coronation sword was acquired by the future Russian minister of justice, Prince Dmitry Lobanov-Rostovsky, who probably hoped to resell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Polish aristocrats. In 1819, he approached General Wincenty Krasiński, speaker of the Sejm (parliament) of the [...] "Congress" [...] Kingdom of Poland. The prince did not disclose the actual source of the sword and claimed to have bought it in Moscow from an Armenian merchant who had found the weapon somewhere between Belgrade and Rusçuk (now Ruse in Bulgaria) during the recent Russo–Turkish War. Krasiński, who was a known antique [...] weapon collector, suspected it could be Szczerbiec, but asked Prof. Sebastiano Ciampi, a historian of the Warsaw University, for opinion. Ciampi examined the lithography Krasiński had had made of the sword, but was unsure whether it was the actual Szczerbiec. As a consequence, Krasiński declined Lobanov-Rostovsky's offer.|$|E
500|$|Three contestants {{are each}} given a card {{to start a}} {{blackjack}} hand from a standard 52-card deck shuffled prior to taping. Ribeiro reads multiple-choice questions and the first contestant to answer correctly earns 100 points. The contestant who answered correctly can freeze their hand, [...] preventing them from receiving additional cards or reveal the next card {{from the top of}} the deck. After revealing the card, the contestant can either accept it for themselves or pass <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their opponents who has not yet frozen. If keeping a card, the contestant in control is given another chance to freeze. However, once a contestant has frozen, the remaining contestants must freeze at a score higher than that contestant; ties are not permitted. A contestant is eliminated from the round if their hand exceeds 21. The process is repeated with additional questions and cards until two contestants have frozen or bust. A contestant whose score reaches 21 exactly instantly wins the round and, beginning in season two, a bonus prize which is given to the contestant regardless of the outcome of the game. If two contestants bust, the remaining contestant automatically wins the round. If only one contestant has not yet frozen or busted, no additional questions are asked; the remaining contestant simply continues drawing cards until either beating the highest frozen hand or busting. The winner of this round receives 500 points and a power chip to use in the bonus round, assuming that contestant gets that far. After two rounds, the contestant with the lowest score is eliminated. The two remaining contestants play one more round involving the same toss-up question format, but point scores are not kept. The contestant who wins the round receives $1,000 and two additional power chips (originally one), then moves on to the bonus round.|$|E
