The magnitude and relative frequency of trunk stresses in hazardous tasks has been determined and compared with those with lower incidences of back disorders. The study has confirmed that in examining manual handling hazards in industrial male populations a critical value of truncal stress can be applied and used to determine the safety of occupational factors in relation to their potential causing or contributing to degenerative back diseases...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine those {{occupational}} accidents at construction sites that are related to materials handling as compared with all reportable occupational accidents at construction sites. The main concern is to define the kinds of accidents that occur in materials handling. The data were gathered from two sources: a large Finnish construction company and the database of reports of serious occupational accidents (Sammio). One third of all the reported accidents in the studied construction company occurred during materials transfer and 36 % of the absenteeism days resulted from these accidents. Materials handling thus caused more serious accidents than other work activities (t = - 2. 44, df = 351, p < 0. 005). Minor accidents were mostly due to over-exertion whereas serious accidents were mostly falling from a height and injuries caused by falling and collapsing objects. The manual transfer of materials caused most of the materials transfer accidents in the company and mechanical transfer most of the serious materials <b>handling</b> <b>accidents.</b> Over-exertion can, therefore, be decreased by reducing manual materials handling. On the other hand, replacing manual transfers with mechanical transfers means that there arises a risk of serious accidents.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To make proper {{evaluation}} of prevention policies possible, {{data on the}} incidence and associated medical costs of occupational blood exposure accidents in the Netherlands are needed. METHODS: Descriptive analysis of blood exposure accidents and risk estimates for occupational groups. Costs of <b>handling</b> <b>accidents</b> were calculated. RESULTS: Each year, an estimated 13, 000 - 15, 000 blood exposure accidents are reported in the Netherlands, 95 % in occupational settings. Hepatitis B (HBV) vaccination is offered free of charge only to people in risk groups, the seroprevalence of HBV, hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is low and few infections are related to blood exposure accidents. High-risk accidents occur mainly in hospitals. In nursing homes and home care settings, {{the majority of the}} accidents are low-risk. Limited data are available about occurrence of accidents in other occupational groups. Associated medical costs from occupational blood exposure accidents are mainly determined by the initial risk management. CONCLUSIONS: Accidents must be managed effectively to prevent infection and reduce anxiety in injured employees. While strategies to reduce HCV and HIV infection should be primarily aimed at reducing the occurrence of high-risk accidents, vaccination can prevent HBV infection and cut the costs of handling low-risk accidents. The implementation of vaccination strategies, safe working policies and the proper use of safe equipment should be monitored better...|$|E
40|$|When {{accidents}} occur, it {{is essential}} that fire and rescue service respond quickly and efficiently to the accident site to reduce suffering and save lives and property. Planning and coordinating of fire and rescue resources is therefore important in order to maintain a safe society. Firefighters in Sweden have by tradition worked in teams of five, and they have been allocated to fire stations strategically located in populated areas. However, this working approach has recently started to change and the fire and rescue services have started to deploy smaller groups of firefighters. These smaller units can be, for example, strategically located near high-risk areas or roads, or used for preventive work. The complexity of the resource planning process thus increases since the decision makers have to keep track {{of a large number of}} small units spread over the area. The new way of working has resulted in an increased need of support tools that can help the fire and rescue services in decisions regarding the resource management. In this thesis, optimization based decision support tools are developed in order to to support the fire and rescue service so they can efficiently manage, coordinate and dispatch fire and rescue resources with respect to the present demand for service. To find appropriate strategic and tactical locations for different types of response units, an optimization model that minimizes the response time to expected accidents is developed. The model considers both the response time for the first responding unit as well as the response time for the last responding unit. Furthermore, the model is flexible enough to incorporate any type of accidents or resources. The results show that the model can be used to produce practical support for various types of location decisions. To support the more complex operational planning, three optimization based decision support tools are developed. The tools can help the fire and rescue service to always maintain an adequate level of preparedness for <b>handling</b> <b>accidents.</b> To evaluate the preparedness, a quantitative measure has been defined and serves as the basis for the tools. The first tool can help illustrate the preparedness, the second tool to select appropriate vehicles and firefighters to dispatch to accidents, and the third tool to suggest how resources can be relocated to maintain an adequate preparedness for new accidents. The developed decision support tools are evaluated through tests and experiments with fire and rescue services in Sweden. Results from the experiments indicate that the three tools can support the fire and rescue service in operational decisions and in maintaining an adequate preparedness for <b>handling</b> <b>accidents,</b> but also that the planning time seems to increase when using the support tools. However, the participants’ experiences of the tools were in general positive, and they thought the tools were useful and that the tools could support their daily work. The perception of preparedness, which usually varies quite a bit among individuals, also seems to become more uniform with access to the tools...|$|E
