5|$|The Germans had {{maintained}} {{the attacks on}} airfields in south-western England which they had started the previous day. On 12 August, most of the Kentish airfields had been attacked; and on 13 August, the Germans concentrated on the second line airfields south of London. The concentration on Detling and Eastchurch was a failure, as both were Coastal Command stations and bore no relation to Fighter Command. The Germans may have reasoned that if bases such as Manston, Hawkinge and Lympne were neutralised through the attacks on 12 August, then Fighter Command may have had to move onto these airfields. In fact, the bombing of 12 August <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to knock out these strips, and Adlertag <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to destroy or render Detling or Eastchurch nonoperational. Owing to poor intelligence, weather conditions, and RAF resistance, attacks on other targets <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> or been unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{sided with}} the Eatons. He and his late wife Rachel Donelson had {{undergone}} similar political attacks stemming from their marriage in 1791. The two had married in 1791 not knowing that Rachel's first husband, Lewis Robards, <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to finalize the expected divorce. Once the divorce was finalized, they married legally in 1794, but the episode caused a major controversy, and was used against him in the 1828 campaign. Jackson saw attacks on Eaton stemming ultimately from the political opposition of Calhoun, who <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to silence his wife's criticisms.

Rommel's initial infantry assaults <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to capture this vital position, the southern pivot of the British Gazala Line, {{which was held}} by the 1st Free French brigade, commanded by General Marie Pierre Koenig. Rommel had called for air support but <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to break the position, which Kesselring attributed to faulty coordination between the ground and air attacks. Bir Hakeim was evacuated on 10 June 1942. Kesselring was more impressed {{with the results of}} Rommel's successful assault on Tobruk on 21 June, for which Kesselring brought in additional aircraft from Greece and Crete. For his part in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves and swords.|$|E
