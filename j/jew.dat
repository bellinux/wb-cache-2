25|$|Mizrahi <b>Jews</b> are <b>Jews</b> {{descended from}} the Jewish {{communities}} of the Middle East, Central Asia and the Caucasus, largely originating from the Babylonian Jewry of the classic period. The term Mizrahi is used in Israel {{in the language of}} politics, media and some social scientists for <b>Jews</b> from the Arab world and adjacent, primarily Muslim-majority countries. The definition of Mizrahi includes the modern Iraqi <b>Jews,</b> Syrian <b>Jews,</b> Lebanese <b>Jews,</b> Persian <b>Jews,</b> Afghan <b>Jews,</b> Bukharian <b>Jews,</b> Kurdish <b>Jews,</b> Mountain <b>Jews,</b> Georgian <b>Jews.</b> Some also include the North-African Sephardic communities and Yemenite <b>Jews</b> under the definition of Mizrahi, but do that from rather political generalization than ancestral reasons.|$|R
5|$|On July 4, 2007, Jew's {{attorneys}} {{issued a}} 138-page response to Herrera's petition, arguing {{that even if}} <b>Jew</b> had not lived full-time in his home in District 4, his election had not violated any laws. They also accused Herrara of political bias in bringing the charges. Herrera denied Jew's accusations, and released signed bank loan documents on which <b>Jew</b> had identified his address in Burlingame.

25|$|By {{the time}} the State of Israel was proclaimed, the {{majority}} of <b>Jews</b> {{in the state and}} the region were Ashkenazi. Following the declaration of the state, a flood of Jewish migrants and refugees entered Israel—both from Europe and America and also from Arab and Muslim countries. Most of the Jewish immigrants in the 1950s and 1960s were Jewish Holocaust survivors, as well as Sephardic <b>Jews</b> and Mizrahi <b>Jews</b> (mostly Moroccan <b>Jews,</b> Algerian <b>Jews,</b> Tunisian <b>Jews,</b> Yemenite <b>Jews,</b> Bukharan <b>Jews,</b> Iranian <b>Jews,</b> Iraqi <b>Jews,</b> Kurdish <b>Jews,</b> and smaller communities, principally from Lebanon, Syria, Libya, Egypt, India, Turkey and Afghanistan).

5|$|In late May 2007, {{following}} the FBI raid, questions surfaced {{about whether or}} not <b>Jew</b> actually lived in his San Francisco home, and whether or not <b>Jew</b> therefore met the residency requirements of his supervisor position. The house in question (on 28th Avenue in the Sunset District) was owned by his father, though Jew's neighbors said that the house was vacant and utility bills showed little to no usage of water or electricity. <b>Jew</b> claimed that {{he spent most of his}} time at his flower shop, but was not able to provide more information in response to City Attorney Dennis Herrera's formal requests.|$|E

50|$|Nazi {{antisemitism}} provides {{another example}} of the contentious divide between ethnic and religious persecution, because Nazi propaganda tended to construct its image of <b>Jews</b> as race, and de-emphasized <b>Jews</b> as being defined by their religion.
