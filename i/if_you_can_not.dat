He is obliged to be at Pike court where he has a case, with a fee of five hundred dollars, two hundred dollars already paid. To neglect it would be unjust to himself, and dishonest to his client. Harris will be with you, head up and tail up, for Nebraska. You must have some one to make an anti-Nebraska speech. Palmer is the best, {{if you can get}} him, I think. Jo.

But beware when you come to the bird and the spider, for they will not be so kind to you as I am. The bird has no heart at all, and the spider's heart is hard as a stone.

5000|$|Those {{wishing to}} visit Paramount can take studio tours, which are offered {{seven days a}} week. Reservations are required, and {{can be made by}} visiting the tour website. [...] Each tour day is {{different}} because the tour has to work around active movie sets. Pictures are allowed in some areas. Your tour guide will let you know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> take pictures. Most of the time this is because an area or studio is [...] "set", meaning the area or set is being used for a current production and can't be photographed due to copyright laws. The regular tour offers a behind-the-scenes look at the current operations of the studio. Most of the buildings on the tour are named for historical Paramount executives or the artists that worked at Paramount over the years. Many of the stars' dressing rooms have been converted into working offices. The stages where Samson and Delilah, Sunset Blvd., White Christmas, Rear Window, Sabrina, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and many other classic films were shot are still in use today. The studio's backlot set, [...] "New York Street", features numerous blocks of façades that depict a number of New York locales: [...] "Washington Square" [...] (where some scenes in The Heiress, starring Olivia de Havilland, were shot), [...] "Brooklyn", [...] "Financial District", and others. Led by a guide on a golf cart, the tour takes approximately two hours. The best time to take the regular tour is on the weekends because most of the filming is shut down and you can get into more areas. The VIP tour takes you to additional areas not covered by the standard tour, plus you have lunch in the studio restaurant. This tour takes 5 to 6 hours and is usually only offered on weekdays.|$|E
