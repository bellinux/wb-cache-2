40|$|Why is it {{that the}} laws of war, or {{international}} humanitarian law (IHL), allow no justification for breaking the law even if where such conduct would actually produce less humanitarian harm than following the law? In introducing the concept of a humanitarian necessity justification, this paper suggests that it should. It first addresses the puzzle of IHL’s existing absolutist stance through three historical case studies in which actors broke the law under a claim of necessity, or a mixed concern for self and others: The “Early Warning Procedure” employed by the IDF in the West Bank, the generic case of torture, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It then examines whether the domestic necessity defense in criminal law might be transposed onto the international level, ultimately finding that such transposition is impossible. In further searching for an account for IHL’s absolutist stance, the paper turns to first-order accounts – deontological, consequential, and institutional – only to demonstrate that none of these accounts offers a convincing explanation for the exclusion of a humanitarian necessity paradigm. Ultimately, the paper offers a blueprint for a definition for a humanitarian necessity justification that would exculpate an actor who violated the laws of war {{in the name of a}} greater humanitarian good. The central component of the definition is a requirement that the greater humanitarian good would be for the benefit of the enemy, rather than for oneself. Under such paradigm, the <b>Early</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>Procedure</b> and perhaps even the atomic bombing of Hiroshima might be justified, while the paradigmatic case of interrogational torture could not...|$|E

40|$|The {{procedures}} launched against Germany and France due {{to their}} excessive deficits, again brought {{the attention of the}} media and broader public to the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). The point of culmination was reached when the European Commission filed a claim against the Council (C- 27 / 04) which in essence concerned the enforceability and, thus, the functioning of the SGP {{in the context of the}} required cooperation between the two Community institutions. The ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), however, was comparably more reluctant. While concentrating on the concrete steps taken by the Council in the deficit procedures against Germany and France, it sidestepped key questions on the nature and the sequence of the procedure and the division of power between Council and Commission in the enforcement of national budgetary discipline. As a result, the extent to which the system of fiscal surveillance and economic policy coordination binds the Member States, as well as the institutions, remains unsettled. The same can be said regarding the interplay between the Council and Commission not only in the case at hand, but also in future excessive deficit procedures. Can the procedure be continued against the will of the Council? Can there ever be sanctions against the will of the Council? Does the SGP therefore effectively force the Member States to abide by the principle of fiscal discipline? It is one thing to confirm the Council as the central actor and decision-maker in the deficit procedure; it is, however, another to remain silent on the limits of the Council's discretion. When the ECJ mentions the possibility of an action for failure to act, it acknowledges the shortcomings of the procedure in those cases where the Council is unwilling to decide. Nevertheless, the ruling opens additional loopholes for inaction by the Council. This might be fatal not only for the current decisive phase of the excessive deficit procedure against Germany and France, but also for the existence of the pact as such. With the case of Italy, where the Council failed to adopt the recommendation of the Commission to initiate the <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>procedure,</b> the next conflict between Commission and Council is pending.

The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by the installation of SHM systems on four important monuments in northern Italy (Verona Arena and the stone tomb of “Cansignorio della Scala” in Verona, the “Bertoliana” library in Vicenza and the church of S. Sofia in Padova) and on the Qutb Minar in New Delhi.

40|$|Analysis of {{ensemble}} forecasting strategies, {{which can}} provide a tangible backing for flood <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>procedures</b> and mitigation measures over the Mediterranean region, {{is one of the}} fundamental motivations of the international HyMeX programme. Here, we examine two severe hydrometeorological episodes that affected the Milano urban area and for which the complex flood protection system of the city did not completely succeed. Indeed, flood damage have exponentially increased during the last 60 years, due to industrial and urban developments. Thus, the improvement of the Milano flood control system needs a synergism between structural and non-structural approaches. First, we examine how land-use changes due to urban development have altered the hydrological response to intense rainfalls. Second, we test a flood forecasting system which comprises the Flash-flood Event-based Spatially distributed rainfall-runoff Transformation, including Water Balance (FEST-WB) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models. Accurate forecasts of deep moist convection and extreme precipitation are difficult to be predicted due to uncertainties arising from the numeric weather prediction (NWP) physical parameterizations and high sensitivity to misrepresentation of the atmospheric state; however, two hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPS) have been designed to explicitly cope with uncertainties in the initial and lateral boundary conditions (IC/LBCs) and physical parameterizations of the NWP model. No substantial differences in skill have been found between both ensemble strategies when considering an enhanced diversity of IC/LBCs for the perturbed initial conditions ensemble. Furthermore, no additional benefits have been found by considering more frequent LBCs in a mixed physics ensemble, as ensemble spread seems to be reduced. These findings could help to design the most appropriate ensemble strategies before these hydrometeorological extremes, given the computational cost of running such advanced HEPSs for operational purposes...|$|R
30|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is able {{to process}} data for its {{earthquake}} <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> (EEW) <b>procedure</b> very quickly by employing a seismic intensity expectation method that uses simplified strong motion characteristics. To represent one of these characteristics, the site amplification factor at the seismic intensity station, JMA uses ARV (amplitude ratio of peak ground velocity at the ground surface relative to the engineering bedrock of average S-wave velocity 700 m/s) based on topographic data. As a potential substitute for the ARV, we investigated a station correction based on empirical site amplifications obtained from recent observed seismic intensity data. When estimating this station correction, we removed an effect of the abnormal seismic intensity distribution of deep subduction-zone earthquakes and applied a correction for the earthquake source term to the attenuation relation. Station corrections were obtained for 1258 stations, representing about 30 % of all current seismic intensity stations. The correlation between our station corrections at the stations and the site amplification based on topographic data is weak (correlation coefficient = 0.30). The error of the expected seismic intensity was improved by 15 % by replacing ARV with the station correction.|$|R

An example of Taiwanese banking industry is discussed to test the hit ratio of each system. The performance is compared with other four <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems, namely, case-based reasoning, backpropagation neural network, logistic regression analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis. The result indicates that the GNN proposed in this research is a little superior {{to the other two}} soft computing <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems. And the GNN outperforms the statistical <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems at least 13 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Different {{power quality}} (PQ) {{disturbance}} sources can have major {{impacts on the}} power supply grid. This study proposes, for the first time, an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> approach to identifying PQ problems and providing <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> prompts based on the monitored data of PQ disturbance sources. To establish a steady-state power quality <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> index system, the characteristics of PQ disturbance sources are analyzed and summed up. The higher order statistics anomaly detection (HOSAD) algorithm, based on skewness and kurtosis, and hierarchical power quality <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> flow, were then used to mine limit-exceeding and abnormal data and analyze their severity. Cases {{studies show that the}} proposed approach is effective and feasible, and {{that it is possible to}} provide timely power quality <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> for limit-exceeding and abnormal data...|$|R
40|$|As {{a high-risk}} subindustry {{involved}} in construction projects, highway construction safety has experienced major {{developments in the}} past 20 years, mainly {{due to the lack}} of safe <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> in Chinese construction projects. By combining the current state of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> technology with the requirements of the State Administration of Work Safety and using case-based reasoning (CBR), this paper expounds on the concept and flow of highway construction safety <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> based on CBR. The present study provides solutions to three key issues, index selection, accident cause association analysis, and warning degree forecasting implementation, through the use of association rule mining, support vector machine classifiers, and variable fuzzy qualitative and quantitative change criterion modes, which fully cover the needs of safe <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems. Using a detailed description of the principles and advantages of each method and by proving the methods’ effectiveness and ability to act together in safe <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> applications, effective means and intelligent technology for a safe highway construction <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system are established...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{feasibility}} of an earthquake <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> sys-tem for Taipei, two prototype seismic <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems have been implemented in Hualien, about 120 km away. The Taiwan Rapid Earth-quake Information Release (TREIRS) can routinely determine earthquake location and magnitude in about one minute after the earthquake occurred. However, this reporting time is too long for earthquake <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> pur-poses. A dense, real-time monitoring system composed of 8 strong-motion stations was installed in Hualien area for testing earthquake <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> capability. For the 27 earthquakes occurred during August 1998 to April 1999, this system has successfully reported earthquake information in about 18 sec after the origin time. Therefore, it provided about 15 sec of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> time before shear waves arrival in the Taipei urban area. Based on our experience of these two systems, we are encouraged to proceed for-ward {{in the development of}} an earthquake <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system...|$|R
