25|$|The Common Fisheries Policy {{has been}} argued by certain {{commentators}} to have had disastrous consequences for the environment. This view is contradicted by historical evidence revealing that fishing stocks have been in chronic decline {{over the last century}} as a result of intensive trawl fishing. According to scientific research published in 2010, the depletion of fishing stocks is a consequence of mismanagement long before the Common Fisheries Policy came into being, a statement illustrated by the fact that British catches have declined by 94% over the last 118 years. Nonetheless, the Common Fisheries Policy has continued the trend of ineffective fisheries management in European waters. Indeed, the Common Fisheries Policy <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>little</b> if anything to reverse the decline of European fish stocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} the quotas <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>little</b> to remedy the {{perceptions}} of Bumiputra bias in the public tertiary education system. Most Bumiputras opt to enter a one-year matriculation programme, which is considered {{by some to be}} less intensive than the two-year Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM) or Malaysian High Certificate of Education, which is equivalent to the British A-levels. Although the 'grade' standards required for admission are the same for both programmes, there is no moderation to ensure the difficulty of achieving a grade standard is the same between both programmes. The Malaysian High Certificate of Education is open to all races, but the Matriculation programme has a 10% quota for non-bumiputras. In practice significantly more Bumiputra enter the matriculation program, even after normalising for ethnic demographics.|$|E
25|$|Government {{safety net}} {{programs}} {{put in place}} since the War on Poverty have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>little</b> to reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs the poverty rate would be 29% today. An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor. A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs like food stamps, social security and the federal EITC, the poverty rate in the U.S. would be much higher. Nevertheless, the U.S. has the weakest social safety net of all developed nations. Sociologist Monica Prasad of Northwestern University argues that this developed because of government intervention rather than lack of it, which pushed consumer credit for meeting citizens' needs rather than applying social welfare policies as in Europe.|$|E

From 1971 to 2000, obesity rates in the United States increased from 14.5% to 30.9%. During the same period, an increase occurred in the average amount of food energy consumed. For women, the average increase was [...] per day ( [...] in 1971 and [...] in 2004), while for men the average increase was [...] per day ( [...] in 1971 and [...] in 2004). Most of this extra food energy came from an increase in carbohydrate consumption rather than fat consumption. [...] The primary sources of these extra carbohydrates are sweetened beverages, which now account for almost 25 percent of daily food energy in young adults in America, and potato chips. [...] Consumption of sweetened drinks such as soft drinks, fruit drinks, iced tea, and energy and vitamin water drinks is believed to be contributing to the rising rates of obesity and to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency is related to diseases associated with obesity.|$|E

In these years, Bridgeman's octagonal pond and [...] lake were extended and given a [...] "naturalistic" [...] shape, and a Palladian bridge was added in 1744, probably to Gibbs's design. Brown contrived a Grecian valley which, despite its name, is an abstract composition of landform and woodland, and developed the Hawkwell Field, with Gibbs's most notable building, the Gothic Temple (now one of the properties leased from the National Trust but maintained by The Landmark Trust).

2500|$|Leo {{then goes}} on to note that, [...] "the {{majority}} of the students receiving assistance under the act are Black and Brown." [...] There have been various other Acts enacted to try and aid impoverished youth with the chance to succeed. One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This Act was meant to increase the accountability of public schools and their teachers by creating standardized testing which would give an overview {{of the success of the}} school's ability to educate their students. Schools which repeatedly performed poorly would have increased attention and assistance from the federal government. One of the intended outcomes of the Act was to narrow the class and racial achievement gap in the United States by instituting common expectations for all students. Test scores have shown to be improving for minority populations, however, they are improving at the same rate for Caucasian children as well. This Act therefore, <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>little</b> to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.|$|E

2500|$|Car {{ownership}} in Greece between 1990 and 2004 increased by 121% [...] Skopelos reflects this trend {{and the local}} authorities are hard pressed {{to deal with the}} increased traffic and parking issues. Along with the resident population of cars, the burden of tourist and summer resident vehicles and the availability of rental cars and motorbikes has created problems for which solutions have not yet been found. The construction of a large asphalt parking area along the waterfront in the late 1990s <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>little</b> to address the parking problems facing the town of Skopelos. During the summer the population of the island increases from about 5,000 to between 15,000 and 20,000 (est. 1993). The island is served by commuter hydrofoils and ferryboats from the ports of Volos Magnesia and Agios Konstantinos, Phthiotis on mainland Greece which also allows connections to and from Alonissos and Skiathos. In summer there is a ferry to and from [...] Kymi in Euboea. Skopelos has one main road which links the three main villages by coach several times daily. In the mid-1980s the mayor's council voted to apply to the Ministry of the Interior for the construction of an airport. The application was denied.

2500|$|Despite being {{regarded}} as an iconic figure and a popular member of the Royal Family, Diana was subject to criticism during her life. Patrick Jephson, her private secretary of eight years, wrote {{in an article in}} The Daily Telegraph that [...] " [...] had an extra quality that frustrated her critics during her lifetime and <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>little</b> to soften their disdain since her death". Some have said that it was Diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she knew that they were the source of her power, thus she had [...] "overburdened herself with public duties" [...] and destroyed the border between private and public life. Diana was famously criticised by philosophy professor Anthony O'Hear, who in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties, her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy, and she was [...] "self-indulgent" [...] in her philanthropic efforts. Following his remarks, the Princess was defended by the charity organisations that were supported by her, and Peter Luff who called O'Hear's comments [...] "distasteful and inappropriate". Further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself, which in return [...] "demeaned her royal office". Diana's unique type of charity work, which sometimes included physical contact with people affected by serious diseases, in some cases, had a negative reflection in the media.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{complaints}} {{about the use of}} migrant workers, the Act does not require that contractors show that workers engaged are local residents, but rather requires that laborers be paid the local prevailing wage. Due to the way the data were collected at that time and {{due to the fact that}} construction trades were heavily unionized at that time by craft unions, “prevailing wage” effectively meant “union journeyman wage” as discussed above. Unions operate by negotiating for higher wages, and then working to restrict those eligible for the higher wages to union membership. Craft unions did not admit black apprentices, and therefore black laborers did not have the opportunity to advance to journeyman status. According to Bernstein, “as of 1940 blacks composed 19 percent of the 435,000 unskilled [...] "construction laborers" [...] in the United States and 45 percent of the 87,060 in the South”, and according to Hill, [...] "the increase of Negro participation in building trades apprenticeship training programs rose only from 1.5% to 2%" [...] in New York between 1950 and 1960. Furthermore, Hill pointed out that [...] "ecause the National Labor Relations Board <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>little</b> to enforce the anti-closed shop provisions of the Taft Hartley Act, building trades unions affiliated to the AFL-CIO in most instances are closed unions operating closed shops". Therefore, the requirements and mechanisms of the Davis–Bacon Act necessarily prevented black laborers from participating in federally funded construction projects. “According to a study on youth and minority employment published by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on July 6, 1977, Davis–Bacon wage requirements discourage nonunion contractors from bidding on Federal construction work, thus harming minority and young workers who are more likely to work in the nonunionized sector of the construction industry.” Thus, even if racism was not the intent, racial discrimination was a result of the law.|$|E
