A problem arises in Newfoundland which, although using Canadian currency, was {{not a part of}} Canada at the time. The banks in Newfoundland were still obliged to redeem their notes in gold, and so trading in one direction between Canada and the USA began to take place through Newfoundland in order {{to take advantage of the}} arbitrage. This state of affairs did not last for very long because pressure was brought to bear on Newfoundland to amend its legislation in line with Canada's <b>gold</b> <b>embargo.</b> The new Newfoundland legislation took effect at the end of December 1931, and hence Newfoundland also abandoned {{the gold standard}}.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. <b>gold</b> <b>embargo</b> in 1971 and {{the advent}} of a {{floating}} world monetary system was a severe blow for MOL. It changed its financial strategy, keeping more funds in U.S. dollars and in other currencies. More serious was the 1973 oil crisis. MOL immediately cancelled tankers under construction and recorded its best business performance since the merger; freight revenue topped Â¥327.5 billion. Soon afterward, however, results deteriorated rapidly and the downslide continued until 1978.|$|E
