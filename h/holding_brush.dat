5000|$|The artists {{designed}} and printed T-shirts for Philly Painting project {{with the help}} of Germantown Avenue merchants. The idea of team T-shirts originated when the Haas&Hahn were working in Rio de Janeiro under Favela Painting project. Urhahn said the uniforms were a means of self-preservation because the painters were getting shot while in Rio. The police in armored vehicles thought the painters had guns in their hands, when they were just <b>holding</b> <b>brushes.</b> To protect the painters, they designed T-shirts that said [...] "pintor" [...] (painter) on the front. Philly Painting T-shirts became popular in the area during and after the project. Other merchandise was also prepared {{with the help of}} local merchants.|$|R

50|$|Her third son, Arthur MacMorrough Kavanagh, {{was born}} without fully formed limbs. Some {{attributed}} the disability to a peasant’s curse, whilst others have speculated {{it was due}} to Lady Kavanagh taking laudanum during her pregnancy. Kavanagh refused to treat her son differently to his siblings, {{and with the help of}} local doctor Francis Boxwell, raised him as a normal child. During his initial education, Kavanagh taught Arthur herself, teaching him to paint and then write by <b>holding</b> <b>brushes</b> and pens in his mouth. With the help of the surgeon Sir Philip Crampton, she has a mechanical wheelchair constructed for Arthur, and also encouraged him to ride horses and engage in other outdoor activities. Kavanagh's husband died after 12 years of marriage, in 1837.|$|R

5000|$|Heavy body {{acrylics}} {{are typically}} {{found in the}} Artist and Student Grade paints. [...] "Heavy Body" [...] refers to the viscosity or thickness of the paint. They are {{the best choice for}} impasto or heavier paint applications and will <b>hold</b> a <b>brush</b> or knife stroke and even a medium stiff peak. Gel Mediums ("pigment-less paints") are also available in various viscosities and used to thicken or thin paints, as well as extend paints and add transparency.|$|R
5000|$|Hemessen {{is shown}} at half length and <b>holding</b> a <b>brush,</b> looking {{outwards}} {{as if at}} her own image as she records it on the oak panel in front of her.

Her face is painted with soft brush-strokes, while the textures of her gown are distinguished using {{a wider variety of}} brushmarks.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{several other}} {{species that are}} able to produce {{abstract}} art, elephants using their trunks to <b>hold</b> <b>brushes</b> create paintings which some have compared to the work of abstract expressionists. However, it is unclear whether the elephants assign any meaning to the paintings that they have created. Elephant art is now commonly featured at zoos, and is shown in museums and galleries around the world. [...] Ruby at the Phoenix Zoo is considered the original elephant art star, [...] and her paintings have sold for as much as $25,000. [...] Ruby chose her own colors and was said to have a keen sense of which colour she wished to use. [...] The Asian Elephant Art & Conservation Project, an [...] "elephant art academy" [...] in New York, teaches retired elephants to paint. For paintings that resemble identifiable objects, teachers give the elephants guidance. [...] An example of this was shown in the TV program Extraordinary Animals, in which elephants at a camp in Thailand were able to draw portraits with flowers. Although the images were drawn by the elephants, there was always a trainer assisting and guiding the movement.|$|R
50|$|A fibrous bristle load holds {{significant}} amounts of water which mix with the soap lifted from a shaving mug or scuttle. The more water a <b>brush</b> <b>holds,</b> the moister and richer a lather will be. Thicker and more emollient lather translates to less razor skipping and dragging.|$|R

50|$|In {{the winter}} of 1919-1920, the family {{traveled}} via train to Harbin, Manchuria. Living in Manchuria, Kluge first discovered an interest in art while learning Chinese. Kluge enjoyed beauty of drawing the characters of Mandarin and proper technique for <b>holding</b> the <b>brush.</b> Eventually, with the situation in Manchuria changing, {{the family moved to}} Beijing. At school in Beijing, Kluge was first introduced to formal art study, studying {{under the direction of the}} Russian artist Podgursky Chernomyrdin. Although he demonstrated real talent as an artist, he would pursue architecture in France.|$|R
50|$|In 1962 the Israeli daily {{newspaper}} Haaretz {{hired him to}} draw daily caricatures. A year later, he was given his own a permanent section in the Friday edition of the newspaper. This section used to feature one big caricature which extended across the whole page, and which included several different current events which were connected under one motif. These caricatures were always accompanied by his own little self-portrait {{in which he was}} <b>holding</b> a <b>brush</b> with dripping ink. Farkash continued to work for Haaretz another forty years, until a few months before his death.|$|R
50|$|While robotic {{expressionism}} {{may have}} existed in undocumented forms before them, Price and MacDougall are credited {{with being the}} first roboticists to publicly display art that aligned with the theory of robotic expressionism. They began work on their first robot artist, named RobART, in the Spring of 2012. RobART was composed primarily of VEX Robotics components and had several appendages <b>holding</b> paint <b>brushes,</b> foam brushes, a foam stamp, and spray paint cans. RobART painted {{on the ground and}} moved around on its paintings with twelve wheels; it was programmed using the RobotC language.|$|R
5000|$|Quote from Alex Mendelssohn in Big Planet: [...] "Most {{of my work}} is spiritual. The {{spirits are}} {{definitely}} around us. And that drives us into a direction. When I am working on a spiritual painting, the spirit does the work. It is like someone having a vision {{that no one else}} can see. I can even talk to people while I am painting, but it is not me that is painting, I am only <b>holding</b> the <b>brush.</b> This does not happen every day. When it happens, the spirits and art become one." ...|$|R
60|$|The rim-rock {{came out}} to a point above me, seeming unscalable, all grown over with brush and lichen, and stunted spruce.

50|$|Gen {{looks for}} work {{to pay the}} family's rent. A man hires him to look after his brother Seiji, who has been burnt {{from head to toe}} and lives in squalor. Though Seiji is {{reluctant}} at first, he warms up to Gen over time: The boy learns Seiji is an artist who has lost the will to live because his burns have left him unable to <b>hold</b> a <b>brush.</b> With Gen's help, Seiji learns to paint with his teeth but, eventually, he dies of his wounds. On August 14, Emperor Hirohito announces Japan's surrender over the radio, ending the war.|$|R
50|$|Sara Leighton {{was born}} as Shirley Lorimer in London in 1937, {{the sister of}} actress Carole Lorimer. Her {{ambition}} {{was to become a}} painter since she was old enough to <b>hold</b> a <b>brush,</b> and this she pursued under the tutelage of Pietro Annigoni. She stated that Annigoni gave me the heart to fight for a career when the cards of my sex, youth and country of origin were neatly stacked against me... he was a strict disciplinarian. In her youth she acted in numerous TV and film roles under both her birth name, Shirley Lorimer and her assumed name Sara Leighton.|$|R
5000|$|Liang Kai was a Chinese {{painter who}} lived in the 13th century (Song dynasty). He called himself [...] "Madman Liang," [...] and he spent his life {{drinking}} and painting. Eventually, he retired and became a Zen monk. Liang is credited with inventing the Zen school of Chinese art. Wen Tong was a painter {{who lived in}} the 11th century. He was famous for ink paintings of bamboo. He could <b>hold</b> two <b>brushes</b> in one hand and paint two different distanced bamboos simultaneously. He did not need to see the bamboo while he painted them because he had seen a lot of them.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{deliberate}} contradictions and explorations of mirror images at play. Hemessen <b>holds</b> the <b>brush</b> with her right hand; she would have corrected the reversal on the reflected image. Her head as shown on the panel is undersized and situated on the top left; that is opposite to the position her head appears on the actual painting. Her head is turned {{in the direction of the}} viewer but her eyes do not meet the viewer's. Typical of her work, the background is plain and dark, and gives no indication of the space occupied by the sitter.|$|R
