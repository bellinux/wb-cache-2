50|$|Electrokinetic {{phenomena}} {{refers to}} a variety of effects resulting from an electrical double layer. A noteworthy example is electrophoresis, where a charged particle suspended in a media will move {{as a result of an}} applied electrical field. Electrophoresis is widely used in biochemistry to distinguish molecules, such as proteins, based on size and charge. Other examples include <b>electro-osmosis,</b> sedimentation potential, and streaming potential.|$|E
50|$|The Nano {{electrokinetic}} thruster is {{a theoretical}} space propulsion {{system based on}} the principle of <b>electro-osmosis</b> (also electroosmotic flow). It allows for a high specific impulse and high thrust-to-power ratio as well as a high final velocity which makes it suitable {{for a wide variety of}} applications.

50|$|The {{electrophoresis}} of {{the particles}} and the <b>electro-osmosis</b> become essential when the filtration process is overlaid with electric field. By electrofiltration the conventional filtration is overlaid {{with an electric}} field (DC) which works parallel with the filtrate’s flow direction. When the electrophoretic force FE, oppositely directed to flow, overruns the hydrodynamic resistance force FW, the charged particles migrate from the filter medium, thus reducing significantly {{the thickness of the}} filter cake on the membrane.|$|E
50|$|Electrohydro{{dynamics}} (EHD), {{also known}} as electro-fluid-dynamics (EFD) or electrokinetics, {{is the study of}} the dynamics of electrically charged fluids. It is the study of the motions of ionized particles or molecules and their interactions with electric fields and the surrounding fluid. The term may be considered to be synonymous with the rather elaborate electrostrictive hydrodynamics. ESHD covers the following types of particle and fluid transport mechanisms: electrophoresis, electrokinesis, dielectrophoresis, <b>electro-osmosis,</b> and electrorotation. In general, the phenomena relate to the direct conversion of electrical energy into kinetic energy, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|From the {{instrumental}} viewpoint, {{there are two}} different experimental techniques: microelectrophoresis and electrophoretic light scattering. Microelectrophoresis has the advantage of yielding an image of the moving particles. On the other hand, it is complicated by <b>electro-osmosis</b> at the walls of the sample cell. Electrophoretic light scattering is based on dynamic light scattering. It allows measurement in an open cell which eliminates the problem of electro-osmotic flow for the case of an Uzgiris, but not a capillary cell. And, {{it can be used to}} characterize very small particles, but at the price of the lost ability to display images of moving particles.|$|E
50|$|Iontophoresis, {{also known}} as Ionization, is a {{physical}} process in which ions flow diffusively in a medium driven {{by the use of}} an electric current. Iontophoresis is to be distinguished from the carriage of uncharged molecules by diffusive fluxes of other molecules, especially of solvent molecules, for example by <b>electro-osmosis,</b> that is to say by flux of uncharged solvent molecules carried as a cross-effect of iontophoresis. These phenomena, directly and indirectly, constitute active transport of matter due to an applied electric current. The transport is measured in units of chemical flux, commonly µmol/cm2h. Iontophoresis has experimental, therapeutic and diagnostic applications.|$|E
5000|$|In {{vascular}} plant biology, <b>electro-osmosis</b> {{is also used}} as an alternative or supplemental explanation for the movement of polar liquids via the phloem that differs from the cohesion-tension theory supplied in the mass flow hypothesis and others, such as cytoplasmic streaming. Companion cells {{are involved in the}} [...] "cyclic" [...] withdrawal of ions (K+) from sieve tubes, and their secretion parallel to their position of withdrawal between sieve plates, resulting in polarisation of sieve plate elements alongside potential difference in pressure, and results in polar water molecules and other solutes present moved upward through the phloem.|$|E
5000|$|A leaf beetle has an {{incredible}} ability {{to adhere to}} dry surfaces by using numerous capillary bridges between the tiny hair-like setae on its feet. Vogel and Steen [...] noted this and designed and constructed a switchable wet adhesion mechanism that mimics this ability. They used standard photolithography techniques to fabricate a switchable adhesion gripper that used a pump driven by <b>electro-osmosis</b> to create many capillary bridges that would hold on to just about any surface. The leaf beetle can also reverse this effect by trapping air bubbles between its setae to walk on wet surfaces or under water. This effect was demonstrated by Hosoda and Gorb [...] when they constructed a biomimetic surface that could adhere objects to surfaces under water. Using this technology could help to create autonomous robots that {{would be able to}} explore treacherous terrain that is otherwise too dangerous to explore.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>electro-osmosis</b> or electroosmotic flow creates {{a flow of}} an electrolyte through a very small tube in the nano-meter range. To achieve this flow there is a cathode and an anode {{at the ends of}} the tube over which a voltage is applied. Due to this voltage the ions in the electrolyte stored in a reservoir directly connected to the tube can be accelerated and ejected. This way electrical energy is transformed into kinetic energy. The amount of thrust created by one nano thruster is in the micro newton range, however due to its size it makes sense to arrange a big amount in an array to achieve sufficient thrust. The thrust, exit velocity of the ions and the mass flow rate of the electrolyte are influenced by the applied voltage which makes it easy to regulate those parameters. The applied voltage and the pH-value of the electrolyte (amount of ions it contains) also vary the balance between thrust, efficiency and maximal exhaust velocity (determines the maximal achievable flight velocity). It is also theoretically possible to achieve a very high efficiency of nearly 100% as well as a high specific impulse and high thrust-to-power ratio. This system has not yet been build and experimentally tested because of difficulties with the production of the nano-tubes needed for it.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electro-osmosis</b> {{consolidation}} is {{an innovative}} and effective ground improvement method for soft clays. But <b>electro-osmosis</b> {{is also a}} very complicated process, as the mechanical behaviour, and hydraulic and electrical properties of the soil are changing rapidly during the treatment process; this makes electroosmosis hard to describe and simulate. Traditional <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation theory cannot provide a satisfactory solution, because it does not directly consider the mechanical behaviour of the soil and the coupling between the soil deformation, <b>electro-osmosis</b> flow and pore pressure. A numerical model for the <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation of clay in multi-dimensional domains is presented, with the coupling of the soil mechanical behaviour, pore water transport and electrical fields being considered. Three fully coupled governing equations considering force equilibrium, pore water transport and electrical distribution are presented and solved using COMSOL. The model is verified against the well-known classical analytical solution for <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation. A two-dimensional numerical model is then simulated to investigate the settlement and excess pore pressure profile during the <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation process. It is found that the peak excess pore pressure is developed {{near the bottom of the}} anode and that the maximum settlement is developed near the top of the anode. Moreover, excess pore pressures and settlements develop very rapidly at the beginning of the <b>electro-osmosis</b> treatment, but then become slower with time.

40|$|Consolidation of soft clay {{creates a}} lot of {{problems}} in foundation engineering, because of the very low clay permeability and high compressibility. Primary consolidation {{takes a long time to}} complete if the material is left consolidating under atmospheric evaporation, and traditional dewatering techniques, such as surcharge preloading, vacuum preloading or vertical drains, have been used for decades to shorten the consolidation time. Among new soft ground improvement technologies, <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation is receiving much attention as a possible time efficient solution. <b>Electro-osmosis</b> is a novel technique to consolidate soft clays, and involves the flow of pore fluid in a soil mass in response to an applied electrical field. The electrodes (positive and negative) are installed in pairs in the soil mass; the direct current then forces ions in the mobile part of the electric double layer (EDL) to move from the anode towards the cathode, causing water flow. <b>Electro-osmosis</b> is found to be more effective in clayey soils because the <b>electro-osmosis</b> permeability is independent of the grain size. This means that electroosmosis can generate flow rates that are 100 to 1000 times greater than hydraulic flows in fine grained soft clays. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a numerical model for simulating multidimensional and fully coupled multi-physics <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation, including the elasto-plastic behaviour of soil and time dependent transport parameters at large strain. Special attention is paid to the simulation of complicated geometries and boundary conditions, and to the inclusion of more advanced elasto-plastic constitutive models. The overall goal is to develop a more realistic numerical tool which addresses the main features of <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation, and that has potential use in the design and optimization of field applications. In this thesis, numerical models for the <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation of soft clays in multi-dimensional domains at large strain are presented, which consider the full coupling of the soil mechanical behaviour, pore water transport, pore gas transport and electric flow. In particular, elasto-plastic constitutive models (i. e. the Modified Cam Clay model and Barcelona Basic Model) are employed to describe the mechanical behaviour of the clay, and some empirical expressions are employed to describe the nonlinear transport parameters. The proposed models have been verified against analytical/numerical solutions and also evaluated with results obtained formlaboratory experiments. Overall, excellent agreement has been found, which demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed models. Updated Lagrangian formulations are employed to account for the geometric nonlinearity. The importance of considering large strains in a consistent and proper way is demonstrated, and differences with models based on small strain theory are highlighted. As deformation is the key concern during consolidation behaviour, various numerical examples are investigated to study the deformation characteristics. The ratio of <b>electro-osmosis</b> permeability to hydraulic permeability keo/kw is a key factor in <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation. Generally, <b>electro-osmosis</b> permeability and hydraulic permeability decrease with a decrease in the void ratio and degree of water saturation, but the decrease in hydraulic conductivity is much faster than the decrease of <b>electro-osmosis</b> permeability, so the ratio keo/kw increases during the consolidation process. A field test of <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation has been analysed, showing excellent agreement between the computed and measured settlements. Various electrode configurations, as well as current intermittence and current reversal approaches for <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation have also been investigated using the proposed model. The particular contribution of this thesis is that it introduces a realistic numerical tool for the simulation of <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation. It is able to simulate field applications with complicated boundary and geometry conditions, as well as practical applications such as current intermittence and polarity reversal, which are often employed in the field to achieve efficient and economical consolidation. Feasibility studies and a proper design are important for the field application of <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation. Hence this numerical tool has potential use in the design and analysis of <b>electro-osmosis</b> consolidation, including the assessment of factors for achieving optimal dewatering effects and estimating the cost.

40|$|Since its {{prediction}} {{fifteen years}} ago, electro-osmotic instability has {{been attributed to}} non-equilibrium <b>electro-osmosis</b> related to the extended space charge which develops at the limiting current in the course of concentration polarization at a charge-selective interface.

Secondly, {{it has been shown that}} non-equilibrium <b>electro-osmosis</b> can.

40|$|The {{removal of}} {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from clayey soils is an intricate task. The low porosity of compacted clayey soil hinders bacterial activity and makes convective removal by hydraulic flow impossible. <b>Electro-osmosis</b> {{is a process that}} has been used for the mobilization and cleanup of contaminants in clayey soils with varying successes. The present study focuses on the remediation of a contaminated peaty clay soil, located in Olst - the Netherlands, by means of <b>electro-osmosis.</b> The soil was originally contaminated by an asphalt production plant, active from 1903 to 1983, and presents high levels of all 16 priority PAHs indicated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
