Its front is finished in brick, and the side wall facing Alder is stuccoed. The main facade is two bays wide, except the ground floor, where the main entrance is set in the leftmost of three bays. The ground floor brickwork shows evidence (supported by building documentation) of having been refaced after a commercial storefront had been installed.|$|E
50|$|On May 10, 2010, NTSB {{inspectors}} {{attempted to}} replicate {{the problem with the}} pilothouse controls. Because the vessel was docked during the testing, the units were tested without the engines running. Hydraulic pressure to the units was supplied by electric standby pumps, which limited the maximum attainable pitch command to 75%. When a full ahead pitch command was input from either pilothouse, both units responded normally. When a neutral pitch command was then input, the Staten Island end propulsion unit responded normally to the command, while the New York <b>end</b> <b>unit</b> remained locked at 75% thrust. When control was subsequently transferred to the engine room, both propulsion units responded normally to commands.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of butadiene and isoprene polymerization {{in the presence}} of CpTiCl 3 -MAO initiator has been investigated by means of EHT and ab-initio computations, with the purpose of understanding the factors responsible for the very different homopolymerization rates of the two monomers. The catalytically active species is assumed to be the highly unsaturated [CpTi-R](+) organotitanium cation (R = growing polymer chain). It is shown that coordination of an incoming monomer to the active species forces the <b>ending</b> <b>unit</b> of R to rearrange from the initial eta(3) allylic coordination to the a one. This step is energetically much easier when the <b>ending</b> <b>unit</b> is butenyl rather than 2 -methylbutenyl. No significant differences between butadiene and isoprene have been found for the insertion step; therefore, the large difference in the homopolymerization rates of butadiene and isoprene appears to be due to the highest reactivity of the growing chain ending with a butenyl unit...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of butadiene and isoprene polymerization {{in the presence}} of CpTiCl 3 -MAO has been investigated by means of ab initio computations. According to experimental evidence, the catalytically active species are assumed to be [CpTi-P](+) organotitanium cations (P = growing polymer chain). The results show that (i) in the active species, P is coordinated to Ti both with the pi allyl group of its <b>ending</b> <b>unit</b> and with the pi bond of the penultimate unit; (ii) the cis eta(4) coordination of an incoming monomer to the active species requires the breakage of the latter interaction and the change of the allyl coordination mode from eta(3) to eta(1) That significant rearrangement of P is predicted to be the rate-determining step of the whole propagation reaction and is predicted to be much easier when the <b>ending</b> <b>unit</b> of P is butenyl rather than 2 -methylbutenyl. That finding accounts both for the large difference observed in the homopolymerization rates of butadiene and isoprene and for the fact that in copolymerizations the two monomers exhibit almost the same reactivity...|$|R
50|$|The Will Marion Cook House {{is located}} {{on the north side of}} West 138th Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues. This area, known as Strivers' Row, was home to a number of {{well-known}} people during the height of Harlem's cultural successes of the early 20th century. It is an <b>end</b> <b>unit</b> of a row of sixteen three-story Renaissance Revival brick rowhouses, built by developer David H. King in 1891. The ground floor is two bays wide, with the main entrance in the left bay, set in a rounded-arch opening. The second floor features a single three-part window, with narrow sidelights flanking a larger central sash, separated by Ionic columns; a half-round terra cotta panel above the center window gives the grouping the feel of a Palladian window. The third floor has a central sash window, separated from side narrow windows by brickwork. First and third-floor window bays all feature splayed lintels of terra cotta.|$|E

40|$|Passive optical {{networks}} {{are widely used}} because of their sufficient bandwidth and low price of individual elements. Based on the European Commission, The Czech Republic ISPs have to ensure 30 Mbit/s (in existing networks) and 100 Mbit/s (in new constructed networks) for each customer in selected areas till 2020. Nowadays, the GPON standard is dominating in the Europe due to its low price and maturity. In general, the passive optical {{networks are}} based on P 2 MP (Point to Multipoint) physical topology. Therefore each <b>end</b> <b>unit</b> receives data meant for all units. To mitigate this, the standard defines an encryption method (authentication and key exchange phase) but the key exchange phase relies only on a single unique parameter (serial number of an <b>end</b> <b>unit).</b> A new unique parameter for the key exchange phase is proposed. No modification of the transmission convergence layer in GPON is considered. A measuring scheme for determining of accuracy of our new unique parameter, called [T_{prop}], is also proposed...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to define the effects of end units on supply air quality, {{to find out whether}} there is need for further investigation, and to gain more knowledge for the development of sensory testing. A sensory panel assessed the odour intensity of new units and a used <b>end</b> <b>unit.</b> The amount of dust collected {{on the surface of the}} used unit was measured. Sensory testing is a difficult method to use and it needs developing. Because of the small number of end units tested, it is questionable to draw very definite conclusions. The results showed that the majority of the new end units assessed with this method seemed to have some effect on the odour intensity of the test room but the used <b>end</b> <b>unit</b> did not have, although it was visibly dirty. Methods should be developed which would enable researchers to determine the reasons for odour emissions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{examine the}} {{hypotheses}} that the Streptomyces lividans potassium channel KcsA is gated at neutral pH by the electrochemical potential, {{and that its}} selectivity and conductance are governed at the cytoplasmic face by interactions between the KcsA polypeptides and a core molecule of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP). The four polypeptides of KcsA are postulated to surround the <b>end</b> <b>unit</b> of the polyP molecule with a collar of eight arginines, thereby modulating the negative charge of the polyP <b>end</b> <b>unit</b> and increasing its preference for binding monovalent cations. Here we show that KcsA channels can be activated in planar lipid bilayers at pH 7. 4 by the chemical potential alone. Moreover, {{one or both of}} the C-terminal arginines are replaced with residues of progressively lower basicity–lysine, histidine, valine, asparagine–and the effects of these mutations on conductance and selectivity for K+ over Mg 2 + is tested in planar bilayers as a function of Mg 2 + concentration and pH. As the basicity of the C-terminal residues decreases, Mg 2 + block increases, and Mg 2 + becomes permeant when medium pH is greater than the pI of the C-terminal residues. The results uphold the premise that polyP and the C-terminal arginines are decisive elements in KcsA channel regulation...|$|E

The RCTBC is reformulated in terms of these newly computed values of control points and four free parameters.|$|E
