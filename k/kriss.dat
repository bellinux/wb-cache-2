50|$|<b>Krisses</b> {{have long}} had mystical powers {{attributed}} {{to them in}} Indonesian and Malay mythology. These powers, {{such as the ability}} to go about without its owner or to kill enemies by being pointed in their direction, could be either good or bad; the weapons could also have elemental powers and have different affinities with different people. Beliefs in the sacred power of <b>krisses</b> remain common in Indonesia, and they are often used in Javanese ceremonies.|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} begins with short {{introductions}} to the characters Goldie, Yosef, <b>Kriss,</b> Ace, and Mandee. Perry is then shown entering {{all of the}} parties as [...] "five of the world’s worst birthday entertainers" [...] in disguise. At a man's 90th birthday, Goldie emerges from a large birthday cake and begins to give the man a lap dance. At a child's birthday party, <b>Kriss</b> the Clown attempts to create balloon animals, while Ace the Animal Trainer introduces {{a group of children}} to a box of mice before appearing to eat one, which makes a child cry. At another child's party, Princess Mandee paints a girl's face incompetently; Goldie begins to suffer from respiratory problems, and Yosef does the worm at a boy's Bar Mitzvah. Goldie pulls a man's prosthetic leg off and proceeds to play air guitar with it, and <b>Kriss</b> crashes into a table before drinking alcohol behind a tree.|$|E
500|$|The BBC Editorial Standards Committee in 2007 {{found that}} [...] "there was no {{evidence}} to suggest that the BBC had shown a specific and systemic bias in favour of cases where the victim had been black or Asian", but accepted it had [...] "underplayed its coverage of the Ross Parker case" [...] and repeated the failings in its coverage of the Murder of <b>Kriss</b> Donald.|$|E
500|$|Alexander <b>Kriss</b> of Kill Screen {{found the}} game's {{historical}} {{information to be}} [...] "both genuinely educational but also tantalizing in their brevity", noting their reinforcement of the story's themes. IGN's Rad commended the game's ability to deliver enriching information [...] "without bombarding" [...] players. Gameplanet's Todd deemed the setting of Iran [...] "convincing and real", praising its complexity and detail, although found {{the density of the}} history somewhat overwhelming. Eurogamer's Matulef felt that the information may provide too much backstory for the characters and events, but attributed this to personal preferences.|$|E
5000|$|The alun-alun lor also {{historically}} functioned for a {{place for}} public corporal punishments and executions. Condemned criminals were publicly executed by <b>krissing</b> (using a keris to stab the condemned from the left shoulder blade downward into the heart) beside the enclosed banyan trees of the alun-alun lor. For especially heinous criminals, most especially traitors and vicious brigands the condemned's head would be impaled on a pike as a macabre public warning ...|$|R
60|$|Half a {{dozen of}} the ladders were upset, the men who had mounted them coming heavily to the ground. Some of these, as they rose, at once took to their heels; others, drawing their <b>krisses,</b> rushed at their assailants. But the lads were no longer alone. At the first shout, the doors of the huts had opened; and the {{inhabitants}} rushed out, with their arms. The remaining ladders were instantly overthrown, and a shower of arrows poured upon their assailants.|$|R
60|$|And when it {{was quite}} certain that every village had sent in its bundle, the Rajah divided the needles into twelve equal parts, and ordered the best {{steelworker}} in Mataram to bring his forge and his bellows and his hammers to the palace, {{and to make the}} twelve <b>krisses</b> under the Rajah's eye, and in the sight of all men who chose to see it. And when they were finished, they were wrapped up in new silk and put away carefully until they might be wanted.|$|R
500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Birthday" [...] {{was directed by}} Marc Klasfeld and Danny Lockwood; Dawn Rose served as a producer, while Nicole Acacio served as executive producer, Richard Alarcon sereved as the editor, Tony Gardner as the make-up artist, and Joseph Robbins {{was the director of}} photography. For the video, which was filmed in April 2014, Perry played the characters of five party entertainers, appearing in five parties. They consisted of a burlesque-like elderly woman named Goldie, a Jewish master of ceremonies named Yosef Shulem, a clown named <b>Kriss,</b> an animal trainer named Ace, and a face-painter named Princess Mandee. In order to transform Perry physically to each character, she spent up to seven hours getting prosthetic makeup applied by Tony Gardner.|$|E
500|$|Criticism was {{directed}} at the game's quick-time sequences. Kotakus Narcisse considered them clunky, and Eurogamer's Matulef {{found them to be}} [...] "poorly constructed". Game Informers Gwaltney similarly felt them to be [...] "shoehorned" [...] in between dialogue encounters. Kill Screens <b>Kriss</b> wrote that such sequences are featured in games like The Walking Dead (2012) to reinforce a sense of urgency in players, but felt that this is unnecessary in 1979 Revolution, as [...] "the tension already feels real enough". The game's visuals also received mixed responses. Game Informers Gwaltney considered the art and environments [...] "impeccable", but criticized the character models; Eurogamer's Matulef likewise condemned the models and textures, describing the graphics as [...] "competent at best and an eyesore at worst". IGN's Rad echoed similar remarks, identifying awkward animations of background characters, and Gameplanet's Todd felt that 1979 Revolution [...] "lacks the polish" [...] of works by Telltale Games.|$|E
500|$|At {{the elderly}} man's party, Goldie collapses {{and a woman}} tries to use a {{defibrillator}} on her. While attempting to hit a piñata, <b>Kriss</b> walks onto the road to cause a car crash which shocks the party attendees. At the petting cage, Ace lets a goat run wild which defecates and urinates on the ground; meanwhile Goldie drops a birthday cake on the 90-year-old man, Yosef is then shown beatboxing at the Bar Mitzvah to the disapproval of the guests. Princess Mandee takes off her hat, wig and mask and reveals herself to be Perry, to which the children scream in pleasure. Goldie eats cake with the elderly man, before straddling him on his wheelchair. At {{the end of the}} song, Princess Mandee and the children say [...] "happy birthday" [...] to the camera. During the credits, the characters dance and lip sync to a remixed version of the song.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} {{the removal of the}} tolls is highly charged politically. Several members of the state Democratic Party {{declared}} this as a political maneuver to bolster the gubernatorial campaign of Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey, a Republican, who was behind in the polls {{at the time of the}} announcement. Also, because the MTA Board is composed of Romney appointees, <b>Kriss's</b> former association with the Romney administration and the ongoing election at the time, the issue was clouded by accusations of partiality and political agendas from both sides of the aisle.|$|R
60|$|For a {{time they}} {{contented}} themselves by distant shouting; and then, with a wild yell, charged forward again. Several {{dropped from the}} fire of arrows, {{from those in the}} trees and behind the abbatis but, discharging their arrows in return, the assailants kept on until they again reached the impediment. Here they strove furiously to break through--hacking with their <b>krisses,</b> and endeavoring to pull up the stakes with their hands--but the defenders, in the shade behind, sent their arrows so fast and thick that the assailants again shrank back, and darted away to shelter.|$|R
6000|$|Even as {{he spoke}} a loud shouting, mingled with shrieks and yells, was heard {{at the other end}} of the main street. The sounds of uproar {{appeared}} to approach, and soon a crowd of people was seen rushing towards the market-place, uttering cries of fear in which the word [...] "amok" [...] was heard. At the sound of that word numbers of people-- specially women and children--turned and fled from the scene, but many of the men stood their ground, and all of them drew their <b>krisses.</b> Among the latter of course were the white men and their native companions.|$|R
500|$|Bolt {{stated that}} setting a record {{was not a}} {{priority}} for him, and that his goal was just to win the gold medal, Jamaica's first of the 2008 Games. Olympic medallist <b>Kriss</b> Akabusi construed Bolt's chest slapping before the finish line as showboating, noting that the actions cost Bolt an even faster record time. IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican's actions as disrespectful. Bolt denied {{that this was the}} purpose of his celebration by saying, [...] "I wasn't bragging. When I saw I wasn't covered, I was just happy". Lamine Diack, president of the IAAF, supported Bolt and said that his celebration was appropriate given the circumstances of his victory. Jamaican government minister Edmund Bartlett also defended Bolt's actions, stating, [...] "We have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them. We have to allow the personality of youth to express itself".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. The Orlando Sentinels Roger Moore called The Edukators [...] "a {{surprisingly}} generic German 'Stockholm Syndrome' romantic triangle thriller," [...] adding: [...] "It ends interestingly, but it would've ended better, {{and played}} better, {{had it been}} half an hour shorter." [...] In Slant Magazine, Jason Clark wrote that the film needed [...] "a touch of the perverse", but [...] "Weingartner plays out the drama far too earnestly, and the story barely sustains {{the length of a}} movie half of its running time." [...] According to Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News, [...] "The dialogue between the captive and the captors gets a little didactic, and the ending is as contrived as it is cynical." [...] Similar criticism of the film's didacticism was made by Brett Michel of Boston Phoenix, <b>Kriss</b> Allison of Stylus Magazine and Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Daily News.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Gateshead {{hosted the}} Europa Cup. The men's {{competition}} was {{won for the}} first time by a Great Britain team captained by Linford Christie and which included <b>Kriss</b> Akabusi and Jack Buckner; the event was described a decade later as having had an [...] "invigorating effect" [...] on those who were in attendance. Four years later, on 30 July 1993, a stadium-record crowd of 14,797 watched Christie, by this time the reigning 100m Olympic champion, in action again [...] this time against his old rival Carl Lewis in a race where both men were reportedly paid £100,000 irrespective of the result. Christie won in a time of 10.07 seconds, ahead of Jon Drummond in second and Lewis, who finished [...] "a distant third". The 100m race was the highlight of the [...] "high profile" [...] Vauxhall Invitational meet, which was televised in the UK by ITV and watched by around 10 million viewers. Michael Johnson, John Regis and Steve Cram competed in various events at the Vauxhall Invitational.|$|E
6000|$|It is a {{very true}} and {{expressive}} phrase, [...] "He looked daggers at me," [...] for the first pattern and prototype of all daggers {{must have been a}} glance of the eye. First, there was the glance of Jove's eye, then his fiery bolt, then, the material gradually hardening, tridents, spears, javelins, and finally, for the convenience of private men, daggers, <b>krisses,</b> and so forth, were invented. It is wonderful how we get about the streets without being wounded by these delicate and glancing weapons, a man can so nimbly whip out his rapier, or without being noticed carry it unsheathed. Yet it is rare that one gets seriously looked at.|$|R
60|$|As Number Thirteen arose to {{continue}} his search for Professor Maxon his quick ear caught the shuffling of bare feet upon the verandah. As he paused to listen there broke suddenly upon the still night the hideous war cries of the Dyaks, and the screams and shrieks of their frightened victims in the campong without. Almost simultaneously Professor Maxon and Sing rushed {{into the living room}} to ascertain the cause of the wild alarm, while at the same instant Bududreen's assassins sprang through the door with upraised <b>krisses,</b> to be almost immediately followed by Muda Saffir's six Dyaks brandishing their long spears and wicked parangs.|$|R
6000|$|And {{three days}} {{afterwards}} the Rajah summoned the priests and the princes {{and the chief}} men of Mataram, {{to hear what the}} great spirit had told him {{on the top of the}} mountain. And when they were all assembled, and the betel and sirih had been handed round, he told them what had happened. On the top of the mountain he had fallen into a trance, and the great spirit had appeared to him with a face like burnished gold, and had said--"Oh Rajah! much plague and sickness and fevers are coming upon all the earth, upon men and upon horses and upon cattle; but as you and your people have obeyed me and have come up to my great mountain, I will teach you how you and all the people of Lombock may escape this plague." [...] And all waited anxiously, to hear how they were to be saved from so fearful a calamity. And after a short silence the Rajah spoke again and told them, that the great spirit had commanded that twelve sacred <b>krisses</b> should be made, and that to make them every village and every district must send a bundle of needles--a needle for every head in the village. And when any grievous disease appeared in any village, one of the sacred <b>krisses</b> should be sent there; and if every house in that village had sent the right number of needles, the disease would immediately cease; but if the number of needles sent had not been exact, the kris would have no virtue.|$|R
500|$|Allison Stewart for The Washington Post {{thought that}} [...] "Jump" [...] stood out {{as one of}} the {{highlights}} of Unapologetic, describing it as a [...] "monster in the making". Along with [...] "Stay", Stewart listed [...] "Jump" [...] as her top two songs on the album. Alike Stewart, Melissa Maerz for Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jump" [...] was one of her top recommendations to listen to along with [...] "Diamonds". Stacey-Ann Ellis for Vibe thought that [...] "Jump" [...] could be [...] "mosh-inducing" [...] if played in a nightclub. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush also agreed that [...] "Jump" [...] is one of Unapologetics best songs, writing that [...] "It's an unofficial rule in pop music that any song titled 'Jump' is going to be great (see Pointer Sisters, Van Halen, <b>Kriss</b> Kross, etc.). Rihanna's is no exception". Chris Younie for 4Music echoed Gallucci's sentiments, writing that it is one of the best songs on the album. He further wrote that he felt as though the album peaked after the second track, [...] "Diamonds", had finished, but stated that [...] "Jump" [...] filled void between that and the former.|$|E

60|$|It {{was with}} {{difficulty}} {{that the man}} of science made and noted his measurements, for the people were pressing eagerly round the carcase to gratify their revenge by running their spears into the still warm body. They dipped the points in the blood and passed their <b>krisses</b> broadside over the creature that they might absorb the courage and boldness which were supposed to emanate from it! Then they skinned it, and pieces {{of the heart and}} brain were eaten raw by some of those whose relatives had been killed by tigers. Finally the skull was hacked to pieces for the purpose of distributing the teeth, which are used by the natives as charms.|$|R

Going on shore with the captain and the Chinese supercargo, I was at once introduced to a novel and interesting scene. We went first to the house of the Chinese Bandar, or chief merchant, where we found a number of natives, well dressed, and all conspicuously armed with <b>krisses,</b> displaying their large handles of ivory or gold, or beautifully grained and polished wood.|$|R
60|$|The panic of the Malays had been, in no slight degree, {{caused by}} the {{appearance}} of the two boys; who had purposely stripped to the waist, and had shouted {{at the top of their}} voices as, waving the <b>krisses</b> which they had borrowed, they fell upon the foe. The idea that white devils were leagued with the enemies against them had excited the superstitious fear of the Malays to the utmost; and when, in the morning, scouts again sallied from the village, they found that the enemy had entirely gone--the fact that they had not even returned to carry off the effects which had been abandoned, in the first panic, showing that they had continued their flight, without stopping, to their distant villages.|$|R

(Armstrong also appeared in humorous, albeit risqué, cards that he had printed to send out to friends; the cards bore a picture of him sitting on a toilet—as viewed through a keyhole—with the slogan [...] "Satch says, 'Leave it all behind ya!'") The cards have sometimes been incorrectly described as ads for Swiss <b>Kriss.</b> In a live recording of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Velma Middleton, he changes the lyric from [...] "Put another record on while I pour" [...] to [...] "Take some Swiss <b>Kriss</b> while I pour." ...|$|E

And sometimes the sickness would not go away; and then everybody was convinced {{that there had been a}} mistake in the number of needles sent from that village, and therefore the sacred kris had no effect, and had to be taken back again by the head men with heavy hearts, but still, with all honour--for was not the fault their own? ...|$|R
60|$|After {{the feast}} {{was over the}} chief, after a {{consultation}} with the rest, pointed to a tree close to that in which his own hut was situated. The whole village set to work, ladders were fixed against it; and the men, ascending, hacked away with <b>krisses</b> and stone hatchets at the trunk. Hans--seeing their object--made signs to the chief to lend him his ax and, ascending to the tree, set to work with it; doing, in five minutes, more work than {{the whole of the}} natives employed could have accomplished in an hour. After working for some time, he handed the ax to one of the natives, who continued the work. The tree was not a large one--the trunk, at this point, being about 18 inches in diameter. Half an hour's work sufficed to cut it through; and {{the upper part of the}} tree fell, with a crash.|$|R

The Royal Standard was changed by adding the new Arms of Dominion, which is a golden shield divided into three parts. The first in yellow depicts a three-headed mythical elephant representing Siam, the second quarter in red depicts a single white elephant for Laos (Lan Xang) and the third quarter in pink depicts two crossed <b>Krisses</b> for the Malay suzerainty (Siam was later forced to relinquish these territories by the French and British, respectively). Inside the crown the symbol for the Chakri Dynasty is added; it depicts an intertwined Chakra and Trisula. The flag ratio is 5:6 The name of the Royal Standard was then changed to 'Thong Boromrajathawat Maha Siaminthra' (ธงบรมราชธวัชมหาสยามินทร์), A few years later in 1897 the name was permanently changed to 'Thong Maharaj'.|$|R
