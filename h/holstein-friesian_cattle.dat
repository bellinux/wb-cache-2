Ojango are ILRI authorsThe use of {{imported}} semen within the <b>Holstein-Friesian</b> <b>cattle</b> population in Kenya {{has contributed to}} increased milk production per cow, however, information on how this has impacted on functional traits, particularly early life survival and reproductive performance is scarce. This study evaluated age at first calving (AFC), survival to age at first calving, and survival to four years of age using survival analyses techniques, in <b>Holstein-Friesian</b> <b>cattle</b> on four dairy farms in Kenya. The heritability estimate obtained for AFC was 0. 15 [*]±[*] 0. 06 for an average AFC of 1058 days. Animals sired by New Zealand and Australian born bulls had the earliest average AFC (907 days). On average, 25 % of all the heifers born were culled prior to attaining a first calving, while 34 % were culled prior to four years of age. Though the highest proportion of losses was due to unspecified reasons, the relative risk of being culled was highest when an animal had a specific disease, and the first 60 days of life were the most critical for survival.

40|$|The {{attachment}} to host skin by Rhipicephalus microplus larvae induces {{a series of}} physiological events at the attachment site. The host-parasite interaction might induce {{a rejection of the}} larvae, as is frequently observed in Bos taurus indicus cattle, and under certain conditions in Bos taurus taurus cattle. Ticks deactivate the host rejection response by secreting specific proteins and lipids that play an essential role in manipulation of the host immune response. The available genomic information on the R. microplus tick was mined using bioinformatics approaches to identify R. microplus lipocalins (LRMs). This in silico examination revealed a total of 12 different putative R. microplus LRMs (LRM 1 -LRM 12). The identity of the LRM family showed high sequence variability: from 6 % between LRM 7 and LRM 8 to 55. 9 % between LRM 2 and LRM 6. However, the three-dimensional structure of the lipocalin family was conserved in the LRMs. The B and T cell epitopes in these lipocalins were then predicted, and six of the LRMs (5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12) were used to examine the host immune interactions with sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from tick-susceptible and tick-resistant cattle challenged with R. microplus. On days 28 - 60 after tick infestation, the anti-LRM titres were higher in the resistant group compared with the susceptible cattle. After 60 day, the anti-LRM titres (except LRM 9 and LRM 11) decreased to zero in the sera of both the tick-resistant and tick-susceptible cattle. Using cell proliferation assays, the PBMCs challenged with some of the predicted T cell epitopes (LRM 1 _T 1, T 2; LRM_T 1, T 2 and LRM 12 _T) exhibited a significantly higher number of IFN-γ-secreting cells (Th 1) in tick-susceptible Holstein-Friesians compared with tick-resistant Brahman cattle. In contrast, expression of the Th 2 cytokine (IL- 4) was lower in <b>Holstein-Friesians</b> <b>cattle</b> compared with Brahman cattle.

40|$|We herein {{demonstrate}} {{that in the}} <b>Holstein-Friesian</b> dairy <b>cattle</b> population, microsatellites are as polymorphic on the X chromosome as on the autosomes but {{that the level of}} linkage disequilibrium between these markers is higher on the X chromosome than on the autosomes.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to search for polymorphisms in the bovine MEF 2 D gene and to analyze their effect on MEF 2 D mRNA and on protein expression levels in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Polish <b>Holstein–Friesian</b> <b>cattle.</b> Overall, three novel variations, namely, insertion/deletion g. − 818 _− 814 AGCCG and g. − 211 C<A transversion in the promoter region as well as g. 7 C<T transition in the 5 ′untranslated region (5 ′UTR), were identified by DNA sequencing. A total, 375 unrelated bulls belonging to six different cattle breeds were genotyped, and three combined genotypes (Ins-C-C/Ins-C-C, Del-A-T/Del-A-T and Ins-C-C/Del-A-T) were determined. The frequency of the combined genotype Ins-C-C/Ins-C-C and Del-A-T/Del-A-T was varied between the breeds and the average frequency was 0. 521 and 0. 037, respectively. Expression analysis showed that the MEF 2 D variants were highly correlated with MEF 2 D mRNA and protein levels in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Polish Holstein–Friesian bulls carrying the three different combined genotypes. The highest MEF 2 D mRNA and protein levels were estimated in the muscle of bulls with the Ins-C-C/Ins-C-C homozygous genotype as compared to the Del-A-T/Del-A-T homozygotes (P <  0. 01) and Ins-C-C/Del-A-T heterozygotes (P <  0. 05).
