So I knew that such a school was possible. Shortridge High School in Indianapolis {{produced}} not only me, but the head writer on the I LOVE LUCY show (Madelyn Pugh). And, my God, we had a daily paper, we had a debating team, had a fencing team. We had a chorus, a jazz band, a serious orchestra. And all this with a Great Depression going on.

Then you can love anybody or anything else - your career, your kids, your life, It's like someone emancipating themselves. It's like my re-emancipation of Mimi, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>to</b> be able to sing along with me. It's a big chorus. I {{tend to be more}} private about my personal life anyway, so even if the song were about someone in particular, I would never say that, because that would be like my own private thought.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with PopMatters, Keely described {{the development of the}} Worlds Apart cover art, stating that while he typically incorporates his free time drawings and paintings into the band's albums, this cover collage was more specifically designed. However, Interscope insisted that he cite and clear all sources of his art, much of which was found in museums around the world. Given the improbability of the task, illustrator Cyril Van Der Haegen was hired to paint Keely's design and tweak various elements. Keely also summarized the theme of the collage:"I wanted an allegory depicting the history of human conflict. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>to</b> be fighting, like in Marvel Comics' Secret Wars, where all the superheroes are fighting each other. <b>I</b> actually <b>wanted</b> to sneak in one of the New Mutants." ...|$|R

I walk about the ship--smoking, of course--and look at people who are not well with mild but pitying surprise, as if I wondered what it was like and how they did it. It is very foolish of me, I know, but I cannot help it. I suppose it is the human nature that exists in even the best of us that makes us act like this.|$|E

[...] It was there that he became interested in French and German poetry and started writing himself. His first two poems, though, have been panned by his mother in such a manner that for the next six years he made no attempt at repeating this first poetic venture. At the gymnasium Balmont became involved with a secret circle (formed by students and some teachers) which printed and distributed Narodnaya Volya proclamations.

5000|$|Madonna, who {{was busy}} with True Blue and {{shooting}} for the comedy film Shanghai Surprise, was contacted by Kleinman to ask about her approval of the shot footage.

It portrayed Madonna in her first image makeover, with platinum blond curls, and conservative wardrobe. Madonna wanted to include a summation of her biography—which was used at the beginning of The Virgin Tour—to be added with the footage. Hence, with the footage, Madonna's voice was heard, declaring,"I went to New York.

The performances of [...] "Angel", [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Burning Up" [...] were removed from the track list of the video, as Kleinman believed that Madonna's performance was not her best in them. While shooting the tour on May 25, during the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin", a fan suddenly came up on the stage and tried to get hold of Madonna, but was swiftly whisked away by security. Kleinman decided to keep the shot, as he felt that it illustrated the fanaticism which had grown around Madonna, and her popularity.

40|$|Transcription begins]:STEWART FIELDNEWBURGH, NEW YORK Toosday 1945 Dearest Dottie, Well honey, I passed my 40 hour check. It wasn’t tough. A few stalls, some acrobatics, a spin-s and {{a couple}} of landings. I had it with a major. He’s a swell egg, I guess that helped. That’s the good news. Now comes the bad news. Remember I told you that they didn’t want me to go home Saturday, they wanted me to stay in the hospital? Well now they’re trying to claim that they didn’t release me from the dump, and they’ve slapped a Wing Board on me. Don’t let the big name scare you honey. You see for any demerits awarded over six in number you have to meet a Wing Board. It’s nothing serious, the only thing is I might be {{restricted}} next weekend, it depends on how many demerits I’ll get at the board tomorrow. It will be at least seven, and that’s one tour (you walk a tour for every gig over six that you get) and this morning I got gigged for a dusty floor, that’s two gigs, totaling three tours. One more gig and I can’t get out Saturday night, since I can only walk three off Saturday, and can’t leave the post ‘til all are walked off. Aw honey, I’ve got to see you next weekend. It’s bad enough going from weekend to weekend, but for two weeks, I can’t see it. Gee I love you so, darling. That letter you wrote Sunday was so sweet. I know you’re then [sic] only girl I ever loved or ever will. I didn’t think it could happen to me, but it has, and it’s marvelous, Dottie. And don’t worry, darling. Ever[y]thing is going to be all right. I said I was going to marry you in March, and by God, I’ll marry you in March, and nothing or no one will stop me. Don’t worry about Mom. You see hon, she and I are much closer than the average mother and son, what with Dad dead, and stuff. She doesn’t want me to marry in March, it’s true, but she would never {{stand in the way of}} our happiness, darling, I know her too well. So don’t worry, sweetheart, everything will be O. K. Oh, and another thing. Maybe Nanny do[e]sn’t want me to marry you in March, that makes no difference to me, but I know that Bobby does, not matter what she says. She understands the way we feel about it. And as for me, I know what I’m doing. I’d marry you tomorrow if there wasn’t a war on. The only affect the war had on us was bringing us together. Marriage has been against my principles ever since I’ve been old enough to think about it. So when I ask you to marry me, after all these years of conscientious objections, don’t you think that I really mean it? I do darling, I mean everything I ever say to do, this is too big a step to take just because “everybody’s doing it. ” I was never much of a conventionalist anyhow. (With my reputation how could I be) All I know is that I love you darling, like I never loved anyone before. You’re her, hon, that certain girl in every guy’s life. I just never expected to find you so soon, that’s all. Hon, let’s announce the engagement as soon as we can. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>to</b> know that I’m the luckiest guy in the world. If it’s O. K. with you we can announce it as soon as I can get a ring, hon. Well hon, I’ve got to write Mom tonight, I promised her I would. I’ll call you Thursday night hon, and let you know about this weekend. Gigs, stay ‘way from ma do’! I love you darling, and kinda miss you, a little too, just a little, (am I kiddin’) Good night sweetheart,I love you— As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|E
