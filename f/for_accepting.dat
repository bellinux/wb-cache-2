5|$|In March 1906, Commissioner of Corporations James Rudolph Garfield {{submitted}} {{a report to}} President Roosevelt, alleging large-scale rebating in Standard Oil shipments. Federal prosecutors in several states and territories sought indictments against components of the Standard Oil Trust. On June 28, 1906, Standard Oil of Indiana was indicted on 6,428counts of violation of the Elkins Act <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> rebates on shipments on the Chicago & Alton Railroad. The case was assigned to Landis.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} Fall and a {{relative}} {{had received a}} total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases. Fall was ultimately convicted in 1929 <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> bribes and, in 1931, became the first U.S. cabinet member to be imprisoned for crimes committed while in office. Sinclair was convicted only of contempt of court for jury tampering. Doheny was brought to trial before a jury in April 1930 for giving the bribe Fall had been convicted of accepting, but he was acquitted.|$|E

5|$|After Republicans {{gained control}} of the Senate in 1981, Mathias sought the {{chairmanship}} of the Judiciary Committee but was relegated to the relatively mundane chairmanship of the Rules Committee. He was also appointed chairman of the Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and the District of Columbia, and accepted a seat on the influential Foreign Relations Committee, though he had to sacrifice his seat on the Appropriations Committee to do so. In 1982, Mathias chaired a bipartisan Senate inquiry into the methods used by the FBI in the Abscam corruption investigation, which found that dozens of officials had been named <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> bribes without basis. He also served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Printing from 1981 to 1983 and 1985 to 1987, and {{as a member of the}} Joint Committee on the Library from 1983 to 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received {{were not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{earned a}} bid to the Independence Bowl {{following}} an 83 record during the 1984-1985 football season. Tech was the No. 3 team {{in the country in}} terms of overall defense and No. 2 in terms of rushing defense, due to the efforts of Tech defender Bruce Smith, an All-American and Outland Trophy winner who would later go on to be the first-overall selection in the 1985 NFL Draft. Smith became the centerpiece of an eligibility debate during the weeks prior to the game, as he was at first prohibited from participating in the game by the NCAA, which had placed him under probation <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> illegal gifts. Smith contested this probation in Virginia and Louisiana courts, and was allowed to play in the game by virtue of two court actions.|$|E

5|$|A {{short while}} {{later at the}} Andronikov Monastery, a {{messenger}} arrives from Moscow to ask Andrei for his assistance in decorating the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanes the Greek. Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> Theophanesâ€™ offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes {{to say goodbye to}} his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit of anger, decides to leave the monastery for the secular world, throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog, but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead. Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma (Mikhail Kononov). Foma is another creative character, representing the light-hearted and practical-minded commercial artist. Still he seems to be contemplative enough to get along with Andrei.|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Sullivan, ageing and unwell, {{resigned}} as {{conductor of the}} Leeds triennial music festival, a post which he had held since 1880. He believed that Stanford's motive <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> the conductorship of the Leeds Philharmonic Society the previous year was to position himself {{to take over the}} festival. Stanford later felt obliged to write to The Times, denying that he had been party to a conspiracy to oust Sullivan. Sullivan was by then thought to be a dull conductor of other composers' music, and although Stanford's work as a conductor was not without its critics, he was appointed in Sullivan's place. He remained in charge until 1910. His compositions for the festival included Songs of the Sea (1904), Stabat Mater (1907) and Songs of the Fleet (1910). New works by other composers presented at Leeds during Stanford's years in charge included pieces by Parry, Mackenzie, and seven of Stanford's former pupils. The best-known new work from Stanford's time is probably Vaughan Williams's A Sea Symphony, premiered in 1910.|$|E

5|$|Sampson's term {{in office}} was a tumultuous one. The 1928 {{legislature}} was dominated by Democrats and was not particularly responsive to Sampson's proposals. After the session, Sampson was indicted <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> gifts from textbook companies, but the charges were later dropped. In 1929, Sampson removed Democratic political boss Ben Johnson from his post as highway commissioner. When legislators reconvened in 1930, they retaliated by stripping Sampson {{of many of his}} appointment powers and reinstalling Johnson to his post. Later in the session, Sampson proposed to allow Samuel Insull to dam the Cumberland Falls to generate hydroelectric power. The General Assembly instead voted to accept an offer from T. Coleman du Pont to purchase the falls and turn them into a state park. The Assembly voted to further restrict Sampson's powers in 1930. The end of Sampson's term was complicated by the economic realities of the Great Depression. He called out the Kentucky National Guard to quell a violent mine strike in Harlan County known as the Battle of Evarts. Following his term, Sampson returned to Barbourville and was re-elected as a circuit court judge. He died May 25, 1967 and was buried in Barbourville Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|During the war Hirst, {{along with}} Rhodes and their team-mate Schofield Haigh, {{worked in a}} munitions factory in Huddersfield. Hirst and Rhodes were paid by Yorkshire to play in war-time cricket matches on {{a certain number of}} Saturdays. Hirst played in the Bradford League, and became known among cricketers <b>for</b> <b>accepting</b> minimal fees from financially {{struggling}} clubs. When first-class cricket restarted in 1919, Hirst resumed playing for Yorkshire. In the first match of the season he hit an aggressive unbeaten 180 against MCC, to secure a draw for the county; he followed this with two more centuries in {{the first two weeks of}} the season. Although his form later faltered, he played some substantial innings in difficult circumstances and ended the season with 1,441 runs at an average of 38.94. He bowled infrequently, taking 18 wickets at 29.27. During this season, Hirst accepted the position of coach at Eton College. In the last match of the season, at Scarborough, he was given a warm reception by the crowd, who did not expect to see him playing for Yorkshire again. However, he appeared on occasions during the school holidays in the next two seasons, although he did not score any centuries, did not average more than 24 with the bat and took only 21 wickets in total. At the end of the 1921 season Hirst retired as a Yorkshire player, and made what was expected to be his final first-class appearance in a Scarborough Festival match, in which he captained the Players against the Gentlemen. On the last day of the match, Hirst's 50th birthday, he took the final two wickets to secure victory for his side. The crowd gathered outside the pavilion and demanded to see him; he gave a farewell speech, and was moved by the reception given to him.|$|E
