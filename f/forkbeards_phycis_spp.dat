40|$|Interest in {{sourcing}} high quality non-quota fish species {{continues to increase}} as fish quotas tighten and traditional whitefish stocks decline. Quality aspects of one such species, silver smelt. (Argentinus silus), were examined {{in an article in}} Farm and Food, October-December 1991. This work has now been extended using spot samples of a further six deep water, non-quota species caught in the Atlantic off the north west coast of Ireland. The tests, which will continue on an annual basis, are a co-operative effort between staff at The Fisheries Research Centre and The National Food Centre. The six species evaluated were Bairds smoothead (Alepocephalus bairdii), blue ling, (Molva dypterygia), black scabbard(Aphanopus carbo), rabbitfish (Chimaera monstrosa), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and greater <b>forkbeard</b> (<b>Phycis</b> blennoides). Details of catching, procurement and fish characteristics are reported from The Fisheries Research Centre, while tests for proximate analysis, water holding capacity, gel strength, and colour were carried out at The National Food Centre using samples which were blast frozen at sea...|$|R

The Great <b>forkbeard,</b> <b>Phycis</b> blennoides (Brünnich, 1768), is {{a species}} widely {{distributed throughout the}} Mediterranean Sea and although it is of great importance for fishing industry, {{little is known about}} its reproductive characteristics. This study provides first data on reproductive characteristics of this species in the south western Mediterranean, important for management and stock assessment. For this purpose a total of 461 individuals ranging from 17. 5 to 43. 5 cm in total length were collected monthly in a period of one year using trammel nets. Sex ratio of males to females was 1 : 0. 91. The estimated length where 50 % of analyzed individuals were sexually mature was 24. 73 cm for females. The peak value of gonad somatic index was recorded in September and continued throughout the October, indicating the highest spawning activity when the Kn values are low...|$|R
40|$|The <b>forkbeard,</b> <b>Phycis</b> phycis, and conger eel, Conger conger, are two coastal species, {{with a wide}} {{bathymetric}} {{and geographical}} distribution. The longline fleet of the Azores catches these two important commercial species. Few studies on their diet composition were found in literature. Data were collected during the demersal cruise surveys that took place abo rd the R/V “Arquipélago ” {{during the spring of}} 1996 and 1997. Stomachs of 53 forkbeards and 95 conger eels were examined to define their diets. Both species fed primarily on fishes, mainly on two benthopelagic species (Capros aper and Macroramphosus scolopax). However, the relative importance of fish was higher for conger eel than for forkbeard, which fed secondarily on decapods. Prey composition of the diet did not vary between sexes, predator size or areas. However, some differences were found on di t composition between depth strata. Prey composition indicates that both predators have the ability to feed near the bottom on benthic prey or in the water column on benthopelagic species...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTotal mercury {{concentrations}} were determined in different fish {{size classes of}} commercial importance such as, conger eel (Conger conger), starry ray (Raja asterias), <b>forkbeard</b> (<b>Phycis</b> blennoides), frostfish (Lepidopus caudatus), striped mullet (Mullus barbatus), red gurnard (Aspitrigla cuculus) and yellow gurnard (Trigla lucerna) in order to evaluate eventual variations in consumer exposure to mercury {{as a function of}} fish consumption of different size spectra. The highest mean levels of total mercury were detected in conger eel (0. 80 μg g- 1) and in starry ray (0. 75 μg g- 1). Forkbeard (0. 67 μ g g- 1), frostfish (0. 59 gμ g- 1) and striped mullet (0. 55 μg g- 1) showed slightly lower levels, while red gurnard (0. 33 μg g- 1) and yellow gurnard (0. 22 μg g- 1) exhibited the lowest concentrations. The results of the linear regression analysis showed significant relationship between mercury concentrations and fish size for all species. Consequently, dietary consumption of larger size specimens leaded to an increase in the exposure level for consumer. Understanding by consumers of all factors leading to an increase of exposure to mercury is the first step to address them to make decisions about eating fish...|$|R

Although circadian bias in the catch rates for this fishery has been reported, no conclusive study had been carried out until now. Catch per unit effort oscillated with {{the time of the}} day. Total catches, both in numbers and weight considerably higher in daytime than at night, suggesting that the 24 -hour light cycle strongly influences catchability of rose shrimp. The rose shrimp, shows a clear shift in abundance from daytime to night hours, with catches decreasing sharply at dusk and, then increasing significantly at dawn. Overall, the most captured fish species: european hake, Merluccius merluccius; monkfish, Lophius budegassa; european conger, Conger conger; and great <b>forkbeard,</b> <b>Phycis</b> blennoides; present the same trend, although less marked. The exceptions are: silver scabbardfish, Lepidopus caudatus; blue Whiting, Micromesistius poutassou; tongue sole, Symphurus nigrescens; atlantic mackarel Scomber scombrus and silver cod, Gadiculus argenteus; whose catches were higher in the night hours. Understanding, the circadian variability in catches of highly valuable commercial species such as the deep-water rose shrimp may contribute to an improved management, by allowing a better control of fishing effort and more efficient use of technical measure...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of population {{structure of a}} species is essential to effectively assess and manage fisheries. In the present study, genetics, by mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b sequence analysis, and body geometric morphometrics were {{used to evaluate the}} existence of distinct populations of the <b>forkbeard</b> (<b>Phycis</b> phycis), an important commercial species in several European countries, especially Portugal and Spain. For geometric morphometric analysis, specimens were collected in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean-Azores, Madeira and mainland Portugal, and for genetic analysis, these samples were complemented with samples collected in the Mediterranean Sea-Spain, Italy and Croatia, in order to cover the entire distribution area of the species. Body shape of the forkbeard from the Northeast Atlantic was found to be highly variable. This variation was probably associated with different environmental factors between the study areas. Despite morphological variation, a low genetic differentiation between samples from different areas was found, most likely due to gene flow that occurred in the past or with the demographic history of the species. Moreover, the presence of unique haplotypes in the Northeast Atlantic and in the Mediterranean suggests that recent gene flow between populations from these areas should be limited. Altogether, a high haplotype diversity, a low nucleotide diversity, a "star-like" network and the results of the mismatch distribution, indicate a possible signature of recent population expansions, which probably started during the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and led to the colonization of the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean...|$|R

Species {{distribution}} modelling of {{the marine}} environment has been extensively used to assess species–environment relationships to predict fish spatial distributions accurately. In this study we explored the application of two distinct modelling techniques, maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and generalized linear models (GLMs) for predicting the potential distribution in the Azores economic exclusive zone (EEZ) of four economically important demersal fish species: blackbelly rosefish, Helicolenus dactylopterus dactylopterus, <b>forkbeard,</b> <b>Phycis</b> phycis, wreckfish, Polyprion americanus and offshore rockfish, Pontinus kuhlii. Models were constructed based on 13 years of fish presence/absence data derived from bottom longline surveys performed {{in the study area}} combined with high resolution (300 m) topographic and biogeochemical habitat seafloor variables. The most important predictors were depth and slope followed by sediment type, oxygen saturation and salinity, with relative contributions being similar among species. GLMs provided ‘outstanding’ model predictions (AUC> 0. 9) for two of the four fish species while MaxEnt provided ‘excellent’ model predictions (AUC= 0. 8 – 0. 9) for three of four species. The level of agreement between observed and predicted presence/absence sites for both modelling techniques was ‘moderate’ (K= 0. 4 – 0. 6) for three of the four species with P. americanus models presenting the lowest level of agreement (K< 0. 1). For the scope of this study, both modelling approaches presented here were determined to produce viable presence/absence maps which represent a snap–shot of the potential distributions of the investigated species. This information provides a better description of demersal fish spatial ecology and can be of a great deal of interest for future fisheries management and conservation planning...|$|R
40|$|Potential for new {{developments}} in deep water fishing have been identified by two sampling surveys carried out in April and September 1993, in the deep waters off {{the west coast of}} Ireland and Scotland. The primary objective of the two surveys was to secure samples of a variety of potentially commercial deep water fish species in order to examine aspects of their age, growth, reproduction and diet. These data will be essential in formulating management plans for the expanding deep water fisheries in the area. The surveys were conducted on a chartered fishing vessel using a commercial otter trawl, fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. Fishing activity concentrated on the depth range 400 m- 1200 m and a total of 81 trawling operations were carried out, of which 75 produced fish catches with limited gear damage. Fifteen species of cartilaginous and 50 species of teleost fish were recorded from the catches. These include the roundnose grenadier Coryphaenoides rupestris, black scabbard Aphanopus carbo, greater <b>forkbeard</b> <b>Phycis</b> blennoides, blue-mouth rockfish Helicolenus dactylopterus and Baird's smooth-head Alepocephalus bairdii. Length, weight, sex, maturity and catch data together with samples of otoliths, gonads and stomachs were secured. In general terms, the fishing ground off the north west of Ireland and west of Scotland caused little problems with gear damage and yielded good catches of deep water species. The two surveys have shown the areas have potential for commercial deep water fishing but the development of this fishery in the area will be contingent on the establishment of suitable markets. This initial report documents the surveys and presents some preliminary results. The data gathered from these surveys are currently under analysis at the FRC and the results will be published in the scientific literature...|$|R
40|$|Background. The greater <b>forkbeard,</b> <b>Phycis</b> blennoides (Brünnich, 1768), is a gadiform species, {{which has}} {{economical}} value and its population is dwelling in a 60 – 800 m depth range throughout the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Along African north coast, {{there is a}} lack of information about the biology (age, growth, sex-ratio) of this species. This study provides the first data on population parameters of P. blennoides in Tunisia. Materials and Methods. Specimens of Phycis blennoides were collected from the landings of the artisanal fisheries between September 2007 and June 2010. The length–weight relations were determined according to the allometric equation: W = aTLb. Growth parameters were estimated using the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Results. Length (TL) –Weight (W) relations were allometrically positive for the females (W = 22. 10 – 4 TL 3. 409), males (W = 13. 10 – 4 TL 3. 674), and both sexes (W = 19. 10 – 4 TL 3. 460), without significant differences between males and females. The relation between otolith weight and age showed a significant difference between males and females. The growth parameters were calculated as TL∞ = 57. 17 cm, K = 0. 193 · year– 1, t 0 = – 1. 578 · year for the females, and 44. 74 cm, 0. 313 · year– 1, and – 1. 210 · year for the males, respectively. The females grew faster than the males which did not exceed 45 cm. The growth performance index Ф' calculated for the females (2. 80 cm· year – 1) and males (2. 79 cm· year – 1) yielded similar results. Conclusion. Results reported in this work will contribute to the knowledge on the biology of P. blennoides in Tunisia, with the aim of generating sufficient information to improve future stock management and sustainable fisheries...|$|R
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Ciências do Mar, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2015 The {{biology and}} ecology of many commercially {{important}} species {{are not subject}} to study before these species begin to be exploited. The knowledge of stock structure and degree of mixing among populations is important for the rational management of marine resources, especially when dealing with commercially important marine fish species. The <b>forkbeard,</b> <b>Phycis</b> phycis, is a benthopelagic fish with a wide distribution in the southern Northeast Atlantic {{and is one of the}} most important gadiform species commercially exploited in Portuguese waters. However, no information on the species biology for Portuguese coast exists, the stock structure along its distribution area is unknown and its exploration unregulated. Thus, this thesis aims to gather new and important biological information on the species and elucidate the stock structure of forkbeard in the southern Northeast Atlantic. In relation to biology, the age and growth study described in this thesis suggests that forkbeard is a relatively slow growing, long-lived species, that does not show sexual dimorphism in growth. Fishing mortality estimates for this species is representative of a low/moderate exploitation pattern. The reproductive strategy study indicates that forkbeard is a group-synchronous, batch spawner species with a determinate fecundity. In Portuguese waters, spawning season occurs from September to early January and the length at first maturity was estimated as 35. 9 cm and 28. 5 cm TL for females and males, respectively. Stock structure of forkbeard along its distribution area was investigated using otolith shape analysis, body geometric morphometrics and genetic analysis. The morphological techniques suggest the existence of at least three phenotypic stocks in the southern Northeast Atlantic (mainland Portugal, Azores and Madeira), and the genetic analysis suggests the existence of two genotypic stocks, between the southern Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
