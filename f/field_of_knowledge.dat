The Rosetta Stone is, therefore, no longer unique, {{but it was the}} essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation.

25|$|The most {{defining}} {{property of}} modernity, according to Giddens, {{is that we}} are disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like, even if he has never been there. In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} of the Prophet Muḥammad in female education was manifest {{in the fact that}} he himself used to teach women along with men. Muḥammad's teachings were widely sought by both sexes, and accordingly {{at the time of his}} death it was reported that there were many female scholars of Islam. Additionally, the wives of the Prophet Muḥammadparticularly Aishaalso taught both women and men; many of Muḥammad's companions and followers learned the Qur'an, ḥadīth and Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) from Aisha. Notably, there was no restriction placed on the type of knowledge acquired: a woman was free to choose any <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> that interested her. Because Islam recognises that women are in principle wives and mothers, the acquisition of knowledge in fields which are complementary to these social roles was specially emphasised.|$|E

Liana Bortolon, writing in 1967, said: [...] "Because of the multiplicity of interests that spurred him to pursue every <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge...</b> Leonardo can be considered, quite rightly, {{to have been the}} universal genius par excellence, and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term. Man is as uncomfortable today, faced with a genius, as he was in the 16th century. Five centuries have passed, yet we still view Leonardo with awe." ...|$|E

The reviewer asked why the book did not fully address questions including, [...] "Did any of the forgeries described have a significant political impact on the intended target, and on U.S. relations with the country concerned, or were they merely of nuisance value?" [...] Conflict Quarterly criticized such absence in the book and identified it as an academic deficiency, writing, [...] "Without answers to questions such as these, it is difficult to accept, at face value, the authors' conclusions." [...] Charters concluded the book was [...] "a useful introduction to a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> which... is likely to continue to expand in importance for diplomats, the intelligence community, and scholars of international security affairs.|$|E

2500|$|The German {{mathematician}} Carl Friedrich Gauss {{referred to}} mathematics as [...] "the Queen of the Sciences". More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics [...] "the Queen of Science... the main {{driving force behind}} scientific discovery". In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum, {{as well as in}} German Königin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding to science means a [...] "field of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of [...] "science" [...] in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The specialization restricting the meaning of [...] "science" [...] to natural science follows the rise of Baconian science, which contrasted [...] "natural science" [...] to scholasticism, the Aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as biology, chemistry, or physics. Albert Einstein stated that [...] "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mencken {{repeatedly}} identified mathematics with metaphysics and theology. According to Mencken, {{mathematics is}} necessarily infected with metaphysics {{because of the}} tendency of many mathematical people to engage in metaphysical speculation. In a review for A. N. Whitehead's The Aims of Education, Mencken remarked that despite his agreement with Whitehead's thesis and approval of his writing style, [...] "now and then he falls into mathematical jargon and pollutes his discourse with equations", and [...] "here are moments when {{he seems to be}} following some of his mathematical colleagues into the gaudy metaphysics which now entertains them". For Mencken, theology is characterized {{by the fact that it}} uses correct reasoning from false premises. Mencken also uses the term [...] "theology" [...] more generally, to refer to the use of logic in science or any other <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> In a review for both A. S. Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World and Joseph Needham's Man a Machine, Mencken forcefully ridiculed the use of reasoning to establish any fact in science, because theologians happen to be masters of [...] "logic" [...] and yet are mental defectives: ...|$|E

But the study of man seemed to be his highest delight: and if his genius had any special bias, it lay in discovering those things that made men wiser and happier. As truth was the sole object of his researches, he was, of course, no sectary: and as reason was his guide, he embraced no system which that did not authorize. In short, he laid the whole volume of nature open before him, and diligently and faithfully perused it.|$|E
