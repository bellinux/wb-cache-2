40|$|A weakly {{magnetized}} expanding hydrogen plasma, {{created by}} a cascaded arc, was investigated using optical emission spectroscopy. The emission of the expanding plasma is dominated by H a emission {{in the first part}} of the plasma expansion, after which a sharp transition to a blue afterglow is observed. The position of this sharp transition along the expansion axis depends on the magnetic field strength. The blue afterglow emission is associated with population inversion of the electronically excited atomic hydrogen states n = 4 - 6 with respect to n = 3. By comparing the measured densities with the densities using an atomic collisional radiative model, we conclude that atomic recombination processes cannot account for the large population densities observed. Therefore, molecular processes must be important for the formation of excited states and for the occurrence of population inversion. This is further corroborated at the transition from red to blue, where a <b>hollow</b> <b>profile</b> of the excited states n = 4 - 6 in the radial direction is observed. This <b>hollow</b> <b>profile</b> is explained by the molecular mutual neutralization process of H- 2 (+) with H-, which has a maximum production for excited atomic hydrogen 1 - 2 cm outside the plasma center...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{detailed}} analysis of metal flow through a porthole die to produce a rectangular <b>hollow</b> aluminium <b>profile</b> was performed by means of three-dimensional FE simulation using DEFORM 3 D.

In the case of extruding a rectangular <b>hollow</b> <b>profile</b> through a porthole die with four ports, two neighbouring ports were different from each other. Using an FE model including these two ports, different flow patterns of two individual metal streams were revealed. The 3 D FE simulation also showed how two unequal metal streams contacted each other and became bonded in the welding chamber under a certain hydrostatic pressure and at a certain temperature, before the metal flew through the die bearing. The difference in velocity between the metal streams led to uneven flow at the die bearing and thus a wavy extrusion nose...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{emission}} spectroscopy {{was used to}} observe the continuum emission at 700 – 900 nm in a hydrogen plasma at Pilot-PSI in order to extract the electron density out of the absolute intensity of the emission. The validity of the continuum emission diagnostic was judged by comparison with Thomson scattering, which acts as a reliable tool for measuring the electron density. We observed the absolute value of the continuum emission about {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the Thomson scattering profile. Moreover, the emission profile over the radius of the plasma beam appears to be hollow, which is not to be expected from the Thomson data. The overcalculation of the continuum intensity is most likely caused by an emission band of molecular hydrogen(715 - 765 nm), whereas the <b>hollow</b> emission <b>profile</b> is explained by considering the density of molecular hydrogen, which dominates the emission profile above an electron density of ne = 5 ∙ 1019 m− 3 and hence causes a <b>hollow</b> <b>profile.</b> In conclusion, the 700 – 900 nm regime in a hydrogen plasma is not suitable for extracting the electron density accurately from the continuum emission...|$|R
40|$|Experiments on trace argon {{impurity}} transport in L-mode discharges {{were performed}} on Korea superconducting tokamak advanced research (KSTAR) with electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECH). Ar emission was measured by soft x-ray (SXR) arrays and vacuum UV (VUV) diagnostics. A significant reduction in the core Ar emissivity was observed with core ECH. The reduction was the largest with on-axis heating and became smaller with outward heating positions. The diffusivity and convection velocity of Ar were obtained by analysis of the SXR data with the SANCO impurity transport code for the on-axis ECH and the non-ECH shots. In the on-axis ECH case, both diffusivity and convection velocity increased. Furthermore, the convection changed its direction from inward to outward in the plasma core (r/a?<? 0. 3), resulting in a <b>hollow</b> <b>profile</b> of the total Ar density.

The {{purpose of}} work is {{presentation}} of features and results of the conducted works on determination of introduction expedience of hexahedral <b>hollow</b> <b>profiles</b> as the component elements of the modern supporting systems of railway freight gondola cars. Methodology. During the research an introduction methodology {{of different types of}} profiles as alternative to the existent supporting elements of the body module for freight car was used. This methodology had been developed by the author before. It is oriented to the reduction in material consumption and providing of strength requirements and operating reliability of the car design under study. The developed methodology includes the procedures of admissible values calculation of the resistance moments of the section of the hexahedral hollow profile, which is being introduced. It also includes the determination of optimum (i. e. characterized by the minimum material consumption when meeting the durability requirements) values of height and minimum thickness of profile in the conditions of construction limitations. At the same time the admissible resistance moments are calculated as such, which are equal to the value of existent implementation of supporting element or as such that are determined taking into account the surplus design reserve. The first direction is applied in this work. Findings. As a result of the conducted research the introduction expedience of hexahedral <b>hollow</b> <b>profiles</b> as vertical rods of the lateral and latitude belts of the walls of the butt-end freight gondola cars is grounded and the optimum parameters of such replacements are determined. Originality. The problem of the use expedience of hexahedral <b>hollow</b> <b>profiles</b> as the supporting elements of the freight gondola cars bodies was first considered in the article. To solve this problem the mathematical models describing the dependence of basic strength and mass indexes of the proper profiles on varying the geometrical parameters, as well as the auxiliary graph are developed.

This taking into account the large scale of their park will provide a considerable economic effect at their producing and operation. The materials developed and presented in the article can be used for consideration and solution of analogical tasks for other types of freight cars, and also for other facilities of the transport engineering.
