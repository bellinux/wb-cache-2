40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{literature}} on the relationship between <b>innovations</b> <b>and</b> employment at the firm level, with most of the results indicating positive effects. Thus far, this kind of analysis has not been performed for Poland {{and it seems to be}} an important and interesting field for research. On the other hand, there is some empirical evidence that developments in the Polish labour market are at least partially driven by the Skill Biased Technical Change (SBTC) process. This paper tries to fill in this gap by looking at three dimensions of the relationship between <b>innovations</b> <b>and</b> employment in Poland: <b>innovations</b> <b>and</b> job creation, <b>innovations</b> <b>and</b> the skill structure of employment <b>innovations,</b> <b>and</b> wage formation. The results of the analysis indicate that there is a weak but positive relationship between the level of <b>innovations</b> <b>and</b> the probability of job creation. However, we have not been able to prove that innovations have any effect on the skill structure of labour demand in Poland. We have however found a positive and statistically significant relationship between the level of <b>innovations</b> <b>and</b> skill-biased wage changes. The results indicate that innovations positively influence the wages of skilled workers while they negatively influence the wages of the unskilled. innovation, employment, wages, Poland...|$|R
