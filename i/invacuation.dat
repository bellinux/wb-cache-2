40|$|We {{consider}} {{an overview of}} city evacuation policy with particular reference to the United Kingdom and using a conceptual framework which considers evacuations and invacuations to be pedagogical. Taking an historical perspective, {{with a focus on}} the United Kingdom, the chapter considers the reasons for a gradual move from a policy of city evacuation in WWII towards an ‘invacuation’ policy in the Cold War. It then explores more recent policies of ‘flexible response’ to a range of contingencies with mixed invacution / evacuation policies being proposed. We illustrate this with an examination of websites for evacuation / <b>invacuation</b> preparedness in UK cities. Recent trends in mobility, social media and communication technologies present increasing interdisciplinary problems for evacuation modelling...|$|E
40|$|The Haiti {{earthquake}} of January 12 th, 2010 {{provided a}} unique opportunity to further our knowledge concerning ???mass <b>invacuation???</b> planning processes. No systematic research assessment has been undertaken to look at how host communities manage the process of receiving evacuees, providing immediate mass care, and resettling displaced individuals. This research focuses on the initial phase of the evacuation/invacuation process of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, from the day after the earthquake (January 13, 2010) through April 2011. The data has been collected as part of an NSF-RAPID grant, a collaborative proposal between the University of Delaware and the University of North Texas, organizations are the units of analysis, and we have used qualitative interview techniques as our data collection method. Reviewing our data has highlighted the challenges faced by public sector emergency managers as they interacted with and attempted to integrate unconventional emergency response organizations into the Incident Command System. Lindell and Perry (2007) state that in order for planning and preparedness for emergencies to be effective, stakeholders at every level need to be included. Further findings may suggest how alternative emergency response organizations can plan and train for mass evacuation events or how conventional emergency responders can integrate them within the ICS modular structure. Thus, organizations that seldom play a role in disaster events may be better integrated into disaster response functions when necessary. Overall, disasters are likely to occur more often in the future, leading to more mass evacuations and increasingly complex responsibilities for organizations that, in the past, may not have played a role (Quarentelli 1990). In order {{to meet the needs of}} future invacuees/evacuees, public, private, and nonprofit stakeholders need to find new solutions towards collaboration and training while simultaneously meeting current NIMS and ICS requirements...|$|E
