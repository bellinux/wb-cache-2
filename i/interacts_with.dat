5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> the stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E

The main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> non-player characters, and develops a character according to their taste. Once the game is updated the player can access the extra content at any time with any character.|$|E

50|$|CBC {{is known}} to <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> many receptors in the brain.

CBC in {{particular}} {{is known to}} <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> the TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors as well, which may result in some of its medicinal properties. Also, in mice, its antiinflammatory activity appears to be modulated by the administration of THC and is independent of the CB2 receptor. This suggests an interplay of the two molecules.|$|R
