50|$|Unlike other {{portions}} of the Maginot Line, the Rhine defenses were not interconnected, consisting of individual casemates or blockhouses a few hundred meters apart, arranged <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> along <b>the</b> length of the defended frontier. In initial planning, a Maginot ouvrage with several combat blocks, interconnected and served by underground galleries, barracks and magazines, was planned for Oberroedern. The plan was reduced to two separate casemates, Oberroedern Nord and Sud. The casemate is arranged on two levels, with living facilities and utilities on the lower level and combat stations on the upper level. <b>The</b> casemate <b>fired</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and south along the casemate line, and an 37mm anti-tank gun/JM machine gun combination <b>firing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and an AC37/JM <b>firing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, with a JM machine gun <b>firing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west.. A GFM cloche {{on the top of}} the casemate allowed for protected observation. Firing ports for light automatic rifles covered the entrance and the area around the casemate.|$|R
5|$|Alien {{opened in}} American theaters on May 25, 1979. The film had no formal premiere, yet moviegoers {{lined up for}} blocks to see it at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood where a number of models, sets, and props were {{displayed}} outside to promote it during its first run. Religious zealots set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> model of the space jockey, believing {{it to be the}} work of the devil. In the United Kingdom, Alien premiered at a gala performance at the Edinburgh Film Festival on September 1, 1979, before starting an exclusive run at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on September 6, 1979, but it did not open widely in Britain until January 13, 1980.|$|E
5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 {{gathered}} and threatened to set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired {{over the heads of}} the crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.|$|E
5|$|Australia carried eight BL 12-inch Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; {{the largest}} guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted {{fore and aft}} on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had some limited ability to <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, {{one on each side}} aft of 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.|$|E

5|$|Borchgrevink was not {{a trained}} scientist, and his {{incompetence}} with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern {{to some of the}} party. However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the hut. A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings. During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fire fumes as they slept.|$|E
5|$|By 3:30p.m. the {{massacre}} was well under way. A {{group of women}} in Rock Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E
5|$|Counting casualties, Parker {{reported}} 40 sailors {{killed and}} 71 wounded aboard Bristol, which was hit more than 70 times with much {{damage to the}} hull, yards, and rigging. Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded. Active and Solebay reported 15 casualties each. The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded. The following morning, the British, unable to drag the grounded Acteon off the sandbar, set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ship, fired some of its cannons at the British ships, took what stores and loot they could, and retreated shortly before the ship's powder magazine exploded.|$|E

5|$|Daenerys and her {{remaining}} followers build {{a funeral}} pyre for Drogo. Daenerys places her dragon eggs atop the pyre, and she orders Ser Jorah to tie Mirri to it. Having set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pyre, Daenerys declares herself queen {{of a new}} khalasar, freeing those who would remain with her. Despite Jorah's worries, Daenerys then steps into the pyre. By daybreak, Jorah and the khalasar are surprised to find her unharmed in the ashes, carrying three dragon hatchlings. Amazed, they bow to Daenerys {{as one of the}} hatchlings clambers onto her shoulder and a dragon's screech is heard {{for the first time in}} centuries.|$|E
5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents bled to death, in what today is still called Blutgasse, or Blood Alley.|$|E
5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other {{at either end of}} a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot in order to protect himself from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E

5|$|During their {{retreat from}} Quebec, the Americans {{carefully}} took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove {{useful to the}} British. When Arnold and his troops, making up the rear guard of the army, abandoned Fort Saint-Jean, they burned or sank all the boats they could not use, and set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sawmill and the fort. These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.|$|E
5|$|Following some fruitless negotiations, {{the women}} and {{children}} were allowed to leave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered. The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight. The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.|$|E
5|$|In 1257, Béla IV of Hungary (12351270) {{appointed}} {{his eldest}} son, the future Stephen V (12701272) {{to govern the}} kingdom's territories {{to the east of}} the Danube. Here the younger king ceded a significant part of his royal domains to noblemen. The first years of the reign of Ladislaus IV of Hungary (12721290), were characterized by civil wars throughout the entire kingdom. In Transylvania, the Saxons engaged in a local conflict with the bishop, took Alba Iulia and set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cathedral. The series of wars continued in 1285 with a second Mongol invasion. During its initial stage, the Székelys, the Romanians and the Saxons successfully blocked the Mongols' access and later organized a series of ambushes provoking panic among the retreating invaders.|$|E

5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended off some {{putative}} captors, and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|Narrated by Tseng, {{leader of}} the elite espionage and {{assassination}} division known as the Turks, Last Order switches between the Nibelheim incident and Zack Fair's escape to Midgar with his unconscious friend, Cloud Strife. During the Nibelheim event, Sephiroth, insane after discovering his origins, sets <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village of Nibelheim. After killing many villagers, he proceeds to the Nibelheim reactor where Jenova has been encased. Tifa, a resident of Nibelheim, attacks him soon after he arrives. Sephiroth knocks her aside and continues to Jenova's body, preserved in a large glass tank filled with liquid. Zack follows Sephiroth into the reactor and they engage in combat, but Sephiroth is able to disarm and incapacitate him. Sephiroth returns to Jenova's body, but does not notice Cloud approaching.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October New Jersey steamed {{south to}} engage Communist targets. During the {{shelling}} aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti-aircraft <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extreme {{north of the}} target zone; subsequently, New Jersey altered her fire to silence the site with her big guns. The next day New Jersey leveled 30structures, destroyed three underground bunkers, and shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. New Jersey responded by firing six 16inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an anti-aircraft site.|$|E
