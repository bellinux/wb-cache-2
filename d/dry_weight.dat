Salt tolerance was evaluated based on visual appearance of plant damage and the plants were assigned the scale from 1 (most tolerant) to 4 (most sensitive). The salinity scales ranged from 1. 00 - 3. 75. All genotypes responded to salt by an accumulation of Na +, reduction in K +, Ca 2 +, N and shoot/root <b>dried</b> <b>weight</b> and a small increase in P. Salinity tolerance scales, ion concentration and shoot/root <b>dried</b> <b>weight</b> differed greatly among tomato genotypes.
