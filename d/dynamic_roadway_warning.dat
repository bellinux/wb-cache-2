40|$|One of {{the most}} widely used {{measures}} to reduce deer-vehicle crashes (DVCs) is the deer crossing warning sign (See Figure 1). The design of this sign is controlled by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), and consists of a diamond-shaped panel with a black “Deer Crossing ” legend or deer symbol and a yellow background (See Figure 1) (1). It is generally acknowledged and understood by transportation professionals that <b>roadway</b> <b>warning</b> signs are most effective (i. e., they result in an alteration of speed and/or path choice) when they alert the driver to an obvious danger (e. g., a curve ahead). The use of warning signs that alert drivers to sporadic and/or warn of general possibilities, encounters, or situations (e. g., deer crossing and slow children warning signs), on the other hand, do not normally have a consistent impact on driver behavior. The overuse or misuse (i. e., installation at incorrect locations) of warning signs also reduces their overall effectiveness. Unfortunately, deer crossing signs have one or both of these characteristics. No research literature was found that specifically considered or quantified the DV...|$|R

Several modern applications, like contextdependent information dissemination for pervasive computing, on-demand warning in surveillance sensor networks and <b>roadway</b> safety <b>warning,</b> require that each originating event is stord around its point of origin. LCS is a suitable approach for such applications. Though, LCS does not take into consideration the origin of the queries, which is equally important to the storage method, because it has immediate influence on the experienced latency. This paper proposes a simple yet effective way of reducing the network latency, namely the Query Sensitive Storage (QSS) protocol. QSS makes certain that not only will the queries be answered, but all subsequent queries that originated in the same area will be answered faster. The experimental evaluation using the J-Sim simulator attests that with the proposed QSS protocol we can achieve smaller network latency at a minimum storage cost as compared to its state-of-the-art competitor, namely LCS. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This study {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility of pedestrian collision warnings presented via different sensory modalities in a driving simulator. Despite the well-established fact that reaction times (RT) are faster under S-R compatible conditions, the majority of collision warning research has used S-R incompatible warnings (i. e., the warning comes {{from the direction of the}} obstacle to be avoided not the desired response direction). Thirty-two participants in a fixed-base driving simulator drove on a three-lane urban road in which pedestrians randomly walked from the sidewalk into the <b>roadway.</b> Collision <b>warnings</b> in two different modalities (tactile and auditory) were compared with a no warning condition. Participants were equally divided into one of four conditions representing all combinations of two levels of warning S-R compatibility (compatible and incompatible) and two levels of warning timing (early and late). For early warnings, incompatible warnings were most effective as shown by a significantly shorter steering RT and larger clearance distance. For late warnings, compatible warnings were most effective. For early warnings, RTs were significantly faster in the tactile condition. The relationship between collision warning effectiveness and S-R compatibility in driving is dependent on whether the driver has time to evaluate the situation before collision will occur. Our findings have important implications for the design of effective tactile and auditory collision warning systems. However, further research is needed to determine if these effects occur in more representative driving conditions (e. g., lower pedestrian incursion rate and unreliable warnings).

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a set of}} performance metrics and a performance measurement system developed {{for the evaluation of}} <b>roadway</b> departure <b>warning</b> systems. The work is part of an effort by the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop quantitative measures of performance for the evaluation of highway safety systems. The work is also {{part of an effort to}} promote dual-use technologies between the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense. The Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology undertook the development of the performance measurement system. The approach for quantitative evaluation rests on establishing a baseline measurement of roadway departure that is of higher accuracy than the warning system under test. The output of the warning system is then compared to the baseline measurement to produce a quantitative measure of performance. The baseline measurement system is installed on a vehicle with the warning system. The baseline system achieves high accuracy by aiming a calibrated camera onto an area of the road adjacent to the vehicle. As the vehicle is driven and roadway departure maneuvers are performed, the output of the video camera, the vehicle's position (from a global positioning system and inertial sensors), and the output of the warning system are synchronized and digitally recorded. After a vehicle run is complete, a suite of software is used to automatically analyze the baseline video data to determine roadway departure. Since the video and other data remain available after the vehicle run, an operator (to establish the credibility of the baseline measurement) can verify a roadway departure. Also, the data can be analyzed to provide insight into the c [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of increasingly elaborate nomadic devices presents {{a problem for}} the safety of our roadways. One approach to counteracting this emerging threat is safetyenhancing systems, such as Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) that are also beginning to enter the automotive market. These systems attempt to warn the driver about immediate unexpected conflicts. Yet the introduction of collision warning systems into the passenger vehicle market has been relatively slow, perhaps because of the acceptance issues surrounding nuisance alerts. Common types of FCW nuisance alerts include situations where a host vehicle approaches a lead vehicle that is vacating the lane (either turning or changing lanes) or when a host vehicle approaches the lead vehicle with an intention of passing. Common LDW alerts that might be considered to be unnecessary include those where the driver knowingly strays over the lane marker without consequence, or where the driver intentionally changes lanes without using the turn signal. Both extended exposure to these systems on the road and in relatively short exposures in the driving simulator have suggested that nuisance alerts undermine driver acceptance (e. g., NHTSA, 2005; Lees & Lee, in preparation). Nuisance alerts often stem from the difficulty these systems have in detecting the driver’s current state of awareness. For example, even if a system performs exactly as the designers had intended and correctly identifies a potential threat associated with a slowing lead vehicle, attentive drivers may still view the situation as a nuisance alert. Whether a driver views an alert as useful or annoying depends on the driver state as well as the traffic situation. As a consequence, {{the next step in the}} adaptive-vehicle cockpit will be to not only measure the traffic situation, but also the state of the driver. To avoid annoying the driver, collision-warning systems will adapt warnings according to whether the driver is attending to the forward <b>roadway.</b> Adaptive collision <b>warnings</b> are one of the two major branches of the Safety Vehicle...|$|R
30|$|Rockburst {{ultimately}} {{leads to}} the sudden violent <b>dynamic</b> failures of <b>roadway</b> or coalface, of which 87  % (Pan et al. 2013) occurs in the roadway. Therefore, it is of direct significance for the control of rockburst by inhibiting the failure of roadway and coalface through support means. As for rockburst-resisting roadways, the support system should be capable of resisting high burst dynamics, providing appropriate pressure yielding deformation, and owning a flexibility that can play a buffering and energy-absorbing role (Gao et al. 2009). Bolt has become a reasonable supporting mean due to its initiative, pressure yielding ability, energy absorbing ability, and the capability in utilizing the bearing capacity of surrounding rocks (Gao et al. 2009; He et al. 2010). However, bolt support technology can only resist the rockburst under certain intensity. As for high-energy rockburst, energy absorbing materials are needed to consume part of the tremor energy to stabilize the support system (Lv et al. 2011). On this basis, Pan and Lv et al. (Pan et al. 2011; Lv and Pan 2012) proposed a structure model of rigid-flexible energy-absorbing support which was composed of surrounding rocks, energy absorbing materials, and steel bracket (rigid-flexible-rigid). In essence, the model {{is similar to the}} strong–soft–strong structure model (Gao et al. 2008). The surrounding rocks, energy absorbing materials, and steel bracket are equivalent to the externally strong large structure, middle soft structure, internally strong small structure respectively. Theoretically basing on the model above, the rigid-flexible energy-absorbing support system (Liu et al. 2013) was developed. It is a three-level support system composed of three parts, namely, the bolt-mesh-cable support, the O-type roof support made of energy absorbing materials and U-type steels (simply called as O-type roof support), and the rigid burst-resisting bracket. The energy absorbing materials lay between the bolt-mesh-cable support and O-type roof support. This support system was implemented in Yuejin Coal Mine of Henan Dayou Energy Co., Ltd., China, and effectively avoided roadway damages, equipment damages, and casualties when high-energy rockburst occurred.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, new sensing technologies, such as {{inductive}} loops, laser range scanners, radar detectors and computer vision sensors have been greatly enhanced {{and applied to}} the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) area. Among all these sensor systems, computer vision-based approaches {{are one of the}} most popular and promising techniques used in ITS for traffic evaluation and management, driver assistance, as well as other safety related research. This is primarily due to the advantages of easy maintenance, high flexibility, and low cost for traffic scene monitoring and analysis. Many stationary vision sensors have been already installed near the roadway, particularly at intersections. In addition, more and more vision sensors are now being installed on mobile vehicles, in order to have real time surrounding traffic information. This dissertation focuses on both mobile and stationary computer vision based traffic surveillance techniques, including the development of a new vision sensor, a survey and development of vision algorithms, as well as their applications in three different aspects of ITS areas with high quantitative requirements. These areas are outlined in further detail below. Portable Loop Fault Detection For many years, it has been difficult to quantitatively measure real-time freeway traffic conditions. Numerous research projects have been carried out in traffic surveillance; for example, the Freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS) operated by Caltrans and UC Berkeley collects, processes, aggregates, and examines traffic data primarily through loop detectors buried beneath the freeway. This type of stationary embedded loop sensor system provides a point measurement for the traffic flow, roadway occupancy and average speed. By aggregating these directly measured traffic data, they can be used to estimate and provide a larger picture of the traffic conditions in certain area. However, the results obtained from embedded loop sensors are not entirely reliable. The embedded loop data delivered to a Traffic Management Center (TMC) may contain errors at one or more sensors, and between the loop detector and the TMC database. As a result, loop fault detection is important. In this dissertation, a stationary-vision based technique has been developed as part of a Portable Loop Fault Detection Tool (PLFDT). This work is complementary to recent research focusing on aggregated faulty loop data at a macroscopic level (the macroscopic level generally considers a large roadway network as consisting of links (roadways) and nodes (e. g., intersections)). The objectives of the PLFDT is to develop a real time, multi-lane, multi-vehicle tracking system for freeways using video cameras as the baseline measurement technique to compare the loop detection signal for direct fault detection for inductive loop system. Localized Traffic Density Measurement The embedded loop sensor system provides a direct measurement to traffic flow, roadway occupancy and average speed (only for double-loop detector). This type of sensor network does not directly measure traffic density; instead it can only be estimated. In this dissertation, we have developed systematic techniques to measure traffic conditions by utilizing both on- and off-board computer vision systems. A unique development technique is a combined computer vision and Global Positioning System (GPS) equipped mobile traffic surveillance system to measure localized traffic density. In addition, we correlate the localized density measurement with estimates from embedded loop sensor system using a space-time diagram. Experiments have shown the complementary nature of these sensing techniques. Further, most traffic surveillance computer vision algorithms and techniques are typically based on observing vehicles from stationary rectilinear cameras mounted near roadways. For many applications, some of the key tasks include extracting traffic information such as average traffic speed, flow, and density. However, less research has been carried out in observing and generating the localized traffic map around specific vehicles in the traffic stream. In this dissertation, we have developed a vision-equipped vehicle test bed for traffic surveillance purposes and have experimentally demonstrated the generation of localized traffic density from video processing and synthesizing. In contrast to the off-board surveillance systems (e. g. embedded loop sensor networks and stationary vision monitoring system), this type of on-board surveillance system provides a temporal- and spatial- continuous measurement of the localized traffic density. One of the key components developed is an Orthogonal Omni-directional Vision (OODV) System that has been developed to observe lane-level activity surrounding a vehicle, as well as the ability to observe the surrounding roadway geometry. This vision system uses a special catadioptric mirror providing a 360 degree orthogonal view of the environment. It is different from other catadioptric mirror-based Omni-directional vision systems in that it directly provides an orthogonal image without the need of warping a polar-coordinate based image to a perspective view. Based on this unique OODV, a roadway traffic surveillance system was designed and implemented. It consists of three major components: *	A GPS stamped roadway traffic data collection technique; *	Post video processing that includes automatic vehicle detection/tracking with the ability to correct using interactive tools;*	A traffic parameter (localized density) estimation process. Combined with a GPS receiver that provides approximately 2 - 3 meters spatial resolution, this traffic surveillance system can be applied not only in several traffic applications which require localized traffic density/flow/average speed measurements, but also in some other applications that require detailed roadway geometry acquisition, and vehicle activity analysis. Based on experimentation, it has been shown that the designed mobile surveillance system reports a high detection rate under the dynamic freeway environment in the experiments, with assistance from a human interactive detection module. In order to have a better understanding of dynamic traffic conditions, we have incorporated this localized traffic density measurements into a <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Roadway</b> Network Database (DRND), which has been developed to fuse the roadway traffic data and the probe vehicle data. We believe that with the increasing use of on-board vision sensors, more and more localized traffic information samples can be reported to this type of database. The combinational analysis of temporal-spatial variable density and the embedded loop sensor data will provide a better and more reliable method for traffic condition estimation and prediction. Bicycle Safety Support System In addition to these new traffic data collection/analysis techniques and verification process, computer vision techniques are being applied in safety studies as well. In the third part of this dissertation, stationary vision based observations have been made of the timing of bicyclists' intersection crossing maneuvers, to support of efforts in improving traffic signal timing to accommodate the needs of bicyclists. Video recordings were made of bicyclists' crossings and the video images were processed to extract the bicyclists' trajectories. These were synchronized with video images of the traffic signals so that the timing of the bicyclists' maneuvers could be determined relative to the signal phases. The processed data have yielded cumulative distributions of the crossing speeds of bicyclists who did not have to stop at the intersection and the start-up times and final crossing speeds of the bicyclists who had to cross from a standing start. This study provides a foundation in recommendation of minimal green signal time in terms of safety purpose. The key contributions of this dissertation are:*	A unique OODV System has been designed and developed;*	A vision based systematic approach for developing a mobile traffic surveillance system has been proposed and implemented;*	A time-space diagram based flow calculation method from localized density has been proposed and experimentally verified; *	A stationary-vision based technique has been developed as part of a Portable Loop Fault Detection Tool (PLFDT) to provide baseline data; and*	A stationary vision-based intersection monitoring system has been developed for the quantitative study of bicyclist crossings at signalized intersections...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{agencies}} in coastal urban areas face a significant challenge {{to enhance the}} long-term resilience of their networks to flooding and storm surge events exacerbated by sea level rise. The problem of sea-level rise adaptation is characterized by deep uncertainty that makes it complex to assess the value of adaptation investments. To enable informed adaptation decisions, the present study created a dynamic stochastic modeling framework based on the theoretical underpinnings of complex adaptive systems that integrates: (i) stochastic simulation of sea-level rise stressors based on the data obtained from downscaled climate studies pertaining to future projections of sea-level and precipitation; (ii) <b>dynamic</b> modeling of <b>roadway</b> conditions by considering regular decay of roadways, as well as structural damages caused by storm surge events; and (iii) a decision-theoretic modeling of agency infrastructure management and adaptation processes based on cognitive psychology, bounded rationality, and regret theories. In this framework, resilience is examined based on trend changes in the network performance measures (e. g., life cycle costs and performance). The created framework and model were tested in a case study related to the road network {{of the city of}} Miami-Beach, which global assessments rank first iv among the world 2 ̆ 7 s urban areas most exposed to sea-level rise risks. The results indicated that: (i) SLR Adaptation investment and life cycle costs of roadway infrastructure are negatively correlated. In addition, it was shown that the sensitivity of network’s life cycle cost to actual sea-level rise scenario decreases when adaptation investment increases. These finding emphasize the importance of proactive improvement of the network resilience to alleviate the long-term costs of sea-level rise. (ii) When funding is sufficient for all required adaptation actions, mid-term adaptation planning yields lower life cycle cost. When funding is insufficient, aggregated investment in long-term adaptation planning intervals yields lower network LCC. These findings imply that different adaptation planning approaches should be taken for different levels of adaptation investment. (iii) The agency’s perception of SLR and risk attitude do not have significant effect on life cycle cost of roadway networks. Hence, implementation of adaptation action based on any perception of sea-level rise and risk attitude can significantly reduce the life cycle costs of roadway networks under the impacts of SLR. (iv) The devised performance target has negative correlation with life cycle cost of a roadway network affected by SLR impacts. Therefore, compromising the network performance condition will never result in lower life cycle costs...|$|R
