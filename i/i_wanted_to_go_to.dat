500|$|Thorpe {{spoke to}} reporters after his 100m race, saying: [...] "When I started this I {{wanted to get}} back into the pool. I wanted to start racing again, I wanted to be {{competitive}} again and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Olympics. I still want to do all of those things. I've missed out on what was a huge goal for me to accomplish in this short period of time, but still the desire I had previous to this, it's still there." [...] Essentially saying that his (relatively) slow times in the 100 and 200 meters were the result of too short a period to train and prepare, Thorpe announced he will continue training, setting as his (new) goal qualifying for the World Championships in 2013.|$|E
