To {{investigate}} {{the validity of}} steel slag as aggregates in road <b>surface</b> <b>dressing,</b> {{a series of tests}} for asphalt concrete mixed with asphalt cement and steel slag aggregates particles are performed using Marshall method. Through the statistical analysis of the test data, and comparison the data with those of asphalt macadam mixture, the asphalt concrete mixed with asphalt cement and steel slag aggregates have very large stiffness, high resistance to deformation and high resistance to cracking. If meeting the requirements of the code in china for asphalt macadam mixture, steel slag can be applied in road <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> instead of stone aggregates, but also bring remarkable economic effect and has broad application prospect...|$|R

The inservice performance of <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> relates to balancing properties such as skid resistance against changes in time as the aggregate particles embed into the underlying road and react to trafficking.

The influence of chipping size is also discussed.

40|$|Surface {{dressings}} {{are used}} as a road maintenance activity {{as well as a}} surfacing of a newly constructed road. One of the main decisions to be taken in designing a dressing is the selection of appropriate aggregate size. Improper selection of aggregate size could tarnish the performance of a <b>surface</b> <b>dressing.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} find the optimum size of aggregate for a single <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> especially in Sri Lankan Macadam roads. General size of aggregate for a particular <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> could be found using commercial traffic volume and surface hardness of the road based on TRRL method. But the aggregate sizes selected in above simple method have shown inconsistent results. Therefore tests should be carried out to find most appropriate size for the surface dressings. Three sizes of aggregate were selected using above simple check for the tests. Three different surface dressings from different aggregate sizes were done. Binder type kept constant and binder rate changed according to the chip size. The performances of these three surface dressings were evaluated by measuring aggregate removal rate and skid resistance of the seal. Digital photographs of demarcated locations in surface dressings of different chip sizes were taken at pre determined time intervals. The numbers of aggregate were counted in each photo after certain time interval and using this data, the behavior of each <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> over a period of time can be studied. The aggregate size that could keep highest area of aggregate intact in its dressing would be a more durable chip size. The next aspect of checking performance of the dressing is the skid resistance. The techniques utilized to measure this value are Locked wheel test and Sand patch method. The main- aim of skid resistance testing was to compare three sizes of aggregate and see how they respond to skidding. -It was found that 9. 5 mm nominal size performed better in durability aspect and 12. 5 mm performed better in skid resistance aspect...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} the monitoring {{and the experience}} of two full scale trials with <b>surface</b> <b>dressing.</b> In one of them modified emulsion was tested on the primary road 84 between Kasteln-Laforsen in the county Hälsingland in the north of Sweden. The test sections were produced during year 2001. A second full scale trial test was carried through during year 2004 with the purpose to optimise the utilizing of the stone aggregate (chippings) with different types of fractions 4 - 8, 4 - 16 and 8 - 16 mm. This trial was carried through on the secondary road 723 between Heden and Färila also in the county Hälsingland. In addition to testing different types of binders, the effect of breaking additive was studied in the respects of how soon the <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> could be swept from excess of loose stones after the surface treatment was carried out and the time of the year the surface treatment was carried out. The test sections have been monitored with respect to macro texture, rut depth, longitudinal evenness and noise emission as well as by visual inspections of damages and defects. In addition to this the laboratory testing of the wear resistance and the testing of the sensibility to the effect of water have been carried out. For this purpose a modified laboratory test method (Prall method), for <b>surface</b> <b>dressing,</b> has been used. During the production phase of the <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> some advantages were noticed by the use of polymer modified bitumen emulsion {{with the addition of a}} breaking additive. In principle the method is to inject the breaking additive into the emulsion just before spreading of the bituminous emulsion on the road. The stone aggregate was fixed to the road surface after a relatively short time which made it possible to sweep the surface treatment from the excess of loose stones after a few hours after the production of the surface treatment. Modified bitumen emulsion combined with the breaking additive showed consequently positive effects for the road users through better accessibility and a less risk of loose stones damaging the vehicles...|$|R
