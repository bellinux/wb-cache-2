40|$|There is a {{widespread}} idea that corporations have completely taken over invention and innovation processes throughout the twentieth century, thus becoming the main users of patent systems. However, recent studies suggest that, in spite of corporate expansion, independent invention is still economically significant nowadays, and that individuals outside {{the boundaries of the}} firm were actually the principal source of innovation before World War II. This article analyzes the history of corporate and <b>independent</b> <b>patents</b> in Spain in the long-term, in order to confirm that independents were also very relevant to promoting innovation and technology transfer in latecomers with high rates of technological dependence. Employing a new method of work with patent files, the author also offers new historical evidence of the structure, effectiveness and scope of emerging international social networks of innovation. After introducing the research framework, Section Two briefly summarizes the characteristics of the Spanish patent system, and compares corporate and <b>independent</b> <b>patents</b> taken out between 1820 and 1939.

40|$|BACKGROUND: While {{there has}} been much {{discussion}} by policymakers and stakeholders about the effects of "secondary patents" on the pharmaceutical industry, there is no empirical evidence on their prevalence or determinants. Characterizing the landscape of secondary patents is important in light of recent court decisions in the U. S. that may make them more difficult to obtain, and for developing countries considering restrictions on secondary patents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We read the claims of the 1304 Orange Book listed patents on all new molecular entities approved in the U. S. between 1988 and 2005, and coded the patents as including chemical compound claims (claims covering the active molecule itself) and/or one of several types of secondary claims. We distinguish between patents with any secondary claims, and those with only secondary claims and no chemical compound claims ("independent" secondary patents). We find that secondary claims are common in the pharmaceutical industry. We also show that <b>independent</b> secondary <b>patents</b> tend to be filed and issued later than chemical compound patents, and {{are also more likely to}} be filed after the drug is approved. When present, <b>independent</b> formulation <b>patents</b> add an average of 6. 5 years of patent life (95 % C. I. : 5. 9 to 7. 3 years), independent method of use patents add 7. 4 years (95 % C. I. : 6. 4 to 8. 4 years), and <b>independent</b> <b>patents</b> on polymorphs, isomers, prodrug, ester, and/or salt claims add 6. 3 years (95 % C. I. : 5. 3 to 7. 3 years). We also provide evidence that late-filed <b>independent</b> secondary <b>patents</b> are more common for higher sales drugs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Policies and court decisions affecting secondary patenting are likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Secondary patents provide substantial additional patent life in the pharmaceutical industry, at least nominally. Evidence that they are also more common for best-selling drugs is consistent with accounts of active "life cycle management" or "evergreening" of patent portfolios in the industry...|$|R

40|$|This patent {{describes}} {{a means by}} which an outdoor storage unit for wheelchairs is opened and closed. Co-authors King, A. C. and King, B. A proposed outdoor storage units for wheelchairs to be operated by the public. Originality: Physical movement of part of the product is used as visual feedback to the user, who is standing remote from the wheelchair storage pods at the moment of unlocking. This movement was achieved by taking full advantage of the materials and processes already required to make the shell of each storage unit. This changed the project from an un-patentable, ‘lockable-box’ concept (according to an <b>independent</b> <b>patent</b> attorney who reviewed the original proposition) into a design solution with unique qualities of user-interaction, warranting international patent protection. An appropriate design process methodology was proposed and the project was agreed and funded on that basis. In the final design, the local area of the rotationally moulded shell is designed with a double-wall (a unique capability of this process) enabling complex door-engagement details to be post-machined directly into the moulding without compromising its structural integrity or adding new component costs. The work builds directly on Lievesley's work on the innovative application of plastics evident in his previously patented or registered designs for street-furniture and traffic products (see previous RAE 2008 submission: Bicycle Stand Patent number GB 2382554 and also RAE 2001 submissions: European Patent EP 0863091 'Fire-retardant enclosure' and UK Registered Design No. 2045078 'Pedal Operated Waste Bin'). In each of these two designs, Lievesley also used the double-wall rotational-moulding process to achieve a key product feature without introducing additional components. The first uses it to create a water reservoir to automatically extinguish fires set by vandals in a litter-bin. The second uses the double wall to conceal a pedal-bin’s moving parts within the plastic body to eliminate dirt-traps in commercial kitchens. Impact: The wheelchair storage unit was co-developed with the commercialisation company, Wheelbox Ltd. The research and development work was funded as part of a £ 735 k multidisciplinary European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) project named INSTEP. Once the Patent applications had been filed, prototype units were publicly trialled at football stadia, bus termini and a major museum, and were filmed and featured on the BBC’s regional news programmes and in the regional press...|$|E
40|$|The Court of Justice of the European Union has {{frequently}} {{been criticized for}} its allegedly pro-integration and almost pro-active judicial policy regarding the construction {{and the application of}} primary and secondary Union law. This paper aims at showing that, at least with respect {{to the development of a}} uniform case law on harmonized national and unified Community industrial property, the Court has had and still has to fulfil its unique task of informing national courts and the industrial property community in general as to the direction, in which European Union law is to evolve in the interest of the Union’s legal unity and of its independent industrial property policy. To this effect, a comparison is made between, on the one hand, the system of decentralized judicial review as it has been established with respect to both harmonized national copyright, trademark and design law, and unitary Community trademarks, designs and plant varieties, with, on the other hand, the recent proposals made for the conclusion of a “European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) ” and for the creation by international agreement of a highly centralized “European and European Union Patent Court (EEUPC) ”. Both concern the settlement of litigation over infringement and validity of patents, the former relating only to national patents resulting from the bundle of patents granted by the European Patent Office at uniform conditions, the latter to both these patents and the unitary European Union patent (formerly the Community patent) as expected to be introduced by a Community regulation. More particularly, the paper critically assesses the relationship between the proposed inter-national EEUPC and the European Court of Justice. The draft agreement as currently under consideration by the Council of the European Union pretends at creating a workable link between the two different courts with a view to ensuring primacy of the Union’s law and uniformity of the application of its secondary law on patents. However, in reality the proposal tends to both severely reduce the role, which the European Court of Justice ought to play in the Union’s legal order, and to restrict the sovereign development of a forward looking, <b>independent</b> <b>patent</b> policy by the Union. This is so because, on the one hand, as a specialised and centralised high court, the EEUPC will by itself and by its very vocation ensure the development of a patent-specific “expert” case law and of its uniformity, and, on the other, because the inclusion of both the European and the European Union patent into one litigation agreement containing a full set of rules on the infringement and on the revocation of patents will exclude any unilaterally defined patent policy. As a result, patent law is vowed to develop in splendid isolation, and without the benefit of the guidance, which the European Court of Justice, it being a supreme court of general jurisdiction, has given and is called upon to give in other areas of the protection of industrial and intellectual property in the Union...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Türkiye sanayileşmesini tamamlayamamış, bu nedenle henüz tam olarak üretici ülkeler kategorisinde olmayan, düşük değilse bile orta gelir düzeyinde bir ülkedir. Salt ekonomik açıdan değerlendirildiğinde görülen bu olumsuz duruma karşın Türkiye, bulunduğu coğrafyada güçlü ve caydırıcı konumunu sürdürmek, bunun için de güçlü bir silahlı kuvvetlere ve onu destekleyen güçlü bir savunma sanayiine sahip olmak, dolayısıyla bu alanda harcamalar yapmak zorundadır.   Ülkemiz uzun vadede teknoloji edinme stratejilerinden birkaçına başvurarak yoluna devam etmelidir. Ancak Türkiye gibi bölgesel güçten küresel güç olma yolunda ilerleyen, uluslar arası devlet destekli terör örgütlerinin sahada olduğu siyasi ve jeopolitik konumda olan, teknolojiden yoksun bir Türkiye için çok uzun sürecek olan teknoloji edinme faaliyetleri ulusal savunma gücünü kısa vadede zayıflatmaktadır. Uzun vadede ise gelişmiş ekonomilerin her zaman bir adım gerisinden gidilecek ve montaj sanayinin değişik versiyonu olan kopya sanayi riski ortaya çıkacaktır. Tez çalışması kapsamında literatür taraması teknoloji transferi, teknoloji istihbaratı, patent kırma teknikleri kavramları çerçevesinde yapılmıştır. Literatür taraması doğrultusunda elde edilen verilere göre; teknoloji yönetimi ve ulusal teknoloji stratejisi belirleme faaliyetlerinin temelini gelecek çalışmaları oluşturmaktadır. Gelecek çalışmalarında ağırlıklı olarak kullanılan yöntemler teknoloji istihbaratı, teknoloji değerlendirmesi, teknoloji tahmini ve teknoloji öngörüsü olarak karşımıza çıkmaktadır. Bu kapsamda teknoloji öngörü çalışmaları alternatif formları arasından teknoloji istihbaratı metodu incelenerek Türk savunma sanayisi için hızlandırılmış teknoloji istihbaratı stratejileri araştırılmıştır.

'Industrial espionage' {{activities that}} emerged after the Industrial Revolution have referred many states to take precaution against dangers {{that occur in}} enemy elements and have been effective in countering the shortcomings that will occur in war times. Both in short term to increase the deterrent strength of our national defense {{as well as in}} the long term in order to have a strong national defense technology, every way should be tried to become a global power.   At this point, starting from recent period of war history that has changed the nature of the world of politics, it is required to investigate the technology intelligence operations conducted in the states by using example case analysis and to determine the importance level of technology intelligence activities among the nationalization strategies for defense technology of Turkey. As part of the thesis, literature research was made within the framework of technology transfer, technology intelligence and the concepts of patent breaking techniques. According to the data obtained in accordance with the literature; future studies constitute a basis for technology management and the activities to set a national technology strategy.   Methods that mainly used in future studies appears on the topics of technology intelligence, technology assessment, technology forecasting and technology prediction. In this context, accelerated technology strategies for the Turkish defense industry were investigated among alternative forms of intelligence technology foresight activities by examining technology intelligence methods. This thesis presents a novel technical intelligence method of patent mapping for visualising conflicts between patent claims that incorporates the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ). Implemantation of “TRIZ: innovative invention technique” (the theory of inventive problem solving" in English acronym TIPS) as a method of accelerated technology intelligence to identify and to evaluate the certain technologies that could affect the current and future activities of the defense industry firms is the main objective of our study.   Between technology intelligence activities, providing information over patents, that were disclosed, has been increasing its importance across every day. The required technical data can be obtained by accessing publicly accessible internet database of patents. Patents are an important source of information for industrial research and product development because of easy accessibility and the inherent innovativeness. To know how to use this information resource in innovative/innovation designs is much more important. Patent intelligence; the transformation of content found in multiple patents into technical, business, and legal insight, is considered a key factor in gaining a competitive advantage in technologically competitive business environments. Patents provide a wealth of information about design concepts, their physical realization, and their relationship to prior designs in the form of citations. Patent databases which can be easily accessible from the open source stand out among many different methods of technology intelligence. The methodology of breaking patents and the method utilised to exceed the scope of the patent, that used in the context of thesis work, are engineering techniques that represents the rearrangement of claims which allows to create new versions of a legal and technical system.   In this study, possible innovation paths to exceed the scope of the patent were discussed by examining the tools of “TRIZ: the theory of innovative problem solving”. And finally, patents taken on unmanned aerial vehicles which will have strategic importance for the defense industry in the future have been examined and a design of exceeding the scope of a selected patent is included in dissertation. In the thesis, primarily one was selected by examining patents were approved in the field of defense industry and then TRIZ method to produce innovation over existing patents is used. Selected dependent and <b>independent</b> <b>patent</b> claims have been analyzed in detail. Data required for functional analysis examining the relationship between sub-functions with the patent's main functions have been created.   Subsequently patent function graph was revealed. After this step we used comprising a plurality of TRIZ method of ARIZ algorithm to obtain innovative proposals. Patents have been made taking into account the physical condition of the evaluation on each of the innovative proposals. An innovative form of patents on existing patents as a result of assessment work has been developed in this context. This thesis analyzed accelerated technical intelligence for Turkish defence industry developmet.  Technology intelligence tools have come to be regarded as vital components in planning for technology development and formulating technology strategies.

40|$|The {{status of}} patent {{attorneys}} in the Czech Republic and {{their rights and}} obligations The purpose of my thesis is to analyze the status of patent attorneys in the Czech Republic and highlight their rights and obligations. The thesis is composed of six chapters, each of them dealing with {{different aspects of the}} historical or modern view on the profession. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis. Chapter Two examines with the historical evolution of the profession. The chapter consists of six parts. Each part deals with some of the time period of modern Czech history. Chapter Three is subdivided into four parts and provides an outline of the first <b>independent</b> act about <b>patent</b> attorneys on the territory of Czech republic/Czechoslovakia. Chapter Four concentrates on problems resulting from the necessity of the professional autonomy and examines with the inner structure of the Chamber of patent attorneys. Chapter Five discuss about the actual legislation and the status of patent attorney on the ground of last professional act. Chapter Six summarizes the head rights and obligations which are important for the exercise of the profession. At the conclusion of my thesis I focus on possible future changes in legislation and recapitulation of current status. The main aim [...] ...|$|R
50|$|By 1850, Lowell's {{population}} was 33,000, {{making it the}} second largest city in Massachusetts and America's largest industrial center. The 5.6 mile long canal system produced 10,000 horsepower, being provided to ten corporations {{with a total of}} forty mills. Ten thousand workers used an equal number of looms fed by 320,000 spindles. The mills were producing 50,000 miles of cloth annually. Other industries developed in Lowell as well: The Lowell Machine Shop and Father John's Medicine opened. Tanneries, a bleachery, and service companies needed by the growing city were established. Moxie, an early soft drink, was invented in Lowell in the 1870s. Around 1880, Lowell became the first city in America to have telephone numbers.Lowell continued to be in the forefront of new industrial technology. In 1828, Paul Moody developed an early belt-driven power transfer system to supersede the unreliable gearwork that was utilized at the time. In 1830, Patrick Tracy Jackson commissioned work on the Boston and Lowell Railroad, one of the Oldest railroads in North America. It opened five years became <b>independent</b> in 1845, <b>patent</b> medicine factories like Hood's Sarsaparilla Laboratory later, making the Middlesex Canal obsolete. Soon, lines up the Merrimack to Nashua, downriver to Lawrence, and inland to Groton Junction, today known as Ayer (renamed after Lowell patent medicine tycoon Dr. James Cook Ayer), were constructed.|$|R
25|$|The Terrex AV81 is an {{armoured}} fighting vehicle weighing between 25 and 30 tons an 8×8 {{wheeled chassis}} and modern armour. Multiple weapon platforms are supported, including both the remote and overhead weapons stations. The Terrex's modular design allows for different level of armour protection and weapon systems. It {{is designed to}} be air-portable by C-130s or equivalent cargo aircraft. The Terrex uses a <b>patented</b> <b>independent</b> double wishbone suspension, which greatly improves ground mobility and comfort during rides over rough terrains. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tyres enables the Terrex to reach high speed on soft ground. The vehicle has a double hull with an external V-hull that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full chemical, biological and nuclear protection in extreme operational conditions. The baseline configuration is fully amphibious. Two water jets mounted on either side {{at the back of the}} hull propel the vehicle through water at 10km/h. Initially developed for export sales from the number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements including U.S. Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) concept, which calls for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs. In 2006, the SAF decided to purchase 135 units to replace their aging V-200 armoured vehicles. The Indonesian Army also indicated plans to purchase 420 units and to produce the Terrex under license locally.|$|R
40|$|To the {{difference}} of trademarks and designs, protection of patents in Europe essentially rests on national law only. The 'European patent' as granted by the European Patent Organization through the European Patent Office, while internationally uniform as to {{the conditions of the}} grant, represents but a 'bundle' of as many <b>independent</b> national <b>patents</b> as have been asked for by the applicant. As a consequence, the terms of the exclusive right, which they confer upon their owner, are determined by the various national laws. It is to remedy this territorially fragmented and more or less diverse protection, that since about half a century the European Union attempts to establish an autonomous system of unitary patent protection of its own design, but has failed to achieve it whichever way it chose. The stumbling blocks have been not so much the proper determination of the substance of protection, since only little efforts of modernization have been undertaken. Rather, they were the choice of the language regime for the patents granted, and the establishment of a common patent litigation system. Both obstacles have a history of their own. While the latter is still evolving, the former actually has blocked the introduction of an EU-wide unitary European Union (ex Community) patent. Instead, a 'European patent with unitary effect' is about to come, which will cover only the territories of those EU Member States, which will participate in 'enhanced cooperation' within the Union, most likely a majority of 25 States. Switching from the entire Union to enhanced cooperation was, indeed, the not unwelcome opportunity not only to overcome the language hurdle, but also to modify the very structure of patent protection, and to try to move from a Union type of patent to an international one. The paper is concerned with, first, why the language regime could become or could be made a reason to move from a Union project to one of enhanced cooperation among “the willing”; second, with whether enhanced cooperation is a proper approach at all under Union law; third, with the problematic structure and nature of the 'European patent with unitary effect'; and fourth, with the no less problematic co-existence of an up-graded European patent as it will result from the eventual adoption of an 'Agreement on a Unified Patent Court' to be concluded among EU Member States only. The conclusion is that instead of obtaining a workable system of patent protection in Europe, we will have to face a multi-layer monster system of patents of all kinds, national, full and half European, Unionist, territorially fragmented or unitary, balanced or unbalanced in their substance...|$|R
