5|$|Nearby and to {{the north}} of this demesne, the Knights Hospitaller {{established}} a Commandery at Clerkenwell dedicated to St John in the mid-12th century, and in 1194 received a Charter from King Richard I <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> Order formal privileges. Later Augustinian canonesses established the Priory of St Mary, north of the Knights of St John property.|$|E
5|$|Such {{measures}} impelled Pericles' {{critics to}} hold him responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy. Constantine Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions. Hence, he enacted legislation <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> lower classes access to the political system and the public offices, from which they had previously been barred.|$|E
5|$|The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was {{ratified}} in 1961, <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> District three {{votes in}} the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president, but still no voting representation in Congress.|$|E

5|$|The colonies, {{in spite}} of their differences, united {{themselves}} as a consequence of these events, <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> Second Continental Congress (predecessor to the modern U.S. Congress) sufficient authority and funding to conduct the revolution as a unified whole, including funding and outfitting the military forces that formed {{as a result of this}} campaign.|$|E
5|$|Although Charles {{had been}} criticised {{severely}} for <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> large ransom payment to the Vikings, {{he had other}} more critical issues to deal with at the same time, including disputes with his brothers, regional revolts and disgruntled nobles, as well as pressure from abroad. Since he would have trouble trusting his own counts to assemble and lead troops to defeat Ragnar's large force militarily, paying them off instead would buy Charles time, and possibly peace from further Viking raids—at least in the near future.|$|E
5|$|As Norway gained full {{independence}} in 1905, {{the national government}} determined to establish institutions consistent with the newly formed state's ambitions as a modern society. The first prime minister made it a priority to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water toilets, providing hot and cold water, and <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, queen, and their son.|$|E

5|$|Between battles, {{characters}} can {{be managed}} at a Base. In this location, skills can be assigned, weapons can be traded, purchased, and forged, and bonus experience points earned in battle can be given to characters. There is also a Support system accessible through the Base where player characters can talk {{with each other and}} improve their relationships. These conversations improve affinity between characters and grant stat boots in battle. Supports are ranked from C to A, with A being the highest rank and <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> best bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left {{less than a}} year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E
5|$|Following Baehr v. Lewin, a 1993 {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of Hawaii that found the state's refusal to grant same-sex couples marriage licenses discriminatory, voters in 1998 approved a constitutional amendment <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> Hawaii State Legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples, and the legislature passed a law banning same-sex marriage. Civil unions were not restricted. Bills creating civil unions were considered several times, but failed to receive committee approval prior to 2009.|$|E

5|$|In 1456 Reginald de Gray, {{the owner}} of the Manor itself, sold the land to a group {{including}} Thomas Bryan. A few months later, the other members signed deeds of release, <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> property solely to Thomas Bryan. Bryan acted as either a feoffee or an owner representing the governing body of the Inn (there are some records suggesting he may have been a Bencher at this point) but in 1493 he transferred the ownership by charter to a group including Sir Robert Brudenell and Thomas Wodeward, reverting the ownership of the Inn partially back to the Gray family.|$|E
5|$|In March 1794, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> government additional powers {{in the event of}} an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson, on {{the other}} hand, took a stricter view of the Constitution: parsing the text carefully, he found no {{specific}} authorization for a national bank. This controversy was eventually settled by the Supreme Court of the United States in McCulloch v. Maryland, which in essence adopted Hamilton's view, <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> federal government broad freedom to select the best means to execute its constitutionally enumerated powers, specifically the doctrine of implied powers. Nevertheless, the American Civil War and the Progressive Era demonstrated the sorts of crises and politics Hamilton's administrative republic sought to avoid.|$|E

5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad {{can be said}} to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between {{the two sides of the}} Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} prompted Pakistan {{to ask the}} two Australian {{players to}} appear {{in front of their}} own judicial inquiry into corruption; Australia responded by <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> Pakistanis permission to hold hearings in Australia with full privileges. The players were questioned about their accusations against Malik, and whether their dealings with John detracted from their credibility. Both Waugh and Warne denied any suggestions they played with less determination in the matches in question, stating that they were among the leading players in those games.|$|E
5|$|The embassy party {{left behind}} in Canton in 1518 {{proceeded}} north in January 1520 {{with the rest of}} the Portuguese under Tomé Pires and Fernão Pires de Andrade. The embassy reached Nanjing, where the Zhengde Emperor was touring in May 1520, <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese embassy a quick audience. However, further diplomatic negotiations were to be resumed once the emperor returned to Beijing; hence, the Portuguese embassy was sent there to wait for the emperor's return.|$|E

5|$|The first prior was Aldwyn, {{who founded}} the monastery on his bishop's advice, and by 1135 the monastery {{included}} thirty monks. Aldwyn was succeeded by Walcher of Malvern, an astronomer and philosopher from Lorraine, whose gravestone inside the priory church records details that the priory arose in 1085 from a hermitage endowed by Edward the Confessor. An ancient stained glass window in the Priory church depicts the legend of St. Werstan, with details of his vision, the consecration of his chapel, Edward the Confessor <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> charter for the site, and Werstan's martyrdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue was}} {{resolved}} on May 23, 2008 when BK CEO John Chidsey announced {{an agreement with}} the CIW <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> requested 1¢ pay increase to the workers.

Additionally, the company agreed to provide a ½¢ per pound payment to the CIW to cover payroll taxes and administrative costs for the tomato growers.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{conservation status}} of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, <b>granting</b> <b>the</b> species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction. Many states had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. The great white shark is further listed as Threatened in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and as rare or likely to become extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in Western Australia.|$|E
