5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E

After the ultimate failure of Operation Barbarossa in January 1942, Blumentritt returned to Germany as Chief Quartermaster of the OKH. Late in the year he personally recommended to his superiors that the Germans should withdraw from Stalingrad, receiving the support of Chief of Staff OKH—General Franz Halder—in this recommendation, but the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> withdrawal was rejected by Hitler.|$|E

It would only be a move to (rescue) the French”, {{although}} he was probably not aware of Haig’s insistence, overruling Rawlinson’s earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and “fighting the enemy in the open”. Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig “does not mean to knock his head against a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition he means to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else”.|$|E

25|$|Physicist John Taylor, who has {{investigated}} parapsychological claims, {{has written that}} an unknown fifth force causing psychokinesis would have to transmit {{a great deal of}} energy. The energy would have to overcome the electromagnetic forces binding the atoms together, because the atoms would need to respond more strongly to the fifth force than to electric forces. Such an additional force between atoms should therefore exist all the time and not during only alleged paranormal occurrences. Taylor wrote there is no scientific trace of such a force in physics, down to many orders of magnitude; thus, if a scientific viewpoint is to be preserved, the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> fifth force must be discarded. Taylor concluded that there is no possible physical mechanism for psychokinesis, and it is in complete contradiction to established science.|$|E

500|$|As in Islam, a {{fundamental}} tenet of Judaism is that God is {{not bound by}} any limitations of time, matter, or space, and that the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> person being God, a part of God, or a mediator to God, is heresy. The Book of Ezra, which Judaism accepts as a chronicle {{of the life of}} Ezra and which predates Muhammad and the Qur'an by around 1000 years, gives Ezra's human lineage as being the son of Seraiah and a direct descendant of Aaron. Tractate Ta'anit of the Jerusalem Talmud, which predates Muhammad by two to three hundred years, states that “if a man claims to be God, he is a liar.” Exodus Rabba 29 says, [...] "'I am the first and I am the last, and beside Me there is no God' I am the first, I have no father; I am the last, I have no brother. Beside Me there is no God; I have no son." [...] However the term 'sons of gods' occurs in Genesis. The Encyclopedia of Judaism clarifies that the title of 'son of God' is attributed a person whose piety has placed him in a very near relationship to God and [...] "by no means carries the idea of physical descent from, and essential unity with, God".|$|E

Later critics stated that the sentimental-humanitarian Poor Folk contained a great deal of parody and satire of Gogol books; however, there are some dissenters.

[...] Joseph Frank, who suggested that the whole work is a [...] "serious parody", recalled that Poor Folk burlesques the [...] "high-society adventure novel, the Gogolian humorous local color-tale" [...] and [...] "the debunking physiological sketch". Victor Terras dubbed it a [...] "travesty of the sentimental epistolary love story." [...] The Contemporary stated [...] "In this work comedy is somehow explored and includes an appreciable tone, colour and even the language of Gogol and Kvitka".

NBC had initially hired former Monday Night Football play-by-play man Mike Tirico for Thursdays before the league nixed the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> separate broadcast teams for Sunday and Thursday nights.

He realized some songs already re-recorded or scheduled would need to be cut (The special was only an hour long). He quickly arranged for rehearsals to take place to capture the feel of Presley's informal studio jamming, drafting in the surviving members of Presley's original backing band – Scotty Moore and D. J. Fontana (bassist Bill Black had died in 1965). He also brought in Presley's friends Alan Fortas, Lance LeGault and Charlie Hodge to encourage Presley and make him feel at ease. Two sessions took place, each about two hours in length; the first on June 24 and the second on the 25th. Both took place in the informal surroundings of the dressing room at NBC. They were recorded by Presley's friend Joe Esposito using the singer's own tape recorder.
