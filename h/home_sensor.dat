40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} proposes smart home-based intelligent {{techniques that}} perform automated {{assessment of a}} resident's well-being by monitoring their behavior inside the home. We hypothesize that the everyday behavior of smart home residents can be estimated by tracking residents' activities using smart home sensors and that machine learning algorithms can predict their cognitive and physical health utilizing behavioral information. We first describe a cross-sectional study where we compare behavior differences across an entire population sample to assess activity quality and the individual's cognitive health. For this study, we introduce a machine learning-based framework for assessing the quality of eight different activities and one complex activity with interweaved sub-activities, called the Day Out Task. We compare our automated assessment of task quality with direct observation scores and assess the ability of machine learning techniques to classify an individual's cognitive health using the same machine learning-based framework. We then describe a longitudinal study where we use an individual as their own baseline to identify behavioral changes that can predict cognitive health and mobility. We first introduce a Clinical Assessment using Activity Behavior (CAAB) approach to model a smart home resident's daily behavior and predict the corresponding standard clinical assessment scores utilizing longitudinal smart <b>home</b> <b>sensor</b> data. CAAB extracts statistical features that describe characteristics of a resident's daily activity performance and trains the machine learning algorithms to predict the standard clinical assessment scores. We then introduce an activity curve to represent an abstraction of an individual's normal daily routine based on automatically recognized activities. We develop algorithms to detect changes in behavioral routines by comparing activity curves and use these changes to analyze the possibility of changes in cognitive or physical health. We evaluate all of our algorithms using real-world longitudinal smart <b>home</b> <b>sensor</b> data. We conclude {{that it is possible}} to assess the health and well-being of a smart home resident utilizing smart <b>home</b> <b>sensor</b> data and machine learning algorithms.

One state-of-the art approach is to exploit homes enriched with a multitude of sensors, actuators, and multimedia equipment, but the problem of loneliness is not sufficiently tackled. We envision homes enriched with sensors, but also audio-visual components such as cameras, microphones and beamers that allow opening the boundaries of one single home to interact with remote relatives and friends, here of course minding issues such as privacy and non-intrusiveness. To decrease loneliness, our system supports social services like playing cards with one another or having dinner together.

In a smart home scenario, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can potentially provide information about device activities and their status. This information can be useful for variety of purposes like monitoring home security, examining status of nodes, and replacing nodes that are malfunctioning or dead. The sensor network needs to be protected from intrusions and anomalies. Over the years, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are proposed for preventing WSNs from intrusions. Although some mobile agent based IDS are proposed, anomaly detection for wireless smart <b>home</b> <b>sensor</b> network (WSHSN) is not fully exploited. In this article, we have proposed a mobile agent based anomaly detection mechanism for WSHSNs. The proposed scheme takes advantage from heterogeneous nature of devices in smart home for effectively detecting anomalies. The anomaly detection infrastructure is installed at resource rich nodes such as Cluster Heads (CHs). The mobile agent takes only few bytes of data to further assess the anomalous behavior of suspicious node. The analysis and comparative study show several advantages of the proposed scheme, such as efficient utilization of memory, reducing network load, and reduction in overall computational cost of the network. The nature of our proposed solution is generic, so that as it is, or with slight modifications, it can be implemented on other heterogeneous wireless sensor networks.

Demographic and technological changes present a real opportunity for the assisted living technology industry to develop new innovations to connect and enable dispersed families to provide support to their loved ones within a consumer marketplace. OBJECTIVE: Under the dallas i-Focus programme, the Advanced Digital Institute, with partner Coventry University, developed the Warm Neighbourhoods® AroundMe™ service to help people live at home and enable friends and family to support them using existing connected <b>home</b> <b>sensor</b> technologies to detect usual daily routines. METHOD: A new, consumer-focussed assistive technology service was designed through co-creation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{cognitive}} deficiencies (CDs) are {{the spectrum}} of deficiencies related to {{the reduction of the}} brain cognitive capability. They mainly affects reasoning, planning and solving capabilities of daily performed activities with the consequence cognitively impaired people become dependent by family or Health Institutes. Some of them are Alzheimer's disease (AD), traumatic brain injuries (TBI), schizophrenia and autism. For cognitively impaired people, meal preparation is a privileged moment and a good opportunity to enhance autonomy, to combat the deficiency effects and a good mean to promote self-esteem as well as social interactions. These are the goals of the Virtual Community Kitchen (VCK) intended for the people affected by CD. The VCK will be an opportunity for a group of this people to connect and meet, for instance once a week, and to attend at distance to a cooking lesson given by a grand chef. Each person will be in his kitchen and will prepare the meal along with the chef. The chef will be remotely able to supervise and to help people. At the end of the activity everyone will eat the meal in her kitchen linked to each participant. VCK focuses on two aspects: autonomous cognitive assistance for meal preparation in a kitchen and cognitive assistance and social interactions in a networked community for cognitively impaired people. A pervasive cognitive assistant in the kitchen. A dynamic context-aware cognitive Virtual Kitchen Assistant (VKA) for meal preparation will be installed in each kitchen and it will share the control between the assistants and the user. Its user interfaces will be a mix of graphical (GUI) and tangible user interfaces (TUI) designed in way to best support augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) approach. AAC is an area of research, clinical and educational practice with the objective to compensate temporary or permanent impairments and activity limitation of individuals with speech and comprehension disorders thanks to any system or device which let them to represents meaningful messages. The meal preparation and related tasks will be defined according to the task analysis best practice. The step by step assistance will mix images, audio notes and video sequences and it will be initiated either by the VKA when it detects the step is over, either by the user when he evaluates a step completion. When VKA detects some actions have not been done or it detects an activity carried out in an inadequate way, it presents again the step highlighting the missing actions and proposes how addressing. Using the whole kitchen, the objects contained in it and the user actions as one user interface, VKA can also provides cues to help the person to find ingredients or utensils necessary for recipe preparation. Community services and group assistance for meal preparation. VCK includes community services to foster social interactions, self-esteem and breaking isolation. In particular, a grand chef will give periodically cooking lessons and people will have the opportunity for grouping and attending at distance to the remote recipe preparation. Each person will be in her kitchen and will prepare the meal with the chef. The chef will be supported by medical and technical staff and he will be remotely able to supervise and to help, directing acting on the remote kitchen. At the end of the activity everyone will eat the meal in his kitchen linked to other participants of the collaborative recipe by the mean of the VCK. Scenario. A cooking lesson will be done in three main phases. The first phase focuses on the activities related of one's participation to the course: registration to the course, management of agenda, recipe selection, buying ingredients, etc. The second phase targets meal preparation per se: gathering ingredients, preparing, cutting, slicing, baking, sharing comments, providing pieces of advice, synchronizing everyone actions and activities, etc. The last phase corresponds to eating together at distance, sharing impression, ambiance and seeing each other. Such a scenario is fully suitable on the needs of any person, cognitive impaired or not because they are solutions for ADLs in a human society there people has a great number of things to remember and often they forget actions (i. e. buy one ingredient for cooking the dinner, find one utensil in the kitchen) that sometime could be dangerous (i. e. forget the oven on). Conclusions. The features of VCK vision makes it an AAL long-term project involving numerous and heterogeneous research fields ranging from industrial design, ergonomics, psychology, human-computer interaction and sensor networks to AAC, remote monitoring, semantics and task analysis. At the moment, the studies have produced Archipel, a robust pervasive cognitive assistant tested with people affected by mental retardation. It will be the core of the VKA.
