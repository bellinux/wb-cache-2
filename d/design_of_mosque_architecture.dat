This paper seeks to explore the comparative, the concept of homogeneity and hybridity architecture, with a critical theory approach. The results of this search is, the concept of architectural homogeneity establishing assumption that certain architectural forms are supposed to represent "universal identity and modernity" of Muslim architecture. Meanwhile, the concept of architectural hybridity to show enrichment architecture identity because of the attempt to combine aspects of the universality of Islam with locality of Nusantara. Both these aspects can be positioned as the two subjects of mutual dialogue in a parallel position. As architecture strategy, the concept of hybridity reflects the effort or ijtihad in interpreting local and universal contextuality in the contemporary conditions that are constantly evolving and open...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bangladesh {{possesses}} a rich early heritage involving two great religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. These two beliefs, with their political patronization, developed an architectural vocabulary expressing their spiritual desire and aspiration. Later, when Muslims invaded India, they brought a different architectural approach, evident in their {{secular and religious}} structures all over the Indian subcontinent. Muslims built mosques {{with the use of}} imported features modified by local culture, climate, tradition, materials, and technology. From that period through the present, mosques in Bangladesh have developed a unique style in terms of <b>architecture.</b> The notion <b>of</b> <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> has been changing over time, according to the desires of the ruling class and the common people as well. This study presents tangible evidence of the changing morphology <b>of</b> <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture,</b> and identifies the influencing factors that initiated the development over the ages. Architecture is the carrier of the social, political, and cultural history of a nation. Whenever we speak of an architectural style or pattern, we have to look behind to search for the history, culture and, above all, the aspirations of the people of that period.

In this study, six mosques for every decade begin ning from 1960 ‟s are analyzed in terms of their general architectural features, the usage and interpretation of minarets in their designs. Throughout the selected cases, the modification of forms and functions are studied and compared with the pre - modern o nes as well as with each other. The changed forms and functions of minarets and the introduction of new ideas to their design are also discussed. By this way, a general evaluation regarding the developments and progress in contemporary <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> in Turkey is proposed with reference to comparative results. On this basis, this study demonstrates that the main elements, organization schemes and planning setups <b>of</b> Classical Ottoman <b>Mosque</b> are still preserved in the selected mosque examples.

40|$|Mosques {{are among}} the most {{important}} building types for any community, where Muslims gather for their prayers and social activities. <b>Mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> has developed over history and faced several dramatic changes.

The analysis carried out of several contemporary cases revealed that there is a wide margin to revive and reintroduce these elements in the light of the modern architectural trends. In addition to their functional roles, mosque architectural elements could be used as identity elements of the Islamic city, microclimatic modifiers, and linking tools between the past and the present...|$|R

In spite of far-reaching studies conducted on the importance <b>of</b> <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture,</b> historical background and functions, very {{little attention has been}} paid to the utilisation, functions and importance <b>of</b> <b>mosque</b> open spaces to the multicultural community. This study aims to explore the spatial and sociocultural factors <b>of</b> urban <b>mosque</b> open spaces in order to determine the extent to which intercultural space exists within them. The study focuses on three urban mosques at the national, district and sub-district levels in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Guided by theory of place and the concepts of affordance and social affordance, this study employs a mixed method strategy with a cross-sectional design. It comprises both quantitative – systematic observation with behaviour mapping at selected urban mosques – and qualitative – focus group discussions with mosque managers and multicultural users – methods, as well as findings with regard to the use <b>of</b> <b>mosque</b> open spaces that were derived from social media sources such as Facebook and blogs. The findings show that more multicultural users utilise the National Mosque open spaces in comparison to those at district and sub-district mosques. Patterns were identified in the spatial occupancies based on gender, age group, ethnicity and activities at all <b>of</b> the urban <b>mosque</b> open spaces studied. People‟s identification of their favourite open spaces and preference for outdoor activities, as well as the current condition and <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mosque</b> open spaces, influences the utilisation <b>of</b> urban <b>mosque</b> open spaces by multicultural users.
