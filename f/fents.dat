40|$|Background: Spinal {{anaesthesia}} is {{the preferred}} technique to fix fracture of the femur. Extreme pain does not allow ideal positioning for this procedure. Intravenous fentanyl and femoral nerve block are commonly used techniques to reduce the pain during position for spinal anaesthesia however; results are conflicting regarding superiority of femoral nerve block over intravenous fentanyl. Aims: We conducted this study to compare the analgesic effect provided by femoral nerve block (FNB) and intra- venous (IV) fentanyl prior to positioning for central neuraxial block in patients undergoing surgery for femur fracture. Patients and Methods: In this randomized prospective study 60 patients scheduled for fracture femur operation under spinal were included. Patients were distributed in two groups through computer generated random numbers table; Femoral nerve block group (FNB) and Intravenous fentanyl group (<b>FENT).</b> In FNB group patients received FNB guided by a peripheral nerve stimulator (Stimuplex; B Braun, Melsungen, AG) 5 minutes prior to positioning. 20 mL, 1. 5 % lidocaine with adrenaline (1 : 200, 000) was injected incrementally after a negative aspiration test. Patients in the fentanyl group received injection fentanyl 1 μg/kg IV 5 mins prior to positioning. Spinal block was performed and pain scores before and during positioning were recorded. Statistical analysis was done with Sigmaplot version- 10 computer software. Student t-test was applied to compare the means and P < 0. 05 was taken as significant. Results: VAS during positioning in group FNB: 0. 57 ± 0. 31 versus <b>FENT</b> 2. 53 ± 1. 61 (P = 0. 0020). Time to perform spinal anesthesia in group FNB: 15. 33 ± 1. 64 min versus <b>FENT</b> 19. 56 ± 3. 09 min (P = 0. 000049). Quality of patient positioning for spinal anesthesia in group FNB 2. 67 ± 0. 606 versus <b>FENT</b> 1. 967 ± 0. 85 (P = 0. 000027). Patient acceptance was less in group <b>FENT</b> (P = 0. 000031).

40|$|Abstract This paper first {{reports the}} {{occurrence}} and fate of monobutyltin, dibutyltin, tributyltin, monophenyltin, diphenyltin and triphenyltin {{in drinking water}} from north China. The sum of the six organotins in raw water and drinking water ranged from 33. 3 to 476. 9 ng Sn L- 1 and from no detection to 142. 4 ng Sn L- 1, respectively. The highest concentration of triphenyltin in drinking water and raw water were 41. 3, 44. 6 ng Sn L- 1, and those for tri-butyltin were 32. 1, 37. 6 ng Sn L- 1, respectively, which were observed from April to July. Conventional treatment processes and advanced treatment processes could not remove organotins completely. Keywords Drinking water Tributyltin Triphenyltin Advanced treatment Organotin compounds, especially tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) have been proven to be highly toxic to aqueous life and disturb the cell energy metabolism (<b>Fent</b> 1996) and the endocrine especially for dogwhelk (Nucella lapillus; Gibbs et al. 1991 a). TBT and TPT pollution are known to induce various symptoms on the affected organisms, like failure of spat in oysters (Alzieu et al. 1986), impotence in neogastropods and gastropods (Bryan et al. 1988; Gibbs et al. 1991 b) and reduction of the dog-whelk population (Gibbs et al. 1991 a). Organotins are also hazardous to humans, and butyltin and phenyltin com-pounds are both immunotoxic to human NK (natural killer) cells under in vitro experiments (Whalen et al. 2000). The estimated tolerable daily intake (TDI) value for TBTO and TPT acetate is 0. 25 lg kg- 1 body weight as prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO 1999) and 0. 4 lg per kg body weight as prescribed by the German Federal Institute for Health Protection of Consumers and Veteri-nary Medicine (BGVV 2000), respectively. Organotins {{are some of the}} most widely used organo-metallic compounds, and their world output has multiplied almost tenfold in the past 40 years, increasing from 5, 000 tons in 1955 to approximately 50, 000 tons in 1994 (<b>Fent</b> 1996).

This {{study examined}} the therapeutic effect and outcome of adding low dose ketorolac tromethamine infusion to PO intravenous patient controlled fentanyl analgesia IV-PCA. Patients and methodsSixty right lobe donors were randomized into either fentanyl or ketorolac groups (30 patients each). Patients in both groups received fentanyl (2 μg/ml) solution in normal saline as IV-PCA with background infusion in a rate adjusted to deliver 0. 25 μgkgh− 1 and boluses of 10 ml with a lock-out time of 20 min. They received 15 mg ketorolac IV bolus in ketorolac group and similar placebo injection in the control. Patients in both groups received a continuous intravenous infusion of 240 ml normal saline solution that is either free in the <b>FENT</b> group or containing 60 mg ketorolac in ketorolac group, adjusted to a rate of 0. 2 mlkgh− 1. Visual analogue score (VAS) and hemodynamic profile were recorded at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h while laboratory results were recorded after 48 h and 7 days post-operatively. ResultsVAS was significantly lower in ketorolac group compared to fentanyl group from 6 to 36 h post-operatively while sedation score was significantly higher in fentanyl group compared to fentanyl–ketorolac group between 12 and 36 h post-operatively. Fentanyl consumption was significantly lower in ketorolac group at 24 (318. 7 ± 66 vs 468. 3 ± 79) and 48 (211. 5 ± 59 vs 369. 1 ± 68) h. Hemodynamic data and laboratory parameters were comparable in both groups. Nausea had a significantly higher incidence in <b>FENT</b> compared to KETR groups while other complications (vomiting and blood loss) were homogenous in both groups.

40|$|Background and Objectives: - The {{effects of}} associating {{lipophilic}} opioids to local anesthetics in epidural anesthesia {{are not well}} defined. There are still questions and controversies about opioid doses to be used and their major effects in the epidural block. This study aimed at evaluating the epidural block effects in humans {{of the association of}} different fentanyl and sufentanil doses to bupivacaine with 1 : 200. 000 epinephrine. Methods: - A double-blind randomized study was performed in 94 patients of both genders, physical status ASA I, aged between 18 and 60 years, submitted to lower abdomen, perineal or lower limb surgery. Patients without preanesthetic medication were epidurally injected with 100 mg (20 ml) 0. 5 % bupivacaine, 0. 1 mg (0. 1 ml) 1 %o epinephrine plus a combination of the following drugs: BUPI Group (15 patients) : 2 ml of 0. 9 % saline solution (SS); <b>FENT</b> 50 Group (19 patients) : 50 μg (1 ml) fentanyl + 1 ml SS; <b>FENT</b> 100 Group (20 patients) : 100 μg (2 ml) fentanyl; SUF 30 Group (20 patients) : 30 μg (0. 6 ml) sufentanil + SS (1. 4 ml); SUF 100 Group (20 patients) : 50 μg (1 ml) sufentanil + SS (1 ml). The following parameters were studied: onset of sensory block, analgesic block (onset time) in T 12, T 10 and T 8, analgesic block duration in T 10 and T 12, motor block degree, consciousness degree, need for supplemental perioperative sedation and analgesia, hypotension, bradycardia and peri and post operative side-effects, analgesia duration, proportion of patients needing supplemental analgesia and evaluation of postoperative pain (pain analog visual scale). Results: Groups were demographically uniform. The addition of fentanyl or sufentanil did not alter major characteristics of perioperative epidural block and has not significantly increased postoperative analgesia duration as compared to the use of bupivacaine only. However, the addition of lipophilic opioids has increased the quality of perioperative anesthetic block, translated into a lesser need for supplemental analgesia (p < 0. 02). The increased dose of fentanyl and especially of sufentanil has increased the incidence of perioperative drowsiness (p < 0. 001) without significant increase in other side effects. Conclusions: In the conditions and doses used, the addition of lipophilic opioids to bupivacaine and the increased dose of lipophilic opioids have improved anesthetic block quality without changes in the epidural block characteristics or a significant increase in side effects, with the exception of drowsiness mainly caused by sufentanil. However, they were not able to provide a significant increase in postoperative analgesia duration...|$|R
