40|$|Large {{amplitude}} oscillations {{of solar}} filaments {{is a phenomenon}} known {{for more than half}} a century. Recently, a new mode of oscillations, characterized by periodical plasma motions along the <b>filament</b> <b>axis,</b> was discovered. We analyze such an event, recorded on 23 January 2002 in Big Bear Solar Observatory Hα filtergrams, in order to infer the triggering mechanism and the nature of the restoring force. Motion along the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> of a distinct buldge-like feature was traced, to quantify the kinematics of the oscillatory motion. The data were fitted by a damped sine function, to estimate the basic parameters of the oscillations. In order to identify the triggering mechanism, morphological changes in the vicinity of the filament were analyzed. The observed oscillations of the plasma along the filament was characterized by an initial displacement of 24 Mm, initial velocity amplitude of 51 km/s, period of 50 min, and damping time of 115 min. We interpret the trigger in terms of poloidal magnetic flux injection by magnetic reconnection at one of the filament legs. The restoring force is caused by the magnetic pressure gradient along the <b>filament</b> <b>axis.</b> The period of oscillations, derived from the linearized equation of motion (harmonic oscillator) can be expressed as P=π√(2) L/v_Aϕ≈ 4. 4 L/v_Aϕ, where v_Aϕ =B_ϕ 0 /√(μ_ 0 ρ) represents the Alfvén speed based on the equilibrium poloidal field B_ϕ 0.

40|$|The strongest myosin-related {{features}} in the low-angle axial x-ray diffraction pattern of resting frog sartorius muscle are the meridional reflections corresponding to axial spacings of 21. 4 and 14. 3 nm, and the first layer line, at a spacing 42. 9 nm. During tetanus the intensities of the first layer line and the 21. 4 -nm meridional decrease by 62 and 80 % respectively, but, when the muscle is fresh, the 14. 3 -nm meridional intensity rises by 13 %, although it shows a decrease when the muscle is fatigued. The large change in {{the intensity of the}} 21. 4 -nm meridional reflection suggests that the projected myosin cross-bridge density onto the thick <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> changes during contraction. The model proposed by Bennett (Ph. D. Thesis, University of London, 1977) in which successive cross-bridge levels are at 0, 3 / 8, and 5 / 8 of the 42. 9 -nm axial repeat in the resting muscle, passing to 0, 1 / 3, and 2 / 3 in the contracting state, can explain why the 21. 4 -nm reflection decreases in intensity while the 14. 3 -nm increases when the muscle is activated. The model predicts a rather larger increase of the 14. 3 -nm reflection intensity during contraction than that observed, but the discrepancy may be removed if a small change of shape or tilt of the cross-bridges relative to the thick <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> is introduced. The decrease of the intensity of the first layer line indicates that the cross-bridges become disordered in the plane perpendicular to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{diameter}} of the actin filament decreases with an increase of the protein osmotic pressure. This phenomenon {{is accompanied by a}} decrease of the angle (alpha) formed between the long axis of the actin monomer and the pointed end of the <b>filament</b> <b>axis.</b> At 1. 8 x 10 (5) dyn/cm 2 (the protein osmotic pressure in frog muscle) the diameter is 8. 34 nm and the angle (alpha) is 61. 5 degrees. The interfilament distance of tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments, at a set of different osmotic pressures, is larger than that of F-actin filaments. This suggests that the two tropomyosin helices project out of the contour of the actin filament. The tropomyosin-decorated actin filament is more rigid than F-actin. At 1. 8 x 10 (5) dyn/cm 2, the angle (alpha) is 76. 4 degrees, as compared to the value of 61. 5 degrees for F-actin. The interfilament distance of troponin-tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments is sensitive to Ca 2 +: in the physiological range of protein osmotic pressure it decreases from 13. 3 nm, in the presence of 2 mM EGTA, to 12. 2 nm in the presence of 0. 2 mM CaCl 2. Two alternative models are proposed to explain the decrease in interfilament distance. (a) Calcium shifts tropomyosin along the actin monomer, toward the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> (the classical model). (b) Calcium releases the rigidity of the tropomyosin-decorated filament and restores the original plasticity of F-actin. The consequent decrease of the angle (alpha) brings the tropomyosin helices nearer to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis,</b> without any real movement of tropomyosin along the actin monomer...|$|R

These structure are easily recognized in the distribution of galaxies, but have not been directly observed in the distribution of the gas. We use Ly-alpha absorption lines in the spectra of 24 AGN to present a new way to probe these filaments. We use a new catalogue of nearby (cz< 10, 000 km/s) galaxies, complete down to a luminosity of about 0. 05 L* for the region of space analyzed here. Using HST spectra of 24 AGN we sample the gas associated with a 30 x 5 Mpc galaxy filament at cz~ 3500 km/s. All of our sightlines pass outside the virial radius of any known filament galaxy. Within 500 kpc of the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> the detection rate is ~ 80 %, while no detections are seen more than 2. 1 Mpc from the filament. The width of the Lya lines correlates with filament impact parameter and the four BLAs in our sample all occur within 400 kpc of the <b>filament</b> <b>axis,</b> indicating increased temperature and/or turbulence.

We also used fluorescent phalloidin as a probe near the <b>filament</b> <b>axis.</b> Changes in {{the orientation of the}} fluorophores depend not only on the state of acto-myosin binding but also on the location of the fluorescent probes. We observed changes in polarization (i. e., orientation) for those fluorophores attached at the sites directly involved in myosin binding (and located at high radii from the <b>filament</b> <b>axis)</b> that were contrary to the fluorophores located at the sites close to the <b>axis</b> of thin <b>filament.</b> These altered probe orientations suggest that myosin binding alters the conformation of F-actin.

40|$|AbstractIn {{isolated}} thick filaments {{from many}} types of muscle, the two head domains of each myosin molecule are folded back against the filament backbone in a conformation called the interacting heads motif (IHM) in which actin interaction is inhibited. This conformation is present in resting skeletal muscle, {{but it is not}} known how exit from the IHM state is achieved during muscle activation. Here, we investigated this by measuring the in situ conformation of the light chain domain of the myosin heads in relaxed demembranated fibers from rabbit psoas muscle using fluorescence polarization from bifunctional rhodamine probes at four sites on the C-terminal lobe of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC). The order parameter 〈P 2 〉 describing probe orientation with respect to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> had a roughly sigmoidal dependence on temperature in relaxing conditions, with a half-maximal change at ∼ 19 °C. Either lattice compression by 5 % dextran T 500 or addition of 25 μM blebbistatin decreased the transition temperature to ∼ 14 °C. Maximum entropy analysis revealed three preferred orientations of the myosin RLC region at 25 °C and above, two with its long axis roughly parallel to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> and one roughly perpendicular. The parallel orientations {{are similar to those of}} the so-called blocked and free heads in the IHM and are stabilized by either lattice compression or blebbistatin. In relaxed skeletal muscle at near-physiological temperature and myofilament lattice spacing, the majority of the myosin heads have their light chain domains in IHM-like conformations, with a minority in a distinct conformation with their RLC regions roughly perpendicular to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis.</b> None of these three orientation populations were present during active contraction. These results are consistent with a regulatory transition of the thick filament in skeletal muscle associated with a conformational equilibrium of the myosin heads...|$|R

40|$|Erupting {{filaments}} {{are sometimes}} observed {{to undergo a}} rotation about the vertical direction as they rise. This rotation of the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> is generally interpreted as a conversion of twist into writhe in a kink-unstable magnetic flux rope. Consistent with this interpretation, the rotation is usually found to be clockwise (as viewed from above) if the post-eruption arcade has right-handed helicity, but counterclockwise if it has left-handed helicity. Here, we describe two non [...] active-region filament events recorded with the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), in which the sense of rotation appears to be opposite to that expected from the helicity of the post-event arcade. Based on these observations, we suggest that {{the rotation of the}} <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> is in general determined by the net helicity of the erupting system, and that the axially aligned core of the filament can have the opposite helicity sign to the surrounding field. In most cases, the surrounding field provides the main contribution to the net helicity.

40|$|AbstractThis review {{deals with}} the {{structure}} of the actin monomer, its assembly into filaments and the loci on F-actin involved in binding myosin. Two distinctly different arrangements of monomers have been suggested for actin filaments. One model proposed by Holmes et al. is well developed. It places the so-called ‘large’ domain close to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> and the so-called ‘small’ domain out near the surface of the filament. A second, less-well developed, model proposed by Schutt et al. locates the ‘small’ domain close to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> and they rotate the monomer so that ‘bottom’ of the ‘large’ domain is at the highest radius. We analyze the available evidence for the models of F-actin derived from X-ray diffraction, reconstructions from electron micrographs, fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy, chemical cross-linking, antibody probes, limited proteolysis, site-directed and natural mutations, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and other techniques. The result is an actin-centered view of the loci on actin which are probably involved in its interaction with the myosin ‘head’. From these multiple contacts we speculate on the sequence of steps between the initial weak-binding state of S- 1 to the actin filament through to the stable strong-binding state seen in the absence of free Mg-ATP, i. e., the rigor state...|$|R

The repeat of myosin binding protein C (C-protein) molecules on the thick filaments {{was determined to be}} 45. 33 nm, slightly longer than that of myosin crossbridges. With the inclusion of structural information for C-proteins and a pre-powerstroke head shape, modeling in terms of a mixed population of regular and perturbed regions of myosin crown repeats along the filament revealed that the myosin filament had azimuthal perturbations of crossbridges in addition to axial perturbations in the perturbed region, producing pseudo-six-fold rotational symmetry in the structure projected down the <b>filament</b> <b>axis.</b> Myosin crossbridges had a different organization about the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> in each of the regular and perturbed regions. In the regular region that lacks C-proteins, there were inter-molecular interactions between the myosin heads in axially adjacent crown levels.

40|$|Force {{generation}} in myosin-based motile systems {{is thought to}} result from an angular displacement of the myosin subfragment 1 (S 1) tail domain {{with respect to the}} actin <b>filament</b> <b>axis.</b> In muscle, raised temperature increases the force generated by S 1, implying a greater change in tail domain angular displacement. We used time-resolved x-ray diffraction to investigate the structural corollary of this force increase by measuring M 3 meridional reflection intensity during sinusoidal length oscillations. This technique allows definition of S 1 orientation with respect to the myofilament axis. M 3 intensity changes were approximately sinusoid at low temperatures but became increasingly distorted as temperature was elevated, with the formation of a double intensity peak at maximum shortening. This increased distortion could be accounted for by assuming a shift in orientation of the tail domain of actin-bound S 1 toward the orientation at which M 3 intensity is maximal, which is consistent with a tail domain rotation model of force {{generation in}} which the tail approaches a more perpendicular projection from the thin <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> at higher temperatures. In power stroke simulations, the angle between S 1 tail mean position during oscillations and the position at maximum intensity decreased by 4. 7 °, corresponding to a mean tail displacement toward the perpendicular of 0. 73 nm for a temperature-induced force increase of 0. 28 P 0 from 4 to 22 °C.

40|$|From {{analysis}} of moderate- to small-angle x-ray diffraction patterns, {{in the light}} of similar experience with paramyosin, has been derived the following description for the structure of actin-rich filaments in "tinted" portions of the adductor muscle of the clam, Venus mercenaria: 1. Some 11 diffraction maxima, widely streaked along layer lines and occurring at moderate diffraction angles (spacings 7 to 60 A) appear to be accounted for as (hk) reflections of a net whose cell elements are, for dry material: a ≑ 82 A, b = 406 A (<b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> identity period), and γ ≑ 82 ° (angle between a and b axes). These reflections follow a selection rule which indicates that the net cell is non-primitive and contains 15 equivalent locations (nodes) arranged as shown in Fig. 5. An alternative net has b' = 351 A and 13 nodes per cell. 2. Another interpretation rolls the net into a large-scale helix and places the 15 (or 13) nodes along 7 (or 6) turns of a helical locus projecting 406 (or 351) A along the <b>filament</b> <b>axis.</b> Whether considered to be built of planar-net or helix-net cells, the individual filament contains a single cell width transverse to its <b>axis.</b> Transverse <b>filament</b> dimensions are, therefore, in either case similar (50 to 100 A). 3. Consideration of existing electron-optical, physicochemical, and x-ray diffraction data regarding isolated actin suggests that the net cell is built of rods, each containing in cross-section from one to four actin molecules which run parallel to or twisted about rod axes that extend at 12 ° to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> along the (21) diagonals of the cell. Depending on monomer shape, 2 to 15 monomers furnish length to reach across two cells, and the actin molecules are built into each rod {{in such a way as}} to repeat (or nearly repeat) structure 15 (or 13) times along the double cell length. Further details of intra-rod structure cannot be suggested because of lack of wide-angle diffraction information. 4. The actin system is sensitive to treatment of the muscle with ethanol. Concentrations of 5 per cent or greater abolish the net reflections. Other solvents—water, benzene, ether, pyridine, acetone—do not alter the pattern materially. 5. Two other reflections, occurring at the first and second layer lines of an axial periodicity of about 400 A, do not clearly belong to the actin-net system. They represent either a superstructure built upon the filaments by parts of the actin molecules themselves or by incorporated other molecular species, or they arise from an additional macromolecular component (possibly myosin, or its homologues or fractions) of similar axial periodicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{averaged}} {{structure of}} rigor cross-bridges in insect flight muscle is further revealed by three-dimensional reconstruction from 25 -nm sections containing {{a single layer}} of thin filaments. These exhibit two thin filament orientations that differ by 60 degrees {{from each other and}} from myac layer filaments. Data from multiple tilt views (to +/- 60 degrees) was supplemented by data from thick sections (equivalent to 90 degrees tilts). In combination with the reconstruction from the myac layer (Taylor et al., 1989), the entire unit cell is reconstructed, giving the most complete view of in situ cross-bridges yet obtained. All our reconstructions show two classes of averaged rigor cross- bridges. Lead bridges have a triangular shape with leading edge angled at approximately 45 degrees and trailing edge angled at approximately 90 degrees to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis.</b> We propose that the lead bridge contains two myosin heads of differing conformation bound along one strand of F-actin. The lead bridge is associated with a region of the thin filament that is apparently untwisted. We suggest that the untwisting may reflect the distribution of strain between myosin and actin resulting from two-headed, single filament binding in the lead bridge. Rear bridges are oriented at approximately 90 degrees to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis,</b> and are smaller and more cylindrical, suggesting that they consist of single myosin heads. The rear bridge is associated with a region of apparently normal thin filament twist.

40|$|International audiencePreliminary {{assumption}} {{of this model}} is that interactions between actin and myosin presupposes an exact three-dimensional geometrical correspondence between sites, due to the very short time constants present under physiological conditions. Only small and controlled torsions of the actin filaments are accepted. The model uses geometrical information concerning orientations and dimensions of myosin crossbridges and actin monomeres to modelize the distribution of their inter-actions. An orientation map of actin sites in the cross-section perpendicular to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> is proposed, adapted to the specific filament array of vertebrate muscle. Orientation of myosin crossbridges follows Luther's rules. According to the model, any interaction between actin and myosin implies the superimposition of their respective cross-sectional planes. The axial length of actin monomere is 55 A; the distance between two crossbridges along the myosin <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> is 143 A. The following properties are derived: 1) The shortening step of the sliding actin filament must be a multiple of 11 A (highest common factor). Taking into account the staggered disposition of the two actin strands {{and the presence of}} two heads for each cross-bridge, the most probable value for this shortening step is equal to 99 A. A specific scheme is proposed to describe the shortening process. The behavior of the modelized crossbridge does not need any elastic structure [...] 2) Planes situated at 715 A (lowest common multiple) of actin and myosin coinciding planes are also in coincidence. In a hemi-sarcomere the maximal number of these planes, referred to as simultaneously activable planes, is 10 (20 if both myosin heads are considered). The proportion of interactions authorized by the site orientations is 1 / 12. In the model, the concept of randomly recruited crossbridges is replaced by a discretized recruitment, based on geometrical properties at an ultrastructural level. The proposed distribution is homogeneous: it can be extended radially in the sarcomere and authorizes the actin filament sliding in the whole physiological range under the control of a dual activation function, reproducing Ca++ temporal and spatial distribution...|$|R

Additionally, the dominant equatorial and row line reflections were modelled to fully define the disposition of the heads in space for every pair.;At rest, {{the results of this}} study indicate the myosin heads prefer a flexed configuration about a point defined by the S 1 -S 2 junction. Both myosin heads within a pair adopted similar axial orientations, and one head in each pair favoured a small rotation about the normal to thick <b>filament</b> <b>axis.</b> Azimuthally all myosin heads preferred to project perpendicular from the backbone.;At plateau, the results suggest that a configuration closely mirroring the crystalline myosin head structure at rigor was favoured. Each myosin head within a pair preferred to adopt distinctly different axis orientations with one head perpendicular to the thick <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> and the other head more inclined to the backbone. The implication that there are two distinct populations of myosin heads suggests that approximately 50 % of myosin heads form a stereospecific actomyosin complex at plateau. The axis distribution of the myosin heads at plateau was also investigated. A less compressed regular axial distortion was required in comparison to modelling at rest. Furthermore, two myosin heads periodicities were studied in conjunction with an extension to the thin filament...|$|R
40|$|Galaxies {{properties}} {{are known to}} be affected by their environment. One important question is how their angular momentum reflects the surrounding cosmic web. We use the SDSS to investigate the spin axes of spiral and elliptical galaxies relative to their surrounding filament/sheet orientations. To detect filaments a marked point process with interactions (the "Bisous model") is used. Sheets are found by detecting "flattened" filaments. The minor axes of ellipticals are found to be preferentially perpendicular to hosting filaments. A weak correlation is found with sheets. These findings are consistent with the notion that elliptical galaxies formed via mergers which predominantly occurred along the <b>filaments.</b> The spin <b>axis</b> of spiral galaxies is found to align with the host filament, with no correlation between spiral spin and sheet normal. When examined as a function of distance from the <b>filament</b> <b>axis,</b> a much stronger correlation is found in outer parts, suggesting that the alignment is driven by the laminar infall of gas from sheets to filaments. When compared with numerical simulations our results suggest that the connection between DM halo and galaxy spin is not straightforward. Our results provide an important input to the understanding of how galaxies acquire their angular momentum. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|R
40|$|A {{major goal}} for X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) based science is to {{elucidate}} structures of biological molecules {{without the need}} for crystals. Filament systems may provide some of the first single macromolecular structures elucidated by XFEL radiation, since they contain one-dimensional translational symmetry and thereby occupy the diffraction intensity region between the extremes of crystals and single molecules. Here, we demonstrate flow alignment of as few as 100 filaments (Escherichia coli pili, F-actin, and amyloid fibrils), which when intersected by femtosecond X-ray pulses result in diffraction patterns similar to those obtained from classical fiber diffraction studies. We also determine that F-actin can be flow-aligned to a disorientation of approximately 5 degrees. Using this XFEL-based technique, we determine that gelsolin amyloids are comprised of stacked β-strands running perpendicular to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis,</b> and that a range of order from fibrillar to crystalline is discernable for individual α-synuclein amyloids...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} {{filaments}} of the TGBA phase {{arising from the}} homeotropic smectic A phase and nucleating on the sample surface is proposed. The model {{is based on the}} concept of finite blocks of parallel smectic layers forming a helical structure. The blocks are surrounded by dislocation loops. The model describes the filament structure near the sample surface and explains the observed inclination of the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> with respect to the easy direction of the molecular anchoring on the surface. The model is based on the observations of filament textures of the TGBA phase in a new chiral liquid crystalline compound, but can be applied for forming of TGBA filaments in any compound. The compression modulus of the compound has been estimated using such parameters as anchoring energy, estimated from the field necessary to transform the structure into the homeotropic smectic A, and the observed filament width.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of myosin filament suspensions shows that these solutions {{are characterized by}} highly nonideal behavior. From these data a model is constructed {{that allows us to}} predict that 1) when subjected to an increasing protein osmotic pressure, myosin filaments experience an elastic deformation, which is not linearly related to the acting force; and 2) at constant protein osmotic pressure, when the cross-bridges of the myosin filaments are subjected to an external, nonosmotic force parallel to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis,</b> they are deformed and the water activity coefficient is altered. As a consequence, in muscle, passive and active shortening of the sarcomere is expected to promote the change of the water-water and of the water-protein interactions. We thus propose to depict muscle contraction as a chemo-osmoelastic transduction, where the {{analysis of}} the energy partition during the power stroke requires consideration of the osmotic factor in addition to the chemoelastic ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} resting tension and {{external}} {{force on the}} rigor crossbridge angle was investigated in insect flight muscle (Honeybee, Apis mellifera). In the presence of resting tension, bridges were either perpendicular to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> or tilted towards the M-line. In shortened, slack muscle, bridges remained perpendicular or were tilted towards the Z-line. Thus, the rigor bridge angle appears {{to depend on the}} state of the thick filament. With the thick filament under stress, the angle may be quite different than when it is slack. On the other hand, external force applied directly to the rigor bridges did not change their configuration. Bridge angle remained unchanged, irrespective of the amount of tension applied to the bridge. This implies that a very tight bond exists between the rigor bridge and thin filament, allowing essentially no rotation even with a large applied force. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A new method, {{in which}} a genetic {{algorithm}} was combined with Brownian dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, was developed to analyze fluorescence depolarization data collected by the time-correlated single photon-counting technique. It was applied to studies of BODIPY-labeled filamentous actin (F-actin). The technique registered the local order and reorienting motions of the fluorophores, which were covalently coupled to cysteine 374 (C 374) in actin and interacted by electronic energy migration within the actin polymers. Analyses of F-actin samples composed of different fractions of labeled actin molecules revealed the known helical organization of F-actin, demonstrating the usefulness of this technique for structure determination of complex protein polymers. The distance from the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> to the fluorophore {{was found to be}} considerably less than expected from the proposed position of C 374 at a high filament radius. In addition, polymerization experiments with BODIPY-actin suggest a 25 -fold more efficient signal for filament formation than pyrene-actin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractContractile {{function}} of cardiac cells {{is driven by}} the sliding displacement of myofilaments powered by the cycling myosin crossbridges. Critical to this process is the availability of ATP, which myosin hydrolyzes during the cross-bridge cycle. The diffusion of adenine nucleotides through the myofilament lattice {{has been shown to be}} anisotropic, with slower radial diffusion perpendicular to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> relative to parallel, and is attributed to the periodic hexagonal arrangement of the thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments. We investigated whether atomistic-resolution details of myofilament proteins can refine coarse-grain estimates of diffusional anisotropy for adenine nucleotides in the cardiac myofibril, using homogenization theory and atomistic thin filament models from the Protein Data Bank. Our results demonstrate considerable anisotropy in ATP and ADP diffusion constants that is consistent with experimental measurements and dependent on lattice spacing and myofilament overlap. A reaction-diffusion model of the half-sarcomere further suggests that diffusional anisotropy may lead to modest adenine nucleotide gradients in the myoplasm under physiological conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{simulations of}} a microscopic elastic filament {{immersed in a}} fluid and subject to a uniform external force. Our method accounts for the hydrodynamic coupling between the flow generated by the filament and the friction force it experiences. While models that neglect this coupling predict a drift in a straight configuration, our findings are very different. Notably, a force with a component perpendicular to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> induces bending and perpendicular alignment. Moreover, with increasing force we observe four shape regimes, ranging from slight distortion {{to a state of}} tumbling motion that lacks a steady state. We also identify the appearance of marginally stable structures. Both the instability of these shapes and the observed alignment {{can be explained by the}} combined action of induced bending and non-local hydrodynamic interactions. Most of these effects should be experimentally relevant for stiff micro-filaments, such as microtubules. Comment: three figures. To appear in Phys Rev Let...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{quantitative}} detection of large-scale filamentary structure at z ≃ 0. 7 {{in the large}} cosmological volume probed by the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS). We use simulations to show the capability of VIPERS to recover robust topological features in the galaxy distribution, in particular the filamentary network. We then investigate how galaxies with different stellar masses and stellar activities are distributed around the filaments and find a significant segregation, with the most massive or quiescent galaxies being closer to the <b>filament</b> <b>axis</b> than less massive or active galaxies. The signal persists even after down-weighting the contribution of peak regions. Our results suggest that massive and quiescent galaxies assemble their stellar mass through successive mergers during their migration along filaments towards the nodes of the cosmic web. On the other hand, low-mass star-forming galaxies prefer {{the outer edge of}} filaments, a vorticity rich region dominated by smooth accretion, as predicted by the recent spin alignment theory. This emphasizes the role of large scale cosmic flows in shaping galaxy properties. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
