5|$|Marge and Lisa {{discover}} Bart's {{deception and}} inform the passengers {{that the virus}} is a hoax. As punishment, the furious passengers maroon the Simpsons in Antarctica and head home. While hiking toward a research station for help, they notice a group of penguins; Lisa is fascinated by {{the chance to see}} them up close, but Bart thinks that their lives are boring and says that the ice slide they are riding down is just one isolated moment of fun. Lisa tells him that capturing and enjoying the best moments in life can make <b>it</b> <b>fun,</b> and Bart realizes she is right after Homer pushes him down the ice slide, with the whole family joining in.

5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make <b>it</b> <b>fun</b> so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{were mixed}} in their {{opinions}} on the gameplay, some considering it too complex and some too simple. Carden criticized the difficulty in reaching the different endings without following a guide, and how it sometimes is unclear what the effects of some player choices will be; Fenner did however find <b>it</b> <b>fun</b> and compelling to use knowledge from one playthrough {{to go back and}} make different choices while aiming for another ending. Rogan disliked how the player choice system was simpler than the one in Steins;Gate, calling it a step back for the series, and Helm thought that the player choices lacked the tension and regret of the original game's. Fenner appreciated how the RINE system improved upon the text messages from the previous game, allowing the player to see what exact message they would send prior to sending it while simultaneously automatically saving the game. Carden, Rogan and Helm appreciated the Tips system, considering it a helpful way to make sure that players understand concepts and terms discussed in the game.|$|E

500|$|Hoshino feels {{grateful}} to the editors assisting her, owing her D.Gray-mans success to them. She has also thanked her mother in some volumes of the series. The story arc involving Alma Karma proved Hoshino to difficult {{due to the fact}} it featured several characters. As a result, this arc set up Allen's departure from the Black Order to feature less characters per chapter. She has also commented the series' main theme was [...] "tragedy" [...] but still aims to make <b>it</b> <b>fun.</b> Additionally, once she has finished D.Gray-man, Hoshino wishes to make a more lighthearted series.|$|E

Also, Half-Blood Prince {{remains one of the}} most positively reviewed entries within the series among film critics, who praised the film's [...] "emotionally satisfying" [...] story, direction, cinematography, visuals and music. Grint observed a change in Ron in this entry, pointing out that his once insecure, often overshadowed character started to become more secure and even began to show a dark side of himself.

500|$|According to Hoshino, the series' main theme {{focuses on}} tragedy. Many {{characters}} such as Allen across the series suffer poor fates such as losing {{a loved one}} and being tempted to revive them by the Earl. Although this works, the people are revived as Akumas who consume the skin of their loved ones. This has led to state that an initial theme is that people should not be brought back to life. Although some characters like Kanda express unconditional love to Alma, their happiness is short-lived due to Alma dying shortly after this with another writer finding fitting for the series' dark narrative. Additionally, Allen's life becomes sadder across the series as he is forced to abandon the Black Order due to the Pope removing his rights as an exorcist and he is treated as Noah due to his connections with these characters. Nevertheless, Hoshino still tried to make <b>it</b> <b>fun</b> for the readers, stating that Allen will always have allies.|$|E

More {{positive}} reaction came from Scott Bowles of USA Today called Azaria the [...] "human standout"; Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt he suffered the [...] "greatest disservice" [...] of the film's cast due to a poor script. Azaria noted in an interview with The A.V. Club that The Smurfs and Night at the Museum were films he agreed to do primarily for the money, but that [...] "I won't even do that unless I think it will at least be fun to do...I really try to throw myself into it, figure out the funniest, cleverest way to get the material over, and make <b>it</b> <b>fun</b> to do and fun to watch."

500|$|Variety {{magazine}} called the film [...] "well-executed and original", praising the performances, and the editing by Gerry Hambling.

[...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote that the film was [...] "a deadly funny movie; nearly every scene is broken off with a punch line. But Parker's sense of comedy is organic; he never lets the jokes elbow the characters, or the music, out of the spotlight." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "... Parker has loosened up quite a bit here, not forcing the action {{as much as he}} did in the similar Fame and bringing a surprisingly loony touch to characters like Jimmy's Elvis-obsessed father." [...] Time magazine reviewer Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "The film offers no message, no solutions, only a great time at the movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Game {{director}} and composer Junichi Masuda stated that {{to keep the}} games fresh, he looks at every previous element {{to decide what to}} adapt to the new game, stating [...] "people may not like what they like in the past, trend wise". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make <b>it</b> <b>fun</b> for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players {{would not be able to}} know what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.|$|E
