Methods: This retrospective study included data from 15 eyes with previous radial keratotomy and subsequent cataract surgery. The average central power and Humphrey <b>Atlas</b> <b>methods</b> from the ASCRS IOL calculator, along with an average IOL power produced from an average of these two methods (ASCRS average), were compared. Primary outcome measures for each method were mean arithmetic and absolute IOL prediction error, variance in mean arithmetic IOL prediction error, and the percentage of refractive outcomes within &plusmn; 0. 50, &plusmn; 1. 00, &plusmn; 1. 50, and &plusmn; 2. 00 diopters (D). Results: The average central power method and the ASCRS average were significantly more accurate than the Humphrey <b>Atlas</b> <b>method</b> in terms of mean absolute IOL prediction error (1. 03 D and 1. 02 D versus 1. 53; P = 0. 04 and P = 0. 01, respectively). In addition, the average central power method and ASCRS average produced a higher percentage of refractive outcomes within &plusmn; 0. 50 D when compared with the Humphrey <b>Atlas</b> <b>method</b> (60 % and 46. 67 % versus 0 %, respectively). A comparison of the average central power method and the ASCRS average demonstrated a smaller variance and higher percentage of patients within &plusmn; 1. 00 D when using the ASCRS average. Conclusion: The ASCRS calculator for eyes with prior radial keratotomy is an easily accessible and valuable online tool for calculating IOL power in patients with previous radial keratotomy.

40|$|International audienceTwo popular {{segmentation}} {{methods used}} today are atlas based and graph cut based segmentation techniques. The <b>atlas</b> based <b>method</b> deforms a manually segmented image onto a target image, {{resulting in an}} automatic segmentation. The graph cut segmentation method utilizes the graph cut paradigm by treating image segmentation as a max-flow problem. A specialized form of this algorithm was developed by Lecoeur et al [1], called the spectral graph cut algorithm. The goal {{of this paper is}} to combine both of these methods, creating a more stable atlas based segmentation algorithm that is less sensitive to the initial manual segmentation. The registration algorithm is used to automate and initialize the spectral graph cut algorithm as well as add needed spatial information, while the spectral graph cut algorithm is used to increase the robustness of the <b>atlas</b> <b>method.</b> To calculate the sensitivity of the algorithms, the initial manual segmentation of the atlas was both dilated and eroded 2 mm and the segmentation results were calculated. Results show that the atlas based segmentation segments the thalamus well with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0. 87. The spectral graph cut method shows similar results with an average DSC measure of 0. 88, with no statistical difference between the two <b>methods.</b> The <b>atlas</b> based <b>method's</b> DSC value, however, was reduced to 0. 76 and 0. 67 when dilated and eroded respectively, while the combined method retained a DSC value of 0. 81 and 0. 74, with a statistical difference found between the two methods...|$|R

In the SME and social entrepreneurship sectors, Bangladesh is doing well, but the overall situation of entrepreneurship in Bangladesh is not good at all (Moazzem 2008).

The reliability of atlas-based AC is associated with how well the template matches the individual patient’s skull.

The white matter clusters are augmented with expert anatomical labels and stored in a new type of atlas that we call a high-dimensional white matter atlas. We then show how to perform automatic segmentation of tractography from novel subjects by extending the spectral clustering solution, stored in the atlas, using the Nystrom method. We present results regarding the stability of our method and parameter choices. Finally we give results from an atlas creation and automatic segmentation experiment.

5000|$|A high-income {{economy is}} defined by the World Bank as a country with a gross {{national}} income per capita US$12,236 or more in 2016, calculated using the <b>Atlas</b> <b>method.</b> While the term [...] "high-income" [...] is often used interchangeably with [...] "First World" [...] and [...] "developed country", the technical definitions of these terms differ.

Several institutions, such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or International Monetary Fund (IMF), take factors other than high per capita income into account when classifying countries as [...] "developed" [...] or [...] "advanced economies". According to the United Nations, for example, some high-income countries may also be developing countries. The GCC countries, for example, are classified as developing high-income countries.

40|$|There {{is as yet}} no fully {{satisfactory}} way to compare income per capita of the former Soviet Union with that of other economies. Even more problematic is compiling estimates for the separate economies that have emerged with {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union. The main problem is the isolated non-market economy of the country, compounded by the chaotic state of information services. The results presented here, while subject to considerable uncertainty, are considered reliable enough for their primary purpose: to assign the new states of the Soviet Union to income categories for Bank analytical and operational purposes. The main difficulty was choosing a ruble-dollar conversion factor that accords reasonably well with the Bank's <b>Atlas</b> <b>method.</b> Official rates cannot be used because they are as artifical and misleading as any other planned price, meaning that they diverge by a large margin from the rate effectively applied to international transactions. This study investigated three alternative conversion methods, yielding GNP per capita estimates for the former Soviet Union for 1990 ranging from $ 2, 440 to $ 3, 720. The method judged most reliable (referred to as the synthetic Atlas-type conversion factor) gave an estimate of $ 2, 870. The figure is somewhat at odds with Atlas estimates for the former Soviet Union {{and other members of the}} Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), which may reflect the limited applicability of the <b>Atlas</b> <b>methods</b> for historically planned economies. Income per capita is calculated for each of the states of the former Soviet Union and for the other European members of CMEA. The method developed here relies on a purchasing power parity bridge from planned to market economies. Unlike conventional use of this measure, the study uses the relationship between purchasing power parity and exchange rates for comparator market economies to suggest an Atlas-type conversion factor. The estimations for the state of the former Soviet Union have a suggested margin of error of plus or minus 10 percent. Incomplete reports for 1991 - 92 show large declines in real GDP in all countries of the former Soviet Union - as much as 25 percent in some cases. It is unlikely that mechanically extending results to 1992 will yield meaningful results, so this study is just a beginning.

40|$|AbstractThe {{differences}} between countries in national income, growth, human development {{and many other}} factors are used to classify countries into developed and developing countries. There are several classification systems that use different sets of measures and criteria. The most common classifications are the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank (WB) systems. The UN classification system uses the UN Human Development Index (HDI), an indicator that uses statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita for countries' classification. While the WB system uses gross national income (GNI) per capita that is calculated using the World Bank <b>Atlas</b> <b>method.</b> According to the UN and WB classification systems, there are 151 and 134 developing countries, respectively, with 89 % overlap between the two systems. Developing countries have limited human development, and limited expenditure in education and research, among several other limitations.

We assess our proposed approaches on 18 healthy subjects in the public IBSR database and on 9 subjects with Alzheimer’s disease in the AIBL database.
