25|$|The {{editorial}} board of Nacional reacted by accusing the police of Pukanić's death by {{failure to provide}} police protection. They stated that Pukanić's round-the-clock protection by two police officers was lifted on August 1 not by Pukanić's request <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> but under a pressure from the police. Pukanić allegedly received two death threats {{after the end of}} the protection and promptly forwarded them to the police, but they failed to act upon them. The redaction also condemned the prosecution office for investigating false accusations against Pukanić instead of concentrating on finding his April assailant. As of now, there are only informal speculations as to the motive of the assassin.|$|E
25|$|The hired hand Ray Lamphere {{was deeply}} {{in love with}} Gunness; he {{performed}} any chore for her, no matter how gruesome. He became jealous of the many men who arrived to court his employer and began making scenes. She fired him on February 3, 1908. Shortly after dispensing with Lamphere, she presented herself at the La Porte County courthouse. She declared that her former employee was not <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> and was a menace to the public. She somehow convinced local authorities to hold a sanity hearing. Lamphere was pronounced sane and released. Gunness was back {{a few days later}} to complain to the sheriff that Lamphere had visited her farm and argued with her. She contended that he posed a threat to her family and had Lamphere arrested for trespassing.|$|E
500|$|The two volume {{biography}} of Whitehead by Victor Lowe {{is the most}} definitive presentation {{of the life of}} Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no Nachlass; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death. Additionally, Whitehead was known for his [...] "almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy", and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life. [...] This led to Lowe himself remarking on the first page of Whitehead's biography, [...] "No professional biographer <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> would touch him." ...|$|E

[...] "No leader <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> frame of <b>mind</b> urges his people to change their churches simply because of a Bill," [...] he said on 29 June.

He paid back the money which Bartley had borrowed from Halleck, and he set himself as patiently as he could to bear with Marcia's obstinacy. It was a mania which must be indulged for the time, and he could only trust to Atherton to keep him advised concerning her. When he offered her money at parting, she hesitated. But she finally took it, saying, [...] "Bartley will pay it back, every cent, as soon as he gets home. And if," [...] she added, [...] "he doesn't get back soon, I will take some other boarders and pay it myself." ...|$|R

500|$|In the Pacers' locker room, O'Neal and Carlisle nearly {{got into}} a fight over the coaches trying to {{restrain}} the players when they were defending themselves. Artest asked Jackson whether he thought the players would get in trouble. Jackson responded, [...] "We'll be lucky if we have a freaking job." [...] The conversation convinced an amazed Jackson and Pollard that Artest [...] "wasn't <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> to ask that question". Auburn Hills police entered the locker room to make arrests, but the team rushed Artest onto the bus and refused to take him off. The police decided to protect the Pacers as they left the arena and to later contact the team after reviewing game film. Outside of the arena, there were dozens of police cruisers lining the roads out of the parking lots.|$|E

5000|$|Jury {{selection}} eventually {{started on}} January 20, 2015, after {{a request by}} Holmes's lawyers for yet another continuance was denied. The juror selection process lasted three months and summoned 9,000 candidates, making it the largest jury summons in U.S. history. On April 15, selection ended, {{with a total of}} nineteen women and five men serving. There were concerns about the selection of the jurors since at least two from the pool of twelve primary jurors, along with twelve alternatives, had ties to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre: [...] "Juror No. 535", the aunt of a Columbine survivor; and [...] "Juror No. 737", a man who was a student there at the time and also a former friend of the shooters. The trial began on April 27 with opening arguments by the prosecution explaining that Holmes intentionally went to the movie theater that evening with the deliberate intent to kill {{as many people as possible}} in a mass shooting spree. The defense opened up their argument by admitting all the facts that Holmes was indeed the shooter, but that he is mentally ill with severe schizophrenia and was never <b>in</b> control of <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind.</b> Starting on April 28, and over the next few weeks, prosecution testimony included various survivors of the massacre and the after effects it had on the survivors.|$|R
40|$|We are all {{aware of}} the {{problems}} with computer-based, software-intensive systems (CBSISs) not only these days, but also, since we first started to develop CBSISs. They do not do what they are supposed to do; they do not handle surprises well; they are not reliable; and they have poor user interfaces. We call them “brain damaged”. When we are designing a CBSIS, we have to think of everything, everything the CBSIS should do and everything the CBSIS should not do. Thinking of everything means figuring out what anyone using the CBSIS would want it to do under any circumstances and figuring out all possible stimuli, including multiple stimuli, to which the CBSIS must respond. In short, thinking of everything means figuring out all eventualities in all combinations. Like building architects and contract drafters, we CBSIS developers have to think of everything, even things of which no one <b>in</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> would have ever dreamt. The real cause of any problem with CBSISs is really very simple. A problem happens simply because at no time {{in the development of the}} CBSIS to date, did anyone in the team that developed and maintains the CBSIS think of the problem long enough for action to be taken to solve that problem. By “team”, I mean the entire set of people whose thoughts and actions affect the development and maintenance of the CBSIS. This group certainly includes all stakeholders, but can include also passers by who happen to interact with other members of the team in ways that affects the CBSIS’s development. By “not thinking of the problem long enough”, I am referring to the fact tha...|$|R
2500|$|The noted American author John Dos Passos {{joined the}} {{committee}} and wrote its 127-page official review of the case: Facing the Chair: Story of Americanization of Two Foreignborn Workmen. Dos Passos concluded it [...] "barely possible" [...] that Sacco might have committed murder {{as part of a}} class war, but that the soft-hearted Vanzetti was clearly innocent. [...] "Nobody <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> who was planning such a crime would take a man like that along," [...] Dos Passos wrote of Vanzetti.

Their conduct in prison {{consistently}} impressed guards and wardens. In 1927, the Dedham jail chaplain wrote {{to the head of}} an investigatory commission that he had seen no evidence of guilt or remorse on Sacco's part. Vanzetti impressed fellow prisoners at Charlestown State Prison as a bookish intellectual, incapable of committing any violent crime. Novelist John Dos Passos, who visited both men in jail, observed of Vanzetti, [...] "nobody <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> who was planning such a crime would take a man like that along."

The singles spanned four albums, including #7, Ocean Front Property in 1987, If You Ain't Lovin' You Ain't Livin' in 1988 and 1989's Beyond the Blue Neon, all of which reached the number one spot on country album charts. Ocean Front Property was the first country album to ever debut at No.1 on the charts by any artist. The streak included such songs as [...] "Ocean Front Property", [...] "All My Ex's Live in Texas", [...] "Famous Last Words of a Fool" [...] and [...] "Baby Blue".
