The colloidal stability of stationary-phase suspensions was examined by means of sedimentation and 6 -potential experiments.

The performance ofthe slurry-packed microcolumns was predominantly determined by {{the selection of the}} packing liquid.

Escape of the powder during FSP is less in holes filling method {{compared with that of}} <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> method. Similarly, holes filling and closing method gives more control over the particle incorporation compared with that of <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> and holes filling methods but requires more operations. For applications, where more quantity is not necessary but slight modification is enough to alter the surface properties, simple <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> method or <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> and closing method can be adapted. <b>Groove</b> <b>filling</b> method is also appropriate to obtain thick composite layers compared with other processes as shown in Table  1. Of course, the thickness of a composite layer depends on the FSP tool pin dimensions and processing parameters. Where applications demand more amount of secondary phase at the surface, holes filling or holes filling and closing method can be chosen.|$|R

40|$|The dorsal cortex of the equine third {{metacarpal}} mid-diaphyseal bone was characterised during {{growth by}} the histological and microradiographic examination of specimens from 30 horses {{ranging in age}} from 2 months to 8 y. Bone from horses aged less than 6 months was characterised by rapid periosteal apposition of circumferential trabeculae of woven bone that were next connected by radial trabeculae to the parent cortex. Deposition of lamellar bone on the inner trabecular surfaces resulted in rows of primary osteons. Replacement of primary bone occurred only after 4 months of age and preferentially in the woven interstitial bone separating rows of primary osteons formed in the postnatal periosteal cortex. Resorption cavities and <b>incompletely</b> <b>filled</b> secondary osteons characterised bone of 1 and 2 -y-old horses. Bone from horses older than 3 y contained several generations of secondary osteons, fewer resorption spaces and <b>incompletely</b> <b>filled</b> osteons, and had a greater portion of circumferentially oriented collagen fibres than bone from younger horses. Bone from horses older than 5 y had large resorption cavities characterised by irregular boundaries. We propose that the process of periosteal bone tissue apposition observed in growing foals be called 'saltatory primary osteonal bone formation' and that this process results in faster cortical expansion and larger total surface area for bone deposition than circumferential lamellar, simple primary osteonal, and plexiform mechanisms of periosteal bone formation. We speculate that bone from 1 and 2 -y-old horses would be more susceptible to fatigue microdamage resulting from compressive loads because of high porosity, few completed secondary osteons and low proportion of circumferentially oriented collagen fibres...|$|R

This paper presents a new detailed mechanism for their formation, which has been developed by combining existing theoretical modeling results, experimental observations, and analyses based on optical and scanning electron microscopy. Hooks form by solidification and dendritic growth at the liquid meniscus during the negative strip period. Oscillation marks are generated when molten steel partially overflows over the frozen meniscus shortly afterwards and <b>incompletely</b> <b>fills</b> in the gap before solidifying.

40|$|Acidification is {{required}} for the function of many intracellular organelles, but methods to acutely manipulate their intraluminal pH have not been available. Here we present a targeting strategy to selectively express the light-driven proton pump Arch 3 on synaptic vesicles. Our new tool, pHoenix, can functionally replace endogenous proton pumps, enabling optogenetic control of vesicular acidification and neurotransmitter accumulation. Under physiological conditions, glutamatergic vesicles are nearly full, as additional vesicle acidification with pHoenix only slightly increased the quantal size. By contrast, we found that <b>incompletely</b> <b>filled</b> vesicles exhibited a lower release probability than full vesicles, suggesting preferential exocytosis of vesicles with high transmitter content. Our subcellular targeting approach can be transferred to other organelles, as demonstrated for a pHoenix variant that allows light-activated acidification of lysosomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{number and}} {{proportion}} of motoneurons and interneurons {{present in the}} rat abducens nucleus {{was determined by the}} use of ChAT immunostaining and of HRP staining after retrograde transport from the injected right lateral rectus muscle. After HRP injection 67 % of abducens neurons took up HRP and were hence motoneurons to the muscle. The cell bodies were mainly located in the middle third of the nucleus and were either spindle-shaped or pyriform. By ChAT-immunohistochemistry, 77 % of the rat abducens neurons were ChAT-positive. After considering and discarding the hypotheses that the lateral rectus muscle could be <b>incompletely</b> <b>filled</b> by HRP, and that other muscles may be innervated by abducens motoneurons, it is concluded that some interneurons of the abducens nucleus of the rat are probably cholinergic...|$|R

30|$|<b>Groove</b> <b>filling</b> was {{the first}} method {{proposed}} in the literature to produce a composite by FSP (Mishra et al. 2003). It is simple and requires less machining. A straight groove can be produced on the workpiece using ordinary milling cutter. Recently, Gandra et al. (2011) has studied {{the position of the}} groove with respect to the tool pin and demonstrated that if the groove is placed under the pin, the powder distribution is found to be more compared with placing the groove outside the pin interaction area (advancing or retrieving). Another strategy was proposed by Heydarian et al. (2014) in <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> method in which parallel grooves with gradient groove depths were produced and FSP was carried out. Compared with single groove, composite produced from the gradient grooves was found to have uniform distribution of the powder. Whereas the <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> and closing method needs additional tools such as pin-less FSP tool, and also the process involves two cycles; one to close the groove, and the second to produce the composite.

40|$|We {{put forward}} a {{coarse-grained}} model that describes the competition between the supramolecular polymerization of molecules and their binding to template molecules containing a fixed number of binding sites that are also present in the solution. Our model captures the salient features of the competition between this kind of self- and template-assisted assembly and demarcates conditions under which either is predominant. Template-assisted or “templated” assembly wins over self-assembly if the free energy gain of attaching of a monomer unit to a binding site is larger than that of binding it to a self-assembly. In order to find the optimal conditions for full coverage of the templates, we investigate the role of different control parameters such as stoichiometry and temperature on the binding efficiency.

The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure.

The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|R
