40|$|All <b>mineral</b> <b>matter,</b> {{essential}} or non-essential, {{can have}} a significant influence on production results {{and the health of}} animals, if large quantities of them are present in a feed ration. A maximally tolerant content depends on the animal specie and category. Many factors, such as physiological status (growth, lactation, etc.), nutritive status, content and ratio of nutritive matter in the ration, duration of exposure, and the biological level of utilization of elements, also affect the maximally tolerant content of <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> in feed. The content of certain <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> in plant feed significantly depends on the soil factor, as well as the content and level of utilization of <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> from the soil. Mn, Se and Mo can be present in plant feed in such quantities as to induce toxicosis. Industrial contaminants, Cd, Pb or F, can contaminate plants, in particular their leaves, in quantities which lead to the appearance of clinical signs of conventional toxicosis. Moreover, natural water can contain large quantities of S, F, Na, Mg, or Fe, and certain <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> can get into water through industrial waste. In addition to the above, it is possible to cause unwanted effects through the frequent, but primarily unprofessional use of mineral additives, since it is extremely important, besides meeting the mineral requirements of each individual element, to secure a ratio among the <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> themselves as well as with other nutritive <b>matter.</b> <b>Mineral</b> <b>matter</b> present in food are in mutual interference, and these relations can be synergistic or antagonistic. The sufficiency {{of a large number of}} <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> has a negative effect on the utilization of other matter (conditional and/or border deficiency), while certain elements cause the clinical appearance of toxic effects.

40|$|The {{experimental}} determination of <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> in coal is a tedious {{as well as}} time consuming process, and requires highly skilled analyst {{to carry out the}} chemical analysis of coal and ash.

This LTA procedure is {{a modification of}} the Australian Standard for LTA at 370 degrees C, and alleviates adverse effects to thr: minerals caused by the heat of combustion. The leaching behaviour of the <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> towards aqueous HCl and hydrofluoric acid (HF) is presented. HCl can dissolve simple compounds such as phosphates and carbonates, yet it cannot completely dissolve the clays. HF resets with almost every mineral in the <b>mineral</b> <b>matter,</b> except pyrite, {{and most of the}} reaction products are water soluble. However, at HF concentrations greater than that required to dissolve the aluminosilicate compounds in the <b>mineral</b> <b>matter,</b> insoluble compounds form. These compounds include CaF 2, MgF 2 and a compound containing Na, which is believed to be NaAlF 4. It is proposed that HF reacts preferentially with the aluminosilicates in the <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> to form largely AlF 2 +, AlF 3 and SiF 4, and that the concentrations of free fluoride (F-) and AlF 4 - are not high enough to complex cations such as Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and Na+. When the <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> is treated with HF concentrations greater than that required to dissolve all of the aluminosilicates, AlF 3, AlF 4 - and SiF 62 - form, the concentration of F- is high enough to complex Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and form insoluble CaF 2 and MgF 2, and the concentration of AlF 4 - is high enough to complex Na+ and form insoluble NaAlF 4.

30|$|Singh et al. (2015 a) found a {{specific}} micro-structural relation between <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> and the coaly substance in Meghalaya coal. In the moderately dull coal, <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> occurs as superficial impregnation and cavity filling; in moderately bright coal as superficial impregnation, cavity filling, and intimate intergrowth; and in bright coals as superficial mounting and pore fillings. In Umaria and Ib valley coal, in general <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> is more dominant in dull bands {{as compared to}} the brighter ones (Fig.  3 d–f). The micro structural relationships between coaly substances and <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> in vitrain, appears as amorphous mass with conchoidal fracture or observed mainly superficial mounting (Fig.  3 a), superficial blanketing (Fig.  3 b, c), deep intergrowth (Fig.  3 d) and massive impregnation (Fig.  3 c). Saikia (2009) has reported two different morphological types of collotelinite in Assam coals. Those are of typically angular in shape and with parallel laminations. Increase in coal rank appears {{to increase the number of}} laminations and give more ordered system of stacked sheets. Particular, in Umaria coal, telinite shows cellular structures with woody matter compressed probably due to pressure (Fig.  3 e, f). In case of clarain, characterised by alternate thin bands of vitrain and durain, <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> occurs as superficial blanketing and cellular cavity filling. In dull bands it occurs as massive intergrowth and deep impregnations. In durain which is characterised by structureless, compact, residual ground mass, the <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> occurs as intergrowth and massive impregnation. This lithotype records the maximum contamination. Finkelman and Stanton (1978) found pyrite concentrated in vitrinite macerals; illite, quartz, and rutile in the carbominerite; and kaolinite in fusinite and semifusinite. Finkelman (1980) has reported sulfides, concentrated in inertinites and vitrinites. Late epigenetic minerals, such as kaolinite, siderite, pyrite, calcite, barite and silica and most commonly the aluminum silicates have been reported by Finkelman (1980) to occur in micro cleats of coal. In the present investigation, the voids are seen to be filled with clayey, sideritic and at places limonitic <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> (Fig.  4 a, b). Davis et al.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} to provide an insight into the proximate and ultimate analysis, <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> distributions, pyrolysis characteristics and pore structure of three density fractions of Huadian oil shale. XRD analysis shows that the major phases in oil shale of different densities are present as clays, quartz and calcite. Low-density pulverized oil shale predominantly contains organic matter and {{a small amount of}} <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> while high-density pulverized oil shale contains an abundance of <b>mineral</b> <b>matter.</b> The difference is that the former contains mainly internal <b>mineral</b> <b>matter,</b> but in the latter a large quantity of excluded <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> predominates. The pyrolysis curves of oil shale of three densities indicate that the light density fraction assumes a most intense pyrolysis and the weight loss, and the decomposition rate becomes ever weaker with an increase of density in the range of 250 – 550 ̊C. Clays have a catalytic effect on the reactivity of oil shale pyrolysis, causing the degradation of the medium and high fraction to start at a lower temperature. Pore structure of oil shale was measured by using a N 2 isothermal adsorption/desorption method. The pore shapes of oil shale of different densities all present slit types. The pore volume and BET surface area of the medium density fraction is higher than that of the light and high density fraction...|$|R

The organism was grown in microcultures on collodion membranes supported by agar media. At various stages of development, microcultures were floated on distilled water, picked onto cover glasses, air-dried, and incinerated at 500 to 525 C. The mineral residue is deposited in situ and shows the distribution of <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> in the cells. Study of the spodograms thus obtained shows that in the spore <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> is concentrated in a peripheral layer surrounding a minerally poor core. As soon as the spore begins to germinate, often before one notes any change in its optical properties, the minerally rich layer increases in thickness while the core becomes gradually smaller and finally disappears.

The nuclei of the vegetative cells are sites of mineral accumulation. In the compound nuclei, minerals seem to be concentrated in a superficial ring around a minerally poor center.
