5|$|Named {{after the}} South American mammal, <b>Kinkajou</b> was the younger {{half-sister}} of Mozart and appeared sporadically throughout the programme. In the first series, a teenage <b>Kinkajou</b> took {{her younger brother}} Mitch from the burrow and left him alone in the desert after she got bored with watching him. She became a more reliable babysitter as she grew older, but followed in her mother Flower's footsteps with an unauthorised pregnancy in the second series. As <b>Kinkajou</b> was evicted between {{the second and third}} series, it remains unanswered how she was reunited with her sisters Mozart and De la Soul.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} series, Carlos put aside his roving ways {{and became the}} {{dominant}} male of the Starsky, with both <b>Kinkajou</b> and Mozart pregnant with his pups. Carlos was bitten in the face during a fight with Commandoes dominant male, Hannibal. An infection set into the wound, eventually killing Carlos (he really died of TB) and leaving the Starsky without a dominant male.|$|E
25|$|The {{representative}} species include white-headed capuchin, {{mantled howler}} and spider monkeys, brown-throated sloth, paca, <b>kinkajou,</b> coatimundi tayra, Central American otter, puma, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary and red brocket.|$|E
50|$|A nocturnal animal, the <b>kinkajou's</b> peak {{activity}} is usually between about 7:00 PM and midnight, and again {{an hour before}} dawn. During daylight hours, kinkajous sleep in tree hollows or in shaded tangles of leaves, avoiding direct sunlight.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>kinkajou's</b> slender five-inch {{extrudable}} tongue {{helps the}} animal to obtain fruit and to lick nectar from flowers, {{so that it}} sometimes acts as a pollinator. (Nectar is also sometimes obtained by eating entire flowers.) Although captive specimens will avidly eat honey (hence the name [...] "honey bear"), honey {{has not yet been}} observed in the diet of wild kinkajous.|$|R
25|$|The Belize Zoo {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of mammals, {{including}} Belize's national animal, the Baird's tapir, and the five wildcat species found in Belize: (jaguar, puma, ocelot, margay, and jaguarundi). Other mammals include white-tailed deer, red brocket, spider monkey, howler monkey, greater grison, white-lipped peccary, collared peccary, and <b>kinkajou.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ravenoff {{successfully}} convinces Rita to spurn Ranger Jim on {{the pretext}} that Jim will arrest Roberto. Rita unhappily agrees to marry Ravenoff {{to prevent him}} from exposing Roberto as the <b>Kinkajou.</b> Meanwhile, Wheeler's first wife, Katie (Helen Kaiser), shows up to accuse him of bigamy, but conveniently falls in love with Woolsey.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the film}} {{switches}} into Technicolor. During the wedding ceremony aboard Ravenoff's private barge, Ranger Jim cuts the craft's ropes {{so that it}} drifts north of the Rio Grande. The Texas Rangers storm the barge, arrest Ravenoff as the real <b>Kinkajou</b> {{just in time to}} prevent the wedding, and Roberto is revealed {{to be a member of}} the Mexican Secret Service. Jim takes Rita's hand in marriage and Roberto escorts Ravenoff back to Mexico for trial.|$|E
500|$|De La Soul was Mozart and Kinkajou's younger sister. She was {{a former}} Whiskers member but was evicted from the group. The date or {{reason for this is}} unknown. She did not {{challenge}} <b>Kinkajou</b> and Mozart for the role of dominant female of the Starsky. De La Soul, Mozart and <b>Kinkajou</b> were the only three members of the Starsky towards the end of series 3, as the others had died from disease and predation. After a confrontation with the Commandoes, the three sisters were split up, and De La Soul was chased by the Commandoes. <b>Kinkajou</b> and Mozart made it to a burrow but De La Soul did not join them. She was never reunited with Mozart and <b>Kinkajou</b> and has not been seen since. She is thought to have been killed by the Commandoes. [...] She was known as Whoopi in the American version.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the third series, <b>Kinkajou</b> was {{pregnant}} by Carlos and determined to become the dominant female of the group. [...] She started her quest for leadership by leading the group on their foraging trips and then initiating a burrow move. As a final assertion of dominance, she demonstrated her right to be the only female in the group with pups by killing Mozart's newborn pups. [...] She held her position as dominant female until the group, down to only the three sisters, had a disastrous run-in with the Commandoes {{near the end of the}} series. After fleeing for their lives, only <b>Kinkajou</b> and Mozart remained. They found a burrow for the night during a storm, but weakened from starvation, <b>Kinkajou</b> died in her sleep.|$|E
500|$|When Mozart {{returned}} {{in the third}} series, she competed with her sister <b>Kinkajou,</b> also evicted from the Whiskers, for leadership of a new group, the Starsky, which she had founded with roving male Carlos. [...] <b>Kinkajou</b> eventually took over as dominant female, asserting her dominance by killing Mozart's newborn pups. Carlos' death left the Starsky females without a mate or a potential for new pups, and the remaining {{members of the group}} died. Mozart at last lost her sisters in the eleventh episode. [...] Shortly after, Mozart met a roving Commandoes male, Wilson, who seemed primed to help her revive the group, but Mozart was killed outside of her burrow by a jackal the next day.|$|E
500|$|The Starsky was a {{small group}} of seven meerkats that formed between the filming of the second and third series. [...] The group first {{appeared}} in the second episode of the third series. Mozart and <b>Kinkajou,</b> two of three evicted Whiskers sisters in the group, competed for the position of dominant female, while Carlos, the former roving male from the Lazuli, was secure in his position as dominant male. The group struggled to survive from the start. They were plagued with problems, such as Carlos having a fatal face injury, keeping litters alive, and their small territory having little food. [...] After Carlos died from an infection in his wound, the remaining meerkats began dying from starvation, disease, and predation. By the eleventh episode of the third series, only the three sisters, <b>Kinkajou,</b> Mozart, and De la Soul, remained. [...] The last of the group, Mozart, was killed by a jackal in April 2007, bringing the short life of the Starsky group to an end.|$|E
500|$|Carlos, whose {{research}} {{name was}} JD, made regular {{appearances in the}} series starting with the second episode. A rather amorous fellow who was billed as the Kalahari's [...] "Casanova", he impregnated at least four Whiskers females during the first series [...] including Daisy, Mozart, Tosca, and <b>Kinkajou.</b> Despite his roving ways, the show producers referred to him as Mozart's [...] "long-time love" [...] due to their frequent matings.|$|E
500|$|Pookie {{is one of}} Flower's {{sons and}} in the first episode of the series when the group went foraging, he, <b>Kinkajou,</b> and Rocket Dog stole Mitch, {{abandoned}} him, and looked for something more fun. When Yossarian brought Mozart and Tosca's pup's above ground, he ended the chaos by bringing them back to the burrow entrance. Pookie was Flower's biggest competition for food during her lifetime. She died two days after a bite from a cape cobra on 29 January 2007. She was only 6 years old. After his mom died, Pookie left the whiskers to go out roving. When Pookie tried to steal food from Flower, it taught Columbus a lesson: [...] "Don't mess with Mom".|$|E
500|$|Having {{discovered}} over 3000 {{new species}} at Ega, Bates agrees that discovery [...] "forms {{but a small}} item in the interest belonging {{to the study of}} the living creation." [...] He describes the scarlet-faced and other monkeys, [...] "a curious animal", the <b>kinkajou,</b> bats, and toucans. He found 18 species [...] "of true Papilio (swallowtail) butterflies and about 550 butterfly species in all at Ega, among over 7000 species of insect. He describes some unusual insects and their behaviour, including a moth which suspends its cocoon on a long strong silk thread, which while conspicuous is hard for birds to attack. He describes at length various species of Eciton or army ants, noting that confused accounts of these have appeared in travel books, then copied into natural histories.|$|E

2500|$|The canopy is {{the primary}} layer of the forest forming a roof over the two {{remaining}} layers. It contains {{the majority of the}} largest trees, typically 30â€“45 m in height. Tall, broad-leaved evergreen trees are the dominant plants. [...] The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy, as it often supports a rich flora of epiphytes, including orchids, bromeliads, mosses and lichens. [...] These epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. It is suggested that the total arthropod species richness of the tropical canopy might be as high as 20 million. Other species habituating this layer include many avian species such as the yellow-casqued wattled hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), collared sunbird (Anthreptes collaris), African gray parrot (Psitacus erithacus), keel-billed toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus), scarlet macaw (Ara macao) as well as other animals like the spider monkey (Ateles sp.), African giant swallowtail (Papilio antimachus), three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridactylus), <b>kinkajou</b> (Potos flavus), and tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla).|$|E
6000|$|We {{showed a}} Vulturine Parrot and a <b>Kinkajou.</b> The <b>Kinkajou,</b> by the by, got loose one night, and {{displayed}} his natural inclination by instantly catching a rat, and dancing between decks {{with it in}} his mouth: but was so tame withal, that he let the stewardess stroke him in passing. The good lady mistook him for a cat; and when she discovered next morning {{that she had been}} handling a 'loose wild beast,' her horror was as great as her thankfulness for the supposed escape. In curious contrast to the natural tameness of the <b>Kinkajou</b> was the natural untameness of a beautiful little Night-Monkey, belonging to the purser. Its great owl's eyes were instinct with nothing but abject terror of everybody and everything; and it was a miracle that ere the voyage was over it did not die of mere fright. [...] How is it, en passant, that some animals are naturally fearless and tamable, others not; and that even in the same family? Among the South American monkeys the Howlers are untamable; the Sapajous less so; while the Spider Monkeys are instinctively gentle and fond of man: as may be seen {{in the case of the}} very fine Marimonda (Ateles Beelzebub) now dying, I fear, in the Zoological Gardens at Bristol.|$|E
6000|$|The {{existence}} in South America of a fossil horse, of the mastodon, possibly of an elephant (7/4. Cuvier [...] "Ossemens Fossils" [...] tome 1 page 158.), {{and of a}} hollow-horned ruminant, discovered by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil, are highly interesting facts {{with respect to the}} geographical distribution of animals. At the present time, if we divide America, not by the Isthmus of Panama, but by the southern part of Mexico in latitude 20 degrees, where the great table-land presents an obstacle to the migration of species, by affecting the climate, and by forming, with the exception of some valleys and of a fringe of low land on the coast, a broad barrier; we shall then have the two zoological provinces of North and South America strongly contrasted with each other. (7/5. This is the geographical division followed by Lichtenstein, Swainson, Erichson, and Richardson. The section from Vera Cruz to Acapulco, given by Humboldt in the [...] "Polit. Essay on Kingdom of N. Spain" [...] will show how immense a barrier the Mexican table-land forms. Dr. Richardson, in his admirable [...] "Report on the Zoology of N. America" [...] read before the British Association 1836 page 157, talking of the identification of a Mexican animal with the Synetheres prehensilis, says, [...] "We do not know with what propriety, but if correct, it is, if not a solitary instance, at least very nearly so, of a rodent animal being common to North and South America.") Some few species alone have passed the barrier, and may be considered as wanderers from the south, such as the puma, opossum, <b>kinkajou,</b> and peccari. South America is characterised by possessing many peculiar gnawers, a family of monkeys, the llama, peccari, tapir, opossums, and, especially, several genera of Edentata, the order which includes the sloths, ant-eaters, and armadilloes. North America, on the other hand, is characterised (putting on one side a few wandering species) by numerous peculiar gnawers, and by four genera (the ox, sheep, goat, and antelope) of hollow-horned ruminants, of which great division South America is not known to possess a single species. Formerly, but within the period when most of the now existing shells were living, North America possessed, besides hollow-horned ruminants, the elephant, mastodon, horse, and three genera of Edentata, namely, the Megatherium, Megalonyx, and Mylodon. Within nearly this same period (as proved by the shells at Bahia Blanca) South America possessed, as we have just seen, a mastodon, horse, hollow-horned ruminant, and the same three genera (as well as several others) of the Edentata. Hence it is evident that North and South America, in having within a late geological period these several genera in common, were much more closely related in the character of their terrestrial inhabitants than they now are. The more I reflect on this case, the more interesting it appears: I know of no other instance where we can almost mark the period and manner of the splitting up of one great region into two well-characterised zoological provinces. The geologist, who is fully impressed with the vast oscillations of level which have affected the earth's crust within late periods, will not fear to speculate on the recent elevation of the Mexican platform, or, more probably, on the recent submergence of land in the West Indian Archipelago, as the cause of the present zoological separation of North and South America. The South American character of the West Indian mammals seems to indicate that this archipelago was formerly united to the southern continent, and that it has subsequently been an area of subsidence. (7/6. See Dr. Richardson's [...] "Report" [...] page 157; also [...] "L'Institut" [...] 1837 page 253. Cuvier says the <b>kinkajou</b> is found in the larger Antilles, but this is doubtful. M. Gervais states that the Didelphis crancrivora is found there. It is certain that the West Indies possess some mammifers peculiar to themselves. A tooth of a mastodon has been brought from Bahama; [...] "Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal" [...] 1826 page 395.) ...|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{omnivorous}} diet, procyonids have {{lost some of}} the adaptations for flesh-eating found in their carnivorous relatives. While they do have carnassial teeth, these are poorly developed in most species, especially the raccoons. Apart from the <b>kinkajou,</b> procyonids have the dental formula:for a total of 40 teeth. The <b>kinkajou</b> has one less premolar in each row:for a total of 36 teeth.|$|E
50|$|Olingos {{are similar}} to the <b>kinkajou</b> in {{morphology}} and habits. However, genetic studies have shown that kinkajous were an early offshoot of the ancestral procyonid line and are not closely related to any of the other extant procyonids, to which they are a sister group. This divergence is thought to have occurred about 22.6 million years ago. The similarities between the <b>kinkajou</b> and olingos are thus an example of parallel evolution; the closest relatives of the olingos are actually the coatis. The <b>kinkajou</b> is distinguished from olingos by its prehensile tail, its foreshortened muzzle, its extrudable tongue, and its lack of anal scent glands. The only other carnivoran with a prehensile tail is the binturong of Southeast Asia.|$|E
