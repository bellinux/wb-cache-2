25|$|The {{timing of}} gas {{generation}} presents the greatest exploration risk. Maximum burial of, and primary gas migration from, the source rocks could have terminated {{as early as}} the Jurassic, whereas many of the tilted fault blocks were reactivated or created during Paleogene inversion of the basin. However, {{it is also possible that}} a secondary gas charge occurred during regional heating associated with intrusion of Paleogene dykes, such as those that crop out nearby on the coastline of north Wales. (Floodpage et al., 1999) have invoked this second phase of Paleogene hydrocarbon generation as an important factor in the charging of the East Irish Sea Basin's oil and gas fields. It is not clear as yet whether aeromagnetic anomalies in the southeast of Caernarfon Bay are imaging a continuation of the <b>dyke</b> <b>swarm</b> into this area too, or whether they are instead associated with deeply buried Permian syn-rift volcanics. Alternatively, the fault block traps could have been recharged by exsolution of methane from formation brines as a direct result of the Tertiary uplift (cf. Doré and Jensen, 1996).|$|E

40|$|Highlights • New {{inversion}} method resolves high-resolution {{magnetic anomaly}} along uneven routes. • Linear magnetic lows depict multiple shallow <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms.</b> • These <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> confirm the hypermagmatic {{activity of the}} segment. Abstract High-resolution, near-seafloor magnetic data have been acquired over the 16 °N hypermagmatic segment of the East-Pacific Rise using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. This survey proves to be ideal to test the relative efficiency of various inversion methods applied to data acquired at {{a more or less}} constant altitude above the seafloor. Unlike other methods, a recently published Bayesian inversion preserves the short wavelengths and allows for the resolution of a high-resolution reduced-to-the-pole magnetic anomaly. This anomaly unveils the presence of several laterally adjacent dykes associated with individually separated Axial Summit Troughs. The observation of such anomalies, and therefore of shallow dykes, confirms the hypermagmatic character of the segment in a location where complex magma chambers have been imaged in seismic reflection studies. Variable intensity of the magnetic anomalies reflects the depth of the <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> and, ultimately, the timing and style of eruptive events, helping to constrain the spreading axis evolution...|$|R

40|$|Studies of mafic <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> may {{simultaneously}} {{provide information}} on the mechanical, geochemical, geochronological and magnetic environments {{at the time of}} their formation. The mafic intrusive history of different cratons can also be potentially used to unravel their assembly into their current configuration. The identification and classification of dykes is a first step to all these studies. Fortunately, even in regions with poor outcrop, we can use the strong magnetic response of mafic dykes to identify and map their extent. In West Africa the first maps of mafic dyke distribution were made over 40 years ago, but there are still large areas where there are almost no published data. In this paper we present a significantly updated map of mafic dykes for the West Africa Craton based in large part on new interpretations of the regional airborne magnetic database. This map includes the locations of over three thousand dykes across the craton, which locally shows several orientation clusters that provide a minimum estimate for the total number of <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> in this region. Whilst we will have to wait until systematic dating of the different swarms is completed, we can demonstrate that there is a long and complex history of mafic magmatism across the craton, with up to 26 distinct <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> mapped based according to their orientation. The mapping and dating of these swarms will provide key constraints on the assembly of the fragments that make up the modern continents...|$|R

40|$|The Sao Francisco Craton (SFC) is an Archaean-Proterozoic craton that hosts a {{significant}} number of mafic intrusions. Previous attempts to date the igneous emplacement of these rocks are limited to a few poor precision Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isochrons. Here, dykes from the Curaca belt, in the northeastern portion of the craton, {{as well as from the}} Chapada Diamantina region in the central part, were dated using U-Pb on baddeleyite (ID-TIMS). These dykes yielded similar baddeleyite U-Pb ages of 1506. 7 +/- 6. 9 Ma (Curaca) and 1501. 0 +/- 9. 1 Ma (Chapada), with converging trends indicating a possible magmatic centre located near the western margin of the Sao Francisco Craton. The two <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> are subalkaline, and have light rare earth enriched chondrite-normalized patterns but the Curaca dykes have lower Mg-number and higher abundances of most incompatible trace elements than the Chapada dykes. Geochemical modelling and trace element ratios suggest that the two <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> had different petrogenesis, with the Chapada dykes being derived from more depleted mantle sources and the Curaca dykes from enriched sources, however the mantle sources of both <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> appear to have had contributions from an enriched plume. Current geochronological and palaeomagnetic data suggest a coherent Sao Francisco-Congo block from at least the late Mesoproterozoic until the opening of the South Atlantic (ca. 130 Ma ago). The discovery of ca. 1500 Ma intrusions in the Sao Francisco Craton is a major step forward to a more complete barcode record for the SFC-Congo Craton, which can be used in future palaeo-continental reconstructions.

40|$|On Earth, giant {{radiating}} <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> {{are usually}} preserved as fan-shaped fragments {{which have been}} dismembered from their original configuration by subsequent plate tectonic rifting events. Analysis of the largest fragments and consideration of their original configuration {{has led to the}} idea that many swarms are plume related, and that <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> radiate away from plume centers. Magellan radar data reveal abundant intact giant radiating swarms on Venus which are similar in scale and pattern to those on Earth. The absence of intense weathering and plate tectonic processes on Venus accounts for the preservation of the primary radiating patterns. It is characteristic of both Earth and Venus that giant radiating dikes are emplaced laterally for distances of at least 2000 km away from plume centers. At distances beyond the influence of the plume on both Earth and Venus, the radiating dyke pattern is often swept into a linear pattern aligned with the regional stress field. There is tremendous potential synergism between the characterization and analysis of terrestrial <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> (where significant erosion has revealed their structure and emplacement directions at depth) and the giant swarms of Venus (where the complete circumferential structure is preserved, and the surface fracture systems above near surface dikes {{and the nature of the}} central source regions are revealed). In this study, we report on the characteristics of radial <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> on Earth and Venus and draw some preliminary comparisons from the two perspectives. In summary, on both planets there is evidence for plume-related magmatic centers associated with vertical and lateral injection of magma over considerable distances (up to at least 2000 km). The abundance of very broadly radiating swarms on Venus supports the notion that the swarms on Earth were radiating over broad sectors at the time of intrusion but were dissected by later events. The Venus data show that a swarm can change from radiating (proximal) to regional (distal) subparallel orientations. An implication for Earth is that many regional linear swarms which do not have a radiating pattern may be due to fragmentation of the swarm during later plate tectonic rifting. Completion of the global classification and census of Venus features, comparison to the terrestrial synthesis, and documentation of the mode of emplacement of dikes in these environments (buffered and unbuffered conditions) should lead to additional general insight into mechanisms of formation and evolution and their relation to plumes...|$|R

Regional heating associated with mafic magmatism was the probable cause of thermal metamorphism, but previous proposals that the <b>dyke</b> <b>swarms</b> were the consequence of collision or extensional orogenic collapse cannot be substantiated. A regional thermal anomaly, craton-scale extension and adiabatic decompression melting of the asthenosphere are implied, but causal mechanisms such as a mantle plume or intracontinental rifting require substantiation from other parts of East Gondwana. The significant time gap between orogenic deformation and thermal metamorphism implies that metamorphism in many other orogens may not necessarily be due to compressive tectonics...|$|R
