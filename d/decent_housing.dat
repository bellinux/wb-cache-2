5|$|The couple {{moved into}} a very basic ground-floor {{apartment}} in London, on Clarendon Road, Notting Hill. Given {{how hard it was}} to find <b>decent</b> <b>housing,</b> they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, who at the time was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ₤6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life.|$|E
25|$|The first {{efforts to}} tackle Dublin's {{extensive}} slum areas {{came on the}} foundation of the Iveagh Trust in 1891, and the Dublin Artisan Dwellings Company, but these could only help several thousand families. The main focus by government in 1900–1914 was in building 40,000 cottages for rural workers. Some public planning for the city was made {{in the first years of}} the Irish Free State and then effected after 1932, when Éamon de Valera came to power. With greater finances available, and lower wages due to the Great Depression, major changes began to take place. A scheme of replacing tenements with <b>decent</b> <b>housing</b> for Dublin's poor began. Some new suburbs such as Marino and Crumlin were built but Dublin's inner city slums remained.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{has stated}} {{at various times}} that he {{promoted}} a platform to inform Americans of an alternative option in American politics. He believes that capitalism was a selfish system which focused on the wealthy and not the weak and the poor. Moore felt that [...] "capitalism is an economic system where decisions are made {{at the top and}} come down in a dictatorial fashion" [...] He felt that redistributing the wealth between {{the rich and the poor}} would give the United States a stronger public sector, which would in turn focus more on renewable energy and the needy. During his presidential campaign he claimed that the current economic system was falling apart because of capitalist greed. Moore guaranteed an income of [...] "approximately $10,000 per family a year and <b>decent</b> <b>housing</b> for all families". He also called for the [...] "elimination of exorbitant executive salaries, outsourcing of jobs and companies, and calls for an end to for-profit corporations". When asked what made socialism better than capitalism, Moore said; ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{public housing}} {{officials}} in the Roosevelt Administration were progressives, and had strong convictions about the right of all citizens to inexpensive, quality housing. [...] The provision of <b>decent</b> <b>housing</b> seemed to many of these officials {{to be a key}} to the preservation of democracy during the dark days of the Depression. Housing was simply too important a concern to be left only to private industry, labor, or even individual citizens; they believed it was the responsibility of the government to take the lead. [...] Sentiments such as these quickly led to the consideration of public housing programs for those other than just the low-income groups. [...] But the government creation of middle-income housing projects was viewed by many members of the nation's building and real estate industry to be a much larger threat to their livelihood than that designed for the lower-income group. [...] Although pressure from these groups did not stop the development of innovative middle-income housing programs, it did stop those programs from being implemented during the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|Slums {{were common}} in the United States and Europe before the early 20th century. London's East End is {{generally}} considered the locale where the term originated in the 19th century, where massive and rapid urbanisation of the dockside and industrial areas led to intensive overcrowding in a warren of post-medieval streetscape. The suffering of the poor was described in popular fiction by moralist authors such as Charles Dickens – most famously Oliver Twist (1837-9) and echoed the 'Christian Socialist' values of the time, which soon found legal expression in the Public Health Act of 1848. As the slum clearance movement gathered pace, deprived areas such as Old Nichol were fictionalised to raise awareness in the middle classes {{in the form of}} moralist novels such as A Child of the Jago (1896) resulting in slum clearance and reconstruction programmes such as the exemplary Boundary Estate (1893-1900) and the creation of charitable trusts such as the Peabody Trust founded in 1862 [...] and Joseph Rowntree Foundation (1904) which still operate to provide <b>decent</b> <b>housing</b> today.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the middle}} of the 1930s the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration began to bring {{attention}} to the housing plight of lower-income groups in the United States. [...] Many of the New Deal administrators became convinced that <b>decent</b> <b>housing</b> was the right of every citizen, and believed it the duty of the government to find ways to provide such housing. [...] A decentralized lower-income housing program was developed, which relied heavily on local community involvement, organization and input. [...] Financial and administrative support for this initiative were provided by the federal government. In support of this effort, a well-developed public relations campaign was begun to promote and explain the need for public housing, and to establish popular support for the program. [...] Some administrators of the housing program were not satisfied with assisting only the lower-income groups. They asked why programs could not be expanded to assist the middle-income groups in finding decent, affordable housing. [...] Able to afford higher rents, yet often unable to accumulate the required down payments for ownership, members of the middle-income group found it very difficult, if not impossible, to make the jump from rental housing to home ownership. [...] Affordable housing plans were developed but were unable to garner the necessary support within government circles, and they were filed away to await a time when the environment would be right for implementation. [...] Surprisingly, the wait was not long. [...] Just prior to direct American involvement in World War II, the nation entered an emergency period of military buildup that required the development of housing for the middle-income defense workers then streaming into defense plants across the country. [...] The nation's entire public housing program needed to adjust quickly {{to the needs of the}} middle-income worker, and the proposals for housing programs—filed away just a few years earlier—were dusted off. During this relatively brief period of time (1940–1941) just prior to the outbreak of war and its accompanying material shortages and limitations, housing officials had a great deal of freedom to implement these experimental middle-income housing plans.|$|E
