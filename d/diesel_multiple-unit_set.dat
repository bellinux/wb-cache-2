50|$|On three {{consecutive}} days in February 2017, Northern Rail replaced two return journeys between Appleby and Skipton, normally {{operated by a}} <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple-unit,</b> with steam-hauled services worked by no. 60163 Tornado. Unlike the services described above, regular National Rail tickets were valid for travel on these trains, thus making them the first regular scheduled steam-hauled passenger trains {{since the end of}} BR steam.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} of closure all {{passenger}} services on the branch were worked by <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple-unit</b> trains, after an experiment with battery-electric railcars in 1958 - 1962.

Northern services are operated using Class 153 and 156 <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple-unit</b> trains (on the Furness line) and Class 142, 144 and 150 units (Leeds line); very occasionally Class 158 sets also appear on trains from Leeds.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the system}} was a {{completely}} diesel network. Because of the {{many different kinds of}} electrical specifications (voltages and current types - alternating current and direct current) used in the different countries it was thought at that time that use of diesel-hauled trains or <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple-unit</b> trainsets would greatly speed up border crossing. Moreover, at that time many border crossing sections were not yet electrified. The German DB built the streamlined DB Class VT 11.5, while the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and the Dutch NS developed the RAm / DE, both diesel trains.|$|R
