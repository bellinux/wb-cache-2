60|$|But {{when the}} house, or church, or other {{building}} is thus far designed, and {{the forms of}} its <b>dead</b> <b>walls</b> and <b>dead</b> roofs are {{up to this point}} determined, comes the divine part of the work--namely, to turn these <b>dead</b> <b>walls</b> into living ones. Only Deity, that is to say, those who are taught by Deity, can do that.|$|R

60|$|A dead sort of house, with a <b>dead</b> <b>wall</b> {{over the}} way and a dead gateway at the side, where a pendant bell-handle {{produced}} two dead tinkles, and a knocker produced a dead, flat, surface-tapping, that seemed not to have depth enough in it to penetrate even the cracked door. However, the door jarred open on a dead sort of spring; and he closed it behind him as he entered a dull yard, soon brought to a close by another <b>dead</b> <b>wall,</b> where an attempt {{had been made to}} train some creeping shrubs, which were dead; and to make a little fountain in a grotto, which was dry; and to decorate that with a little statue, which was gone.|$|E

6000|$|Remorse in {{the shape}} of a violent {{headache}} had overtaken the Governor. He was uneasily conscious that he might, perhaps, have exceeded his powers; and the captain of the [...] "Guadala", in spite of all his patriotic sentiments, remembered distinctly that no war had been declared between the two countries. He did not need the Governor's repeated reminders that war, serious war, meant a Republic at home, possible supersession in his command, and much shooting of living men against <b>dead</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R

60|$|One evening, while Valentine--still deeply {{immersed}} in the difficulties of depicting the cover-hack--was returning to the Rectory, after a day's work at the Squire's house, his attention was suddenly attracted in the high street of Rubbleford, by a flaming placard pasted up on a <b>dead</b> <b>wall</b> opposite the market-house.|$|E
60|$|That {{is what we}} have to make men, so far as we may. All are to be men {{of genius}} in their degree,--rivulets or rivers, it does not matter, so that the souls be clear and pure; not <b>dead</b> <b>walls</b> {{encompassing}} <b>dead</b> heaps of things known and numbered, but running waters in the sweet wilderness of things unnumbered and unknown, conscious only of the living banks, on which they partly refresh and partly reflect the flowers, and so pass on.|$|R
60|$|To {{get into}} this Vestry in the eminent {{capacity}} of Vestryman, gigantic efforts are made, and Herculean exertions used.

Flaming placards are rife on all the <b>dead</b> <b>walls</b> in the borough, public-houses hang out banners, hackney-cabs burst into full-grown flowers of type, and everybody is, or should be, in a paroxysm of anxiety.|$|R

50|$|Also in 1979, {{the company}} {{developed}} the UM-1 UltraMonitor, {{which led to}} a long association with the band Grateful Dead. As the band was very experimental, this relationship resulted in opportunities for John Meyer to try out new ideas for the then-emerging field of high-powered sound reinforcement in real-world applications. The UltraMonitor was the first product to employ a new, patented horn loudspeaker design that reduced distortion by a factor of ten compared to previous designs. This patent was the first of more than three dozen issued to the company since its founding. John Meyer was also involved {{in the development of the}} Grateful <b>Dead's</b> <b>Wall</b> of Sound.|$|R

60|$|The {{investigation}} required some {{exercise of}} patience at the outset. It was not till the cab had traversed {{the distance between}} Bayswater and Pimlico that the driver began to slacken his pace and look about him. After once or twice retracing its course, the vehicle entered a quiet by-street, ending in a <b>dead</b> <b>wall,</b> with a door in it; and stopped at the last house on the left-hand side, the house next to the wall.|$|E

60|$|But Shefford {{could not}} sleep. The river kept him awake. In the {{distance}} it rumbled, low, deep, reverberating, and near at hand {{it was a}} thing of mutable mood. It moaned, whined, mocked, and laughed. It had {{the soul of a}} devil. It was a river that had cut its way to the bowels of the earth, and its nature was destructive. It harbored no life. Fighting its way through those <b>dead</b> <b>walls,</b> cutting and tearing and wearing, its heavy burden of silt was death, destruction, and decay. A silent river, a murmuring, strange, fierce, terrible, thundering river of the desert! Even in the dark it seemed to wear the hue of blood.|$|R

No one believed her, until three days before, she presented herself and her daughter before the astonished Margaret, who was too much delighted to be able to scold. She had come away on her own responsibility, and was full of triumph. To come home in this manner, after having read [...] "Rivers for ever!" [...] on all the <b>dead</b> <b>walls,</b> might be called that for which she had lived. She made no stay--she had only come to show her child, and establish a precedent for driving out, and Margaret had begun to believe the apparition a dream, when the others came in, some from Cocksmoor, others from the committee-room at the Swan.|$|R

60|$|Mews Street, Grosvenor Square, was not {{absolutely}} Grosvenor Square itself, {{but it was}} very near it. It was a hideous little street of <b>dead</b> <b>wall,</b> stables, and dunghills, with lofts over coach-houses inhabited by coachmen's families, who had a passion for drying clothes and decorating their window-sills with miniature turnpike-gates. The principal chimney-sweep of that fashionable quarter lived at the blind end of Mews Street; and the same corner contained an establishment much frequented about early morning and twilight for the purchase of wine-bottles and kitchen-stuff. Punch's shows used to lean against the <b>dead</b> <b>wall</b> in Mews Street, while their proprietors were dining elsewhere; and the dogs of the neighbourhood made appointments to meet in the same locality. Yet there were two or three small airless houses at the entrance end of Mews Street, which went at enormous rents on account of their being abject hangers-on to a fashionable situation; and whenever one of these fearful little coops was to be let (which seldom happened, for they were in great request), the house agent advertised it as a gentlemanly residence in the most aristocratic part of town, inhabited solely by the elite of the beau monde.|$|E

60|$|He {{was as if}} mad. The {{horror of}} the brick buildings, of the tram-car, of the ashen-grey {{people in the street}} made him reeling and blind as if drunk. He went mad. He had lived with her in a close, living, pulsing world, where {{everything}} pulsed with rich being. Now he found himself struggling amid an ashen-dry, cold world of rigidity, <b>dead</b> <b>walls</b> and mechanical traffic, and creeping, spectre-like people. The life was extinct, only ash moved and stirred or stood rigid, there was a horrible, clattering activity, a rattle like the falling of dry slag, cold and sterile. It was as if the sunshine that fell were unnatural light exposing the ash of the town, as if the lights at night were the sinister gleam of decomposition.|$|R
