50|$|The most {{fundamental}} rule of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>law</b> {{is that the}} person of a diplomatic agent is inviolable.

50|$|It {{is also an}} {{accepted}} principle of customary international law and is recognised between countries {{as a matter of}} practicality. <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>law</b> is often strictly adhered to by states because it works on reciprocity.

40|$|The purpose o f this article, {{which is}} based on A lot hi he's (1997) paper on {{diplomatic}} agents in pre-colonial Lesotho, is to compare and contrast Lesotho's diplomats o f today and those o f King Moshoeshoe's time. Following the brief historical background o f Lesotho, the author compares and contrasts the two diplomatic eras on the following points: eligibility criteria o f diplomatic agents, functions and responsibilities o f diplomats in pre-colonial and post-colonial times, privileges, immunities and inviolability o f diplomatic agents. The paper concludes bv indicating that diplomacy in Lesotho is as old as the state itself and that the diplomacy o f Moshoeshoe's era basically followed the same principles and executed the same diplomatic functions as in post-colonial era. However, what is drastically different is that today the functions and principles are codified as part o f the international law whereas in the pre-colonial epoch they were not.

40|$|Most literatures on {{international}} law {{have been observed}} to neglect or give scanty attention to the contribution of Islamic law towards the development of modern international law, particularly the principles relating to the diplomatic immunity and privileges. It has often been maintained, especially by some Western commentators {{that there is no}} modicum of materiality between Islamic siyar and the rules of conventional international law; as such, Islamic law has nothing to offer the international legal system. The current spades of global terrorism which are allegedly perpetrated in the name of Islam against diplomatic institutions have further widened this perceived incongruity between the two legal regimes. This study therefore critiques and also evaluates the exactitude of the contention that the sources of the two legal regimes are incompatible. This study equally examines the compatibility in the diplomatic principles between Islamic <b>diplomatic</b> <b>law</b> and international <b>diplomatic</b> <b>law.</b> It also contends that the attacks on diplomats and diplomatic facilities are antithetical to the classical principles of jihaad and Islamic <b>diplomatic</b> <b>law.</b> It further argues that the need to harmonise the two legal systems and have a thorough cross-cultural understanding amongst nations generally with a view to enhancing unfettered diplomatic cooperation should be of paramount priority...|$|E
40|$|The Dissertation {{entitled}} "The Status of the Diplomatic Mission of a State in the 1961 Vienna Convention Perspective and the Progress of <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Law</b> ", aims {{to identify}} and analyze the inviolability of the diplomatic premises in the receiving state {{as stated in the}} 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the jurisdiction of sovereign state, and the status of diplomatic missions in applying extraterritorial jurisdiction to take measures that are inconsistent with the provisions of Article 41 paragraph (3) of the Vienna Convention and the progress of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>law</b> after the 1961 Vienna Convention setting up. Some theories are used to analyze the issues raised in this dissertation such as: the extraterritorial/ exterritoriality jurisdiction theory, the functional necessity theory, the sovereignty theory, the perfect equality of state theory, the territorial jurisdiction theory and the reciprocity theory. This prescriptive legal research focused on law enforcement and it was aimed explaining to determine the truth of law. The study based on the provisions of international law, particularly in the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>law,</b> namely the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and other laws (das-Sollen), as well as the application (das-Sein). The status of inviolability of diplomatic premises in the receiving state has not been absolute anymore. The progress of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>law</b> has shown that the situation can changes the status of inviolability. The protection of the citizens of the sending state who are involved in criminal act in the receiving state can be done based on the rights of extraterritorial jurisdiction. In the event of the receiving state has failed to implement international obligations to give mandatory access on consular notification and when the failure has caused harm to the citizens, the sending state is entitled to bring the case to international court. The granting of diplomatic asylum in spite of being contrary to the Convention of Diplomatic Relations has evolved into customary international law...|$|E
40|$|Welcome! This is a {{guide to}} {{diplomatic}} and consular law, a fascinating area of the law. In a strict conceptual sense, <b>diplomatic</b> <b>law</b> is concerned with state-to-state political relations, whereas consular law deals with the relationship between individuals of sending and receiving states. Embassies and ambassadors establish high-level diplomatic relations, whereas consulates and consuls deal with the bureaucratic tasks of fostering trade, friendship, and understanding on an individual level. Diplomatic missions to a foreign state consist of establishing one embassy in the foreign state’s capital city and consulates in other major cities. For example, the U. S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany consists of the U. S. Embassy in Berlin and consulates in the major cities of Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Leipzig, and Munich. Given the inter-related nature of the two branches of law, both <b>diplomatic</b> <b>law</b> and consular law are addressed together in this guide...|$|E

Nevertheless, it is argued that the emergence of the so-called “new” diplomacy, coupled with the developing notion of “responsibility to protect” in the face of gross violations of human rights, such as those faced by Wallenberg, have opened up the possibility for diplomats to engage in the process of protecting civilian populations in times of internal strif...|$|E
