When standing shoulder to shoulder these pieces protect each other's blind spots, making the defense hold up against a lone Lion. An even stronger castle results from leaving the Golds diagonally protecting the outer-most pieces of the wall, although this has the obvious disadvantage that these Golds then cannot be used for attacking, or protecting the wings of your camp from infestation by enemy promoting pieces. There is no hurry in building the castle, as {{it will take a}} long time before the opponent can fight his way through all the material that is initially in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> King.|$|E
500|$|Other sources {{place this}} event as {{occurring}} in Alexandria, Egypt during the Egyptian {{campaign against the}} Ottoman Empire. [...] This variant may {{have been inspired by}} Napoleon's letter to General Auguste de Marmont just prior to the 1799 Battle of Abukir when Marmont was in Alexandria. [...] It urged Marmont to provide an attack warning system by securing [...] "a large quantity of dogs which can be made use of by posting them in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> fortifications". [...] After this event, the Colonel of the grenadier regiment is said to have formally placed Moustache on the roll as a grenadier and gave him a collar bearing the regiment's name. [...] Additionally, he ordered that Moustache receive the field rations entitled to a grenadier and that he be combed by the unit's barber once per week.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to other [...] "mainstays" [...] of modern-day youth, technology serves {{an important role}} in the series, specifically the Internet and Kim's gadgets, the most significant of which is a cell phone-like device known as a Kimmunicator, designed to help Kim communicate with Wade and allow her access to virtually any information she desires. McCorkle elaborated on the show's emphasis on technology: [...] "Using the Internet theme in the series became an easy launching pad partially because it is such a major part of the fabric of teen life and the interactive possibilities are endless ... It's as though we get to play James Bond's 'Q' for each episode -- the more imaginative the toy, the better." [...] Particularly desirable to younger viewers, technology allows Kim to travel around the world effortlessly and to some extent mirrors children's ability to speak to anyone anywhere in the world via the Internet. Kim's ability to travel virtually anywhere around the world within a short period of time is left largely unexplained; BuzzFeed referred to Wade as an [...] "example that sitting in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> computer all day is actually the most powerful position to be in." [...] The fact that Wade never leaves his bedroom could potentially indicate that he suffers from agoraphobia.|$|E

500|$|... "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira and co-produced by the singer along with Lester Mendez. It is a {{combination}} of pop rock and tango, a style of fast-paced ballroom dance music that originated in Argentina and Uruguay. According to the sheet music of [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] published at MusicNotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, it is written in the key of B minor and has a half note metronome of 66 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range spans from E3 to B4. The song contains instrumentation from the bandoneón, which is played at a [...] "breakneck speed," [...] and also features a [...] "twanging" [...] guitar solo. Lyrically, [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] is dramatic and humorous in approach and focuses on an angered Shakira ordering her love interest to choose between her and his other leading lady; it was said to be a feminist anthem and a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train". It contains a line in which Shakira asserts to her lover that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/ That’s why in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> eyes I'm invisible/ But you gotta know small things also count," [...] which a critic commented was a [...] "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers." [...] During the bridge of the song, Shakira delivers rap-like vocals and instructs her lover to end the love triangle, declaring that [...] "Tango is not for three, was never meant to be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} most songs in Laundry Service {{are based on}} issues and themes related to love, {{as they had been}} written after Shakira began a {{relationship}} Antonio de la Rúa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa. [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] is an [...] "ode" [...] to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an [...] "important side" [...] in [...] "The One", which is a song about how [...] "you love your guy so much that you’re actually going to learn to cook" [...] and contains lines like [...] "To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone." [...] In [...] "Rules", she aims to make her lover realise that he is [...] "condemned" [...] to her and lists [...] "all the things your new boy can do." [...] Songs like [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] and [...] "Fool" [...] also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train." [...] In the song, Shakira asserts that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> eyes I'm invisible", which a reviewer commented was a [...] "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers [...]" [...] "Fool" [...] discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a [...] "shitty, self-absorbed man" [...] even after suffering a [...] "soul-crushing defeat." ...|$|E
500|$|Curiosity {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary critics. Bill Lamb of About.com began his review stating {{that it is}} always interesting to have new artists making music both familiar and fresh. He went to describe the six [...] "electronic pop songs strong, almost too short to be satisfying but immensely repeatable." [...] Lamb also added that Jepsen's [...] "style is summery and bright without the emotional bogging down of [...] Lovato or the flat out drudgery of Jessie J" [...] Allmusic critic Jon O'Brien stated that, when compared to Jepsen's previous effort Tug of War (2008), the EP [...] "unexpectedly abandons her previous singer/songwriter approach {{in favor of an}} unashamed bubblegum sound which harks back to the early 2000s pop princess glory days of Britney, Christina, Jessica, and Mandy." [...] Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada described the musical style of the album as [...] "pop. But not in the annoying, auto-tune, and talentless way. Her perfectly pitched voice makes it clear that this girl has real talent." [...] Eadie summarized her review saying that Curiosity [...] "is filled with music that dances. And it is your choice to listen to it with or without a hairbrush (a.k.a. microphone) in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> bedroom mirror. Overall a great EP. I can’t wait to put the top down and blast her tunes all summer." [...] Jen Appel of idobi Radio commented that, overall, Curiosity is the kind of extended play that brings attention from the teenage public due to its mainstream songs, and added, [...] "if you are looking for fun, lovable songs to make you smile, this is your go-to mix." [...] Appel only criticized the lyrical content, noting that it is [...] "very childish but seem to work with the music nonetheless." ...|$|E
