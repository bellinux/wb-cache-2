25|$|In {{numerous}} {{clinical trials}} conducted in NSCLC, several different platinum-based chemotherapy regimens {{have been shown}} to be more-or-less equally effective. LCLC's, as a subtype of NSCLC, have traditionally been included in many of these clinical trials, and have been treated like other NSCLC's. More recent trials, however, have shown that some newer agents may have particular effectiveness in prolonging survival of LCLC patients. Pemetrexed, in particular, has shown significant reduction in the <b>hazard</b> <b>ratio</b> for death when used in patients with LCLC. Taxane-based (paclitaxel, docetaxel) chemotherapy was shown to induce a complete and sustained response in a liver metastasis in a case of LCC-RP. A later-appearing metastasis within mediastinal lymph nodes in the same case also showed a durable response to a taxane alone.|$|E
30|$|We {{compared}} the patient characteristics related to HCC development in proportional hazards models (Table  2). Male gender, high {{body mass index}} (BMI), advanced liver fibrosis, low platelet counts, {{and high levels of}} AFP had significant associations with HCC development in univariate analysis (<b>Hazards</b> <b>ratio</b> 5.6, p[*]=[*] 0.0062, <b>Hazards</b> <b>ratio</b> 1.2, p[*]=[*] 0.0086, <b>Hazards</b> <b>ratio</b> 3.8, p < 0.0001, <b>Hazards</b> <b>ratio</b> 0.77, p < 0.0001, and <b>Hazards</b> <b>ratio</b> 1.1, p[*]=[*] 0.0002, respectively). The incidence of HCC development was significantly lower in the patients with PNPLA 3 148  M than in those with PNPLA 3 148 I (<b>Hazards</b> <b>ratio</b> 0.4, p[*]=[*] 0.043). Liver steatosis and amino acid 70 of HCV core affected HCC development slightly (<b>Hazards</b> <b>ratio</b> 2.1, p[*]=[*] 0.067, and <b>Hazards</b> <b>ratio</b> 3.4, p[*]=[*] 0.082, respectively), while the SNP genotype of IL 28 B was not associated with the risk of HCC development (<b>Hazards</b> <b>ratio</b> 0.62, p[*]=[*] 0.31).

25|$|Data exist {{from both}} {{observational}} and randomized clinical trials regarding {{the association between}} menopausal hormone replacement therapy (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative {{risk of breast cancer}} of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive combined hormone therapy or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers (<b>hazard</b> <b>ratio</b> = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years. HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring in the placebo group, and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term use of hormones for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no breast cancer risk. A correlation was found between the use of hormonal contraceptives and subsequent reliance on hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|According to {{systematic}} review, {{in heart}} failure with preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone {{did not improve}} patient outcomes. This {{is based on the}} TOPCAT Trial examining this issue, which found that of those treated with placebo had a 20.4% incidence of negative outcome vs 18.6% incidence of negative outcome with spironolactone. However, because the p-value of the study was 0.14, and the unadjusted <b>hazard</b> <b>ratio</b> was 0.89 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.77 to 1.04, it is determined the finding had no statistical significance. Hence the finding that patient outcomes are not improved with use of spironolactone. More recently, when blood samples from 366 patients in the TOPCAT study were analyzed for presence of canrenone (an active metabolite of spironolactone), 30% of blood samples from Russia lacked detectable residues of canrenone. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} TOPCAT trial results in Russia don't reflect actual clinical experience with spironolactone in patients with preserved ejection fraction. The TOPCAT study results are now considered to have been invalidated. The study's prime investigator and other prominent research cardiologists are now advising physicians treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to consider prescribing spironolactone pending outcome of two multicenter trials of newer medications.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the previously reported finding that the association between obesity and mortality strengthens with increasing age. Methods: The data were derived from the National Health Interview Survey. Age-specific <b>hazard</b> <b>ratios</b> of mortality for grade 2 / 3 obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m), relative to a BMI of 18. 5 kg/m to < 25 kg/m, were calculated by using a flexible parametric survival model (240, 184 white men) and Cox proportional hazard models (51, 697 matched pairs). Results: When the model included interaction terms between obesity and age at the survey, <b>hazard</b> <b>ratios</b> appeared to increase with age if those interaction terms were ignored by fixing age at the survey as a single value. However, when recalculated for adults with various ages at the survey, according to model specifications, <b>hazard</b> <b>ratios</b> were higher for younger adults than for older adults with the same follow-up duration. Based on matched data, <b>hazard</b> <b>ratios</b> were also higher for younger adults (2. 14 [95 % CI: 1. 90 - 2. 40] for those 40 - 49 years of age) than for older adults (1. 22 [95 %: 0. 91 - 1. 63] for those 90 + years of age). Conclusions: For any given follow-up duration, the association between obesity and mortality weakens with age. The previously reported strengthening of the obesity-mortality association with increasing age was caused by the failure to take all the model specifications into consideration when calculating adjusted <b>hazard</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The basal or resting {{heart rate}} (HRrest) {{is defined as}} the heart rate when a person is awake, in a {{neutrally}} temperate environment, and has not been subject to any recent exertion or stimulation, such as stress or surprise. Most texts cite the typical resting heart rate in adults as 60–100 beats per minute (bpm). A large body of evidence indicates that the normal range is actually 50-90 beats per minute. For example, all-cause mortality is increased by 1.22 (<b>hazard</b> <b>ratio)</b> when heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute. The mortality rate of patients with myocardial infarction increased from 15% to 41% if their admission heart rate was greater than 90 beats per minute. ECG of 46,129 individuals with low risk for cardiovascular disease revealed that 96% had resting heart rates ranging from 48-98 beats per minute. Finally, expert consensus reveals that 98% of cardiologists believe that the [...] "60 to 100" [...] range is too high, with a vast majority of them agreeing that 50 to 90 beats per minute is more appropriate. The normal resting heart rate is based on the at-rest firing rate of the heart's sinoatrial node, where the faster pacemaker cells driving the self-generated rhythmic firing and responsible for the heart's autorhythmicity are located. For endurance athletes at the elite level, it is not unusual to have a resting heart rate between 33 and 50 bpm.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fever after aneurysmal subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} {{is associated with}} poor outcome.

METHODS: Fever within 14 days (subdivided into infectious and noninfectious) {{was defined as a}} mean daily body temperature above 38. 0 degrees C for at least 2 consecutive days in a prospectively collected cohort of 194 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. <b>Hazard</b> <b>ratios</b> were calculated {{to assess the impact of}} hydrocephalus (bicaudate index) and cisternal and intraventricular blood (Hijdra score) on the occurrence of fever. Adjusted <b>hazard</b> <b>ratios</b> were calculated in one multivariate model, including other possible confounding factors. RESULTS: Infectious fever occurred in 34 % of patients and noninfectious fever in 9 %. Adjusted <b>hazard</b> <b>ratios</b> of intraventricular blood were 2. 2 (95 % CI, 1. 3 to 3. 8) for any fever, 2. 4 (95 % CI, 1. 3 to 4. 4) for infectious fever, and 2. 0 (95 % CI, 0. 7 to 5. 9) for noninfectious fever.
