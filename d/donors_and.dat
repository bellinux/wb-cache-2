First, a number of transformants for <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> recipient plant species is produced, carrying the DNA constructs necessary for the exchange of chromosomal fragments mediated by site-specific recombination. The <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> recipient are chosen such that, upon sexual cross or somatic cell fusion, they produce unstable progeny or demonstrate preferential segregation or sorting out. Second, the crossing between <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> recipient species and formation of chromosomal recombinants of <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> recipient plant species is induced. Third, {{taking advantage of the}} instability of hybrids between <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> recipient, recombinant cells and plants of the recipient are selected which contain specific chromosome fragments of the donor species.

5|$|Prokaryotes {{control their}} use of these {{electron}} <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.|$|E
5|$|Although NASA was {{supporting}} {{his work with}} grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research.

SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private <b>donors,</b> <b>and</b> in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.|$|E

5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron <b>donors,</b> <b>and</b> nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Political {{proximity}} between <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> recipient governments may impair {{the effectiveness}} of aid by encouraging favoritism.

We test these competing hypotheses empirically by considering the political ideology of both governments along the left-right spectrum in augmented models on the economic growth effects of aid.

5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy, {{which is used}} to form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox reactions are carried out by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> acceptors.|$|E
