25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the <b>differential</b> <b>expansion</b> of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|E

Using a simple 1 D example of periodical chains of spheres connected by translational and rotational springs two techniques based on <b>differential</b> <b>expansions</b> and integral transformations are analysed. It is shown that the method of <b>differential</b> <b>expansions</b> leads to a Cosserat Continuum that provides a reasonable compromise between the accuracy and simplicity.

In {{the case of}} <b>differential</b> <b>expansions,</b> c_k=Lf(M^-j·) (-k), where L is an appropriate differential operator. For a large class of functions ϕ, the approximation order of <b>differential</b> <b>expansions</b> was recently studied. Some smoothness of the Fourier transform of ϕ from this class is required. In the present paper, we obtain similar results for a class of band-limited functions ϕ with the discontinuous Fourier transform. In the case of falsified expansions, c_k is the mathematical expectation of random integral average of a signal f near the point M^-jk. To estimate the approximation order of the falsified sampling expansions we compare them with the <b>differential</b> <b>expansions.</b> Error estimations in L_p-norm are given {{in terms of the}} Fourier transform of f.

40|$|Abstract: Masonry is a {{two-phase}} {{composite material}} formed by regularly distributed bricks and mortar. The homogenization procedure followed here extends the 2 D approach of Sulem and Mühlhaus [4] {{and leads to}} an anisotropic 3 D Cosserat continuum. The enriched kinematics of the Cosserat continuum allow to model microelement systems undergoing in-plane and out-of-plane rotations. The domain of validity of the derived Cosserat continuum is discussed by comparing the dispersion function of the discrete system of blocks with the continuous one and {{is found to be}} in good agreement.

The homogenization by <b>differential</b> <b>expansions</b> technique is used for obtaining an equivalent Cosserat continuum. It is shown that the enriched kinematics of the Cosserat continuum is not sufficient to capture the full dynamic behaviour of this bi-atomic system.

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the failure criteria of layered composites with orthotropic {{properties in the}} homogenous temperature field. The composite has modeled by two mechanically equivalent families of fibres. The paper formulates constitutive equations in terms of intrinsic "preferred" directions, which are defined by the orientation of fibers at any point of the composite. A uniformly heated, thermoelastic solid undergoes distortion as well as volume change because it experiences <b>differential</b> <b>expansions</b> in different directions. This effect is more complicated if, in addition of being anisotropic, the material is inhomogeneous, {{as in the case}} with laminated materials. In order to illustrate the influence of temperature on the failure of this group of materials constitutive equations are derived and adopted for use in failure criteria, without the influence of temperatures, and with the influence of increased temperature...|$|R

Changes in temperature and humidity should be done slowly so as to minimize the difference in expansion rates. However, an accelerated aging study {{on the effects of}} fluctuating temperature and humidity on paper color and strength showed no evidence that cycling of one temperature to another or one RH to another caused a different mechanism of decay.|$|E

The Chevrolet engine group then designed an aluminum crossflow cylinder head with single central overhead camshaft, “hemi" [...] combustion chambers and big valves. This was lighter and about 4" [...] lower than the Vega production head. Although numerous prototypes were built and manufacturing tooling started, the engine did not receive production approval.

50|$|Exfoliation (or {{onion skin}} weathering) is the gradual {{removing}} of spall {{due to the}} cyclic increase and decrease in {{the temperature of the}} surface layers of the rock. Rocks do not conduct heat well, so when they are exposed to extreme heat the outermost layer becomes much hotter than the rock underneath causing differential thermal expansion. This <b>differential</b> <b>expansion</b> causes sub-surface shear stress, in turn causing spalling. Extreme temperature change, such as forest fires, can also cause spalling of rock. This mechanism of weathering causes the outer surface of the rock to fall off in thin fragments, sheets or flakes, hence the name exfoliation or onion skin weathering.|$|E
5000|$|Heat {{stress is}} a major concern during the {{construction}} of masonry heaters. Differences in temperature inside the masonry core of the heater can result in <b>differential</b> <b>expansion.</b> A skilled heater mason knows how to provide for this stress when designing and constructing the heater, thereby preventing uneven expansion from causing cracking in the exterior. There are two general ways this concern is addressed. One is to incorporate a gap between the inner core of the heater and its outer [...] "skin." [...] The other is to build a more monolithic design with post-tension aspects to mechanically compensate for expansion and contraction. Both methods are used with success.|$|E

5000|$|Doming {{problems}} due to {{thermal expansion}} of the shadow mask was solved in several ways. Some companies used a thermostat to measure the temperature, and adjust the scanning to match the expansion. Bi-metallic shadow masks, where <b>differential</b> <b>expansion</b> rates offset the issue, became common in the late 1960s. Invar alloy and similar low-expansion alloys were introduced in the 1980s These materials suffered from easy magnetization that can affect the colors, but this could be generally solved by including an automatic degaussing feature. The last solution to be introduced was the [...] "stretched mask", where the mask was welded to a frame, typically glass, at high temperatures. The frame was then welded {{to the inside of}} the tube. When the assembly cooled the mask was under great tension, which no amount of heating from the guns would be able to remove.|$|E
