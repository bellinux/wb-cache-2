500|$|With {{the fall}} of Sihanouk, Hanoi became alarmed at the {{prospect}} of a pro-Western regime that might allow the Americans to establish a military presence on their western flank. To prevent that from happening, they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of Kratié and the timing of the move was propitious. President Nixon was of the opinion that: [...] "We need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol...something symbolic...for the only Cambodian regime that <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> take a pro-Western and pro-American stand." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to events in Cambodia, President Nixon {{believed that there}} were distinct possibilities for a U.S. response. With Sihanouk gone, conditions were ripe for strong measures against the Base Areas. He was also adamant that some action be taken to support [...] "The only government in Cambodia in the last twenty-five years that <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> take a pro-Western stand." [...] The president then solicited proposals for actions from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and MACV, who presented him {{with a series of}} options: a naval quarantine of the Cambodian coast; the launching of South Vietnamese and American airstrikes; the expansion of hot pursuit across the border by ARVN forces; or a ground invasion by ARVN, U.S. forces, or both.|$|E

500|$|Eventually Butler's {{leadership}} {{style and the}} directness of actions undermined his support within the community. His departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I {{have the guts to}} fire him." [...] Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted General Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he was doing a bad job, though, and when the news started to break that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the Academy of Music. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.|$|E
500|$|On a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (January 16, 1989) {{episode of}} ABC's late-night news program Nightline, Julian Bond, a social activist and {{leader in the}} Civil Rights Movement, nicknamed the film [...] "Rambo Meets the Klan" [...] and criticized its {{depiction}} of the FBI: [...] "People {{are going to have}} a mistaken idea about that time... It's just wrong. These guys were tapping our telephones, not looking into the murders of [...]" [...] Filmmaker Spike Lee criticized the film for its lack of central African-American characters; he felt it was among several other films that used a white savior narrative to exploit blacks in favor of depicting whites as heroes. When asked about the film at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, Lee responded, [...] "Hated it. They should have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> have at least one central black character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for {{the first time}} I can remember, an extreme-sports game {{actually}} has a real story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The French Prime Minister Guy Mollet, {{outraged by}} Nasser's move, {{determined}} that Nasser {{would not get}} his way. French public opinion very much supported Mollet, and apart from the Communists, all of the criticism of his government came from the right, who very publicly doubted that a socialist like Mollet <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> {{go to war with}} Nasser. During an interview with publisher Henry Luce, Mollet held up a copy of Nasser's book The Philosophy of the Revolution and said: [...] "This is Nasser's Mein Kampf.
