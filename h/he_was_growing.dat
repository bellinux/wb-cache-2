5|$|Invader is a {{graduate}} of the École des Beaux-Arts, a Parisian art school. Invader initially derived inspiration for his creations from video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s that he played when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, particularly characters from Space Invaders, from which he derived his name. Games of the era were made with 8-bit graphics, and so lend themselves well to his method of each tile representing one pixel. Invader began making mosaics in Paris in the 1990s and then in 31 other cities in France.|$|E

5|$|Despite this outburst, {{the studio}} liked him, and before his three-week {{contract}} was up—while {{the film was}} still shooting—they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which {{was followed by a}} full seven-year contract at $400 a week. The contract, however, allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively only guaranteeing him 40 weeks income at a time. As when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, Cagney shared his income with his family. Cagney received good reviews, and immediately starred in another gangster role in The Doorway to Hell. The film was a financial hit, helping cement Cagney's growing reputation. He made four more movies before his breakthrough role.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 1948, Shadrick {{left for}} basic combat {{training}} at Fort Knox, Kentucky. As he was 17 years old, Shadrick {{had to convince}} his parents to sign papers allowing him to enlist. Shadrick completed this training in February 1949, and sailed for Japan to join the 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, for post–World War II occupation duties. Shadrick spent a year on Kyushu island with the division. According to his family, Shadrick enjoyed his tour in Japan at first, but by June 1950 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> tired of the country, and indicated in letters he was feeling depressed.|$|E

5|$|Zoldak {{was born}} on December 8, 1918 in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised by his mother, and worked at her {{confectionery}} shop, both while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up and during the baseball offseason. He attended Eastern District High School, and took up {{the game of baseball}} at McCarren Park, as his high school did not have a baseball team. He began his professional career with the Palatka Azaleas in 1938, and threw 13 innings in two games. He was released afterwards, and played college baseball for the Fordham Rams baseball team while also playing some semi-professional baseball for a team in Cedarhurst, New York. Zoldak was signed by Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack before the 1941 season, ending his college baseball career and restarting his professional one.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, {{it was possible to}} be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
5|$|What {{was seen}} as a failure to keep {{discipline}} on the team hurt Stengel's standing with the Yankee owners, Topping, Weiss and Webb, as did the defeat in the 1957 Series. Stengel was by then aged 67, had several times fallen asleep in the dugout, and players complained that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> more irritable with the years. Former Yankee catcher Ralph Houk, who had been successful as a minor league manager and was Stengel's first base coach, was seen by ownership as the next manager of the Yankees. Stengel's contract, his fifth two-year deal, was up after the 1958 season. As ownership debated whether to renew it, the Yankees led by as many as 17 games, and won the pennant by 10. The Braves were the opponent in the 1958 World Series. The Braves won three of the first four games, but the Yankees, backed by the pitching of Bob Turley (who got two wins and a save in the final three games) stormed back to win the Series. Firing Stengel under such circumstances was not possible, and ownership gave him another two-year contract, to expire after the 1960 season.|$|E
