According to the director, Mammootty was instrumental in casting actress Meena for the film.

5|$|The {{expected}} daily ridership of {{the whole}} network of all phases, ater the compleiton of Phase-II, is 4 million passengers. The communication based train control (CBTC) is being used which enables trains to run at a short headway of 90 seconds. Keeping this <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> other constraints, DMRC changed its decision to build 9-car-long stations for new lines and instead opting for shorter stations which can accommodate 6-car trains.|$|E
5|$|Control of the {{building}} project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, {{at a time of}} increasing costs. Rising costs sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems. With the cost increases <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project, the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{period for}} Giselle is not {{indicated in the}} story. Paul Lormier, the chief costume designer at the Paris Opéra, probably consulted Gautier on this matter. It {{is also possible that}} Pillet had the ballet's budget <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> decided to use the many Renaissance-style costumes in the Opéra's wardrobe for Giselle. These costumes were said to have been those from Rossini's William Tell (1829) and Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini (1838). Lormier certainly designed the costumes for the principal characters. His costumes were in use at the Opéra until the ballet was dropped from the repertoire in 1853.|$|E

5|$|As built, both ships {{also carried}} 21 /51 caliber guns arrayed ten {{to a side}} with one in the stern, {{primarily}} for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. Many of the 5-inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near {{the ends of the}} ship and below the main deck. The ships were not designed with anti-aircraft (AA) defense <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> with the development of naval aviation, this was seen as a serious drawback to the class. The New York class was the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, with two /50 caliber guns mounted on platforms on top of the boat cranes of Texas in 1916. In 1918, the secondary armament was reduced to 16 5-inch/51 caliber guns, eight to a side, as the guns near the ends of the ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea. When both ships were refitted 1925-26, AA defense was increased with eight 3-inch/50 caliber guns arrayed four to a side. Six of the 16 remaining 5-inch guns were relocated higher in the ship to new casemates on the main deck. The New York class also initially featured four torpedo tubes, 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern, for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo, instead of the previous two, because of advances in torpedo performance increasing the prominence of the weapon. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. However, the torpedo tubes were removed in the 1925-26 refit.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more easily get to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|Piccinino, however, did {{not seek}} to {{maintain}} the agreement {{as one of his}} deserters reported. Upon learning this, Skanderbeg decided to open battle with Piccinino's men. After feeding his men and preparing his horses, Skanderbeg set off by moonlight for the Angevin camp. He found the place empty, however, since one of Piccinino's men had already informed Piccinino on the Albanians' intentions. Skanderbeg then returned to Barletta where he was reinforced by Ferdinand and his men. He then split his army into two, one under Alessandro Sforza's command, the other under his, and he approached Troia. Jean d'Anjou and Piccinino were stationed in Lucera, however, eight miles from Troia. Knowing that battle would come between Troia and Lucera, Skanderbeg set out by night to capture Seggiano, a mountain lying between the two cities, where he stationed some of his men to protect it. Thence, his men could find refuge in case of defeat. Piccinino had the same objective <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> set out to capture the mountain, but instead met Skanderbeg's men. He thus kept his men in order for the coming battle. The next day, the two armies met. The battle lasted until dusk, but Jean's men suffered a serious defeat and he was forced to flee. Piccinino then retreated from his campaigns. He went northwards where he joined Sigismondo Malatesta and 200 of his men to launch assaults on the papal state.|$|E
40|$|What are mirror systems good for? Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made in response to this question, addressing the putative functions of mirror systems <b>in</b> <b>minds</b> <b>and</b> brains. This paper examines possible contributions of mirror systems to the emergence of subjectivity. At the heart of the discussion is the notion of social mirroring, which has a long tradition in social philosophy and social anthropology. Taking the existence of mirror devices <b>in</b> <b>minds</b> <b>and</b> brains for granted, I argue that social mirroring is a prerequisite for the constitution of mental selves, and, hence, the emergence of subjectivity. However, the fact that self and subjectivity are socially created should not be taken to indicate that they are illusory. They are as real as natural facts are...|$|R

5|$|To {{transport}} the raiders to the island, two tugs, Vulcan and Nuneaton, {{were provided by}} the Governor of Nigeria, Sir Bernard Bourdillon. The raiding force would consist of 32 men, four SOE agents, 11 commandos from the SSRF and 17 men recruited from the local population to crew the two tugs. The mission suffered a blow when the British General Officer Commanding (GOC) West Africa Command, General Sir George Giffard refused to support the mission and would not release the 17 men required, stating it would compromise some unnamed plans he had <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> the act of piracy would have repercussions. Responding {{to the concerns of}} the GOC West Africa, the Admiralty suspended the operation. The Foreign Office was also not in favour of the operation, and neither was the British Embassy in Madrid, which was concerned about the possible reactions of the Spanish government. The final go ahead, eventually supported by the Foreign Office, was not given until 6 January 1942, on the grounds that suspicion of British involvement in the raid was inevitable; what counted was the avoidance of any tangible proof. As a safeguard the Admiralty also dispatched , a , to intercept the vessels at sea, which would provide the cover story that they had been intercepted while trying to make their way home to Europe.|$|E
