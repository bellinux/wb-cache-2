40|$|The fabric {{weave pattern}} {{recognition}} {{process is a}} structure identification process that detects the yarn location {{as well as the}} yarn crossing structure in a woven fabric. A new local orientation feature is proposed for fabric structure detection by using high-resolution images. The detection process consists of two main steps. Firstly, the yarn location is detected through a series of image enhancement techniques and an edge-based projection method. Secondly, the yarn float is recognized with a local orientation detection approach based on Radon transform. Three kinds of yarn-dyed cotton fabrics are investigated in this study, including the single yarn, the <b>double</b> <b>yarn,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>twisted</b> <b>yarn</b> fabric. Experimental results and discussions demonstrate that the research method is effective in detecting fabric structure and yarn float even with long hairiness. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} <b>twist</b> in a <b>yarn</b> helps {{to define the}} style of yarn- a yarn {{with a lot of}} air such as a woollen yarn will have much less <b>twist</b> than a <b>yarn</b> with little air, like a worsted yarn. It also affects the stretchiness of the yarn, {{strength}}, the halo of the yarn, and many other attributes. Filling or weft yarns usually have fewer twists per inch because strength is not as important as with warp <b>yarns,</b> <b>and</b> highly <b>twisted</b> <b>yarns</b> are, in general, stronger. Warp yarns have to be stronger so that they can withstand the tension of the loom. Filament fibers, such as silk, or many synthetics, need only to be twisted slightly to create a yarn.|$|R
