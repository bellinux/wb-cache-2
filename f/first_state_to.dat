5|$|Although {{significant}} {{opposition to}} abolitionism existed {{early on in}} Massachusetts, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837, opposition to slavery gradually increased throughout the next few decades. Abolitionists John Brown and Sojourner Truth lived in Springfield and Northampton, respectively, while Frederick Douglass lived in Boston and Susan B. Anthony in Adams, Massachusetts. The works of such abolitionists contributed to Massachusetts's actions during the Civil War. Massachusetts was the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> recruit, train, and arm a Black regiment with White officers, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. In 1852, Massachusetts became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> pass compulsory education laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Indiana {{became the}} <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> adopt {{eugenics}} legislation, {{that allowed the}} involuntary sterilization of dangerous male criminals and the mentally defectives. It was never put in effect and in 1921 Indiana became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> rule such legislation unconstitutional when the Supreme Court of Indiana acted. A revised eugenics law was passed in 1927, and it remained in effect until 1974.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, NPVIC {{legislation}} {{was introduced in}} 42 states. It was passed {{by at least one}} legislative chamber in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, Maryland, and Hawaii. Maryland became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> join the compact when Governor Martin O'Malley signed it into law on April 10, 2007.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{liberalization}} of sexuality in American film had increased during the 1920s, the pre-Code era is either dated {{to the start of}} the sound film era, or more generally to March 1930, when the Hays Code was first written. Over the protests of NAMPI, New York became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in Mutual Film vs. Ohio by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the next year, and eight individual states had a board by the advent of sound film.|$|E
5|$|Health-care {{coverage}} in the United States {{is a combination of}} public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. In 2006, Massachusetts became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> mandate universal health insurance. Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Mayor Cheye Calvo {{proposed}} {{a measure that}} would require every Maryland police department that operates a SWAT team to submit biannual reports on its activities, including where {{and when it was}} deployed and whether an operation resulted in arrests, evidence seizures, or injuries. The bill passed that same year, despite strong opposition from Maryland's police agencies. Maryland was the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> adopt such legislation; Utah became the second when it passed a similar bill in March 2014.|$|E

25|$|The Ottomans {{were one}} of the <b>first</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} a standing army in Europe since the Roman Empire. The force originated in the 14th century; it was abolished by Sultan Mahmud II in 1826.|$|R
5|$|In January 2003, Obama became {{chairman}} of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms. Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, South Dakota {{has been}} {{transformed}} from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> eliminate caps on interest rates.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, laws {{regulating}} physician licenses {{are governed}} by the states. Between 1901 and 1989, osteopathic physicians lobbied state legislatures to pass laws giving those with a D.O. degree the same legal privilege to practice medicine as those with an M.D. degree. In many states, the debate was long and protracted. Both the AOA and the AMA were heavily involved in influencing the legislative process. The <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> pass such a law was California in 1901, the last was Nebraska in 1989.|$|E
50|$|A {{measure in}} Massachusetts {{resulted}} {{in that state}} becoming the 18th US <b>state</b> <b>to</b> allow medical cannabis. By ballot measure, voters in both Colorado and Washington chose to legalize cannabis outright, the <b>first</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> do so, whereas voters in Oregon chose to reject it.|$|R

5|$|Massachusetts {{politics}} {{since the}} second half of the 20th century have generally been dominated by the Democratic Party, and the state has a reputation for being the most liberal state in the country. In 1974, Elaine Noble became the first openly lesbian or gay candidate elected to a state legislature in US history. The state housed the first openly gay member of the United States House of Representatives, Gerry Studds, in 1972 and in 2004, Massachusetts became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> allow same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) {{was opened}} for signature. All five nuclear weapons states {{recognized}} under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) signed the treaty, with 66 other states following that day. Fiji became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> ratify the treaty on October 10, 1996. Currently, 183 states have signed and 166 states have ratified the treaty. Most recently, Niue signed the treaty on April 9, 2012 and Myanmar and Swaziland ratified on September 21, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Testing of {{cosmetic}} products on animals is {{banned in the}} member states of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted. It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.|$|E

5|$|The Kennedy {{family was}} {{prominent}} in Massachusetts {{politics in the}} 20th century. Children of businessman and ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. included John F. Kennedy, who was a senator and US president before his assassination in 1963, Robert F. Kennedy, who was a senator, US attorney general, and presidential candidate before his assassination in 1968, Ted Kennedy, a senator from 1962 {{until his death in}} 2009, and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a co-founder of the Special Olympics. In 1966, Massachusetts became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> directly elect an African American to the US senate with Edward Brooke. George H. W. Bush, 41st President of the United States (1989–1993) was born in Milton in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances {{that might}} entail military, political, or direct {{economic}} action {{and has been}} neutral {{since the end of}} its expansion in 1515. Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations and it was the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> join it by referendum. Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states. Switzerland is {{not a member of the}} European Union; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s. However, Switzerland does participate in the Schengen Area.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{states of}} the United States have {{designated}} an official state dog breed. Maryland was the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> name a dog breed as a state symbol, naming the Chesapeake Bay Retriever in 1964. Pennsylvania followed the year after, naming the Great Dane as its official breed. Dog breeds are mostly affiliated with the states that they originated in. North Carolina chose the Plott Hound {{as it was the}} only dog breed indigenous to the state.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Denver {{became the}} first major city in the U.S. to vote to make the private {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana legal for adults 21 and older. The city voted 53.5 percent {{in favor of the}} marijuana legalization measure, which, as then-mayor John Hickenlooper pointed out, was without effect, because the city cannot usurp state law, which at that time treated marijuana possession {{in much the same way}} as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $100 and no jail time. Denver passed an initiative in the fourth quarter of 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11-member review panel to monitor the city's compliance with the 2005 ordinance. In 2012, Colorado Amendment 64 was signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper and at the beginning of 2014 Colorado became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> allow the sale of marijuana for recreational use.|$|E
5|$|The Lowell female textile workers {{continued}} to petition the Massachusetts Legislature and legislative committee hearings became an annual event. Although the initial {{push for a}} ten-hour workday was unsuccessful, the LFLRA {{continued to}} grow, affiliating with the New England Workingmen's Association and publishing articles in that organization's Voice of Industry, a pro-labor newspaper. This direct pressure forced the Board of Directors of Lowell's textile mills to reduce the workday by 30 minutes in 1847. The FLRA's organizing efforts spilled over into other nearby towns. In 1847, New Hampshire became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> pass a law for a ten-hour workday, {{although there was no}} enforcement and workers were often requested to work longer days. By 1848, the LFLRA dissolved as a labor reform organization. Lowell textile workers continued to petition and pressure for improved working conditions, and in 1853, the Lowell corporations reduced the workday to eleven hours.|$|E
25|$|In July 2000 Vermont {{became the}} <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> {{introduce}} civil unions. In 2009 Vermont became the <b>first</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> legislate same-sex marriage unforced by court challenge or ruling.|$|E
