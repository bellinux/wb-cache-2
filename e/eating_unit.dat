40|$|Objective: This {{research}} had two aims. First, {{to assess the}} current mealtime practices within UK <b>eating</b> disorders <b>units.</b> Second, to investigate staff perspectives of these mealtimes, including their involvement and understanding of patients’ experience. Method: Study 1 involved a survey to assess mealtime protocols across 22 <b>eating</b> disorders <b>units.</b> In Study 2, sixteen semistructured {{interviews were conducted with}} staff at three <b>eating</b> disorders <b>units.</b> Results: Between and within-unit variation exist regarding the implementation of mealtimes. Thematic analysis revealed that staff perceived their provision of mealtimes to be influenced by their own interpersonal difficulties created by the meals. Additionally, they perceived that these issues could be aided by forward planning, successful teamwork, and focused staff training. Discussion: There is a need for specialized mealtime implementation training. Furthermore, research is required to evaluate current mealtime practices from patient perspectives and to determine the impact of modified mealtime approaches on treatment outcome...|$|R

However, test generation takes time, in particular if projects consist of many classes, like {{in the case of the}} Guava library. To allow search-based test generation to scale up and to integrate it better into software development, continuous test generation applies test generation incrementally during continuous integration. In this paper, we report on the application of continuous test generation with EvoSuite at the SS- BSE' 15 challenge on the Guava library. Our results show that continuous test generation reduces the time spent on automated test generation by 96 %, while increasing code coverage by 13. 9 % on average...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This paper investigates {{compulsory}} treatment under guardianship legis-lation for 15 anorexia nervosa patients admitted to four <b>eating</b> disorders <b>units</b> in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, between 1991 and 1994. Method: A retrospective follow-up was conducted. This involved {{an analysis of}} sociodemographic, clinical, eating and weight history, and Guardianship Order details obtained from medical records. This small sample was compared to a larger sample of anorexia nervosa patients admitted voluntarily to a specialised <b>eating</b> dis-order <b>unit</b> in NSW. Further follow-up included a structured interview using the Morgan-Russell Assessment Outcome Schedule at least 1 year after admission for {{compulsory treatment}}. Results: For those treated involuntarily, a larger number came from metropolitan Sydney and a larger percentage were unemployed, were purgers and required spe-cialist medical consultations. A significantly higher proportion came from higher socioeconomic groups, and the duration of stay in hospital while patients were under guardianship was significantly greater.

40|$|Background Refeeding and {{normalizing}} eating behaviour are main treatment {{aims for}} individuals admitted to inpatient <b>eating</b> disorder <b>units.</b> Consequently, mealtime activities are specific, everyday activities, serving a clear therapeutic purpose, despite numerous challenges for both staff and patients. Few studies have specifically addressed staff involvement, interactions, and management activities to structure mealtimes. In this study, we investigated {{the structure of}} mealtime activities on inpatient <b>eating</b> disorder <b>units,</b> and identified associated staff behaviour. Methods Descriptive and exploratory qualitative study using video observations to investigate the structure of mealtimes and staff management of mealtime activities. Forty main meals were video recorded and the observational data were analysed using interaction analysis. Results An initial analysis during data screening identified three main parts of the meal: ‘pre-eating’, ‘eating’, and ‘meal completion’. For each part, a regular pattern of activities occurred which were associated with staff behaviour. Conclusions Increased awareness amongst staff regarding how they manage the meal and act through a clear internal structure can help staff members to further explore their behaviours and collaboration during mealtimes, and also contribute to improved interaction with patients during the various phases of the meal...|$|R

40|$|Background Eating {{disorders}} are psychiatric illnesses with potentially life-threatening consequences. Inpatient treatment is typically {{required for the}} most severely ill patients, who are often emaciated or significantly malnourished. A core therapeutic objective is to normalize eating patterns and facilitate weight gain. These goals guide the efforts of milieu therapeutic staff working with this patient group, who support renourishment through the positive manipulation of a structured environment, as well via relational aspects. However, {{there is a lack}} of empirical research exploring inpatient staff members’ perspectives concerning various aspects of this work. This article explore staff’s teamwork during mealtimes on inpatient <b>eating</b> disorder <b>units.</b> Specifically, we investigated the collaborative strategies employed to support core therapeutic goals of meal completion and normalized eating behavior, while concurrently maintaining a supportive, friendly atmosphere during mealtimes. Methods This was a exploratory qualitative study. Data was collected through 20 semi-structured in-depth interviews with staff members working on a specialized <b>eating</b> disorder <b>unit.</b> The interviews were performed after the conduction of meal time support. Cultural historical activity theory was used as the key theoretical tool for analysis. Results The analysis revealed three main themes: 1) strategic seating arrangements mediates division of labor, 2) the use of verbal and nonverbal communication as collaborative tools, and 3) the importance of experience as a collaborative resource. Conclusions The present study found that mealtime collaborative strategies on inpatient EDUs were mainly of non-verbal nature, with level of experience as an important premise for staff collaboration.

40|$|Inpatient <b>eating</b> {{disorder}} <b>units</b> {{are increasingly}} being asked to admit patients at lower BMI's, often delaying hospital treatment until medically unavoidable. This paper aims to explore {{the impact of this}} trend on treatment outcome. Eighty-two adults with anorexia nervosa admitted to a national inpatient eating disorder ward were assessed for BMI at admission, length of hospitalisation, discharge BMI and re-admission within 1 -year post-treatment. In the current study, admission BMI was unrelated to amount of weight gain during treatment or to length of hospital stay. As such patients admitted at lower BMI's had significantly lower BMI's on discharge from treatment. Low admission BMI's were related to significantly higher likelihoods of re-admission within 1 year. This study provides strong evidence for the benefit of early treatment episodes and with more successful treatment outcomes being related to higher weights at start of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of Clinical Psychology / Master of ScienceDespite {{a number}} of {{different}} psychotherapeutic approaches having been examined for use with patients with eating disorders, there is still no established psychological treatment associated with acceptable levels of long-term recovery. These poor recovery rates are associated with the observation that eating disorder patients are often ambivalent, or even resistant, to treatment. As such, research has begun to explore the use of Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), a treatment approach that aims to engage ambivalent and change resistant patients in the treatment process, with these individuals. Poor motivation to recover is particularly prominent within the inpatient eating disorder setting. However, no previous study has examined the use of MET to foster willingness to engage in treatment with this group of patients. The objectives of the current study were twofold. Firstly, an examination of the effectiveness of an inpatient <b>eating</b> disorders <b>unit</b> affiliated was undertaken in order to further the research base upon which future inpatient interventions can be built and compared. The second objective was to develop and evaluate a brief MET group program for inpatient eating disorder sufferers. The goal of the intervention was to enhance patients’ motivation to more effectively utilise the inpatient program and to hence positively impact upon their psychological, physical and behavioural functioning. Forty-two consecutive inpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for an eating disorder were recruited into the current study and sequentially allocated to groups. Twenty-three inpatients completed four MET groups in addition to routine hospital care. A control group of 19 participants in the standard hospital treatment program was also employed (TAU group). The inpatient unit was associated with significant improvements on {{a number of}} physical, behavioural and emotional outcome measures. Despite {{no significant differences between the}} MET and the TAU groups being found on the overall formal outcome measures, there were nevertheless differences between the groups. Specifically, the MET groups appeared to foster longer-term motivation and engagement, and to promote treatment continuation. This study hopes to start a constructive debate on the role of MET in the inpatient <b>eating</b> disorders <b>unit...</b>|$|R

Methods: The Reciprocal Attachment Questionnaire (RAQ) was administered to all inpatients and outpatients at a tertiary referral <b>eating</b> disorders <b>unit</b> over a given period of time, and to controls. The RAQ operationalizes the key components of reciprocal attachment, and is in close theoretical agreement with the Adult Attachment Interview. Results: Patients {{scored significantly higher than}} controls on most scales of the RAQ, most notably on Compulsive Care-Seeking and Compulsive Self-Reliance. We did not find any associations between eating disorder diagnoses and particular attachment profiles. Conclusions: A basic “pull-push” dilemma was demonstrated in the reciprocal attachment relationships of eating-disordered subjects. This dilemma bedevils attempts at therapy and may illuminate the strong feelings elicited by these patients in their therapists. The association of attachment style with particular disorder subgroup diagnoses is complicated. Childhood attachment insecurity may provide a vulnerability whose symptomatic manifestation is colored by later events...|$|R

A better understanding of patients’ experiences is paramount to improve treatment acceptability and outcome. This qualitative study aimed to explore the lived experiences of adult female inpatients undergoing a specialist inpatient treatment programme for anorexia nervosa. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 21 female participants (aged 18 - 41 years) with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, undergoing treatment in a specialist inpatient <b>eating</b> disorder <b>unit.</b> Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Results: Qualitative analysis highlighted 5 master themes which underpinned treatment experiences: (1) Shifts in control, (2) Experience of transition, (3) The importance of supportive staff relationships, (4) Sharing with peers and (5) Process of recovery and self-discovery. Conclusions: Overall, findings suggest patients experience a process of change and adjustment during inpatient treatment in relation to their levels of perceived control, attachment to the treatment environment and a sense of self-identity.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the impact of {{childhood}} sexual abuse (CSA) on clinical characteristics and premature termination of treatment in anorexia nervosa (AN). Method: The participants were 77 consecutive patients with AN admitted to an inpatient <b>eating</b> disorders <b>unit.</b> The patients were assessed in terms of eating disorder symptoms, general psychopathology, and CSA history at admission to hospital. Results: Thirty-seven patients (48 %) reported a history of CSA before the onset of the eating disorder. Individuals with a history of CSA reported significantly greater psychiatric comorbidity, including higher levels of depression and anxiety, lower self-esteem, more interpersonal problems, and more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Patients with the binge-purge subtype of AN (AN-BP) were significantly more likely to report a history of CSA prior to the onset of the eating disorder as compared with patients with the restricting subtype (AN-R) of the illness (65 % of the AN-BP patients vs. 37 % of the AN-R patients; p <. 02). Contrary to our predictions, abused patients were not significantly more likely to dropout of treatment overall.

40|$|Objective: Theory and {{clinical}} literature suggest that pride may {{play an important}} role in the maintenance of restrictive eating disorders. A grounded theory study explored experiences of, and reflections on, pride among women with a current or past diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. Design: This is a qualitative study using grounded theory. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 women recruited from an <b>eating</b> disorders <b>unit</b> in England, and from a UK self-help organization. Grounded theory from a constructivist lens was used. Analysis involved coding, constant comparison and memo-writing. Results: Pride evolves over the course of anorexia. Two overarching conceptual categories were identified: ‘Pride becoming intertwined with anorexia’ and ‘Pride during the journey towards recovery’. These categories encompassed different forms of pride: ‘alluring pride’, ‘toxic pride’, ‘pathological pride’, ‘anorexia pride’, ‘shameful pride’, ‘recovery pride’ and ‘resilient pride’. Initially, pride contributed to self-enhancement and buffered negative emotions. As the condition progressed, pride became a challenge to health and interfered with motivation to change. During recovery, perceptions of pride altered as a healthy approach to living ensued. Conclusions: The evolving nature of pride plays a central role in development, maintenance, and treatment of anorexia. Understanding of pride and its role in psychotherapeutic work with this client group may increase motivation to change and promote recovery. Future work should investigate if tackling pride in eating disorders increases treatment efficacy and reduces the risk of relapsing...|$|R

Infected birds develop mild to severe conjunctivitis that could affect their foraging or social behavior. We videotaped house finches with and without conjunctivitis at a bird feeding station in Atlanta, GA to determine whether birds with conjunc-tivitis differed in feeding duration, efficiency, total food intake, or aggressive interactions. We observed 105 house finch feeding bouts (of which 41 % were of birds with conjunctivitis). In-fected birds spent more time at the feeding station and had smaller average and minimum flock sizes. House finches with conjunctivitis also showed lower feeding efficiency than noninfected birds in terms of seeds obtained per attempt and number of seeds <b>eaten</b> per <b>unit</b> time. However, because of their longer feeding bouts, birds with conjunctivitis consumed similar total numbers of seeds as birds without conjunctivitis. Finally, house finches with conjunctivitis were dis-placed from feeder perches less frequently than noninfected individuals and 75 % of all ob-served displacement events consisted of an infected bird displacing a noninfected bird.

40|$|BACKGROUND: No {{specific}} psychotherapy {{for adult}} anorexia nervosa (AN) has shown superior effect. Maintenance factors in AN (over-evaluation {{of control over}} eating, weight and shape) were addressed via Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The study aimed to compare 19 sessions of ACT with treatment as usual (TAU), after 9 to 12 weeks of daycare, regarding recovery and risk of relapse up to five years. METHODS: Patients with a full, sub-threshold or partial AN diagnosis from an adult <b>eating</b> disorder <b>unit</b> at a hospital were randomized to ACT (n= 24) and TAU (n= 19). The staff at the hospital, {{as well as the}} participants, were unaware of the allocation until the last week of daycare. Primary outcome measures were body mass index (BMI) and specific eating psychopathology. Analyses included mixed model repeated measures and odds ratios. RESULTS: Groups did not differ regarding recovery and relapse using a metric of BMI and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). There were only significant time effects. However, odds ratio indicated that ACT participants were more likely to reach good outcome. The study was underpowered due to unexpected low inflow of patients and high attrition. CONCLUSION: Longer treatment, more focus on established perpetuating factors and weight restoration integrated with ACT might improve outcome.

RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (7 %) reported a previous diagnosis of bulimia nervosa and were compared with a control group of 48 patients without a history of bulimia, matched for diagnostic subtype. Among the patients {{with a history of}} bulimia nervosa, 11 were of the restricting type and 13 of the binge eating/purging type. Among restricting anorexic patients, those with a history of bulimia reported greater age of onset, more psychiatric symptoms, more family psychiatric morbidity, and a higher rate of sexual abuse. On the contrary, among patients with the AN bingeing-purging subtype, the presence of a previous bulimia nervosa was not associated with any of the investigated variables. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with restricting AN who report a history of previous bulimia nervosa are not frequent among those referring to an outpatient <b>eating</b> disorders <b>unit.</b> However, our findings in this small group of subjects confirm that a lifetime history of bingeing and purging in patients with eating disorder, irrespective of when it occurs, is always associated with more psychopathology compared with those restricting patients with AN who have never had a period of bingeing and purging...|$|R
40|$|Difficulties in {{executive}} {{functioning and}} emotional processing {{are reported in}} anorexia nervosa (AN). This case study describes the application of cognitive remediation and emotion skills training (CREST), an intervention that has been piloted in an inpatient <b>eating</b> disorders (EDs) <b>unit.</b> CREST is a 10 -session treatment package, which primarily addresses emotion processing difficulties, one of the maintaining features of AN. The stages of CREST are described, which includes targeting thinking styles, recognizing emotions in the self and others, strategies to manage emotions, and practice of emotion expression. Clinical and self-report data collected before and after CREST indicate improvements in identifying emotions and using healthier emotion regulation strategies, alongside an increase in body mass index (BMI) and reduction in ED symptomatology. This case study provides preliminary evidence for the acceptability and effectiveness of CREST as a low-intensity intervention before proceeding to more comprehensive therapies, such as cognitive behavior therapy to address the ED more fully...|$|R
