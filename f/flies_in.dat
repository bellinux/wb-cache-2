5|$|<b>Flies</b> <b>in</b> the Old World genus Bengalia (Calliphoridae) prey on ants and are kleptoparasites, {{snatching}} prey or brood {{from the}} mandibles of adult ants. Wingless and legless females of the Malaysian phorid fly (Vestigipoda myrmolarvoidea) {{live in the}} nests of ants of the genus Aenictus and are cared for by the ants.|$|E
5|$|Recently, an {{analysis}} of nine different methods for preparing A. muscaria for catching <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> Slovenia {{have shown that the}} release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|The brightly {{coloured}} pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic (warning) signal, {{given that}} females can inflict a painful sting. Depending on the species and morph, the warning colours range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. Dipteran <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> the families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or warble flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive {{at least some}} predators.|$|E
50|$|An XB-47 was <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> the 1951 Operation Greenhouse {{nuclear weapons}} testing. This was {{followed}} by a B-47B being <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> the 1954 Operation Ivy and the 1955 Operation Castle. A B-47E was then <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> the 1956 Operation Redwing.|$|R
25|$|The first RB-66A {{pre-production}} aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> 1954, whereas the first production RB-66B aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> {{the beginning of}} 1955.|$|R

5|$|The {{courtship}} {{rituals of}} the American goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> zigzagging evasive patterns. The male {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.|$|E
5|$|The greater honeyguide guides {{people in}} some parts of Africa to the nests of wild bees. A guiding bird attracts a person's {{attention}} with a chattering call, and <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> short bounds towards a bees' nest. When the human honey-hunter has taken their honey, the honeyguide eats what is left. The Boran people of East Africa use a specific whistle, which doubles the encounter rate with honeyguides; they find that using a honeyguide reduces the time to find honey by two-thirds. The Bushmen of the Kalahari thank the honeyguide with a gift of honey.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> a straight line or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E
50|$|With {{the larger}} number of seats {{available}} on the Space Shuttle, the U.S. began taking international astronauts. In 1983, Ulf Merbold of West Germany became the first non-US citizen to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> a US spacecraft. In 1984, Marc Garneau became the first of 8 Canadian astronauts to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> space (through 2010).In 1985, Rodolfo Neri Vela became the first Mexican-born person in space. In 1991, Helen Sharman became the first Briton to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> space.In 2002, Mark Shuttleworth became the first citizen of an African country to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> space, as a paying spaceflight participant. In 2003, Ilan Ramon became the first Israeli to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> space, although he died during a re-entry accident.|$|R
50|$|The BT-9, {{designated}} NA-19 by the manufacturer, {{evolved from}} the North American NA-16, which first <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> April 1935. The BT-9 design first <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> April 1936.|$|R
50|$|Total sorties {{flown by}} the AAF during World War II were 2,352,800, with 1,693,565 <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> Europe-related areas and 669,235 <b>flown</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific and Far East.|$|R
5|$|During migration, {{the song}} thrush travels mainly {{at night with}} a strong and direct flight action. It <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short {{crossings}} (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, {{but the majority of}} birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.|$|E
5|$|Flies have rapid {{reflexes}} {{that aid}} their escape from predators but their sustained flight speeds are low. Dolichopodid <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> the genus Condylostylus respond {{in less than}} 5 milliseconds to camera flashes by taking flight. In the past, the deer bot fly, Cephenemyia, was claimed {{to be one of}} the fastest insects on the basis of an estimate made visually by Charles Townsend in 1927. This claim, of speeds of 600 to 800 miles per hour, was regularly repeated until it was shown to be physically impossible as well as incorrect by Irving Langmuir. Langmuir suggested an estimated speed of 25 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, an American {{film crew}} disappears in the Amazon {{rainforest}} while filming {{a documentary about}} indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers. In anticipation of his arrival, the military conducts a raid on the local Yacumo tribe and takes a young male hostage {{in order to help}} negotiate with the natives. Monroe <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> via floatplane and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel.|$|E
50|$|CNT6 is {{the home}} of C-GHQU, the SeaBeast, a {{converted}} Republic RC3 Seabee. As a Seabee, C-GHQU first <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> 1947. As the SeaBeast, C-GHQU first <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> May 2011.|$|R

25|$|Cessna {{followed}} the AW with the CW-6, which <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> 1928, and the DC-6, which <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> 1929. He then collaborated with his son, Eldon, in designing and flying the CR-series racing aircraft.|$|R
5|$|Lactarius torminosus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{and as such}} {{plays an}} important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed.|$|E
5|$|Tatum is paroled and {{the media}} begins hyping the fight. Marge makes Moe promise her that the moment Homer is in any danger, he will throw in the towel. The fight starts and {{it is obvious that}} Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and is in danger of being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mediterranean fruit <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> 1929 {{also contributed to the}} nearly {{complete}} destruction of tourism and citrus in South Florida â€“ two vital economic industries in the region. The federal and state government would spend approximately $7million (1929USD) in eradication efforts. There were foreign and domestic bans on the importation of fruits and vegetables from Florida. Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in mid and late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an abysmal financial state until the onslaught of American involvement in World War II.|$|E
50|$|The Schweizer Metal Aircraft Company {{built the}} 2-8 {{prototype}} {{over the winter}} of 1937-38. The aircraft was completed and first <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> June 1938, <b>in</b> time to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> the US National Soaring Championships.|$|R

5|$|The trio {{flies to}} the Mana Fortress and confronts Thanatos, who is {{preparing}} to transfer his mind into Dyluck. With {{the last of his}} strength, Dyluck warns that Thanatos has sold his soul to the underworld and must not be allowed to have the Fortress. Dyluck kills himself, forcing Thanatos to revert to a skeletal lich form, which the party defeats. The Mana Beast finally <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> and attacks the Fortress. The hero expresses reluctance to kill the Beast, fearing that with the dispersal of Mana from the world, the sprite will vanish. With the sprite's encouragement, he uses the fully energized Mana Sword to slay the Beast, causing it to explode and transform into snow. At the conclusion of the game, the hero is seen returning the Mana Sword to its place beneath the Potos waterfall.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{memorial}} for Qwark on the Phoenix, Ratchet goes {{to assist}} Ranger forces battling a Tyhrranoid invasion {{in the city}} of Metropolis. Unveiling his newly completed Biobliterator, Nefarious uses it to turn both Metropolis's citizens and his Tyhrranoid soldiers into robots. Making yet another escape, he orders Klunk to kill Ratchet. After besting the clone, Ratchet and Clank are reunited and vow to stop Nefarious. While searching the remains of the Leviathan, they find evidence that Qwark faked his death. A secret message hidden on board the Phoenix reveals the location of a secret hideout, where Qwark, overcome with cowardice, refuses to fight any longer. After fighting off an attack on the Phoenix, the duo intercept the Biobliterator and Clank destroys it with an ion cannon. However, Sasha informs them that a second, more advanced, Biobliterator is being prepped for launch at Nefarious's main command center on planet Mylon, Ratchet and Clank locate Nefarious and defeat him, but he activates the Biobliterator, which transforms into a giant, heavily armed robot. Before he can crush the two, a reinvigorated Qwark <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> to distract him, giving the duo an opening to destroy the Biobliterator. Nefarious's teleporter malfunctions, stranding him and his butler Lawrence on a distant asteroid. With Nefarious defeated, the Q-Force and their allies attend a private screening of the latest Secret Agent Clank holofilm.|$|E
5|$|After {{a tour of}} the home, {{the girls}} leave the {{watermelon}} in a well to keep it cold. Mac later goes to retrieve the watermelon and does not return. When Fantasy goes to retrieve the watermelon from the well, she finds Mac's head, which <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> the air and bites Fantasy's buttocks before she escapes. The other girls also begin to encounter other supernatural traps throughout the house. The aunt disappears after entering the broken refrigerator, and the girls are attacked or possessed by a series of items in the house, such as Gorgeous becoming possessed after using her aunt's mirror and Sweet disappearing after being attacked by mattresses. These attacks cause the girls to try to escape the house. As soon as Gorgeous walks out the door, the rest of the girls find themselves locked in. The girls try to find the aunt to unlock the door but only find Mac's severed hand in a jar. Melody begins to play the piano to keep the girl's spirits up as the girls hear Gorgeous singing upstairs. As Prof and Kung Fu go to investigate, Melody's fingers are bitten off by the piano, and it ultimately eats her whole.|$|E

5|$|As Dennis {{approached}} the Florida Keys, several gale warnings were issued, {{with the first}} from Long Key to Dry Tortugas at 04:00UTC on August16. These gale warnings were posted progressively farther north along the East Coast of the United States, reaching {{as far north as}} Windmill Point in Virginia. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued in South Florida from Fort Myers to Palm Beach, including the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the campgrounds of Bahia Honda and John Pennekamp state parks. Shelters were also prepared to open in the Florida Keys if necessary. Typically, when a tropical cyclone approaches South Florida, the South Florida Water Management District drains Lake Okeechobee using the floodgates. However, due to a severe drought, water was instead directed into the lake from the connector canals. The storm resulted in a postponement of a second spraying to combat the spread of Mediterranean fruit <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> the Tampa Bay Area. About 40,000tourists fled Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, including about 500people from a campground, causing a loss of about $2million to tourism. Some United States Military vessels were sent out to sea, while about 70A-10 jets at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base were flown to England Air Force Base near Alexandria, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles' {{story begins}} in Mushroom Hill, {{where he is}} {{relaxing}} with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him {{through most of the}} same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E
