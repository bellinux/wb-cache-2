40|$|The Gaudi {{architecture}} and framework {{are designed to}} provide a common infrastructure and environment for simulation, filtering, reconstruction and analysis applications. In this context, a Detector <b>Description</b> <b>Service</b> was developed in LHCb in order to also provide easy and coherent access to the description of the experimental apparatus. This service centralizes every information about the detector, including geometry, materials, alignment, calibration, structure and controls. From the proof of concept given by the first functional implementation of this service late 2000, the Detector <b>Description</b> <b>Service</b> has grown and {{has become one of the}} major components of the LHCb software, shared among all applications, including simulation, reconstruction, analysis and visualization.

We stress the easiness of customization and extension of the detector description by the user, on the seamless integration with condition databases in order to handle time dependent data and on the choice of XML as a persistency back-end for LHCb Detector data. We show how the detector description can be shared but still contains application specific data and keeps at the same time several levels of granularity. We present several external tools which provide additional value to the Detector <b>Description</b> <b>Service</b> like a dedicated, easy to use XML editor and different geometry checkers. We finally give hints on how this service could evolve to be part of a common effort between all LHC experiments that would aim at defining common Detector description tools at the level of the LCG project. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{research}} is to find a continuous solution, which allows the description, the creation, the provisioning, and the execution of value-added telecommunication services. This work proposes a framework for an easy and timesaving creation and provisioning of value-added telecommunication services in Next Generation Networks. As research method, feasibility, comparative methods are used in this study. Criteria and requirements for service <b>description,</b> <b>service</b> creation, service execution, and service provisioning, are defined and existing technologies are compared with each other and evaluated regarding these criteria and requirements. Extensions to the selected technologies are proposed and possibilities to combine these technologies are researched. From the results of the previous steps, a framework is defined which offers a continuous solution for the description, creation, provisioning and execution of value-added services. In order to test the proof of concept, this framework is prototypically implemented. For a qualitative analysis of the research targets and the proof of concept, an example service is created and executed within the framework prototype. Furthermore, in order to examine the validity of the quantitative aims and objectives of this research work, a second example service is created, and its characteristics are measured and analysed. The result {{of this research is}} a novel continuous approach for the creation of value-added telecommunication services. This research introduces new possibilities for the service <b>description,</b> <b>service</b> creation, service provisioning, and service execution through an extension of the common telecommunication real-time execution environment JAIN SLEE.

Since WSDL documents are {{the primary source of}} service information, readability of WSDL documents is of concern to service providers, i. e., <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> should be understood with ease by service consumers. Providing highly readable <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> can then be used as a strategy to attract service consumers. However, given highly readable information in the WSDL documents, competitors are able to learn know-how and can copy the design to offer competing services. Security attacks such as information espionage, client impersonation, command injection, and denial of service are also possible since attackers can learn about exchanged data and invocation patterns from WSDL documents. While readability of <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> makes Web <b>services</b> discoverable, it contributes to service vulnerability too. Service designers therefore should consider this trade-off when designing <b>service</b> <b>descriptions.</b> Currently there is no readability measurement for WSDL documents. We propose an approach to such measurement so that service designers can determine if readability is too low or too high with regard to service discoverability, service imitation, and service attack issues, and then can consider increasing or lowering <b>service</b> <b>description</b> readability accordingly. Our readability measurement is based on the concepts or terms in service domain knowledge. Given a WSDL document as a <b>service</b> <b>description,</b> readability is defined in terms of the use of difficult words in the description and the use of words that are key concepts in the service domain. As an example, we measure readability o...|$|R

The IST-FET Integrated Project SENSORIA aims at {{developing}} a novel {{comprehensive approach to}} the engineering of service-oriented software systems where foundational theories, techniques and methods are fully integrated in a pragmatic software engineering approach.

The Service Centered Calculus SCC is a general purpose calculus which enriches traditional process calculi with an explicit notion of session; the Service Oriented Computing Kernel SOCK is inspired by the Web services protocol stack and consists of three layers for service <b>description,</b> <b>service</b> engines, and the service network; Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA) is an expressive formal language for modelling distributed systems which we use for quantitative analysis of services.
