5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted {{that he may have}} been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur from the town of Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>favor</b> in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E
5|$|A {{new trial}} is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim, in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>favor,</b> while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the lack}} of biographical {{information}} is unusual for the period (extensive biographies are available for most significant Greek mathematicians for several centuries before and after Euclid), some researchers have proposed that Euclid was not, in fact, a historical character and that his works were written {{by a team of}} mathematicians who took the name Euclid from the historical character Euclid of Megara (compare Bourbaki).

25|$|Wrestling's {{competitiveness}} was degraded by television, a fact {{regarded by}} many in the business as a natural effect of television over competition. The New York wrestling office soon became dominant, as it refused to use competitive wrestlers, and instead focused on attracting televised entertainment. Perhaps the first of the more comic book-like characters known to professional wrestling today was Antonino Rocca. Comparatively weak in wrestling ability, his marketable personality and barefoot acrobatics attracted fans and made him a national superstar, especially popular among Italian and Hispanic fans. The New York Wrestling office used him to revive the promotion on television, and found him far easier to exploit than a more athletically skilled wrestler, enabling the office to negotiate wrestler contracts tremendously <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>favor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} these campaigns marked {{a turning point in}} Rangers' history. The U.S. Army could provide only limited and thinly {{stretched}} protection in the enormous territory of Texas. In contrast, the Rangers' effectiveness when dealing with these threats convinced both {{the people of the state}} and the political leaders that a well-funded and organized local Ranger force was essential. Such a force could use the deep familiarity with the territory and the proximity with the theater of operations as major advantages <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>favor.</b> This option was not pursued in the light of the emerging national political problems, and the Rangers dissolved until 1874. However, the conviction of their usefulness had become firmly established, and the agency was eventually reconstituted.|$|E
40|$|Background: Many {{strategies}} have been employed {{to increase the}} conformational stability of proteins. The use of 4 -substituted proline analogs capable to induce pre-organization in target proteins is an attractive tool to deliver an additional conformational stability without perturbing the overall protein structure. Both, peptides and proteins containing 4 -fluorinated proline derivatives can be stabilized by forcing the pyrrolidine ring <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>favored</b> puckering conformation. The fluorinated pyrrolidine rings of proline can preferably stabilize either a C c-exo or a C c-endo ring pucker in dependence of proline chirality (4 R/ 4 S) in a complex protein structure. To examine whether this rational strategy can be generally used for protein stabilization, we have chosen human ubiquitin as a model protein which contains three proline residues displaying C c-exo puckering. Methodology/Principal Findings: While (2 S, 4 R) - 4 -fluoroproline ((4 R) -FPro) containing ubiquitinin can be expressed in related auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain, all attempts to incorporate (2 S, 4 S) - 4 -fluoroproline ((4 S) -FPro) failed. Our results indicate that (4 R) -FPro is favoring the C c-exo conformation present in the wild type structure and stabilizes the protein structure due to a pre-organization effect. This was confirmed by thermal and guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation profile analyses, where we observed an increase in stability of 24. 71 kJ?mol 21 {{in the case of}} (4 R) -FPro containing ubiquitin ((4 R) -FPro-ub) compared to wild type ubiquitin (wt-ub). Expectedly, activity assays revealed that (4 R) -FPro-ub retained th...|$|R

The next vote upheld the Chairman's ruling that Iceland {{should be allowed to}} vote, 18–18 once again. Finally, the vote to uphold previous decisions to deny Iceland's reservation was defeated with 18 in favor and 19 opposed.

5000|$|The {{media and}} both schools have called Johns Hopkins-Maryland the {{greatest}} and most historic rivalry in men's lacrosse.

[...] A 2003 Harris Interactive poll found that Marylanders considered it the state's fourth biggest rivalry after the Cowboys-Redskins, Ravens-Redskins, and Duke-Maryland.

Johns Hopkins recognizes those games and records the series as 68-38-1 <b>in</b> <b>its</b> own <b>favor.</b> Maryland, however, recognizes only games played since the formation of their varsity team in 1924, which puts the all-time record at 61-38-1, also in favor of Hopkins.|$|R
25|$|Ten cities {{submitted}} bids to {{host the}} 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics that were recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), five of which made the IOC Executive Committee's shortlist.

Beijing won an absolute majority of votes after two rounds of voting, {{eliminating the need for}} subsequent rounds of voting. IOC delegates and the media identified a number of factors <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>favor,</b> including the size of the country, improvements in Chinese anti-doping enforcement, and its close loss to Sydney, Australia eight years earlier.

25|$|With {{the overall}} public anxiety {{regarding}} the constantly expanding trend of online crimes, in 2001 roughly fifty-four percent of Americans polled showed a general {{approval for the}} FBI monitoring those emails deemed suspicious. Thus, it was born {{the idea for the}} FBI program: “Carnivore”, which was going {{to be used as a}} searching method, allowing the FBI to hopefully home in on potential criminals. Unlike the overall approval of the FBI’s intervention, “Carnivore” was not met with as much of a majority’s approval. Rather, the public seemed to be divided with forty-five percent siding <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>favor,</b> forty-five percent opposed to the idea for its ability to potentially interfere with ordinary citizen’s messages, and ten percent claiming indifference. While this may seem slightly tangent to the topic of internet privacy, it is important to consider that at the time of this poll, the general population’s approval on government actions was declining, reaching thirty-one percent versus the forty-one percent it held a decade prior. This figure in collaboration with the majority’s approval of FBI intervention demonstrates an emerging emphasis on the issue of internet privacy in society and more importantly, the potential implications it may hold on citizens’ lives.|$|E

40|$|In a multi-country {{model with}} {{interconnected}} markets for fossil fuel and deposits some countries fight climate damage by purchasing and preserving fossil fuel deposits, {{which would be}} exploited otherwise.

Following Harstad (2012), we then analyze the policy mix consisting of the deposit policy, a fuel-supply-cap policy and a fuel-demand-cap policy. The fuel-supply-cap policy {{turns out to be}} redundant and so is the fuel-demand-cap policy, if it is nonstrategic.
