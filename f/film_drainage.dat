40|$|International audienceAlthough {{extensively}} {{studied in}} the past, drainage of aqueous foams still offers major unaddressed issues. Among them, the behaviour of foam <b>films</b> during <b>drainage</b> has great significance as {{the thickness of the}} films is known to control the Ostwald ripening in foams, which in turn impacts liquid drainage. We propose a model relating the films' behavior to the liquid flow in foam channels. It is assumed that Marangoni driven recirculation counter flows take place in the transitional region between the foam channel and the adjoining films, and the Gibbs elasticity is therefore introduced as a relevant parameter. The velocity of these counter flows is found to be proportional to the liquid velocity in the channel. The resulting channel permeability is determined and it is shown that Marangoni stresses do not contribute to rigidify the channel's surfaces, in strong contrast with the drainage of horizontal thin liquid films. New experimental data are provided and support the proposed model...|$|R

Three Newtonian, nonpolar liquids have been studied: octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, n-tetradecane, and n-hexadecane.

In very thin films the continuum Reynolds theory breaks down, as drainage occurs in a series of abrupt steps whose size matches the thickness of molecular layers in the liquid.

Several clinical criteria are usually proposed to support or reject a hypothesis of malignancy; however, most are of limited reliability. In any case of doubt, outpatient biopsy is recommended, so as to establish the correct diagnosis and formulate the most appropriate treatment plan. In all facial malignancies, the first (and absolutely mandatory) consideration is control of the cancer. Then, restoration of eyelid function can be addressed, in the following order: protection of the globe by complete dynamic eyelid closure and opening, visual function (and prevention of possible deprivation amblyopia) by insuring a clear visual axis, correction of the tear <b>film,</b> efficient lachrymal <b>drainage,</b> and only then the role of the eyelids in facial expression and esthetics. For most malignant eyelid tumors, the best assurance of complete excision is obtained by extemporaneous examination of the resection margins by frozen section (by Mohs' micrographic surgery techniques, or a variation thereof).

40|$|A {{modelling}} {{study of}} surfactant evolution {{on a film}} surface coupled to lamellar <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> has been carried out. This study simulates the surfactant transport onto a lamella in a foam fractionation column with reflux: such columns offer greater control over enrichment and recovery of the surface active material. Insoluble surfactant is assumed during the simulation as such surfactants potentially derive more benefit from a reflux system. There are two terms involved in the equation for surfactant flux which are the Marangoni flow – from the Plateau border to {{the centre of the}} lamella – and the <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> – which is directed from the centre of the lamella to the Plateau border. The extent of <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> is bounded using two extremal assumptions of mobile or rigid interfaces. On a mobile interface, the <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> dominates the Marangoni effect, while on a rigid interface, the Marangoni effect is dominant. The numerical simulation was carried out using a material point method followed by a bookkeeping operation to regrid the film. Analytical solutions for the case of no drainage and for a (quasi) steady state in which Marangoni flows and drainage are balanced were used to verify the numerical simulation. From the simulations, it can be concluded that the <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> obtained using surfactant with a mobile interface is much faster than that determined using surfactant with a rigid interface, meaning that surfactant tends to be washed out of the film in the mobile case. The desirable condition in a foam fractionation column is however where the Marangoni flow dominates the liquid drainage which can be achieved when using surfactant that gives a rigid interface. The (quasi) steady state solution verifies the simulation result at later time for the case of film with a rigid interface. An asymptotic solution in the case of film with a mobile interface gives a prediction of the surface concentration of surfactant at the centre of the film, but also predicts growing surfactant concentration gradients and growing Marangoni stresses near the film's edge, which may then invalidate model assumptions...|$|E

40|$|Aqueous foam {{concentrate}} (AFC) 380 foam {{was developed by}} Sandia National Laboratory as a blast mitigation foam for unexploded ordnance (UXO) and its ''engineered foam structure'' {{is reported to be}} able to ''envelop chemical or biological aerosols'' [1]. It is similar to commercial fire-fighting foams, consisting mostly of water with small amounts of two alcohols, an ether and surfactant. It also contains xanthan gum, probably, to strengthen the foam <b>film</b> and delay <b>drainage.</b> The concentrate is normally diluted in a 6 : 94 ratio with water for foaming applications. The diluted solution is normally foamed with air to an expansion factor of about 100 (density 0. 01 g/cc), which is called ''dry'' foam. Higher density foam (0. 18 > {rho} > 0. 03 g/cc) was discovered which had quite different characteristics from ''dry'' foam and was called ''wet'' foam. Some characterization of these foams has also been carried out, but the major effort described in this document is the evaluation, at the small and medium scale, of chemical, mechanical and thermal approaches to defoaming AFC 380 foam. Several chemical approaches to defoaming were evaluated including oxidation and precipitation of the xanthan, use of commercial oil-emulsion or suspension defoamers, pH modification, and cation exchange with the surfactant. Of these the commercial defoamers were most effective. Two mechanical approaches to defoaming were evaluated: pressure and foam rupture with very fine particles. Pressure and vacuum techniques were considered too difficult for field applications but high surface area silica particles worked very well on dry foam. Finally simple thermal techniques were evaluated. An order-disorder transition occurs in xanthan solutions at about 60 C, which may be responsible for the effectiveness of hot air as a defoamer. During defoaming of 55 gallons of foam with hot air, after about 70 % of the AFC 380 foam had been defoamed, the effectiveness of hot air was dramatically reduced. Approximately 15 gal of residual foam containing mostly small bubbles was resistant to further defoaming by methods that had been effective on the original, dry foam. In this paper the residual foam is referred to as ''wet'' and the original foam is referred to as ''dry''. Methods for generating ''wet'' foam in small to moderate quantities for defoaming experiments have been developed. Methods for defoaming wet foam are currently under study...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses a}} number of fundamental issues concerning convective mass transfer across fluid-fluid interfaces in porous media. Mass transfer to/from distributed sinks/sources is considered for i) the slow dissolution of liquid filaments of a wetting non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) held {{in the corners of}} angular pores or throats and ii) the fate of gas bubbles generated during the flow of a supersaturated aqueous phase in porous media. 1. 	Effects of the stability of NAPL films on wetting NAPL dissolution Wettability profoundly affects the distribution of residual NAPL contaminants in natural soils. Under conditions of preferential NAPL wettability, NAPL is retained within small pores and in the form of thick films (liquid filaments) along the corners and crevices of the pore walls. NAPL films in pore corners provide capillary continuity between NAPL-filled pores, dramatically influencing the behaviour of NAPL dissolution to the flowing aqueous phase by convection and diffusion. A pore network model is developed to explore the dissolution behaviour of wetting NAPL in porous media. The effects of initial NAPL distribution and NAPL film stability on dissolution behaviour are studied using the simulator. NAPL phase loses continuity and splits into disconnected clusters of NAPL-filled pores due to rupture of NAPL <b>films.</b> Quasi-state <b>drainage</b> and fingering of the aqueous phase into NAPL-filled pores is treated as an invasion percolation process and a stepwise procedure is adopted for the solution of flow and solute concentration fields. NAPL film stability is shown to critically affect the rate of mass transfer as such that stable NAPL films provide for more rapid dissolution. The network simulator reproduces the essential physics of wetting NAPL dissolution in porous media and explains the concentration-tailing behaviour observed in experiments, suggesting also new possibilities for experimental investigation. 2. 	Convective Mass Transfer across Fluid Interfaces in Straight Angular Pores Steady convective mass transfer to or from fluid interfaces in pores of angular cross-section is theoretically investigated. The model incorporates the essential physics of capillarity and solute mass transfer by convection and diffusion in corner fluid filaments. The geometry of the corner filaments, characterized by the fluid-fluid contact angle, the corner half-angle and the interface meniscus curvature, is accounted for. Boundary conditions of zero surface shear (‘perfect-slip’) and infinite surface shear (‘no-slip’) at the fluid-fluid interface are considered. The governing equations for laminar flow within the corner filament and convective diffusion to or from the fluid-fluid interface are solved using finite-element methods. Flow computations are verified by comparing the dimensionless resistance factor and hydraulic conductance of corner filaments against recent numerical solutions by Patzek and Kristensen [2001]. Novel results are obtained for the average effluent concentration as a function of flow geometry and pore-scale Peclet number. These results are correlated to a characteristic corner length and local pore-scale Peclet number using empirical equations appropriate for implementation in pore network models. Finally, a previously published “ 2 D-slit” approximation to the problem at hand is checked and found to be in considerable error. 3. 	Bubble evolution driven by solute diffusion during the process of supersaturated carbonated water flooding In situ bubble growth in porous media is simulated using a pore network model that idealizes the pore space as a lattice of cubic chambers connected by square tubes. Evolution of the gas phase from nucleation sites is driven by the solute mass transfer from the flowing supersaturated water solution to the bubble clusters. Effects of viscous aqueous phase flow and convective diffusion in pore corners are explicitly accounted for. Growth of bubble clusters is characterised by a pattern of quasi-static drainage and fingering in the gas phase, an invasion percolation process controlled by capillary and gravitational forces. A stepwise solution procedure is followed to determine the aqueous flow field and the solute concentration field in the model by solving the conservation equations. Mobilization of bubbles driven by buoyancy forces is also studied. Results of bubble growth pattern, relative permeability and macroscopic mass transfer coefficient are obtained under different gas saturations and aqueous flow conditions...|$|R

40|$|Steady-state rising foam is {{an ideal}} medium for {{studying}} foam coalescence phenomena. The coalescence process {{in this type of}} foam is characterized analytically. The spatial distribution of bubble size depends on the effect of individual coalescence events on the bubble size distribution, the rate at which they occur, and the rise rate of the bubbles. The film rupture rate is assumed to depend on the film area and the <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> time, and is calculated using several simple models. This analysis agrees well with measurements conducted in a laboratory foam cell. However, the time-scale of the experiments indicated that <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> was occurring predominantly in the hydrodynamic regime, and that non-equilibrium rupture mechanisms were primarily responsible for the observed coalescence...|$|E
40|$|Within the oil {{industry}} {{there is a need}} to measure and predict the form of the multiphase liquid and gas flows that are present within oil production and processing pipelines. Knowledge of the flow regimes present allows the engineer to optimise the configuration of the pipeline and downstream processes to achieve the most, economic and reliable design. The applications of these technologies are collectively known as flow assurance. Within oil production systems, one component which has received little attention is the characterisation of the multiphase flow around bends under various process conditions. To predict the flow regimes in greater details requires the development of instrumentation that can measure and characterise the flow within the pipes. To circumvent this challenge, two experimental investigations were carried out in two rigs available in the Chemical and Environmental Engineering Laboratories at the University of Nottingham. These are: (1) a 67 mm internal diameter pipe joined to a 90 o bend, in which air/silicone oil flows were investigated using advanced instrumentation: Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT), Wire Mesh Sensor Tomography (WMS), and high-speed video. The first two provide time and cross-sectionally resolved data on void fraction. The ECT probes were mounted 10 diameters upstream of the bend whilst the WMS was positioned either immediately upstream or immediately downstream of the bend. The downstream pipe was maintained horizontal whilst the upstream pipe was mounted either vertically or horizontally. The bend (R/D = 2. 3) was made of transparent acrylic resin. The superficial velocities of the air ranged from 0. 05 to 4. 73 ms- 1 and for the silicone oil from 0. 05 to 0. 38 ms- 1. (2) a 127 mm internal diameter riser joined to a vertical 180 o bend, in which measurements of film fraction and liquid film thickness distribution for an air-water system were obtained using the electrical conductance technique. The former was measured using the ring conductance probes placed 17 and 21 diameters, respectively upstream and downstream of the bend, 45 o, 90 o and 135 o within the bend. The latter were obtained using pin and parallel wire probes. The pin probes were used for thin films measurement whilst the parallel wire probes for thick films. The bend, made of transparent acrylic resin, has a curvature ratio (R/D = 3). The superficial velocities of the air ranged from 3. 5 to 16. 1 ms- 1 and for the water from 0. 02 to 0. 2 ms- 1. The experimental results for the 90 o bend study reveal that bubble/spherical cap bubble, slug, unstable slug and churn flows were observed before the bend for the vertical pipe and plug, slug, stratified wavy and annular flows when the pipe was horizontal. Bubble, stratified wavy, slug, semi-annular and annular flows are seen after the bend for the vertical 90 o bend, the flow patterns remained the same as before the horizontal 90 o bend. These results were confirmed by the high-speed videos taken around the bend. For the vertical 180 o return bend, the average film fraction was identified to be higher in straight pipes than in bends. For low liquid and higher gas flow rates, due to the action of gravity <b>drainage,</b> <b>film</b> breakdown occurs at the 45 o bend. A previously proposed criterion, to determine stratification after the 90 o bend, based on a modified Froude number have been shown to be valid for a liquid different from that tested in the original paper. Similarly, for the 180 o return bend, the condition for which the liquid goes either to the inside or outside of the bend are identified based on published material. Variations between average liquid film thickness and bend angles are reported for the vertical 180 o bend. Contrary to the conclusions reached by Hills (1973) and Anderson and Hills (1974), the liquid film thickness becomes annular flow in the 180 o bend at low liquid flow rates and stratified flow at higher liquid superficial velocities. In addition, a CFD code has been used to successfully model the hydrodynamics of the slug flow pattern in a riser and vertical 90 o bend, using the Volume of Fluid model based on the Eulerian approach, implemented in the commercial CFD package Star-CCM+. The modelling results are validated with the experiments and also provide more detailed information on the flow such as the velocity field.

The coalescence time obtained under sonication was much longer {{compared to that}} calculated by the <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> theory for a free bubble surface without surfactants. It was found that {{under the influence of}} an acoustic field, the coalescence time could be probabilistic in nature, exhibiting upper and lower limits of coalescence times which are prolonged when both the maximum surface approach velocity and secondary Bjerknes force increases. The size of the two contacting bubbles is also important. For a given acoustic pressure, bubbles having a larger average size and size difference were observed to exhibit longer coalescence times. This could be caused by the phase difference between the volume oscillations of the two bubbles, which in turn affects the minimum film thickness reached between the bubbles and the <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> time. These results will have important implications for developing <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> theory to account for the effect of bubble translational and volumetric oscillations, bubble surface fluctuations and microstreaming.

40|$|Gas bubbles {{coalesce}} in deionized (DI) water {{because the}} water (foam) films between the bubbles are not stable. The so-called hydrophobic attraction {{has been suggested}} {{as the cause of}} the film instability and the bubble coalescence. In this work, microinterferometry experiments show that foam films of ultrapure DI water can last up to 10 s and the contact time between the two gas bubble surfaces at close proximity (similar to 1 mu m separation distance) significantly influences the <b>film</b> <b>drainage,</b> rupture, and lifetime. Specifically, when the two bubbles were first brought into contact, the films instantly ruptured at 0. 5 mu m thickness. However, the <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> rate and rupture thickness sharply decreased and the film lifetime steeply increased with increasing contact time up to 10 min, but then they leveled off. The constant thickness of film rupture was around 35 nm. Possible contamination was vigorously investigated and ruled out. It is argued that migration of gases inherently dissolved in water might cause the transient behavior of the water films at the short contact time. The <b>film</b> <b>drainage</b> rate and instability at the long contact time were analyzed employing Eriksson et al. 2 ̆ 7 s phenomenological theory of long-range hydrophobic attraction (Eriksson, J. C.; Ljunggren, S.; Claesson, P. M., J. Chem.
