40|$|The paper compares one-period ahead {{forecasting}} {{performance of}} linear vector-autoregressive (VAR) models and single-equation Markov-switching (MS) models for two cases: when leading <b>information</b> is <b>available</b> {{and when it}} is not. The results show that single-equation MS models tend to perform slightly better than linear VAR models when no leading <b>information</b> is <b>available.</b> However, if reliable leading <b>information</b> is <b>available,</b> single-equation MS models tend to give somewhat less precise forecasts than linear VAR models. ...|$|R

5|$|Seal {{impressions}} {{found in}} Peribsen's tomb at Abydos show several deities: Ash, Min and Bastet, suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's {{time on the}} throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting monotheism. The heretic theory of Newberry, Černý, Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological <b>information</b> <b>available</b> during their lifetimes. Most of the found clay seal impressions were still undeciphered and untranslated at their time.|$|E
5|$|Stories of mythical Orcadian demons are {{recorded}} in the 16th-century Latin manuscripts of Jo Ben, {{who may have been}} referring to the nuckelavee in his description of the Orkney island of Stronsay. Dennison transcribed much of the <b>information</b> <b>available</b> about traditional tales told on Orkney, but to an extent romanticised and systematically altered certain elements of the stories in the process of transforming them into prose.|$|E
5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book of Mormon to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers {{view it as a}} companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of <b>information</b> <b>available</b> to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature.|$|E

5|$|From a {{study of}} all the <b>information</b> <b>available</b> to the Board it is {{concluded}} that this flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, West Cobalt {{was sold}} to the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company, which {{assigned}} her to its Ripley Steamship Company subsidiary. During the 1930s, Lykes Brothers operated cargo ships between Gulf Coast and Caribbean ports, and though there is little specific <b>information</b> <b>available</b> regarding West Cobalts movements, {{it is likely that}} she called at Gulf coast and Caribbean ports as well. One specific mention of the ship is found in a report in The New York Times in 1937, when the newspaper reported West Cobalts arrival in New York on 30 October, ten days after sailing from New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{like with}} many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model and the policy {{prescriptions}} it generates are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions {{on the nature of the}} industry in question, the <b>information</b> <b>available</b> to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.|$|E

5|$|Kowloon Walled City's early {{population}} fluctuated between {{zero and}} a few hundred, and began growing steadily shortly after World War II. However, there is no accurate population <b>information</b> <b>available</b> {{for much of the}} Walled City's later existence. Official census numbers estimated the Walled City's population at 10,004 in 1971 and 14,617 in 1981, but these figures were commonly considered to be much too low. Informal estimates, on the other hand, often mistakenly included the neighbouring squatter village of Sai Tau Tsuen. Population figures of about 50,000 were also reported.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>information</b> <b>available</b> on the {{allegations}} was released (officially or unofficially) {{by the prosecution}} and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|Prior to filming, Peirce {{researched}} the facts by interviewing the people surrounding the case.

Tisdel, who began dating Brandon just two weeks before he was murdered, was 19 {{years old at the}} time of the murders and lived in Falls City with her mother. Peirce also interviewed Tisdel's mother and Brandon's friends. However, she was unable to interview Brandon's mother or any of his biological family. Much factual information, including Nissen being a convicted arsonist, was incorporated into Boys Don't Cry.|$|E

5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference between the President and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best <b>information</b> <b>available,</b> but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major intelligence failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of <b>information</b> <b>available.</b> Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
5|$|The false {{catshark}} is an infrequent bycatch of longlines {{and bottom}} trawls. It has minimal economic value, though its meat, fins, and liver oil may be utilized. In Okinawa, its oil is traditionally used {{to seal the}} hulls of wooden fishing boats. Like other deepwater sharks, this species {{is thought to be}} highly susceptible to overfishing due to its slow reproductive rate. However, it is rarely caught and there is no <b>information</b> <b>available</b> on its population. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Least Concern.|$|E
