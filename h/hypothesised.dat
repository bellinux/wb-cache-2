5|$|Although the <b>hypothesised</b> {{description}} of what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate.

Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|Bohlinia entered China and {{northern}} India {{in response to}} climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and, around 7mya, entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae; others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate. G. jumae was larger and more heavily built while G. gracilis was smaller and more lightly built. The main driver {{for the evolution of}} the giraffes {{is believed to have been}} the changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8mya. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern {{and northern}} Africa and western India. Some researchers have <b>hypothesised</b> that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are <b>hypothesised</b> to have had more okapi-like colourations.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on their}} orbital characteristics, short-period comets {{are thought to}} {{originate}} from the centaurs and the Kuiper belt/scattered disc —a disk of objects in the trans-Neptunian region—whereas the source of long-period comets {{is thought to be}} the far more distant spherical Oort cloud (after the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort who <b>hypothesised</b> its existence). Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are thought to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards toward the Sun to form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets, whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been <b>hypothesised</b> to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E

5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them.

One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first <b>hypothesised</b> by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|In 1725, the French sailor Julien Tafforet was marooned on the Mascarene {{island of}} Rodrigues for nine months, and his report {{of his time}} there was later {{published}} as Relation d'île Rodrigue.

François Leguat, a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), {{did not have a}} boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did. No people who later traveled to the island mentioned the bird.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} youths' level of understanding of selected environmental concepts measured by their verbal responses.

Youth would especially struggle to <b>hypothesise</b> theoretical and abstract concepts as opposed to describing what they observe.

The study involved nine youths from Christel House, Cape Town, who were selected and assessed on their understanding of four environmental concepts. The crew of the sail ship noted their responses during various lessons offered on board before proceeding with the next. The results indicated that the participating youth were able to compare two different observed scenarios as being either similar or different, but were unable to compare theoretical scenarios.
