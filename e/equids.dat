5|$|The genus Equus {{was first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It {{is the only}} recognized extant genus in the family Equidae. The first <b>equids</b> were small, dog-sized mammals (e.g. Eohippus) adapted for browsing on shrubs during the Eocene, around 54 million years ago (mya). These animals had three toes on the hind feet and four on the front feet with small hooves in place of claws but also had soft pads. <b>Equids</b> developed into larger, three-toed animals (e.g. Mesohippus) during the Oligocene and Miocene. From there, the tridactyl toes became progressively smaller through the Pleistocene until {{the emergence of the}} single-toed Equus.|$|E
5|$|The horse {{adapted to}} survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, {{surviving}} in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other <b>equids</b> are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Different peoples {{inhabited}} the city, including the Halafians, Semites and the Hurrians. Tell Brak was a religious center from its earliest periods; its famous Eye Temple {{is unique in}} the Fertile Crescent, and its main deity, Belet-Nagar, was revered in the entire Khabur region, making the city a pilgrimage site. The culture of Tell Brak was defined by the different civilizations that inhabited it, and it was famous for its glyptic style, <b>equids</b> and glass. When independent, the city was ruled by a local assembly or by a monarch. Tell Brak was a trade center due to its location between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. It was excavated by Max Mallowan in 1937, then regularly by different teams between 1979 and 2011, when the work stopped due to the Syrian Civil War.|$|E
50|$|From the 20th century <b>equid</b> hybrids {{were being}} created. The first {{crossbreeding}} was with zebras and donkeys. <b>Equid</b> hybrids {{can be traced}} back to Africa where there are vast amount of <b>equid</b> species which resulted in natural crossing creating hybrid species. These hybrids were found to be more efficient than the original species because they poses certain traits of both species so scientists began to experiment by crossing other species of the horse family and categorizing them as <b>Equid</b> Hybrids. <b>Equid</b> hybrids are now bred commercially. Mules bred from mammoth studs and stock or draft mares can be as large as seventeen hands and are as strong as a normal horse. Other mules are bred for pets or for entertainment such as zoo, these are the miniature horses or miniature donkeys.|$|R

Even so, numerous clinical syndromes {{have been identified in}} <b>equid</b> species in association with these viruses. <b>Equid</b> gammaherpesviruses are a genetically heterogeneous viral subfamily, the function of which in host immune modulation and disease pathogenesis has not yet been elucidated. While they share similarities with gammaherpesviruses in humans, the role they play in their relationship with the host is the subject of continued interest and research. Their widespread presence in horses and other <b>equid</b> species provides a considerable challenge in linking them with particular clinical and pathological conditions and in defining their significance from a diagnostic and therapeutic viewpoint.

5|$|Seals from Tell Brak and Nabada {{dated to}} the pre-Akkadian kingdom, {{revealed}} {{the use of}} four-wheeled wagons and war carriages. Excavation in area FS recovered clay models of <b>equids</b> and wagons dated to the Akkadian and post-Akkadian periods. The models provide information about the types of wagons used during that period (2350–2000 BC), and they include four wheeled vehicles and two types of two wheeled vehicles; {{the first is a}} cart with fixed seats and the second is a cart where the driver stands above the axle. The chariots were introduced during the Mitanni era, and none of the pre-Mitanni carriages can be considered chariots, as they are mistakenly described in some sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} horse remains {{found in}} the area now covered by Britain and Ireland date to the Middle Pleistocene. Two species of horse have been identified from remains at Pakefield, East Anglia, dating back to 700,000BC. Spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at Eartham Pit, Boxgrove, dated 500,000BC, showed that early hominids were hunting horses in the area at that time. The land which now comprises the British Isles was periodically joined to continental Europe by a land bridge, extending from approximately the current coast of North Yorkshire to the English Channel, most recently until about 9,000years ago. Dependent on {{the rise and fall}} of sea levels associated with advancing and retreating Ice ages, this allowed humans and fauna to migrate between these areas; as the climate fluctuated, hunters could follow their prey, including <b>equids.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, <b>equids,</b> cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Many human primary {{somatic cells}} can be im-mortalized by {{inducing}} telomerase activity through the ex-ogenous {{expression of the}} human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT). This approach has been extended to the immortalization of cell lines from several mammals. Here, we show that hTERT expression {{is not sufficient to}} immor-talize primary fibroblasts from three <b>equid</b> species, namely donkey, Burchelli’s zebra and Grevy’s zebra. In vitro anal-ysis of a reconstituted telomerase composed by hTERT and an <b>equid</b> RNA component of telomerase (TERC) revealed a low activity of this enzyme compared to human telomerase, suggesting a low compatibility of <b>equid</b> and human telomer-ase subunits. This conclusion was also strengthened by comparison of human and <b>equid</b> TERC sequences, which revealed nucleotide differences in key regions for TERC and TERT interaction. We then succeeded in immortalizing <b>equid</b> fibroblasts by expressing hTERT and hTERC con-comitantly. Expression of both human telomerase subunits led to telomerase activity and telomere elongation, indicat-ing that human telomerase is compatible with the other <b>equid</b> telomerase subunits and proteins involved in telomere metabolism. The immortalization procedure described here-in could be extended to primary cells from other mammals. The availability of immortal cells from endangered species could be particularly useful for obtaining new information on the organization and function of their genomes, which is relevant for their preservation...|$|R

25|$|Horse {{bones were}} rare or absent in Neolithic and Chalcolithic kitchen garbage in western Turkey, Mesopotamia, most of Iran, South and Central Asia, {{and much of}} Europe. While horse bones have been {{identified}} in Neolithic sites in central Turkey, all <b>equids</b> together totaled less than 3% of the animal bones. Within this three percent, horses were less than 10%, with 90% or more of the <b>equids</b> represented by onagers (Equus hemionus) or another ass-like equid that later became extinct, Equus hydruntinus. Onagers were the most common native wild <b>equids</b> of the Near East. They were hunted in Syria, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Iran, and Central Asia; and domesticated asses (Equus asinus) were imported into Mesopotamia, probably from Egypt, but wild horses apparently did not live there.|$|E

40|$|Many faunal assemblages across {{southwest}} Asia {{contain the}} remains of multiple wild <b>equid</b> species, which may reflect individual prehistoric human populations’ use of different hunting and/or landscape exploitation strategies.

Seven zooarchaeologists individually use published criteria to assign species to <b>equid</b> teeth from Neolithic Çatalhöyük in central Anatolia, then use Fleiss’ kappa to measure our reliability of agreement. We assess our degrees of agreement for species assignments made using scanned images versus actual specimens and for mandibular teeth versus maxillary teeth.

25|$|In the mid-Eocene, about 47 {{million years}} ago, Epihippus, a genus which {{continued}} the evolutionary trend of increasingly efficient grinding teeth, evolved from Orohippus. Epihippus had five grinding, low-crowned cheek teeth with well-formed crests. A late species of Epihippus, {{sometimes referred to}} as Duchesnehippus intermedius, had teeth similar to Oligocene <b>equids,</b> although slightly less developed. Whether Duchesnehippus was a subgenus of Epihippus or a distinct genus is disputed. Epihippus was only 2 feet tall.|$|E
