500|$|Filming for Crossroads {{initiated}} in March 2001 in Baton Rouge and Hammond, Louisiana, near Spears' hometown. Due {{to the fact}} that Spears was also recording her third studio album along with the film's production, filming only wrapped up after six months. Additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Crossroads had a total budget of $10 million; a relatively low budget by industry standards. According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled What Friends are For. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film's content, saying that it [...] "is about this journey that the three of us best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and getting our friendship back. Friends are all you have {{at the end of the}} day. When your boyfriend breaks up with you, who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>call?</b> Your girlfriend. I just love that message." ...|$|E

"Work" [...] was {{positively}} reviewed by writers of Entertainment Weekly; Kyle Anderson opined that the track was [...] "a thoroughbred {{entry in the}} song of summer race", while Ray Rahman called it a [...] "bulletproof party banger". Devone Jones of PopMatters viewed Azalea's [...] "sombre thought-processing" [...] as [...] "well-executed", and appreciated her for [...] "picking gritty [...] beats over EDM and dance music as well as deciding to rap about her life before her new-found fame as opposed to her fame". Likewise, Craig Mathieson of The Sydney Morning Herald explained that the song highlighted Azalea's [...] "ability to meld the club music sounds that are permeating American hip-hop and pop into something unexpected and affecting". In an October 2013 publication, Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that [...] "Work" [...] was [...] "ear-catching", and contained Azalea's [...] "best-known zing"; [...] "Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins / What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> that? / Head over heels?". In 2014, Nolan Feeney of Time said [...] "Work" [...] was [...] "by far the best thing she's done", and highlighted Azalea's conviction and [...] "rapid-fire" [...] delivery, while Digital Spy's Lewis Corner felt the song [...] "remains one of [...] finest moments". In 2015, NME ranked [...] "Work" [...] third in their list of Azalea's best songs, behind [...] "Fancy" [...] and [...] "1 800 Bone".|$|E

2500|$|Brummell {{put into}} {{practice}} the principles of harmony of shape and contrast of colours with such a pleasing result that men of superior rank sought his opinion on their dress. [...] The Duke of Bedford once did this touching a coat. Brummell examined his Grace with the cool impertinence which was his Grace’s due. He turned him about, scanned him with scrutinizing, contemptuous eye, and then taking the lapel between his dainty finger and thumb, he exclaimed {{in a tone of}} pitying wonder, “Bedford, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> this thing a coat?” His personal habits, such as a fastidious attention to cleaning his teeth, shaving, and daily bathing exerted an influence on the ton - the upper echelons of polite society - who began to do likewise. Enthralled, the Prince would spend hours in Brummell's dressing room, witnessing the progress of his friend's lengthy morning toilette.|$|E
2500|$|In uncharacteristically bold discussions {{after dinner}} Darwin asked his guests [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> yourselves Atheists?" [...] When they {{responded that they}} [...] "did not commit the folly of god-denial, [...] avoided with equal care the folly of god-assertion", Darwin gave a {{thoughtful}} response, concluding that [...] "I am with you in thought, but I should prefer the word Agnostic to the word Atheist." [...] Aveling replied that, [...] "after all, 'Agnostic' was but 'Atheist' writ respectable, and 'Atheist' was only 'Agnostic' writ aggressive." [...] Darwin smiled and responded [...] "Why should you be so aggressive? Is anything gained by trying to force these new ideas upon the mass of mankind? It is all very well for educated, cultured, thoughtful people; but are the masses yet ripe for it?" [...] Aveling and Büchner questioned {{what would have happened}} if Darwin had been given that advice before publication of the Origin, and had confined [...] "the revolutionary truths of Natural and Sexual Selection to the judicious few", where would the world be? Many feared danger if new ideas were [...] "proclaimed abroad on the house-tops, and discussed in market-place and home. But he, happily for humanity, had by the gentle, irresistible power of reason, forced his new ideas upon the mass of the people. And the masses had been found ripe for it. Had he kept silence, the tremendous strides taken by human thought during the last twenty-one years would have been shorn of their fair proportions, perhaps had hardly been made at all. His own illustrious example was encouragement, was for a command to every thinker to make known to all his fellows that which he believed to be the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{comment was}} brought up again in an {{interview}} with Amy Goodman for Democracy Now! in 2006. In January 2006, Belafonte led a delegation of activists including actor Danny Glover and activist/professor Cornel West to meet with President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. In 2005, Chávez, an outspoken Bush critic, initiated a program to provide cheaper heating oil for poor people in several areas of the United States. Belafonte supported this initiative. He was quoted as saying, during the meeting with Chávez, [...] "No matter what the greatest tyrant in the world, the greatest terrorist in the world, George W. Bush says, we're here to tell you: Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of the American people support your revolution." [...] Belafonte and Glover met again with Chávez in 2006. The comment ignited a great deal of controversy. Hillary Clinton refused to acknowledge Belafonte's presence at an awards ceremony that featured both of them. AARP, which had just named him one of its 10 Impact Award honorees 2006, released this statement following the remarks: [...] "AARP does not condone the manner and tone which he has chosen and finds his comments completely unacceptable." [...] During a Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at Duke University in 2006, Belafonte compared the American government to the hijackers of the September 11 attacks, saying: [...] "What is the difference between that terrorist and other terrorists?" [...] In response to criticism about his remarks Belafonte asked, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> Bush when the war he put us in to date has killed almost as many Americans as died on 9/11 and the number of Americans wounded in war is almost triple? [...] By most definitions Bush can be considered a terrorist." [...] When he was asked about his expectation of criticism for his remarks on the war in Iraq, Belafonte responded: [...] "Bring it on. Dissent is central to any democracy." ...|$|E
