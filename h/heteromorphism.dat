40|$|International audienceSperm {{competition}} theory {{predicts that}} males should produce many, similar sperm. However, in some species {{of animals and}} plants, males exhibit a <b>heteromorphism</b> that results {{in the production of}} at least two different types of sperm or pollen grains. In animals, sperm <b>heteromorphism</b> typically corresponds to the production of one fertile morph and one (or more) sterile morph(s), whereas in plants two or more pollen morphs (one of which can be either sterile or fertile) are produced in all flowers but sometimes in different anthers. <b>Heteromorphism</b> has arisen independently several times across phyla and at different phylogenetic levels. Here, we compare and contrast sperm and pollen <b>heteromorphism</b> and discuss the evolutionary hypotheses suggested to explain <b>heteromorphism</b> in these taxa. These hypotheses include facilitation, nutritive contribution, blocking, cheap filler, sperm flushing or killing for animals; outcrossing and precise cross-pollen transfer or bet-hedging strategy for plants; cryptic female choice for both. We conclude that <b>heteromorphism</b> in the two phyla is most likely linked to a general evolutionary response to sexual selection, either to increase one male's sperm or pollen success in competition with other males, or mediate male/female interactions. Therefore, although sperm and pollen are not homologous, we suggest that <b>heteromorphism</b> represents an example of convergence across kingdoms...|$|E

40|$|Times Cited: 3 Cited Reference Count: 32 International audienceVariation in {{the number}} of pollen {{apertures}} has been widely described among and within angiosperm species. Apertures are weak points of the pollen wall where the pollen tube germinates. Pollen aperture <b>heteromorphism</b> (pollen grains with different numbers of apertures in a single individual) is common in flowering plants, whereas polymorphism (among-individual variation) is rare. Previous work on Viola has shown that pollen with few apertures has a better survival rate, whereas pollen with more apertures germinates faster. Here we develop game-theoretic models of competition between several pollen donors. These show that <b>heteromorphism</b> can be a stable strategy for all finite numbers of competitors per stigma for some parameter values where one pollen type germinates faster but has lower longevity. In contrast, polymorphism is not stable in pairwise contests (two pollen donors). When more than two pollen donors interact on stigmas, polymorphism can be stable for certain parameter values. In both <b>heteromorphism</b> and polymorphism, selection operating on the number of pollen apertures is an example of soft selection if each flower in a population produces a fixed number of seeds, regardless of the average fitness of the particular pollen composition present on its stigma. This results in stigma-level and population-level frequency dependence, which makes stable <b>heteromorphism</b> and polymorphism possible. Selective scenarios vary among stigmas due to variation in the pollen present. Thus, a particular pollen type may be more fit than average on some stigmas but less fit on others. As a pollen strategy increases in frequency in a population, the frequency of different kinds of pollen contests shift. This may result in the pollen strategy's fitness advantage being lost at an intermediate frequency, resulting in <b>heteromorphism</b> or polymorphism. Low numbers of pollen donors per stigma result in greater variance in pollen composition among stigmas, resulting in a broader parameter range for stable <b>heteromorphism</b> or polymorphism. For any number of pollen donors per stigma, the conditions for polymorphism are a more restrictive subset of those for <b>heteromorphism.</b> We show that <b>heteromorphism</b> can invade a polymorphic population, whereas <b>heteromorphism</b> is stable against polymorphism, thus explaining why polymorphic species are rare...|$|E

The results of the molecular and cytogenetic studies of parental origin concurred in all cases in which assignments were made independently using both techniques. However, in 4 of 13 cases in which the molecular studies contributed to the interpretation of the cytogenetic findings, the two results did not agree with respect to the meiotic stage of nondisjunction. A relatively high frequency of crossing-over on either the short arm or proximal long arm of chromosome 21 could explain these results and may be a mechanism leading to nondisjunction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The tufted capuchin, Cebus apella is a New World Monkey (NWM) species {{widely used}} in biomedicine. Its genetic {{variability}} has been assessed through various genetic tools. The present study offers a cytogenetic charac-terization of two captive colonies of Paraguayan specimens, {{in order to increase}} the current information on the role of cytogenetic polymorphisms in management of captive capuchins, specially useful for those employed as biomedi-cal models. G-banding confirms all individual as Cebus apella paraguayanus (CAPp). C- banding shows heterochro-matic polymorphisms already published for this species, and a paracentric inversion of the interstitial heterochroma-tin of pair 12, with members of this pair remaining of equal size in all the sample. A retrospective study of C-band polymorphisms in captive CAPp individuals shows a great number of <b>heteromorphisms,</b> considering not only pres-ence/absence of a particular band, but also size and amount of heterochromatin. Therefore, two types of heterochro-matic <b>heteromorphisms</b> have been observed (distributional, with a paracentric inversion but no apparent loss of het-erochromatin, and quantitative, with a drastic reduction of one homologue’s band, therefore on its total size) sug-gesting complex chromatin rearrangements for Paraguayan populations, and supporting the idea that Cebus is, among the NWM, perhaps the best model to analyze heterochromatin behavior...|$|R

Despite its wide {{geographical}} distribution in Argentina, few individuals {{have been studied}} on the cytogenetic level and only through conventional staining. In this work, chromosome characterization of Argentine samples of this species was performed using solid staining, C-banding and base-specific fluorochromes. Twenty two specimens were analyzed, collected in the provinces of Jujuy, Catamarca, and {{the north and south}} of Mendoza. All studied specimens showed 2 n= 38, having mostly the bi-armed autosomes, metacentric or submetacentric. Fundamental Number varied between 70 and 72. These changes were due to the presence of chromosome <b>heteromorphisms</b> in individuals from southern Mendoza and Jujuy. C-banding revealed pericentromeric blocks of constitutive heterochromatin in most chromosomes. Acrocentric chromosomes involved in <b>heteromorphisms</b> showed high variation in the amount of heterochromatin within and among populations. Additionally, banding with fluorochromes (DAPI and chromomycin A 3) revealed homologous localization of AT and GC rich regions among chromosomes of the different populations analyzed. Comparisons among heteromorphic pairs suggested, however, that the variation might be the result of complex chromosome rearrangements, involving possibly amplifications and/or deletions of heterochromatic segments. These results are in accordance with molecular studies that indicate genetic variability within and among the populations of this taxon...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This study is a cross sectional descriptive study which have investigated 75 couples who had three abortions or more, and 65 couples who had two abortions that referred by gynecologist to the lab of Beheshti Hospital in Hamedan for cytogenetical investigation. Also 40 healthy individuals without history of abortion investigated as control group. GTG bonding technique (staining banding with gymsa and trypsin) is used in this study.

There is a significant variation in the proportions of the two pollen types among cultivars (genetic component), but also (with a much lower component of variance) within each cultivar, between plants (genets), flowers of a plant, and even anthers of a flower. This is interpreted as a release of the selective pressure: the cultivars of N. tabacum were obtained after several generations of selfing and are themselves selfers.
