5|$|Given this, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> {{that the}} Cypria—the {{part of the}} Epic Cycle that covers {{the period of the}} Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate,</b> indeed, {{that the}} United Nations has been prematurely hoodwinked into the {{recognition}} of one Namibian tribal faction as 'the sole authentic representative' group of all Namibians {{at the expense of}} the majority of the people.|$|E
25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As {{a member of the}} House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Goryeo (Koryo) {{architecture}} {{is defined as}} the period between the 10th century and the 14th century. Much of the architecture in this period was related to religion and influenced by political power/ kingdom. Many buildings such as magnificent Buddhist temples and pagodas were developed based on religious needs, as Buddhism {{played an important role in}} the culture and society at the time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that little has survived to the present day, since most of the architecture from this period was built of wood. Also, the capital of the Goryeo dynasty was based in Gaesong, a city in modern-day North Korea. Its location has made it difficult for many historians in South Korea to study and analyze the architecture of this era.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as {{a great example of}} devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the greatest}} Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality that in those times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. Like a true Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that a person as noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, and that was how his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E

500|$|The {{referendum}} {{was held}} in Sjöbo on 18 September 1988, {{the day of the}} Swedish general election, and passed with a 67 percent majority of the votes (6,237 for and 3,000 against), which led to even more criticism from the Swedish population. Then-Prime Minister of Sweden Ingvar Carlsson said the results were [...] "tragic", and the then-leader of the Centre Party, Olof Johansson, called the ban [...] "improper". The result of the referendum led to concerns from the Swedish government that other municipalities would follow in Sjöbo's footsteps. The day after the vote, Madeleine Ramel commented: [...] "This is a sad result. Everyone is a loser. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> for Sjöbo." ...|$|E
500|$|Manga Sanctuary {{praised the}} protagonist for being {{original}} and unique. It criticized {{the fact that}} the reader does not have access to some facts that could help to solve the mysteries. The reviewer said <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> because the readers feels passive, which is not desirable in a crime series. However, Manga News said that this impassivity is good because it is what differentiates Neuro from Case Closed. Its design, setting, the [...] "interesting and well-constructed characters", and the development of the relationship between Neuro and Yako were also praised. The reviewer said the series is [...] "completely apart in the world of manga, Neuro is a genre unto itself which is between several styles and therefore appeal to a wider audience." [...] Animelands critic also compared it to Case Closed, but said its black humor, cruel and deadpan laughs were [...] "quite caustic." ...|$|E
500|$|Erotica {{remains the}} most rampantly {{misrepresented}} Madonna album with the biggest backlash of her career. Taraborrelli commented that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that Erotica has to be historically linked to other less memorable ventures in Madonna's career at this time. However, he quipped that the album should be considered on its own merits, not only as one linked {{to the other two}} adult-oriented projects, because it has true value. When asked to name her biggest professional disappointment, Madonna answered, [...] "The fact that my Erotica album was overlooked because of the whole thing with the Sex book. It just got lost in all that. I think there's some brilliant songs on it and people didn't give it a chance." [...] Brian McNair observed that Madonna took a financial risk with the album and it was not until Ray of Light (1998) that her record sales recovered to pre-Erotica levels. He further asserted that [...] "what she lost in royalty payments, however, Madonna more than made up for in iconic status and cultural influence." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> {{that the}} value of k in Corollary 1 is {{generally}} much larger than the tree width of H (a notable exception is when H = K4, the complete graph on four vertices, for which k=3).

2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> {{that the}} latest round of [...] "Humans vs. Zombies" [...] was playing itself out {{on the day of the}} events at Virginia Tech, and it is true that the student {{organizers}} of the game must be more vigilant about keeping it from interfering with classes and disrupting the daily lives of those who would prefer not to be involved in it. We are working with them to assess the game and its future at Goucher.|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> for historians {{that the}} stones rarely reveal {{where the men}} died. On the Smula Runestone in Västergötland, we are {{informed}} only that they died during a war campaign in the East: [...] "Gulli/Kolli raised this stone in memory of his wife's brothers Ásbjôrn and Juli, very good valiant men. And they died in the east in the retinue". Another runemaster in the same province laconically states on the Dalum Runestone: [...] "Tóki and his brothers raised this stone in memory of their brothers. One died in the west, another in the east".|$|E
2500|$|Shaw {{was one of}} the few cricketers of {{his time}} whose Christian name was used more {{frequently}} than his initials. Standing only 5'6½" [...] tall, he put on copious weight near the end of his career, when his naturally corpulent build was dramatically accentuated. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate,</b> therefore, that most photographs of him were taken so late in his cricketing life. A man of droopy aspect, bushed eyes, some classically Victorian facial hair and a belt nearer his breast than his substantial waist, he did not look the part of the era's finest medium-pacer, but there were few who questioned his credentials.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, former BBC {{journalist}} Andrea Wills {{conducted an}} {{audit of the}} ABC radio's federal election coverage. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that Spencer wished Kevin Rudd [...] "best of luck {{in the rest of}} the campaign" [...] ahead of the election.|$|R

[...] "At a moment when Equatorial Guinea desperately needs to move from {{dictatorship}} to democracy and {{at a moment when}} we in Equatorial Guinea and beyond should be concerned with political and economic reforms that would transform the riches of our nations into sustainable economic development for all, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> to see the CAF and other institutions acting in complicity with the government of Equatorial Guinea to entrench corruption and bad governance," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Since he is a Christian {{as well as}} a {{historian}} of science and a cosmologist, Gingerich has been asked several times to comment on matters concerning the interplay between science and faith. One of these, Intelligent design, he calls an issue with “immense incomprehension from both the friends and foes.” On the one hand, he says that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that {{there seems to be a}} knee-jerk reaction among its critics that I.D. is simply Young Earth creationism in disguise. On the other hand, he says that, while I.D. supporters make a good case for a coherent understanding of the nature of the cosmos, ...|$|E
2500|$|When Lu Ji {{sensed that}} {{his death was}} imminent, he wrote, [...] "During the Han dynasty, there lived Lu Ji, a man from Wu Commandery who had lofty ambitions. When he was young, he read the Classic of Poetry and Book of Documents. When he reached adulthood, he was already very {{familiar}} with the Classic of Rites and Yi Jing. He received orders to lead a military campaign to the south, but was struck by illness. How unfortunate his life was! He died with regrets and sorrow!" [...] He also wrote, [...] "About more than 60 years from now, vehicles {{will be able to}} travel on the same roads, and books will be written in the same script. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that I {{will not be able to}} witness that."
