40|$|Accurate <b>electric</b> <b>load</b> {{forecasting}} {{has become}} the most important issue in energy management; however, <b>electric</b> <b>load</b> demonstrates a seasonal/cyclic tendency from economic activities or the cyclic nature of climate. The applications of the support vector regression (SVR) model to deal with seasonal/cyclic <b>electric</b> <b>load</b> forecasting have not been widely explored. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a SVR model which combines the seasonal adjustment mechanism and a chaotic immune algorithm (namely SSVRCIA) to forecast monthly <b>electric</b> <b>loads.</b> Based on the operation procedure of the immune algorithm (IA), if the population diversity of an initial population cannot be maintained under selective pressure, then IA could only seek for the solutions in the narrow space and the solution is far from the global optimum (premature convergence).

A numerical example from an existing reference is used to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed SSVRCIA model.

40|$|Whole-building <b>electric</b> <b>load</b> {{data can}} often reveal {{problems}} with building equipment or operations. In this paper, we present methods for analyzing 15 -minute-interval <b>electric</b> <b>load</b> data. These methods allow building operators, energy managers, and commissioning agents {{to better understand}} a building's electricity consumption over time and {{to compare it to}} other buildings, helping them to 'ask the right questions' to discover opportunities for electricity waste elimination, energy efficiency, peak load management, and demand response. For example: Does the building use too much energy at night, or on hot days, or in the early evening? Knowing the answer to questions like these can help with retro-commissioning or continuous commissioning. The methods discussed here {{can also be used to}} assess how building energy performance varies with time. Comparing <b>electric</b> <b>load</b> before and after fixing equipment or changing operations can help verify that the fixes have the intended effect on energy consumption. Analysis methods discussed in this paper include: ways to graphically represent <b>electric</b> <b>load</b> data; the definition of various parameters that characterize facility electricity loads; and a regression-based electricity load model that accounts for both time of week and outdoor air temperature. The methods are illustrated by applying them to data from commercial buildings. We demonstrate the ability to recognize changes in building operation, and to quantify changes in energy performance. Some key findings are: 1) Plotting time series <b>electric</b> <b>load</b> data is useful for understanding electricity consumption patterns and changes to those patterns, but results may be misleading if data from different time intervals are not weather-normalized. 2) Parameter plots can highlight key features of <b>electric</b> <b>load</b> data and may be easier to interpret than plots of time series data themselves. 3) A time-of-week indicator variable (as compared to time-of-day and day-of-week indicator variables) improves the accuracy of regression models of <b>electric</b> <b>load.</b> 4) A piecewise linear and continuous outdoor air temperature dependence can be derived without the use of a change-point model (which would add complexity to the modeling algorithm) or assumptions about when structural changes occur (which could introduce inaccuracy). 5) A model that includes time-of-week and temperature dependence can be used for weather normalization and can determine whether the building is unusually temperature-sensitive, which can indicate problems with HVAC operation...|$|R
