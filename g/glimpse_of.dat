5|$|In the Agni Purana, as the enchanted Shiva follows Mohini, {{drops of}} his semen {{falls on the}} ground and become lingas, Shiva's symbols.

Shiva Purana says that by the mere <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> Mohini, Shiva spurts out his seed. The seed was {{collected}} and poured into the ear of Anjani, who gave birth to Hanuman, the incarnation of Shiva. The latter is retold in the Thai and Malaysian version of the Ramayana. Though Hanuman strings from Shiva's seed, he is also considered as a combined son of Vishnu and Shiva.|$|E

5|$|Selvo {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first Doge {{in the history of}} Venice whose {{election}} was recorded by an eyewitness, a parish priest of the church of San Michele Archangelo by the name of Domenico Tino.

Over the previous two centuries, the rule of quasi-tyrannies had plagued the popular belief that Venetians held democratic control over their leaders. The events of Selvo's election occurred in the spring of 1071, when the nearly thirty-year reign of Doge Domenico Contarini came to an end upon his death.|$|E
