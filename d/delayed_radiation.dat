50|$|Delayed gamma {{emissions}} {{are the most}} common form of <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> but are not the only form. It is common for the short-lived isotopes to have delayed emissions of various particles. In these cases it is commonly called a beta-delayed emission. This is because the decay is delayed until a beta decay takes place. For instance nitrogen-17 emits two beta-delayed neutrons after its primary beta emission. Just as in the above delayed gamma emission, the nitrogen is not the actual source of the neutrons, a short lived isotope of oxygen is.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} timing of salvage and adjuvant radiation therapy on outcomes after prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, we identified prostate cancer patients diagnosed during 1995 - 2007 who had one or more adverse pathological features after prostatectomy. The final cohort of 6, 137 eligible patients included men who received prostatectomy alone (n = 4, 509) or with adjuvant (n = 894) or salvage (n = 734) radiation therapy. Primary outcomes were genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and erectile dysfunction events and survival after treatment(s). Radiation therapy after prostatectomy was associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal and genitourinary events, but not erectile dysfunction. In adjusted models, earlier treatment with adjuvant radiation therapy {{was not associated with}} increased rates of genitourinary or erectile dysfunction events compared to <b>delayed</b> salvage <b>radiation</b> therapy. Early adjuvant radiation therapy was associated with lower rates of gastrointestinal events that salvage radiation therapy, with hazard ratios of 0. 80 (95 % CI, 0. 67 - 0. 95) for procedure-defined and 0. 70 (95 % CI, 0. 59, 0. 83) for diagnosis-defined events.

5000|$|By the 1950s, around 5,500 {{targets were}} listed to receive SAC bomber strikes; these targets {{consisted}} primarily of industrial sites but included counterforce targets.

5000|$|However, {{this picture}} is not complete, as it neglects {{retardation}} effects {{due to the}} finite cavity photon decay rate [...] The force follows {{the motion of the}} mirror only with some time delay. This leads to effects such as friction. For example, let us assume the equilibrium position sit somewhere on the rising slope of the resonance. In thermal equilibrium, there will be oscillations around this position, which do not follow the shape of the resonance because of retardation. The consequence of this <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> force during one cycle of oscillation turns out to be that work is carried out, in this particular case it is negative,, i.e. the radiation force extracts mechanical energy (there is extra, light-induced damping). This can be used to cool down the mechanical motion and is referred to as optical or optomechanical cooling. It is important for reaching the quantum regime of the mechanical oscillator where thermal noise effects on the device become negligible. Similarly, if the equilibrium position sits on the falling slope of the cavity resonance, the work is positive and the mechanical motion is amplified. In this case the extra, light-induced damping is negative and leads to amplification of the mechanical motion (heating). Radiation-induced damping of this kind has first been observed in pioneering experiments by Braginsky and coworkers in 1970.|$|E

25|$|In a reactor {{that has}} been {{operating}} for some time, the radioactive fission products will have built up to steady state concentrations such that their rate of decay is equal to their rate of formation, so that their fractional total contribution to reactor heat (via beta decay) {{is the same as}} these radioisotopic fractional contributions to the energy of fission. Under these conditions, the 6.5% of fission which appears as <b>delayed</b> ionizing <b>radiation</b> (<b>delayed</b> gammas and betas from radioactive fission products) contributes to the steady-state reactor heat production under power. It is this output fraction which remains when the reactor is suddenly shut down (undergoes scram). For this reason, the reactor decay heat output begins at 6.5% of the full reactor steady state fission power, once the reactor is shut down. However, within hours, due to decay of these isotopes, the decay power output is far less. See decay heat for detail.|$|R

30|$|Late <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> injury, on {{the other}} hand, {{is a much more}} serious form of injury due to a {{combination}} of vascular and glial injury resulting in irreversible and progressive white matter necrosis. The exact mechanism through which this occurs is not well understood but thought to be due to either vascular endothelial injury or direct parenchymal injury [29]. The vascular hypothesis of late <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> injury supposes that radiation induces structural changes in the vasculature (vessel wall thickening, wall dilatation, and endothelial cell nuclear enlargement), which in turn leads to ischaemia and white matter necrosis. In addition, animal models have shown that there is a quantitative decrease in vessel density after radiation [30], which in turn increases the risk for white matter ischaemia. The parenchymal hypothesis of late <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> injury supposes that radiation induces direct injury to various parenchymal cell lines, in particular oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Shinohara et al. demonstrated that radiation induces loss of the oligodendrocyte type- 2 astrocyte (O- 2 A) progenitor cells, preventing the formation of mature oligodendrocytes and ultimately resulting in demyelination and white matter necrosis [31]. Hwang et al. demonstrated that radiation induces microglial activation, which in turns induces astrocyte expression of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), stimulating gliosis, and brain oedema [32]. Rosi et al. demonstrated that hippocampal neurons in mice exposed to radiation significantly decreased expression of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) protein resulting in neuronal dysfunction and suspected cognitive impairment [33]. Although not well understood, it is reasonable to surmise that late <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> injury actually results from a complex interaction between both vascular and parenchymal dysfunction, although more study is needed to further define this dynamic process.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe EORTC/RTOG {{late effects}} {{classification}} {{has been used}} for many years and covers nearly all organs and tissues, which may develop late radiation injuries. Dische developed a scoring system for radiation toxicity in which each clinical sign or symptom, that is characteristic for disturbance of function in an irradiated organ, is given scores for severity individually. EORTC and RTOG formed working groups to up-date their systems, for the recording of late injury to normal tissues, to be used in future clinical trials. The resulting system is called LENT-SOMA (1993). AimIn preparation for the introduction of the LENT-SOMA scale into clinical practice at the Centre of Oncology-Institute in Gliwice, we followed a sizeable cohort of patients using two scoring systems for the assessment of <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> toxicity at each follow-up examination which took place every 6 months for up to 5 years after curative radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Materials/MethodsThe analysed material comprised of 113 patients with oral cavity, pharyngeal or supraglottic cancer (T 2 - 4 N 0 - 1) irradiated by conventional methods (18 patients), continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR) (52 patients) or concomitant boost (CB) (43 patients). Total dose was in the range of 66 – 74 Gy. <b>Delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> toxicity was evaluated by two classification systems, those of Dische and LENT-SOMA, in the mucosal membranes, skin, larynx, salivary glands and spinal cord every 6 months after completion of radiotherapy treatment. The values in every scale were normalised (as a proportion of the maximum intensity for all symptoms) which permitted statistical comparison of the scales by use of the Wilcoxon test. ResultsAnalysis of all materials indicated a difference in the intensity of late radiation toxicity as estimated by the Dische and LENT-SOMA scales. The intensity of <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> toxicity in the normalised Dische scale, for mucosal membranes and for skin, had higher values than observed in the LENT-SOMA system for the majority of examined patients. In the case of the larynx and salivary glands, the opposite situation was noted. The extent of conformity between normalised scales was evaluated {{in the case of the}} spinal cord. ConclusionsThe scoring systems of Dische and LENT-SOMA can not be interchangeably used, in clinical practice, for the estimation of <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> toxicity in tissues of the head and neck region. The sensitivity of the scoring systems is similar only for the evaluation of radiation reactions in spinal cord...|$|E

Initial radiological differentiation between scar formation, altered tissue and true recurrence can therefore be challenging. Furthermore, mammography yield during the first months after surgery/radiation therapy appears to be low [29, 30].

Markiewicz (1935) and Scholz and Hsll (1938) described delayed necrosis occurring eighteen months after the last exposure of the brain to irradiation. In the former paper it was for the treatment of a skin disease. A full description of the pathological findings in <b>delayed</b> <b>radiation</b> necrosis of the brain in man was given by Pennybacker and Russell (1948). Almost all the publications to date are concerned with changes following the experimental irradiation of animals or the irradiation of gliomas or skin tumours in man. This paper, however, is concerned with delayed necrosis of the brain in man following the irradiation of pituitary tumours. This complication of X-ray therapy to the pituitary {{does not appear to have}} been fully described before. Irradiation of pituitary adenomata is a therapeutic method of a long history and acknowledged value. It was practised by Cushing in the earlier part of the century and Henderson (1939), in a review of Cushing's series of cases, found that post-operative X-radiation increased the number of patients surviving five years without recurrence. Harvey Jackson (1958) stated that, in his experience, cases receiving post-operative X-ray therapy have a more lasting recovery than those receiving surgery alone. It is only recently in the literature, however, that the danger of delayed necrosis following therapeutic irradiation of pituitary tumours, has been recognized.

Twenty-three patients took part in this protocol, the BSG 98 protocol, which consisted of frontline chemotherapy alternating hematotoxic and nonhematotoxic schedules. Each cycle included three courses delivered monthly; the first course was 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea– cisplatin, and the second and third were high-dose methotrexate. Three patients underwent one cycle; 5 patients each, two and three cycles; and 10 patients, four cycles. Twenty of the 23 patients eventually received local radiation therapy. A historical cohort of 14 patients who received at least local radiation therapy served as controls.

40|$|PurposeWe {{compared}} {{proton beam therapy}} (PBT) with intensity modulated {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT) for pediatric craniopharyngioma in terms of disease control, cyst dynamics, and toxicity. Methods and MaterialsWe reviewed records from 52 children treated with PBT (n= 21) or IMRT (n= 31) at 2 institutions from 1996 - 2012. Endpoints were overall survival (OS), disease control, cyst dynamics, and toxicity. ResultsAt 59. 6 months' median follow-up (PBT 33 mo vs IMRT 106 mo; P<. 001), the 3 -year outcomes were 96 % for OS, 95 % for nodular failure-free survival and 76 % for cystic failure-free survival. Neither OS nor disease control differed between treatment groups (OS P=. 742; nodular failure-free survival P=. 546; cystic failure-free survival P=. 994). During therapy, 40 % of patients had cyst growth (20 % requiring intervention); immediately after therapy, 17 patients (33 %) had cyst growth (transient in 14), more commonly in the IMRT group (42 % vs 19 % PBT; P=. 082); and 27 % experienced late cyst growth (32 % IMRT, 19 % PBT; P=. 353), with intervention required in 40 %. Toxicity did not differ between groups. On multivariate analysis, cyst growth was related to visual and hypothalamic toxicity (P=. 009 and. 04, respectively). Patients given radiation as salvage therapy (for recurrence) rather than adjuvant therapy had higher rates of visual and endocrine (P=. 017 and. 024, respectively) dysfunction.
