25|$|Player {{characters}} {{can often}} restore their health points by consuming certain items, {{such as health}} potions, food or <b>first-aid</b> <b>kits.</b> Staying a night at an inn fully restores a character's health in many role-playing video games. In general, the different methods of regenerating health has its uses in a particular genre. In action games, this method is very quick, whereas role-playing games feature slower paced methods to match the gameplay and realism.|$|E
500|$|People {{from the}} nearby {{settlement}} of Valemount hurried to the scene and found the troop cars damaged beyond recognition. Some had collapsed in the disaster; rescuers used axes and hammers to break into them. There were no medical supplies aboard the troop train, and the only medical officer on board had disembarked in Edmonton. <b>First-aid</b> <b>kits</b> on that train proved empty; a box labelled [...] "Medical Stores" [...] was found to contain only contraceptives.|$|E
500|$|Along with weapons, {{the player}} {{collects}} {{items such as}} dermal patches and <b>first-aid</b> <b>kits.</b> Dermal patches provide the character with beneficial effects—such as regeneration or increased melee attack power—but can cause detrimental side-effects, such as fatigue and distorted color perception. Attachable [...] "hardware" [...] may also be found, including energy shields and head-mounted lanterns. Increasingly advanced versions of this hardware may be obtained as the game progresses. When activated, most hardware drains from a main energy reserve, which necessitates economization. Certain hardware displays the effectiveness of attacks when active, with messages such as [...] "Normal damage". When an enemy is attacked, the damage is calculated by armor absorption, vulnerabilities, critical hits and a degree of randomness. Weapons and munitions deal specific kinds of damage, and certain enemies are immune, or more vulnerable, to particular types. For example, electromagnetic pulse weapons heavily damage robots, but do not affect mutants. Conversely, gas grenades are effective against mutants, but do not damage robots.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{focuses on}} {{cooperation}} and teamwork and thus eschews some [...] "realism" [...] conventions usual in most FPS {{games of the}} wider genre; colored outlines of teammates are visible through walls to help players stick together and coordinate their movement. If a survivor falls off a ledge, then they may automatically hang onto it and can only be helped up by another survivor. If a survivor's health is depleted, then they become incapacitated and can only be revived by another survivor, at which point they continue playing with a low amount of health that decreases over time. If a survivor has been incapacitated and revived twice without tending to their wounds, then they will experience distorted black-and-white vision, and the next incapacitation will kill the character. If a survivor takes enough damage while incapacitated, or is not eventually helped up by teammates, then the incapacitated character will die. [...] During [...] "Campaign" [...] mode, if a survivor is killed, then they will respawn in a closet or other enclosed space {{after a period of}} time (except during key points in the scenario), but must be freed by another survivor to rejoin the team. Otherwise, the player must wait until the next level. However, if all human player survivors are killed or incapacitated, players will have to restart from the last checkpoint. Survivors can share <b>first-aid</b> <b>kits</b> and pain pills and help each other heal. Left 4 Dead has friendly fire (which causes no damage on the easy difficulty mode), increasing the need for caution around other survivors.|$|E
2500|$|US Secretary of State John Kerry said on 7 April 2014 {{that the}} events [...] "did {{not appear to be}} spontaneous" [...] and called on Russia to [...] "publicly disavow the {{activities}} of separatists, saboteurs and provocateurs" [...] in a phone call to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. A spokeswoman for the US National Security Council noted that the separatists appeared to be supported by Russia. [...] "We saw similar so-called protest activities in Crimea before Russia's purported annexation," [...] she said in a statement, adding: [...] "We call on President (Vladimir) Putin and his government to cease all efforts to destabilize Ukraine, and we caution against further military intervention." [...] American ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey R. Pyatt characterised the pro-Russian insurgents as [...] "terrorists". [...] The US government is sending military advisors to Ukraine to aid the Ukrainian government in its fight against the insurgents. In April, the US Defence Department shipped a 7 million US dollar package of non-lethal military equipment to the Ukrainian forces. Plans for another 8 million dollar aid package were announced on 1 August 2014. The package was meant to include armoured personnel carriers, goods and patrol vehicles, binoculars, night vision goggles and small patrol boats. On the same day, the Defence Department also proposed a $19 million aid package to help train the National Guard of Ukraine. [...] This proposal required congressional approval, and would come into effect in 2015. It had been announced in July that a group of Defence Department specialists in strategy and policy would visit Kiev to evaluate the military needs of the Ukrainian government. On 8 September 2014, The New York Times reported that only a portion of the initial non-lethal aid package had actually arrived in Ukraine. While this report cited concerns about provoking escalation in the region as the reason for the delay, a 13 September 2014 report by The Globe and Mail cited various sources that indicated that both the American package and a $200 million Canadian military aid package were delayed by concerns about diversion of saleable equipment due to corruption among Ukrainian officials. On 11 March 2015, the American government said it would send an additional 75 million US dollars worth of non-lethal aid to Ukraine. This included radios, <b>first-aid</b> <b>kits,</b> surveillance drones, counter-mortar radar systems, military ambulances, 30 armoured Humvees and 300 unarmoured Humvees. In March 2016, US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated that a total of 266 million dollars was spent on non-lethal aid to Ukraine. She also said that nearly 1,200 Ukrainian soldiers and 750 National Guard members had been trained by American military personnel.|$|E

50|$|In time, Kilmer would {{influence}} most of America {{with his}} new products. By the late 19th century, railroads had taken {{most of the nation}} by storm. Americans were traveling more and farther than ever. To address the medical needs of travelers, Kilmer decided to introduce <b>first-aid</b> <b>kits.</b> The Red Cross symbol became as well known as the bald eagle. Soon, people believed that the <b>first-aid</b> <b>kits</b> were as important to their daily lives as railroads, light bulbs, and family. It became an American way of life to grab a first-aid kit when in need of help.|$|E
