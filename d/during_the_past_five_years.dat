6000|$|MY DEAR MISS GILDER,--We shall {{spend the}} {{summer at the}} same old place-the remote farm called [...] "Rest-and-be-Thankful," [...] {{on top of the}} hills three miles from Elmira, N. Y. Your other {{question}} is harder to answer. It is my habit to keep four or five books in process of erection all the time, and every summer add a few courses of bricks to two or three of them; but I cannot forecast which of the two or three it is going to be. It takes seven years to complete a book by this method, but still it is a good method: gives the public a rest. I have been accused of [...] "rushing into print" [...] prematurely, moved thereto by greediness for money; but in truth I have never done that. Do you care for trifles of information? (Well, then, [...] "Tom Sawyer" [...] and [...] "The Prince and the Pauper" [...] were each on the stocks two or three years, and [...] "Old Times on the Mississippi" [...] eight.) One of my unfinished books has been on the stocks sixteen years; another seventeen. This latter book could have been finished in a day, at any time <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> But as in the first of these two narratives all the action takes place in Noah's ark, and as in the other the action takes place in heaven, {{there seemed to be no}} hurry, and so I have not hurried. Tales of stirring adventure in those localities do not need to be rushed to publication lest they get stale by waiting. In twenty-one years, with all my time at my free disposal I have written and completed only eleven books, whereas with half the labor that a journalist does I could have written sixty in that time. I do not greatly mind being accused of a proclivity for rushing into print, but at the same time I don't believe that the charge is really well founded. Suppose I did write eleven books, have you nothing to be grateful for? Go to---remember the forty-nine which I didn't write.|$|E
