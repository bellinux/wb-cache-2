5|$|During the 20th century, {{there was}} {{increasing}} demand to replace or supplement the Saltash and Torpoint ferries, {{which could not}} cope with the rise in motor traffic. After the Government refused to prioritise the project in the 1950s, it was self-financed by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. Construction was undertaken by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company and began in 1959. It was unofficially opened in October 1961, with a formal presentation by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in April 1962. A reconstruction of the bridge began in 1999 after it {{was found to be}} unable to support a European Union requirement for <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> weights. The work involved building two new parallel decks while the original construction was completely rebuilt. The project was completed in late 2001 and formally opened by Princess Anne in April 2002. The extra decks have remained in use, increasing the bridge's capacity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed estimate of fuel consumption rates for six representative vehicle classes on {{different types of}} rural roads in South Africa for use in macroscopic analysis during road planning. The vehicle classes are: Cars, light petrol-driven vehicles other than cars, light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles,</b> medium-sized <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles,</b> heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> and buses.

30|$|For Finland {{this would}} drop {{the number of}} {{fatalities}} per year in cars and <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> from 174 to 100, suggesting a safety potential of 74. It {{should be noted that}} in Table 3, the total is not exactly equal to the sum of individual rows. This resulted from a different share of vehicle kilometres among traffic units. Vehicle kilometres per population are higher in Finland for cars and heavy <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> but lower for light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> compared to Sweden.|$|R

The driver must lower and then raise the pantograph during the transition between catenary systems.|$|E

25|$|The inquiry further {{found that}} Clarke had {{subsequently}} lied about this medical history, both when {{he applied for}} a Large <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (LGV) licence from the DVLA in Swansea and in his job application to Glasgow City Council. As a result, Clarke was suspended by the council on 6 August 2015. In giving evidence the DVLA admitted its self-declaration system had a weakness, since it allowed applicants to be assessed by either an employer-appointed occupational-health doctor or their own GP, and occupational-health doctors would not usually {{have access to the}} applicant's medical records.|$|E

The white lorry may have been broken down, and a number of people were reportedly seen around the vehicle. The two police forces added that they wanted to speak to anyone who owned the truck, had recovered or serviced it, or anyone who saw any activity of this nature on the Shean Road on the night of 25 January.|$|E
25|$|On 8 September 2014, the BBC {{released}} {{new material}} by John Sweeney who cited three civilian witnesses from Donbass {{who saw the}} Buk launcher in the rebel-controlled territory on the day when MH17 crashed. Two witnesses said {{the crew of the}} launcher and a military vehicle escorting it did not have local accents and spoke with Muscovite accents. On the same day Ignat Ostanin, a Russian journalist, published an analysis of photos and films of Buk units moving in Russia and Ukraine in the days before and after the MH17 crash. According to Ostanin, the markings on the specific launcher suspected of being used to shoot MH17, together with the number plates of the large <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> that carried the launcher, suggested that it belonged to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade of the Air Defence Forces of the Russian Ground Forces.|$|E
