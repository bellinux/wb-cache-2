5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders <b>in</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

However, Akitsushima was still {{considered}} underpowered, poorly-armored, and outgunned {{by the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, and was largely assigned to rear line duties, as part of the 6th division of the Japanese Third Fleet.

25|$|At the {{restoration}} of the monarchy in 1660, ministers unwilling to conform to the Church of England were ejected from the benefices. Under the Conventicle Act of 1664 non-Anglican services were only permitted in private houses and only with five persons attending apart from the household. In Cornwall, there were about 50 ejected ministers, some of whom persisted in conducting meetings <b>in</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way places: these included Thomas Tregosse, formerly vicar of Mylor and Mabe, Joseph Sherwood of Penzance, and Henry Flamank of Lanivet.|$|E
25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located <b>in</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so they can help eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one does {{have to get rid of}} a nest, it is recommended that the job is done by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after dark when the wasps are most docile.|$|E

25|$|This {{class of}} PGR is {{composed}} of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from chloroplasts, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects bud growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the apical meristem, causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was thought {{to play a role}} in the processes of natural leaf drop, but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, it plays a role in leaf and seed dormancy by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as gibberellin levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provide some protection from premature growth. It accumulates within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit, or seed germination before winter. Abscisic acid's effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by water washing <b>in</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.|$|E

500|$|Beckett {{made his}} postseason {{debut in the}} opening game of the 2003 National League (NL) Division Series, where he allowed only one run in seven innings against the San Francisco Giants but picked up the loss as Jason Schmidt pitched a {{complete}} game shutout. However, the Marlins came back to win the series in four games. His next start, in game one of the 2003 NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs, did not go well as he allowed four runs in the first inning, two of them on a home run by Moisés Alou, and six runs in his 6 [...] innings. The Marlins battled back and won the game in extra innings. The Cubs took the next three games and only needed one more win to take the series when Beckett returned to the mound in game five. He allowed only three Cubs to reach base in the game, on two singles and a walk, in the complete game shutout to keep his team alive. The Marlins took game six also, thanks partly to the infamous Steve Bartman incident. In game seven, on two days rest, Beckett came <b>in</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bullpen to pitch four innings and the Marlins won 9–6 to clinch the National League championship.|$|E
500|$|Thematically, films noir {{were most}} {{exceptional}} for the relative {{frequency with which}} they centered on women of questionable virtue—a focus that had become rare in Hollywood films after the mid-1930s {{and the end of}} the pre-Code era. The signal film in this vein was Double Indemnity, directed by Billy Wilder; setting the mold was Barbara Stanwyck's unforgettable femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson—an apparent nod to Marlene Dietrich, who had built her extraordinary career playing such characters for Sternberg. An A-level feature all the way, the film's commercial success and seven Oscar nominations made it probably the most influential of the early noirs. A slew of now-renowned noir [...] "bad girls" [...] followed, such as those played by Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), Ava Gardner in The Killers (1946), and Jane Greer <b>in</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Past (1947). The iconic noir counterpart to the femme fatale, the private eye, came to the fore in films such as The Maltese Falcon (1941), with Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade, and Murder, My Sweet (1944), with Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe. Other seminal noir sleuths served larger institutions, such as Dana Andrews' police detective in Laura (1944), Edmond O'Brien's insurance investigator in The Killers, and Edward G. Robinson's government agent in The Stranger (1946).|$|E

2500|$|Vehicles: Cars or {{trucks are}} used as a {{temporary}} or sometimes long-term living refuge, for example by those recently evicted from a home. Some people live in recreational vehicles (RVs), school buses, vans, sport utility vehicles, covered pick-up trucks, station wagons, sedans, or hatchbacks. The vehicular homeless, according to homeless advocates and researchers, make up the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population.

2500|$|The {{reference}} to [...] "objecting to Stapledon's philosophy" [...] was no accident.

2500|$|Hopper {{was able}} to sustain his {{lifestyle}} and a measure of celebrity by acting in numerous low budget and European films throughout the 1970s as the archetypal [...] "tormented maniac", including Mad Dog Morgan (1976), Tracks (1976), and The American Friend (1977). With Francis Ford Coppola's blockbuster Apocalypse Now (1979), Hopper returned to prominence as a hyper-manic Vietnam-era photojournalist. Stepping in for an overwhelmed director, Hopper won praise in 1980 for his directing and acting <b>in</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blue. Immediately thereafter, Hopper starred as an addled short-order cook [...] "Cracker" [...] in the Neil Young/Dean Stockwell low-budget collaboration Human Highway.
