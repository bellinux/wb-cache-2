2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly {{where to look for}} a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime afterward, {{the sons}} of Jacob by Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, were feeding his flocks in Shechem. Jacob {{wanted to know how}} things were doing, so he asked Joseph to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> return with a report. This was the last time he would ever see his son in Hebron. Later that day, the report that Jacob ended up {{receiving}} came from Joseph's brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood. Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph. At that moment he cried “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.” He rent his clothes and put sackcloth around his waist mourning for days. No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement. (...) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "O no!" [...] she cried, [...] "none {{of those}} low things with fish-tails, but a real princess of the ocean. She {{lived in a}} splendid palace {{at the bottom of}} the sea, and fell in love with a prince of the earth, who left his father's kingdom, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> married her.|$|R
6000|$|In {{those days}} miners would flock in crowds {{to catch a}} glimpse of that rare and blessed spectacle, a woman! Old {{inhabitants}} tell how, in a certain camp, the news went abroad early in the morning that a woman was come! They had seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the camping-ground--sign of emigrants from over the great plains. Everybody <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> a shout <b>went</b> up when an actual, bona fide dress was discovered fluttering in the wind! The male emigrant was visible. The miners said: ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'My dear, do let me go!' said Minnikin; 'I should so like to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> amuse {{myself a}} little with the other children.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, but {{how could}} we face the people--I should {{never be able to}} <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> <b>And</b> most of them have such {{enormous}} families." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Got a whale!" [...] he yelled. [...] "See him--down there--in {{that white}} water. See him flash red!... <b>Go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> land him for me. Hurry! He's {{got all the}} line!" ...|$|E
60|$|Peregrine's chin <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> was no answer; {{his hair}} dropped over his heavy brow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet after all," [...] I said, [...] "even if we don't {{find the}} sphere at once, {{there is a}} chance for us. We might hold out. Even through the night. We might <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> again <b>and</b> make a fight for it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jacoby Shaddix {{told the}} story of the song in a video interview: [...] "We were packing up our equipment. I was upstairs packing up my room and I heard this riff ringing up the hallway and it was like Damn! That's sick. So we <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> jammed it out in about an hour, got the beef to the song, tweaked it in a bunch of {{different}} ways. It's a very uplifting song. Lyrically it's about progressing as a human being, as a spiritual being in this crazy shit. It sounds clichéd as this band is my lifeline to humanity, its what connects me to the flow of life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Me <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{live with}} them after all that has happened! I couldn't do {{anything}} like that!" [...] and the old lumberman sprang {{up and began to}} pace the cabin floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I will not. I {{know that}} it is wrong. I will <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> tell him that it must not--must not be so. But I may stay at The Cleeve;--may I not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wouldn't it {{be great}} if we could <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> locate {{a few of those}} {{first-class}} wells?" [...] said Fred, with a sigh. [...] "I'd just like to know how it feels to be a real millionaire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Er {{father was}} quite a leadin' man in chapel. You should ha' seen him Sundays, interruptin' the {{minister}} and givin' out 'ims. He had gold spectacles, I remember, and used to look over 'em at you while he sang hearty--he was always great on singing 'earty to the Lord--and when HE got out o' toon 'arf the people went after 'im--always. 'E was that sort of man. And to walk be'ind 'im in 'is nice black clo'es--'is 'at was a brimmer--made one regular proud to be engaged to such a father-in-law. And when the summer came I <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> stopped a fortnight.|$|R

5000|$|Go to, let us <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> {{confound}} their language, {{that they}} may not understand one another's speech. (Genesis 11:5-6, KJV translation) ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Dear old Harold Bodkin. I {{know him}} well. In fact, I've a {{standing}} invitation to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{stay as long}} as I like. Harold is one of my best pals. Harold is a corker. Good old Harold is----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be ready; and you {{can call}} for me at Mrs. Askerton's. I must <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> it will save you {{something}} in your walk {{to pick me up}} at the cottage." [...] And so the arrangements for the day were made.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't 'ee mind him, there's a dear," [...] said Marian. [...] "I've {{worked here}} before. Now you <b>go</b> <b>and</b> lie <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> Izz and I {{will make up}} your number." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, at any rate, Digby," [...] said Sir Jeremy, [...] "Buggam Grange is haunted. If {{you want}} to be assured of it <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> any time <b>and</b> spend the night and you'll see for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--I suppose not;--except that {{he advises}} {{me to hold}} my tongue. I think that I shall do that. I mean to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> you know, <b>and</b> I daresay I shall be {{much the same as}} others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you mean}} to say," [...] asked Mr. Browne incredulously, [...] "that a chap can <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> put up there {{as if it were a}} hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you choose}} to take this note to my man, he may give it another show. Mind, I don't say that he will. He's going to Sacramento to-night, but you could <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> find him before he starts. He's got a room there, I believe. While you're waiting for him you might {{keep your eyes open}} to satisfy yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> cut two sticks {{about ten}} feet long each; tie strings to the small ends of them; fix hooks that you'll find in that pocket-book to the lines. The creek below the fall is {{swarming}} with fish; you'll find grasshoppers and worms enough for bait {{if you choose to}} look for 'em. Go, and see what you can do." ...|$|E
5000|$|State Rep. Mark Nakashima, who {{presently}} represents state District 1 in House, {{recalled the}} contributions Takamine {{made to the}} state and Hawaii County in 2015, [...] "He was very much supportive of agriculture, especially in the Hamakua area, and did a lot to ensure that agriculture remained a mainstay on Hawaii Island." [...] Nakashima also added that while he was growing up, [...] "We lived {{in the middle of a}} cane field in Kalopa. There's a small paved road that <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I remember my grandmother telling me, from a very young age, that Yoshito was responsible for getting that road done for (his family). There are so many stories like that, where Yoshito was able to provide resources for the residents living in the Hamakua area. I think a lot of his legacy is the resources that we enjoy in Hamakua and along the Hilo coast that speak of his ability to provide for his constituents." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>went</b> on <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> accosted this antiquity, {{and made}} a remark or two. I could not catch up. They were so casual I could not {{recognize}} which one it was that touched that bottom, for in an instant that old man was literally in eruption and was filling the whole place with profanity of the most exquisite kind. You never heard such accomplished profanity. I never heard it also delivered with such eloquence.|$|R
50|$|Also, there's Tum's friend, Jim, who's distraught {{over her}} boyfriend {{cheating}} on her. Tum takes Jim {{with her to}} get her passport, and Jim accidentally gets caught in the crossfire. Jim, now dead, has been compromised and Tum makes off with the money. Tum remembers the reference of Pen when Pen was telling her about how the bodies were dumped down the lake <b>and</b> whatever <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> disappears, <b>and</b> therefore dumps the money, escaping with just guilt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wherever {{does one}} have one's tea?" [...] she asked with the oddest thrill of {{excitement}} in her voice, looking vaguely round and letting herself be drawn {{on down the}} grass path, trailing her parasol, turning her head {{this way and that}} way, forgetting her tea, wishing to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> then down there, remembering orchids and cranes among wild flowers, a Chinese pagoda and a crimson crested bird; but he bore her on.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Let me see; I cannot go and buy sailor's clothes myself, but my old servant can {{be trusted}} absolutely. There is a shop {{down by the river}} where such things are sold. I will get her to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> say that she has a nephew just arrived from sea, and that she wants to give him a new rig out; but as he has hurt himself, and cannot come, she must choose it. What is your height?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you boys}} {{want to send}} that turkey cock home, you had better let me take it down to Rockville to-day," [...] said the old lumberman. [...] "I won't mind the trip at all," [...] he added, as he saw {{that some of them}} were going to remonstrate. [...] "Fact is, I forgot to get some of the things I was going to buy yesterday. So if you'll just make yourselves at home here, I'll <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> be back some time before nightfall." ...|$|E
50|$|Broughton {{drew up a}} set {{of rules}} for the sport that were {{regarded}} as definitive for around 100 years. The rules stipulated that a round would last until a man <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> was to be a 30-second interval between rounds.|$|R
5000|$|He went on {{to state}} that: [...] "In senior year I got {{together}} with a guitar player; he knew a drummer and bass player who were both pretty good. We were serious about it for about six weeks or so, and then it kind of fell apart. I ended up living in a quonset hut in Thousand Oaks, California, writing songs and eating a lot of peanut butter and bread and whatever else was around. In one of the bands, I played with a guy named Rick Carlos {{and he got a}} call from John Batdorf of Batdorf & Rodney, asking him to come to L.A., to play with them. A couple months later {{they were looking for a}} keyboard player who could sing the high parts, so I <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> joined the band. I got to do a tour with them which was great experience. Then after that fell apart, John and I put together Silver; Silver lasted about two years. We put out an album on Arista and were going to do a second but Clive Davis, Arista's president, kind of choked it".|$|R
6000|$|We reached Louisville in time--at {{least the}} {{neighborhood}} of it. We stuck hard and fast on the rocks {{in the middle of}} the river, <b>and</b> lay <b>there</b> four days. I was now beginning to feel a strong sense of being a part of the boat's family, a sort of infant son to the captain and younger brother to the officers. There is no estimating the pride I took in this grandeur, or the affection that began to swell and grow in me for those people. I could not know how the lordly steamboatman scorns that sort of presumption in a mere landsman. I particularly longed to acquire the least trifle of notice from the big stormy mate, and I was on the alert for an opportunity to do him a service to that end. It came at last. The riotous powwow of setting a spar was going on down on the forecastle, <b>and</b> I <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> stood around in the way--or mostly skipping out of it--till the mate suddenly roared a general order for somebody to bring him a capstan bar. I sprang to his side and said: 'Tell me where it is--I'll fetch it!' ...|$|R
