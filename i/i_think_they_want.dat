500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

Whereas I want to do the Western. Because, you see, how else can you justify all of the punching and kicking and violence, except in the period of the West?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 1985 {{interview}} with People, Tullis said, [...] "They {{tried to say}} his intelligence was impaired, but it wasn't true. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to keep him out}} of the classroom because thought it would bother the other kids' parents." ...|$|R
2500|$|The album {{divided the}} Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, [...] "I {{know a lot}} of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a {{functioning}} band and go back to doing that".|$|R
60|$|Bless you, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> that. <b>I</b> only <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> {{to marry}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} they could if the spirits were on the table--in a bottle," [...] replied Wilson, with a curl of his pale lip. [...] "The people round here, when they're all sodden up with Irish whisky, may believe in such things. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> a little {{education}} in this country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They rode {{this morning}} {{back to the}} other Boers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to bring a party of them here to settle, if they like this place, as it is so easy to defend. They said they would return to-morrow, and that {{meanwhile}} we were quite safe, as they had sure tidings that all the Zulus were back over the Tugela, taking some of their wounded with them, and also the Boer cattle as an offering to Dingaan. But come to the house, Allan--our home that I had made ready for you as well as I could. Oh! my God! our home on the threshold of which I believed you would never set a foot. Yes, when the moon rose from that cloud I believed it, and look, they are still quite close together. Hark, what is that?" ...|$|E
5000|$|He is {{a critic}} of the concept of Emotional Intelligence. In recent years, he has become an outspoken {{opponent}} of the animal rights movement, especially the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In a winter 2010 interview with Imagineer Magazine, he stated, [...] "I don’t think PETA want all beings equal at all; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> man to suffer and die." ...|$|E
60|$|CONRAD. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> it's any good. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to {{live longer}} than usual.|$|R
5000|$|Mitchell {{said that}} his {{performance}} on the Late Show with David Letterman as Hedwig was interesting: [...] "During rehearsal, a disembodied voice emanating from the control booth gently told me that I couldn't rip my wig off during the song ("Tear Me Down"). I asked why, {{but there was only}} silence from on high. So when we taped, I ripped it off after the song. They edited it out. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> people to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was a woman and not a man in drag." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To see her people? No, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> me {{very badly}}--and I didn't want very badly to go. Why should I? It's better for married {{people to be}} {{separated}} sometimes." ...|$|R

5000|$|Newman-Phillips was {{contracted}} {{as a guest}} cast member. Of her Narelle's {{exit from}} the series, the actress told a reporter from TV Life that [...] "Narelle left {{in search of a}} guy. It was left open ended. Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> me back so I could be returning to the show around March." [...] She added {{that it would have been}} great to reprise her role, something which has never happened.|$|E
5000|$|... "Newspapers {{are in the}} {{business}} to sell newspapers, and people love a mystery." [...] Karr has become worried that [...] "mainstream media had fallen into the mode of hype now, explain later." [...] Karr has often asked to test claims of weeping statues but states that [...] "such claims are denied by the churches involved. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> people to believe some kind of miracle is going on, I don't think they wanted to hear the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was {{released}} that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies {{in its first}} week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, {{with much of the}} criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, [...] "I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that".|$|R
5000|$|Amy Cavanaugh in the Decider: DC writes [...] "With this spring's {{opening of}} Eatonville, his Zora Neale Hurston-themed restaurant, Andy Shallal {{is trying to}} mend a decades-old {{literary}} rift between the author and her contemporary, Langston Hughes, whom Shallal's Busboys And Poets chain is named in honor of. The two writers tried to collaborate on a play, Mule Bone, but things went sour: “They fought over copyright issues, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to be friends,” says Shallal. Since the restaurants are {{across the street from}} each other, Shallal sees it as a chance to reunite the two writers." ...|$|R

5000|$|Warner Bros. Pictures {{announced}} in October 2011 {{that the first}} draft for Sherlock Holmes 3 was being produced with screenwriter Drew Pearcewriting the script; he was replaced by Justin Haythe. Jude Law commented on the project in late 2013, [...] "We had a meeting earlier this year, the three of us, and I think it's being written now. Warner Bros. have still got to agree to pay for it... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to!" [...] He also said of the delay in getting into production, [...] "I think Warner Bros. wants it, and there's a lot of want from us as a team. We {{want it to be}} better than the other two. We want to make sure it's smarter and cleverer, but in the same realm. It's a slow process. We're all busy. So getting us together to try to nail that has taken a little bit longer than we had hoped... I hate celebrating anything I've done, but I'm so proud of those films. I think it was Joel Silver who said, 'Take it out of that dusty room {{and put it on the}} street'." ...|$|E

6000|$|Clavering nodded. [...] "He {{put them}} into lard. Now, the Brand Company hold Tillotson's biggest contract, and if it suited them they could break him. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to. Tillotson {{is a kind of}} useful man to them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Subsequent {{remarks by}} Zuffa {{spokesperson}} Dana White however cast {{doubt as to}} what the new owners would actually do with Pride. After the sale officially closed on May 25, 2007, White remarked that he planned on bringing Pride's biggest names into UFC competition instead of keeping them in Pride and that they were still deciding on what to do with Pride itself. In later comments made in August 2007, White expressed doubt that Zuffa can resurrect Pride in Japan, claiming, [...] "I've we pulled everything out of the trick box that I can and I can't get a TV deal over there with Pride. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> us there. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> me there." ...|$|R
5000|$|By late 2006 the Spazzys had {{recorded}} their second album, Dumb Is Forever. However its release was [...] "severely delayed by some pretty serious legal issues." [...] Kat later told Steve Bell of theMusic.com.au that the dispute with their label and management began {{when they were}} asked to record it in Los Angeles. She reflected [...] "we didn't want to go to LA, we were tricked into going to LA - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> our managers {{thought it would be a}} cool thing to do... and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> us to record there, which is the daggiest most '80s thing in the fucking world to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I found it," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{felt that}} it was there. I have brought them up with me to see it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to ask you some questions. But first, come and listen." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2010, Lavigne was {{featured}} in Maxim for the November issue. During the interview she revealed that she had finished Goodbye Lullaby after {{two and a half}} years. However, in November, Lavigne announced that her album had been completed for a year, citing her record company as the reason for the album's delays. Lavigne stated that her record company wanted something more upbeat to keep up with mainstream radio, [...] "Radio's very rhythmic and urban and dance today. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> me to do something more like that, but that's not what my vision was for this album". The entire track listing for the album was revealed on 21 December 2010, after some were announced in early December.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Soccer Federation {{submitted}} a bid {{with the hope}} of hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup. U.S. Soccer first said in February 2007 that it would put forth a bid for the 2018 World Cup. On January 28, 2009, U.S. Soccer announced that it would submit bids for both the 2018 and 2022 Cups. In October 2010 it withdrew from the 2018 bid process to focus on winning the 2022 edition. [...] On December 2, 2010, it was announced that Qatar would be the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. [...] Bill Clinton remarked [...] "The FIFA people were in a mood to give it to people who didn’t have it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to make soccer a world sport." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the idea}} here put forward did not suit the idea which was running in Mrs. Clavering's mind. [...] "Edward and Mary are very well off," [...] she said. [...] "His own {{property}} is considerable, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> anything. Besides, he would hardly like {{to give up a}} family living." ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2014, Wilson {{clarified}} {{that he did}} {{not write}} any material with Beck, and that Beck would only be a guest performer. The next month, Beck intimated on the project's status: [...] "I’m not sure. As far as I know, they made a mistake by grabbing me for a tour and opening up the floodgates for a tour prematurely instead of finishing the tracks. And so we left the studio with half-finished tracks-three, four tracks I was supposed to be on and they’re still unfinished. And to me it was a bit stupid because they should have done the album, had a killer album, and then gone out on the road. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to grab me while I was still available. That’s about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} my cousin? Oh, {{she has a}} visitor and doesn't want me. Then Miss Stackpole and Bantling have gone out to a cafe to eat an ice--Miss Stackpole delights in an ice. <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> me either. The opera's very bad; the women look like laundresses and sing like peacocks. I feel very low." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{script was}} given to Maurice Hurley to rewrite. He took six weeks for the rewrite, and his initial version was {{received}} poorly by TNG executives. Hurley later said, [...] "they absolutely hated it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to fire me, {{and they would have}} if I didn't have a guaranteed contract". He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen than we thought it would when we read the script. We were lucky, because it was out of our hands".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it {{must have}} been from a woman--perhaps she was my mother; I don't know--who used to sit up in the bed and cough, all night it seemed to me. People would come to see us--ladies in fine clothes, and gentlemen with oily hair. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to help us. Many of them had kind voices. But always a hard look would come into her face, and she would tell them what even then I knew to be untrue--it {{was one of the first}} things I can recollect--that we had {{everything}} we wanted, that we needed no help from anyone. They would go away, shrugging their shoulders. I grew up with the feeling that seemed to have been burnt into my brain, that to take from anybody anything you had not earned was shameful. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could do it even now, not even from you. I am useful to you, dad--I do help you?" ...|$|R
500|$|After {{hearing all}} the evidence, the Special Master Richard Hixson, {{who presided over}} the {{testimony}} for the Florida Legislature, declared that the state had a [...] "moral obligation" [...] to make restitution to the former residents of Rosewood. He said, [...] "I truly don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> cared about compensation. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> simply <b>wanted</b> the truth to be known about what happened to them... whether they got fifty cents or a hundred and fifty million dollars. It didn't matter." ...|$|R
25|$|Ian Meckiff had {{destroyed}} their batting lineup in the just-completed second Test and their bad luck continued when {{two of their}} players were injured in a car smash on their journey up to Wagga from Melbourne. <b>I</b> don't really <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to play this match at all.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{have found}} {{something}} very interesting in the Chicago River {{on the east}} side of the Kinzie Bridge. I see swirling water that looks like a giant drain ... I would say it looks like the source of the water could be the river itself, and I am hearing reports that fish are swimming in the basement of the Mart just feet from the swirl! I do not see any emergency crews near this spinning swirl, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> may <b>want</b> to take a look. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> someone should wake up the mayor!" ...|$|R
500|$|Initially {{upon her}} arrival at Seattle Grace, plastic surgeon Mark Sloan {{was seen to}} develop {{feelings}} for Hahn, only to be repeatedly rebuffed. The character explained that she kept her personal and professional lives separate, but as Smith has explained: [...] "She came to the wrong hospital if she thought she wasn’t {{going to have a}} personal life!" [...] Smith has admitted to eavesdropping on a writers’ meeting in an attempt {{to find out what was}} in store for her character romantically, as it was being closely guarded, even from her. She discussed with TV Guide editor Michael Ausiello early in her tenure as Hahn how she and Sandra Oh had pushed for a lesbian relationship between Hahn and Cristina, having previously played lovers in the play Stop Kiss. She agreed with Ausiello's assessment that Hahn would make an [...] "awesome lesbian" [...] and that: [...] "I've certainly let [...] know I'm open to it. [...] They were like, [...] "OK, duly noted!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> me to shut up already." [...] Equally, however, Smith has revealed that when she and Shonda Rhimes first discussed the possibility of Hahn being gay; [...] ""we felt it was too obvious that a strong, powerful woman would be a lesbian".|$|R
500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> just <b>wanted</b> a northwest guy to do it, {{because they were}} shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|R
