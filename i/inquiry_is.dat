5|$|Candidates for Freemasonry {{will have}} met most active {{members of the}} Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the {{candidate}} will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial <b>inquiry</b> <b>is</b> made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, the NSW Department of Local Government {{announced}} it would investigate the Council's financial management and would try {{to determine whether it}} properly considered the impact the added costs could have on its other functions. The investigation, which commenced on 6 November 2006, was conducted under Section 430 of the , which allows the Director-General of the Department to investigate any aspect of a Council or of its work or activities. The report, delivered in May 2007 to the Minister of Local Government, concluded that the Council did not exercise due diligence and {{that there had been a}} failure to scope the project, and recommended to the Minister that a Section 740 public inquiry, which would be independent and have some of the powers and protections of a Royal Commission, be held. A Section 740 <b>inquiry</b> <b>is</b> a necessary step before a Council can be dismissed.|$|E

Dying, he tells Craven {{he was working with}} McCroon, a terrorist Craven had had convicted in Northern Ireland. Emma's boyfriend, Terry Shields (Tim McInnerny), tells Craven that she was investigating a hot cell in Northmoor; he is later killed. Craven meets Harcourt and Pendleton at the House of Commons where an <b>inquiry</b> <b>is</b> taking place into the sale of International Irradiated Fuels (IIF) – Northmoor's owners – to the Fusion Corporation of Kansas, owned by Jerry Grogan (Kenneth Nelson). Pendleton tells Craven that he believes Grogan was behind Emma's death. Returning to Yorkshire for Emma's funeral, Craven is refused permission to seek a warrant to enter Northmoor. Returning home, he is observed by McCroon (Sean Caffrey).|$|E

25|$|Since {{the early}} twentieth century, {{philosophy}} in English-speaking universities has {{moved away from the}} humanities and closer to the formal sciences, becoming much more analytic. Analytic philosophy is marked by emphasis on the use of logic and formal methods of reasoning, conceptual analysis, and the use of symbolic and/or mathematical logic, as contrasted with the Continental style of philosophy. This method of <b>inquiry</b> <b>is</b> largely indebted to the work of philosophers such as Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, G.E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.|$|E

AIBN may also investigate foreign ships in cases where Norwegian jurisdiction can be applied under international law. AIBN may also investigate accidents with recreational boats if such an <b>inquiry</b> <b>is</b> presumed to improve safety at sea.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, a {{submission}} {{was made}} to Victoria's parliamentary inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse involving criticism of the college's alleged history of institutionalised brutalisation and sexual abuse of children in its care in the 1960s and 1970s. The <b>inquiry</b> <b>is</b> expected to hand over testimony to a concurrent Royal Commission. The inquiry heard that one victim who reported an incident of corporal punishment to the head was threatened with a strap to the face, although {{it should be noted}} that this allegation related to corporal punishment and not sexual abuse. All the instances of abuse are alleged to have occurred in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} community has overwhelmingly rejected the ideas put forth in creation science as lying outside {{the boundaries of}} a legitimate science. The foundational premises underlying scientific creationism disqualify it as a science because the answers to all inquiry therein are preordained to conform to Bible doctrine, and because that <b>inquiry</b> <b>is</b> constructed upon theories which are not empirically testable in nature. Scientists also deem creation science's attacks against biological evolution to be without scientific merit. Those views of the {{scientific community}} were accepted in two significant court decisions in the 1980s which found the field of creation science to be a religious mode of inquiry, not a scientific one.|$|E

25|$|Homosexuality: A Philosophical <b>Inquiry</b> <b>is</b> a 1988 book by {{the philosopher}} Michael Ruse, {{in which the}} author surveys {{different}} theories of homosexuality and evaluates the moral status of homosexual behavior. Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry received a mixture {{of positive and negative}} reviews. Some reviewers praised the book for Ruse's comprehensive treatment of his subject, careful discussion of theories about homosexuality, and use of philosophy to argue in favor of gay rights. However, Ruse's discussion of psychoanalytic and sociobiological theories, and his use of historical evidence to discuss homosexuality in past societies, were criticized, and commentators also suggested that some of Ruse's comments about homosexuality could be seen as insensitive. Some reviewers suggested that Ruse's arguments and conclusions were influenced by his personal reaction to the AIDS epidemic.|$|E
25|$|The first scholar to give Peirce his {{considered}} professional {{attention was}} Royce's student Morris Raphael Cohen, {{the editor of}} an anthology of Peirce's writings titled Chance, Love, and Logic (1923) {{and the author of}} the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings. John Dewey studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins and, from 1916 onward, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 Logic: The Theory of <b>Inquiry</b> <b>is</b> much influenced by Peirce. The publication of the first six volumes of Collected Papers (1931–35), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds, did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss, did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and Goudge (1950), the 1941 Ph.D. thesis by Arthur W. Burks (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Its Transactions, an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce, pragmatism, and American philosophy, has appeared since 1965. (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to transactionalism).|$|E
25|$|The initial {{inquiry and}} {{preliminary}} {{hearings on the}} 1886 Normanton Incident fell under the consular jurisdiction of the Kobe foreign settlement. On October 24, the cargo ship Normanton, belonging to a steamboat company at the Yokohama settlement, sank in the waters {{off the coast of}} Wakayama Prefecture. The boat's 25 Japanese passengers, who were riding along with the cargo, all died. Although 11 British crewmen boarded lifeboats and survived, not a single Japanese passenger made it out alive, and so suspicion emerged that the captain and crew had been negligent in saving the passengers. Under the consular jurisdiction guaranteed by the Ansei Treaties, the hearings for the case were heard over five days beginning on November 1 in the Kobe foreign settlement, but the British consul James Troup found the crew innocent. The governor of Hyōgo Prefecture, Utsumi Tadakatsu, was dissatisfied with the verdict and accused the captain of murder. On November 20, preliminary hearings were held on this charge in the foreign settlement, and on December 8 public hearings were held in Yokohama; both of these found the captain guilty. As the initial inquiry over the incident had found the crew blameless, doubts and criticism of the right to consular jurisdiction arose domestically in Japan, along with a wave of anti-British sentiment. This initial <b>inquiry</b> <b>is</b> a black spot in the otherwise positive history of foreign–Japanese relations in the Kobe foreign settlement.|$|E
