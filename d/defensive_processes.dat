D., is a {{psychoanalyst}} (IPA), {{a member}} of the board of directors of the Sigmund-Freud-Institut in Germany, and has been involved in dream research for more than a decade. He is the author of publications on dreaming and dream drawings. The subliminal activation method has been very fruitful when studying unconscious cognitive processes. However, affect-laden material has rarely been used in subliminal studies although it seemed likely that this kind of material could be used to find out more about the appearance and the course of <b>defensive</b> <b>processes.</b> In a controlled experimental design at the Sigmund-Freud-Institut, highly affect-laden stimuli were applied subliminally to subjects. In dream reports as well as in waking free imageries indications for the activation of <b>defensive</b> <b>processes</b> could be described on a micro-process level. As a result, after being confronted with the affective subliminal stimuli, dissociative and reassociative processing could be observed. Subjects tried to find a “good solution ” and to integrate the irritating content into a smoothed form and story.

40|$|Prior {{theory on}} prosocial {{behavior}} has suggested that, when we act uncooperatively for other reasons, we may justify that uncooperativeness by telling ourselves that “... I probably couldn't {{have made a}} difference anyway,” that is, by minimizing the efficacy of our cooperative actions. A pair of experiments examined this question in the context of social dilemmas, where there are always clear disincentives to cooperate. In Experiment 1, it was found that making these disincentives stronger not only decreased cooperation, but also decreased group members' sense that acting cooperatively was efficacious for enhancing the group's welfare. An alternative explanation to a defensive, self-justification explanation for the latter finding was then identified. The results of Experiment 2 ruled out this alternative explanation as well as providing additional evidence for a justification-via-inefficacy effect.

30|$|In {{team sports}} such as football, there are until ten attacking and {{defensive}} operational principles for tactical behaviors that oppose each other (i.e., see Teoldo et al. 2009). For invasion games teaching these principles are reduced to six attacking and defensive tactical principles (Bayer 1992; Mitchell et al. 2006). In the attacking process, the principles are: (a) keeping possession of the ball; (b) moving forward; and (c) scoring. In the <b>defensive</b> <b>process,</b> the principles are: (a) taking the initiative; (b) preventing the opposition from advancing, and (c) protecting the goal. Based on these principles and their contextual dynamics, new teaching approaches try to develop the tactical perception and action skills of players (Tan et al. 2012). For this reason, {{it is important to}} design drills based on the most important factors that lead to the tactical learning of main principles and to try to augment the player’s perception of specific dynamics of the game (Brunswik 1956; Travassos et al. 2011).|$|R

Once this self-protective {{strategy}} is initiated, an effective {{resolution of the}} process is crucial to avoid major and unnecessary tissue damage.

Thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) is a matricellular protein involved in angiogenesis, cancer, and inflammation. The effects of TSP- 1 have been studied in many preclinical tumor models, and mimetic peptides are being tested in cancer clinical trials.

40|$|We {{identified}} {{two classes of}} native dispersed DNA repeats in the Ascobolus genome. The first class consisted of several kilobase long, methylated repeats. These repeats, named Mars (methylated Ascobolus repeated sequences), fell in one family of LINE-like elements and in three families of LTR-containing retrotransposable elements. The methylation features of Mars elements were those expected if they were natural targets for the MIP (methylation induced premeiotically) previously discovered in Ascobolus. The second class consisted of short repeats, ∼ 100 bp long, corresponding to 5 S rRNA and tRNA genes. As expected from their size, which {{was too small to}} allow MIP to occur, they were unmethylated, as were 26 kb of unique sequences tested.

40|$|Although {{theoretically}} and clinically important, {{research on}} attachment-related cardiovascular function in adults has {{just started to}} unfold over the last decade, and methods and results differ substantially. A central shortcoming of previous studies concerns attachment theory itself: There are several pathways on when and how the attachment system may influence stress physiology, and these interactions have been largely neglected. One area of particular significance is the dynamic conceptualization of insecure attachment strategies as <b>defensive</b> <b>processes.</b> This dissertation aims at testing a possible approach to address these issues. As many of the existing studies use self-report data {{for the assessment of}} attachment, we first translated and validated the Experiences in Close Relationships - Revised questionnaire (ECR-R) in two large samples. The German version performed well with regard to reliability and validity, and was therefore used in all other studies. The second study describes the rationale and validation of a newly developed, attachment-related short-term stressor, the separation recall (SR) task. The SR was compared to an achievement-oriented stressor, and correlated with attachment style. Both stressors elicited cardiovascular and emotional reactions, but patterns differed between the tasks. Blood pressure down-regulation after the SR but not the other stressor was related to attachment avoidance. The third study deals with factors leading to the activation of attachment-related <b>defensive</b> <b>processes.</b> It probes whether there is a lower threshold of personal significance of attachment-related memory content which triggers attachment-related defensive functioning as measured by psychophysiological response. Differences in personal significance of the reported separation experience moderated the influence of attachment avoidance on heart rate reactivity. The fourth study concentrates on whether psychological distress in general, and life-stress more specifically, are able to distract and change the impact of attachment defensive functioning on psychophysiological stress reaction; in other words, it explores the upper boundaries and vulnerability of insecure attachment strategies. Results indicate that especially life-stress may moderate the impact of attachment avoidance on the reactivity of high-frequency heart rate variability. The overall findings are discussed with regard to their impact on psychosomatic medicine and health psychology...|$|E

Notably, controlled motivation hindered participants' acceptance of their own negative identities but not of others' negative identities, suggesting that control-motivated individuals' rejection of negative past identities was an attempt to distance from undesirable parts of themselves. <b>Defensive</b> <b>processes,</b> reflected in nonpersonal pronouns and escape motives, mediated interaction effects, indicating that lower defense allowed fuller integration.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{roles for}} emotion {{in the development}} of delusions have been outlined.

An empirical investigation was conducted of the delusion-as-defense account with reference to grandiose delusions. Twenty individuals with grandiose delusions and 21 individuals without mental illness were compared on overt and covert measures of self-esteem. No evidence for a discrepancy between overt and covert self-esteem in individuals with grandiose delusions was found. One potential interpretation of the results is that the tasks were not able to penetrate <b>defensive</b> <b>processes.</b> However, we argue that in this group, the grandiose delusions do not currently defend against low self-esteem.

40|$|International Federation for Psychotherapy (IFP) Centre Brain fag was {{originally}} {{described as a}} culture-bound syndrome among West African students.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between depth of defense interpretations by therapists, and patient defensive functioning, on the therapeutic alliance in a sample of 36 patients undergoing short-term dynamic psychotherapy.

Mean depth of interpretation was compared between sessions that were identified beforehand as either high-alliance or low-alliance sessions using the Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAq-II: Luborsky et al., 1996). Results indicated that defensive functioning was correlated to defense interpretation depth in low-alliance sessions. Moreover, mean depth of interpretation was also higher in low-alliance sessions, pointing to the possible "destabilizing" effects that these interpretations may have on both defensive functioning and the therapeutic alliance.

30|$|In summary, ISTDP {{focuses on}} the {{experience}} of feelings in the here-and-now of the transference. In response, the patient begins to automatically manifest anxiety and defend against dissociated feelings from breaking through into conscious awareness. This enables the therapist to assess the anxiety patterns and <b>defensive</b> <b>processes</b> of the patient in vivo. If necessary, the patient is helped to restructure his anxiety to striated muscles. The therapist continues the central dynamic sequence through one of the two routes to the unconscious, depending on whether the patient is primarily manifesting anxiety or defensiveness in the transference that block the rise of anxiety and the underlying complex transference feelings. Pressure is applied either to experience the feelings that are creating anxiety (if anxiety is in the transference), or to the defences that are blocking the rise of anxiety and complex transference feelings. This directs the resistance into the transference, paving the way for the eventual conscious experience of transference feelings and exploration of the unconscious.|$|E
40|$|When {{individuals}} {{grow up with}} autonomy-thwarting parents, {{they may}} be prevented from exploring internally endorsed values and identities {{and as a result}} shut out aspects of the self perceived to be unacceptable. Given the stigmatization of homosexuality, individuals perceiving low autonomy support from parents may be especially motivated to conceal same-sex sexual attraction, leading to <b>defensive</b> <b>processes</b> such as reaction formation. Four studies tested a model wherein perceived parental autonomy support is associated with lower discrepancies between self-reported sexual orientation and implicit sexual orientation (assessed with a reaction time task). These indices interacted to predict anti-gay responding indicative of reaction formation. Studies 2 – 4 showed that an implicit/explicit discrepancy was particularly pronounced in participants who experienced their fathers as both low in autonomy support and homophobic, though results were inconsistent for mothers. Findings of Study 3 suggested contingent self-esteem as a link between parenting styles and discrepancies in sexual orientation measures.

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to <b>defensive</b> <b>processes</b> that can be used to safeguard and repair self-esteem. For example, people can dismiss the validity of nega-tive feedback by rejecting it as inaccurate or biased (Baumeister, 1998; Kernis, 2003; Kunda, 1990). If undermining the feedback itself is impractical, people can compare their performance with relatively worse off others (Taylor & Lobel, 1989; Wills, 1981) or compen-sate for their shortcomings symbolically (Wicklund & Gollwitzer, 1982). Indeed, Tesser (2000) has docu-mented such a wide range of mechanisms for self-esteem repair that he has labeled them a “self-zoo ” of inter-changeable processes. As noted, these processes also share an important shortcoming: They are defensive in nature (see Sherman & Cohen, 2002). Each of these processes is defensive because it restores lost self-esteem without addressing the underlying cause of the negative feedback.

Method: Participants were mailed postcards that featured either a positive, negative, or neutral message {{on the outside of the}} postcard and a message encouraging hearing protection behaviors on the inside. The first posttest measurement of the effectiveness of the persuasive messages was conducted about a week after the postcards were mailed. The delayed posttest measurement was conducted six weeks later. Results: Responses from 307 coal miners revealed that the positive or neutral messages generated significantly more self-reported hearing protection behaviors than the negative message. Identical results were obtained in a delayed posttest assessment of miners' self-reported hearing protection behaviors. The positive message was also more effective than either the neutral or negative message in preventing defensive mechanisms from emerging over time.

40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) {{is involved in}} calcium homeostasis, protein folding and lipid biosynthesis. Perturbations in its normal functions lead to a condition called {{endoplasmic reticulum}} stress (ERS). This can be triggered by many physiopathological conditions such as alcoholic steatohepatitis, insulin resistance or ischemia-reperfusion injury. The cell reacts to ERS by initiating a <b>defensive</b> <b>process</b> known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), which comprises cellular mechanisms for adaptation and the safeguarding of cell survival or, in cases of excessively severe stress, for the initiation of the cell death program. Recent experimental data suggest the involvement of ERS in ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) of the liver graft, which has been considered as one of major problems influencing outcome after liver transplantation.

40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional organelle required for lipid biosynthesis, calcium storage, and protein folding and processing. A number of physiological and pathological conditions, {{as well as}} a variety of pharmacological agents, are able to disturb proper ER function and thereby cause ER stress, which severely impairs protein folding and therefore poses the risk of proteotoxicity. Specific triggers for ER stress include, for example, particular intracellular alterations (e. g., calcium or redox imbalances), certain microenvironmental conditions (e. g., hypoglycemia, hypoxia, and acidosis), high-fat and high-sugar diet, a variety of natural compounds (e. g., thapsigargin, tunicamycin, and geldanamycin), and several prescription drugs (e. g., bortezomib/Velcade, celecoxib/Celebrex, and nelfinavir/Viracept). The cell reacts to ER stress by initiating a <b>defensive</b> <b>process,</b> called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is comprised of cellular mechanisms aimed at adaptation and safeguarding cellular survival or, in cases of excessively severe stress, at initiation of apoptosis and elimination of the faulty cell. In recent years, this dichotomic stress response system has been linked to several human diseases, and efforts are underway to develop approaches to exploit ER stress mechanisms for therapy. For example, obesity and type 2 diabetes have been linked to ER stress-induced failure of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, and current research efforts are aimed at developing drugs that ameliorate cellular stress and thereby protect beta cell function. Other studies seek to pharmacologically aggravate chronic ER stress in cancer cells in order to enhance apoptosis and achieve tumor cell death.
