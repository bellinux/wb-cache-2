40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the NACA Lewis icing research tunnel to determine the characteristics and requirements of cyclic deicing of a 65, 2 - 216 airfoil by use of an external electric heater. The present {{investigation was}} limited to an airspeed of 175 miles per hour. Data are presented to show the effects of variations in heat-on and heat-off periods, ambient air temperature, liquid-water content, angle of attack, and. heating distribution on the requirements for cyclic deicing. The external heat flow at various <b>icing</b> <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> conditions is also presented. A continuously heated parting strip at the airfoil leading edge was found necessary for quick, complete, and consistent ice removal. The cyclic power requirements {{were found to be}} primarily a function of the datum temperature and heat-on time, with the other operating and meteorological variables having a second-order effect. Short heat-on periods and high power densities resulted in the most efficient ice removal, the minimum energy input, and the minimum runback ice formations. The optimum chordwise heating distribution pattern was found to consist of a uniform distribution of cycled power density in the impingement region. Downstream of the impingement region the power density decreased to the limits of heating which, for the conditions investigated, extended from 5. 7 percent chord on the upper surface of the airfoil to 8. 9 percent chord on the lower surface. Ice removal did not take place at a heater surface temperature of 32 F; surface temperatures of approximately 50 to 100 F were required to effect removal. Better de-icing performance and greater energy savings would be possible with a heater having a higher thermal efficiency...|$|E

40|$|The mean annual surface {{pressure}} and temperature on present day Mars {{do not allow}} {{for the long term}} stability of liquid water on the surface. However, theoretical arguments have been advanced that suggest liquid water could form in transient events even though it would not be in equilibrium with the environment. Using a Mars General Circulation Model, we calculate where and for how long the {{surface pressure}} and surface temperature meet the minimum requirements for this metastability of liquid water. These requirements are that the pressure and temperature must be above the triple point of water, but below its boiling point. We find that there are five regions on Mars where these requirements are periodically satisfied: in the near equatorial regions of Amazonis, Arabia, and Elysium, and in the Hellas and Argyre impact basins. Whether liquid water ever forms in these regions depends on the availability of <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat,</b> <b>and</b> on the evaporation rate. The latter is poorly understood for low pressure CO 2 environments, but is likely to be so high that melting occurs rarely, if at all. However, in the relatively recent past, surface pressures may have been higher than they are today perhaps by as much as a factor of 2 or 3. Under these circumstances melting would have been easier to achieve. We plan to undertake laboratory experiments to better understand the potential for melting in low pressure environments...|$|R

Then, a detailed energy balance study has been carried out on this tropical glacier (2. 1 km 2) since March 1996, at the altitude of the mean equilibrium line (5 150 m a. s. l.). Each component of the energy balance (net radiation, sensible <b>and</b> latent <b>heat</b> fluxes, heat transfer into the <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> supplied by precipitation) are derived separately to know which energy flux(es) is(are) responsible for the high seasonality of the proglacial stream discharge. Net radiation and turbulent fluxes dominate the surface energy balance : net radiation is obviously the main source of energy at the glacier surface but quantitatively, this energy input does not change a lot from season to season. Sensible heat flux remains small throughout the year, and does not show any seasonality either. On the contrary, latent heat flux is very variable with seasons. During the dry season, at the glacier surface, the energy input as net radiation is almost entirely consumed by the high sublimation (penitents grow at the surface), and therefore, melting is reduced and discharge is low. During the wet season, the high humidity of the surface layer stops the sublimation, and the energy input is used for melting, leading to high discharge. (RÃ©sumÃ© d'auteur...|$|R

Since 1996, energy balance measurements {{have been carried out}} {{in the vicinity of the}} mean equilibrium line (5150 m a. s. l.) on Zongo Glacier (2. 1 km 2). Comparisons are made with proglacial stream discharges recorded at the main hydrometric station.

Radiation and turbulent fluxes dominate the surface energy balance. Sensible heat flux is small and does not show a significant seasonal change. Latent heat flux is highly variable with low values during the accumulation season and high values during the dry period. This high sublimation loss during the dry season causes well-developed penitents at the glacier surface. In conclusion, incoming energy throughout the year is constant, with no large variations, and humidity controls the balance of this energy between sublimation and melting. During the accumulation season, sublimation is reduced because of a low gradient of vapour pressure and the energy supplied by radiation is directly consumed by melting, explaining why discharge is high. During the dry period, a large part of the energy supplied by radiation is used to sublimate snow or <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> therefore, energy available for melting is low, which leads to low melt rates [...] .

40|$|Abstract Global warming {{first became}} evident beyond {{the bounds of}} natural {{variability}} in the 1970 s, but increases in global mean surface temperatures have stalled in the 2000 s. Increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, create an energy imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) even as the planet warms to adjust to this imbalance, which is estimated to be 0. 5 â€“ 1 Wmâˆ’ 2 over the 2000 s. Annual global fluctuations in TOA energy of up to 0. 2 Wmâˆ’ 2 occur from natural variations in clouds, aerosols, and changes in the Sun. At times of major volcanic eruptions the effects can be much larger. Yet global mean surface temperatures fluctuate much more than these can account for. An energy imbalance is manifested not just as surface atmospheric or ground warming but also as melting sea <b>and</b> land <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> of the oceans. More than 90 % of the heat goes into the oceans and, with melting land ice, causes sea level to rise. For the past decade, more than 30 % of the heat has apparently penetrated below 700 m depth that is traceable to changes in surface winds mainly over the Pacific in association with a switch to a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 1999. Surface warming was much more in evidence during the 1976 â€“ 1998 positive phase of the PDO, suggesting that natural decadal variability modulates the rate of change of global surface temperatures while sea-level rise is more relentless. Global warming has not stopped; it is merely manifested in different ways. 1...|$|R

The boreholes are 300 m apart {{and one of them}} reaches bedrock.
