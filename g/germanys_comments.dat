25|$|Apart from that, Reform {{had little}} to no {{influence}} {{in the rest of}} the continent. Radical lay societies sprang in Hungary during the 1848 Revolution but soon dispersed. Only in <b>Germany,</b> <b>commented</b> Steven M. Lowenstein, did the extinction of old Jewish community life lead to the creation of a new, positive religious ideology that advocated principled change. In Western and Central Europe, personal observance disappeared, but the public was not interested in bridging the gap between themselves and the official faith. Secular education for clergy became mandated by mid-century, and yeshivas all closed due to lack of applicants, replaced by modern seminaries; the new academically-trained rabbinate, whether affirming basically traditional doctrines or liberal and influenced by Wissenschaft, was scarcely prone to anything beyond aesthetic modifications and de facto tolerance of the laity's apathy. Further to the east, among the unemancipated and unacculturated Jewish masses in Poland, Romania and Russia, the stimulants that gave rise either to Reform or modernist Orthodoxy were virtually unheard of. The few rich and westernized Jews in cities like Odessa or Warsaw constructed modern synagogues where mild aesthetic reforms, like vernacular sermons or holding the wedding canopy indoors rather than under the sky, were introduced. Regarded as boldly innovative in their environs, these were long since considered trivial even by the most Orthodox in Germany, Bohemia or Moravia. In the east, the belated breakdown of old mores led not to the remodification of religion, but to the formulation of secular conceptions of Jewishness, especially nationalistic ones.|$|R

In addition to simple regression adjustment, we consider Mahalanobis distance matching and a variety of methods using propensity score matching. In each case, we consider both cross-sectional estimates and difference-in-difference estimates based on comparison of pre- and post-program earnings. Specification tests suggest that the difference-in-difference estimator may provide a better measure of program impact. We find that propensity score matching is generally most effective, but the detailed implementation of the method is not of critical importance. Our analyses demonstrate that existing data available at the state level can be used to obtain useful estimates of program impact. ...|$|R

Exponential density gradients have been estimated for the cities of many countries. The exponential, however, does not easily facilitate the study of jurisdictional effects on suburbanization.

Price is regressed on a set of characteristics of a sample of items and the estimated equation is used {{in a number of ways}} to undertake adjustments for quality changes. Statistical offices use the coefficients, or predicted prices, to adjust prices for quality when a new item of a different quality replaces an obsolete existing one. This is to ensure the resulting price comparisons are not tainted by quality differences. In academic studies it is more usual to include dummy variables for time in the regression equation, their coefficients providing estimates of the change in price over time having adjusted for quality changes. In these and other approaches it is important that the price (changes) are properly weighted in the calculation. It is axiomatic that the price (change) of an item with relatively low sales should not have the same effect as one with relatively high sales. Yet in spite of the widespread use of hedonic regressions little attention has been given to the proper incorporation of weights, it being simply assumed that a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator is appropriate. First, this paper shows how influence and leverage effects have a distorting effect on the weights under WLS. It second, develops and outlines a number of alternative approaches to the measurement of weighted quality-adjusted price changes and the circumstances under which each is most appropriate...|$|R

In a sample of research groups in the fields of science and engineering at universities in Germany, we identify research orientation, output, funding as well as openness to industry and commercialization as relevant components. Nests that attract more public funding and are led by professors with high research performance are more likely to produce researchers who take jobs in public research, while links to industry predict jobs in the private sector. In a more nuanced analysis that differentiates between types of industry employment, we find that larger firms also recruit from groups with higher scientific performance, while small and medium-sized firms recruit from nests with a higher patent productivity. A focus on experimental development instead is associated with academic start-ups, and an applied focus with employment in consulting. Recommendations for research training are discussed.

40|$|Introduction: In several {{countries}} patients {{are assumed to}} choose a health care provider and an insurer, both as a worthwhile effort for patients and as an instrument to encourage competition between providers and insurers. In the end, patient choice is assumed to result in more choice opportunities for patients and more efficient health care of higher quality in general. It needs to be investigated, however, whether the promotion of patient choice indeed is a worthwhile effort for patients, whether they take up their role by actively choosing a health insurer and care providers and whether the goals of more efficient and better quality of care are reached. The workshop will cover the choices that patients are expected to make in different countries {{in the context of}} these countries’ healthcare systems. Objective: The objective of the workshop is to learn about the role of patient choice in health care systems of different countries. The added value of this workshop is that patient choice is discussed in the broader context of the health care systems. In this way, this workshop contributes to sharing knowledge between countries’ policies on patient choice. Consequently, differences between countries in the outcomes and mechanism of patient choice can be explained. Additionally, this will give insight in evidence based policy and might have implications for policy measures in different countries and different health care systems. Lay-out of the workshop The workshop contains four presentations on patient choice, from three different countries. The first presentation will be from the German perspective. This presentation includes conceptual remarks, an overview on research on patient choice in <b>Germany</b> and comparative <b>comments</b> on research in other countries. The second and third presentations are from the Dutch perspective. One presentation will shed light on the influence of health insurers on enrolees’ care provider choice and the other presentation about the relationship between patient choice of health care providers (both as an instrument and a goal) and patient experiences. In the fourth presentation the impact of choice reforms for key stakeholders and the current revival and potential broadening of choice policies in Norway will be discussed. The workshop will end with a discussion on the impact of patient choice on the goals that are supposed to be reached by promoting this in health care systems, namely more choice opportunities for patients and more efficient health care of higher quality. Key messages Patient choice is discussed in the broader context of three countries’ health care systems. Differences in outcomes between countries are discussed and explained. This may have implications for policy measures in different countries and different health care systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this study is hate speech against the Roma in Romania, which was studied with the {{comments}} posted to three Romanian newspapers’ (Jurnalul Naţional, Evenimentul zilei and Adevărul) Internet forums. This study examines how the history, current situation and demographic factors of the Romanian Roma are discussed in the comments on the Internet forums and what kind of solutions the commentators suggest for the Roma situation that many considered problematic. As the conceptual frame of reference in this study is hate speech that has been elaborated within international and American law, the study focuses on the comments that aim at strengthening the negative stereotypes and inciting violence, characteristics of hate speech. Relating to the subject, the study also touches on the dispute over curbing freedom of speech and defining the limits for forbidden speech. The messages used in the study are from {{the first half of the}} year 2009. The method used for collecting the data was Internet-ethnography, a method that applies traditional ethnographic observation to the Internet environment. For analyzing the messages, critical discourse analysis taught by Norman Fairclough was used. The emphasis was laid on the qualities that the commentators gave to the Roma. Two primary ”solutions” to the ”Gypsy problem” in Romania came up from the analysis. According to the comments belonging to the first group, the commentators wanted to change the official Romanian designation of the Roma from ‘rom’ (‘Roma’) to ‘ţigan’ (the Romanian equivalent to ‘Gypsy’) so that the Romanians would not be confused with the Roma that many commentators considered highly insulting and problematic for Romanians. The comments of the other group are more characteristic hate speech: in many comments mass destruction of the Roma or forced deportation to India were proposed, from where the Roma started their travels toward Europe some thousand years ago. The comments contained clear references to the mass destructions of the Jews, Roma, homosexuals and political dissidents during the Nazi regime in <b>Germany</b> and the <b>comments</b> in this category, were especially vulgar. Furthermore, according to the “dirtiness – purity” category of Mary Douglas, the Roma were perceived as an obstacle to the fulfilment of the “clean” Romania. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|The Federal Joint Committee (FJC; Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA) {{defines the}} health-care {{elements}} {{that are to be}} reimbursed by sickness funds. To define a directive, the FJC can commission benefit assessments, which provide an overview of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy and benefits of an intervention. This paper describes the operational implementation of the legal requirements with regard to the benefit assessments of medicines. Such benefit assessments are sometimes referred to as "isolated benefit assessments," to distinguish them from benefit assessments as part of a full economic evaluation. The FJC has the freedom to commission these assessments from any agency; however, to date the majority have commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Nevertheless, the content of this paper applies integrally to any institute commissioned for such assessments. In this report, "the institute"' is used when the text refers to any of these institutes. The legal framework for benefit assessments is laid out in the German Social Code Book version V ([URL] sozialgesetzbuch. de), Sects. 35 b (section sign 1), 139 a (section sign 4 - 6) and Sect. 139 b (section sign 3). It is specified that: The institute must guarantee high transparency. The institute must provide appropriate participation of relevant parties for the commission-related development of assessments, and opportunity for comment on all important segments of the assessment procedure. The institute has to report on the progress and results of the work at regular intervals. The institute is held to giving the commission to external experts. Based on the legal framework, the institute must guarantee a high procedural transparency. Transparency of the whole process should be achieved, which is evidenced by clear reporting of procedures and criteria in all phases undertaken in the benefit assessment. The most important means of enhancing transparency are: 1. To implement a scoping process to support the development of the research question. 2. To separate the work of the external experts performing the evidence assessment from that of the institute formulating recommendations. Therefore, the preliminary report as produced by external experts needs to be public, and published separately from any subsequent amendments or (draft-) reports made by the institute, which includes the institute's recommendations. 3. To implement open peer review by publishing both the comments of the reviewers and their names. Based on the legal framework, the institute must provide for adequate participation of relevant parties. These include organisations representing the interests of patients; experts of medical, pharmaceutical and health economic science and practice; the professional organisations of pharmacists and pharmaceutical companies; and experts on alternative therapies. Patients and health care professionals bring in new insights with respect to research priorities, treatment and outcomes. The relevant parties should be identified and contacted whenever the global scope of the assessment has been drafted. Subsequently, the relevant parties should be involved in defining the research question, developing the protocol and commenting on the preliminary report. To implement the involvement of relevant parties in defining the research question a scoping process is suggested. For the other phases, written comments followed by an oral discussion should be used. Finally, the relevant parties {{should have the right to}} appeal the final decision on judicial grounds. None of these steps mean that the institute would lose any part of its scientific independence. From the relevant sections of the legal framework with respect to the assessment methods, it can be concluded that: 1. The institute must ensure that the assessment is made in accordance with internationally recognised standards of evidence-based medicine (EBM). 2. The assessment is conducted in comparison with other medicines and treatment forms under consideration of the additional therapeutic benefit for the patients. 3. The minimum criteria for assessing patient benefit are improvements in the state of health, shortening the duration of illness, extension of the duration of life, reduction of side effects and improvements in quality of life. EBM refers to the application of the best available evidence to answer a research question, which can inform questions about the care of patients. The optimal design, even for effectiveness questions, is not always the randomised, controlled trial (RCT) but depends on the research question and the outcomes of interest. To increase transparency for each question, the levels of evidence examined should be made explicit. There is no empirical evidence to support the use of cutoff points with respect to the number of studies before making recommendations. To get the best available evidence for the research question(s), all relevant evidence should be considered for each question, and the best available evidence should be used to answer the question. Separate levels of evidence may have to be used for each outcome. There are many ways in which bias can be introduced in systematic reviews. Some types of bias can be prevented, other types can only be reported and, for some, the influence of the bias can be investigated. Reviews must show that potential sources of bias have been dealt with adequately. Methods used by other agencies that perform benefit assessments are useful to interpret the term 'international standards' to which the institute must comply. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is a good example in this respect. NICE shows that it is possible to have transparent procedures for benefit assessments but that this requires detailed documentation. NICE has implemented an open procedure with respect to the comments of reviewers, which makes the procedure transparent. Although the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) in <b>Germany</b> invites <b>comments</b> on their protocol and preliminary report by posting them on their website, and comments are made public, the individual comments are not evaluated openly, and therefore it remains uncertain whether or not they lead to changes in the reports. The participation of relevant parties in the assessment process as implemented by NICE guarantees a process that is transparent to all relevant parties. Transparency of the whole process is assured by clear reporting of procedures and criteria in all phases undertaken in the benefit assessment. In a scoping process, a draft scope is commented on first in writing and subsequently in the form of a scoping workshop. In this way, all relevant aspects can be heard and included in the final scope. The protocol is then developed, followed by evidence assessment. The methods used should be completely reported to show readers that the assessment has been performed with scientific rigour and that bias has been prevented where possible. All relevant parties should have the opportunity to comment on the draft protocol and the draft preliminary report. Each comment should be evaluated as to whether or not it will lead to changes, and both the comments and the evaluation should be made public to ensure transparency of this process. The same procedure should be used for the peer-review phase. Based on the final report of the evidence assessment, the institute forms recommendations and the FJC appraises the evidence. During the writing of the final report, a separation between the evidence assessment and the evidence appraisal phase should be implemented. Ideally, this separation should be legally enforced to prevent any confusion about conflict of interests. Such a process guarantees a feasible combination of the legal requirements for transparency and involvement of relevant parties with international standards of EBM to ensure that the benefit assessments of medicines in Germany are performed according to the highest standards. status: publishe...|$|R
