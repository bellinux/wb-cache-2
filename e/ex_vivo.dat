25|$|Two basic methodologies are {{utilized}} to transfer vectors into target tissues; <b>Ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene transfer and In-vivo gene transfer.|$|E
25|$|The {{indirect}} <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> approach involves {{harvest of}} synovium, isolation {{and culture of}} synoviocytes, in vitro transduction, and injection of engineered synovicytes into the joint.|$|E
25|$|Genes may be {{delivered}} to synovium in animal models of RA and OA by direct, in vivo injection of vector or by indirect, <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> methods involving autologous synovial cells, skin fibroblasts, or other cell types such as mesenchymal stem cells.|$|E
25|$|One type of {{gene therapy}} {{in which the}} gene {{transfer}} takes place outside the patient's body is called <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene therapy. This method of gene therapy is more complicated but safer since {{it is possible to}} culture, test, and control the modified cells.|$|E
25|$|Human ALOX15 {{can also}} convert the peroxy PUFA {{intermediate}} to a cyclic ether with a three-atom ring, i.e. an epoxide intermediate that is {{attacked by a}} water molecule to form epoxy-hydrpoxy PUFA products. Eoxins stimulate vascular permeability in an <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> human vascular endothelial model system.|$|E
25|$|Most {{efficient}} {{methods of}} gene transfer to cartilage have involved <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> strategies using chondrocytes or chondroprogenitor cells. Chondrocytes are genetically enhanced by transferring complementary DNA encoding IL-1RA, IGF-1, or matrix break down inhibitors mentioned in Table 1. As discussed before, the transplanted cells {{could serve as}} an intra- articular source of therapeutic molecules.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of OA, the most {{attractive}} intra- articular sites for gene transfer are the synovium and the articular cartilage. Most experimental {{progress has been made}} with gene transfer to a convenient intra-articular tissue, such as the synovium, a tissue amenable to genetic modification by a variety of vectors, using both in vivo and <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> protocols.|$|E
25|$|Multiple ways of {{producing}} and obtaining tumour targeted T-cells have been developed. T-cells specific to a tumor antigen {{can be removed}} from a tumor sample (TILs) or filtered from blood. Subsequent activation and culturing is performed <b>ex</b> <b>vivo,</b> with the results reinfused. Activation can take place through gene therapy, or by exposing the T cells to tumor antigens.|$|E
25|$|Creatine and Uric acid {{levels are}} lower than normal, at least in women. <b>Ex</b> <b>vivo</b> CD4(+) T cells {{isolated}} from the circulation show a wrong TIM-3 (Immunoregulation) behavior, and relapses are associated with CD8(+) T Cells. There {{is a set of}} differentially expressed genes between MS and healthy subjects in peripheral blood T cells from clinically active MS patients. There are also differences between acute relapses and complete remissions. Platelets are known to have abnormal high levels.|$|E
25|$|Recently Multi-Photon Processing (MPP) was {{employed}} for in vivo expperiments by engineering artificial cartilage constructs. An <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> histological examination showed that certain pore geometry and the pre-growing of chondrocytes (Cho) prior to implantation significantly improves {{the performance of}} the created 3D scaffolds. The achieved biocompatibility was comparable to the commercially available collagen membranes. The successful outcome of this study supports the idea that hexagonal-pore-shaped hybrid organic-inorganic microstructured scaffolds in combination with Cho seeding may be successfully implemented for cartilage tissue engineering.|$|E
25|$|The eoxins (EXC4, EXD4, EXE5) are newly described. They stimulate {{vascular}} permeability in an <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> human vascular endothelial model system, {{and in a}} small {{study of}} 32 volunteers EXC4 production by eosinophils isolated from severe and aspirin-intolerant asthmatics was greater than that from healthy volunteers and mild asthmatic patients; these findings have been suggested {{to indicate that the}} eoxins have pro-inflammatory actions and therefore potentially involved in various allergic reactions. Production of eoxins by Reed-Sternburg cells has also led to suggestion that they are involve in Hodgkins disease. However, the clinical significance of eoxins has not yet been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Reductive Ventricular Omotherapy (RVOT) {{could be}} a novel {{treatment}} that manages cerebral edema {{without the use of}} osmotic agents. RVOT uses catheters permeable to water vapor to increase osmolarity of CSF. <b>Ex</b> <b>vivo</b> experiments have been carried out to test the efficiency of RVOT. RVOT is done locally, therefore, it's more likely to be efficient in severe cases of cerebral edema. Sweep gas, any gas used to flow through the hollow fiber, flows through RVOT cathether made up of hollow fiber with semipermeable walls to remove free, unbound water from ventricles in the form of water vapor.|$|E
25|$|Another {{gene that}} {{experiences}} {{a change in}} methylation status in atherosclerosis is the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT3), which produces a protein responsible for the transport of lactate and other ketone bodies out of many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. In atherosclerosis patients, there {{is an increase in}} methylation of the CpG islands in exon 2, which decreases MCT3 protein expression. The down regulation of MCT3 impairs lactate transport, and significantly increases smooth muscle cell proliferation, which further contributes to the atherosclerotic lesion. An <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> experiment using the demethylating agent Decitabine (5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine) was shown to induce MCT3 expression in a dose dependant manner, as all hypermethylated sites in the exon 2 CpG island became demethylated after treatment. This may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat atherosclerosis, although no human studies have been conducted thus far.|$|E
25|$|Dimethyltryptamine is an indole {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid L-tryptophan is produced endogenously where in animals L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid coming from diet. No matter the source of L-tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Tryptamine transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> {{to be among the}} most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} lifecycles {{of any of}} {{the species}} of Pneumocystis are not known, but presumably all resemble the others in the genus. The terminology follows zoological terms, rather than mycological terms, reflecting the initial misdetermination as a protozoan parasite. It is an extracellular parasite. All stages are found in lungs and because they cannot be cultured <b>ex</b> <b>vivo,</b> direct observation of living Pneumocystis is difficult. The trophozoite stage is thought to be equivalent to the so-called vegetative state of other species (such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe) which, like Pneumocystis, belong to the Taphrinomycotina branch of the fungal kingdom. The trophozoite stage is single-celled and appears amoeboid (multilobed) and closely associated with host cells. Globular cysts eventually form that have a thicker wall. Within these ascus-like cysts, eight spores form which are released through rupture of the cyst wall. The cysts often collapse forming crescent-shaped bodies visible in stained tissue. If meiosis takes place within the cysts, or what the genetic status is of the various cell types is not known for certain.|$|E
2500|$|Malaria {{culture is}} the method to grow malaria parasites outside the body i.e. in an <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> environment. Although {{attempts}} for propagation of the parasites outside of humans or animal models reach {{as far back as}} 1912, the success of the initial attempts was limited to one or just a few cycles. The first successful continuous culture was established in 1976. Initial hopes that the <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> culture would lead quickly to the discovery of a vaccine [...] were premature. However, the development of new drugs was greatly facilitated.|$|E
2500|$|While viral vectors are 40% more {{efficient}} in transferring genes, {{they are not}} fully appreciated for in vivo gene delivery because of their further adverse effects. Primarily, viral vectors induce an inflammatory response, which can cause minor side effects such as mild edema or serious ones like multisystem organ failure. It is also difficult to administer gene therapy repeatedly due to the immune system's enhanced response to viruses. Furthermore, viruses may spread out to other organs after intraarticular injection {{and this will be}} an important disadvantage. [...] However, majority of problems associated with gene delivery using viral vectors solved by <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene delivery method. In Osteoarthritis gene therapy, <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> method makes it possible to transfect not only the cells of the synovial lining of joints but also articular chondrocytes and chondroprogenitor cells in cartilage.|$|E
2500|$|A 2010 study {{published}} in the European medical journal Human Reproduction examined the prevalence of congenital cryptorchidism among offspring whose mothers had taken mild analgesics, primarily over-the-counter pain medications including ibuprofen (e.g. Advil) and paracetamol (acetaminophen). Combining the results from a survey of pregnant women prior to their due date in correlation with the health of their children and an <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> rat model, the study found [...] that pregnant women who had been exposed to mild analgesics had a higher prevalence of baby boys born with congenital cryptorchidism.|$|E
2500|$|Redi {{continued}} his experiments by capturing the maggots {{and waiting for}} them to metamorphose, which they did, becoming flies. [...] Also, when dead flies or maggots were put in sealed jars with dead animals or veal, no maggots appeared, but when the same thing was done with living flies, maggots did. Knowing full well the fates of outspoken thinkers such as Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei, Redi was careful to express his new views in a manner that would not contradict theological tradition of the Church; hence, his interpretations were always based on biblical passages, such as his famous adage: omne vivum <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> [...] ("All life comes from life").|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{method for}} the successful <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> propagation of P. falciparum described culture of the parasite under static conditions (Trager-Jensen method). James B. Jensen joined Trager’s laboratory as a post-doctoral fellow in 1976. [...] He decided to employ a candlejar instead of the [...] incubator. In the summer of 1976 Milton Friedman, {{a graduate student in}} the Trager lab who was working in the MRC laboratories in The Gambia, arranged for a sample of human blood infected with P. falciparum to be sent to New York City. This was diluted with RPMI 1640 (which {{turned out to be the}} best of the commercial media) in Petri dishes, placed in a candlejar and incubated. The line grew very well and became FCR-3/Gambia, one of the most widely used strains. Later, other lines would be established using similar methods and the impact of continuous cultivation of P. falciparum was phenomenal especially for the testing of putative antimalarials and for deciphering its genes. A number of subsequent reports (from as far back as the early 1980s), showed that cell suspension (using a shaking-incubator) significantly increased culture growth. Continuous agitation has also been shown to improve other parameters of culture growth relevant to researchers, such as the prolongation of culture synchrony after synchronization procedures, and a reduction of the rate of multiple infections. [...] Despite this, the practice of culturing the parasite under static conditions remains widespread. The greatest value of the candlejar method is that it can be used in laboratories almost anywhere in the world where there is an incubator, a candle and a desiccator. Around 60% parasitized cells can be obtained using optimized culturing conditions. Recent studies of P. falciparum isolated directly from infected patients indicate that alternative parasite biological states occur in the natural host that are not observed with <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> cultivated parasites.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{removal from}} donor and {{transplantation}} into the recipient the liver is cooled in an ice-cold preservation solution. The cold temperature slows down deterioration and solution {{is designed to}} counteract the unwanted effects of cold ischemia. Besides this method of static cold storage, various dynamic preservation methods are under development, including machine perfusion. Machine perfusion restores a flow through the liver while it's outside the body (<b>ex</b> <b>vivo).</b> This is currently being investigated at cold (hypothermic), body temperature (normothermic), and under body temperature (subnormothermic). Hypothermic machine perfusion has been used successfully at Columbia University and at the University of Zurich. A 2014 study published in Nature Medicine showed that the liver preservation time could be significantly extended using a technique called Supercooling, which preserves the liver at subzero temperatures (-6nbsp&°C) ...|$|E
6000|$|Nam certè <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> centauri non fit imago, [...] Nulla fuit quoniam talis natura animai: [...] Verùm ubi equi atque hominis, casu, convenit imago, [...] Hærescit facilè extemplò, &c.|$|E
6000|$|This {{hesitation}} about admitting {{the existence}} of such an animal as a centaur, be it observed, does not deserve reproach, as scepticism, but moderate praise, as mere scientific good faith. It need not imply, and it does not, so far as I am concerned, any a priori hypothesis that a centaur is an impossible animal; or, that his existence, if he did exist, would violate the laws of nature. Indubitably, the organisation of a centaur presents a variety of practical difficulties to an anatomist and physiologist; and a good many of those generalisations of our present experience, which we are pleased to call laws of nature, would be upset by the appearance of such an animal, so that we should have to frame new laws to cover our extended experience. Every wise man will admit that the possibilities of nature are infinite, and include centaurs; but he will not the less feel it his duty to hold fast, for the present, by the dictum of Lucretius, [...] "Nam certe <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> Centauri non fit imago," [...] and to cast the entire burthen of proof, that centaurs exist, on the shoulders of those who ask him to believe the statement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ex</b> <b>vivo</b> {{reconstruction}}, {{short for}} <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> renal artery reconstruction and autotransplantation, {{is a technique}} mainly used for complex disease involving multiple segmental branches in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia. In <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> reconstruction, temporary nephrectomy and <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> repair with microvascular techniques followed by autotransplantation allows the precise repair of such lesions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ex</b> <b>vivo</b> (Latin: [...] "out of the living") {{means that}} {{which takes place}} outside an organism. In science, <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> refers to {{experimentation}} or measurements done in or on tissue from an organism in an external environment with minimal alteration of natural conditions. <b>Ex</b> <b>vivo</b> conditions allow experimentation on an organism's cells or tissues under more controlled conditions than is possible in in vivo experiments (in the intact organism), {{at the expense of}} altering the [...] "natural" [...] environment.|$|E

50|$|In cell biology, <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> {{procedures}} often involve {{living cells}} or tissues taken from an organism and cultured {{in a laboratory}} apparatus, usually under sterile conditions with no alterations, for up to 24 hours to obtain sufficient cells for the experiments. Experiments generally start after 24 hours of incubation. Using living cells or tissue from the same organism are still considered to be <b>ex</b> <b>vivo.</b> One widely performed <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> study is the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. In this assay, angiogenesis is promoted on the CAM membrane of a chicken embryo outside the organism (chicken).|$|E
