5000|$|The most {{significant}} {{distinction between a}} PC company and a monopoly is that the monopoly has a downward-sloping demand curve rather than the [...] "perceived" [...] perfectly <b>elastic</b> <b>curve</b> of the PC company. Practically all the variations mentioned above relate to this fact. If there is a downward-sloping demand curve then by necessity there is a distinct marginal revenue curve. The implications of this fact are best made manifest with a linear demand curve. Assume that the inverse demand curve is of the form x = a − by. Then the total revenue curve is TR = ay − by2 and the marginal revenue curve is thus MR = a − 2by. From this several things are evident. First the marginal revenue curve has the same y intercept as the inverse demand curve. Second {{the slope of the}} marginal revenue curve is twice that of the inverse demand curve. Third the x intercept of the marginal revenue curve is half that of the inverse demand curve. What is not quite so evident is that the marginal revenue curve is below the inverse demand curve at all points. Since all companies maximise profits by equating MR and MC it must be the case that at the profit-maximizing quantity MR and MC are less than price, which further implies that a monopoly produces less quantity at a higher price than if the market were perfectly competitive.|$|E

40|$|Ejiri's torus in S^ 5 is {{the first}} example of Willmore surface which is not conformally {{equivalent}} to any minimal surface in any space forms. Li and Vrancken classified all Willmore surfaces of tensor product in S^n by reducing them into <b>elastic</b> <b>curves</b> in S^ 3, and the Ejiri torus appeared as a special example. In this paper, we first prove that among all Willmore tori of tensor product, the Willmore functional of the Ejiri torus in S^ 5 attains the minimum 2 π^ 2 √(3). Then we show that all Willmore tori of tensor product are unstable when the co-dimension is big enough. We also show that the Ejiri torus is unstable in S^ 5. Moreover, similar to Li and Vrancken, we classify all constrained Willmore surfaces of tensor product by reducing them with <b>elastic</b> <b>curves</b> in S^ 3.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of an <b>elastic</b> <b>curve</b> bound to a surface will reflect {{the geometry of}} its environment. This may occur in an obvious way: the curve may deform freely along directions tangent to the surface, but not along the surface normal. However, even if the energy itself is symmetric in the curve’s geodesic and normal curvatures, which control these modes, very distinct roles are played by the two. If the <b>elastic</b> <b>curve</b> binds preferentially on one side, or is itself assembled on the surface, not only would one expect the bending moduli associated with the two modes to differ, binding along specific directions, reflected in spontaneous values of these curvatures, may be favored. The shape equations describing the equilibrium states of a surface curve described by an elastic energy accommodating environmental factors will be identified by adapting the method of Lagrange multipliers to the Darboux frame associated with the curve. The forces transmitted to the surface along the surface normal will be determined. Features associated {{with a number of}} different energies, both of physical relevance and of mathematical interest, are described.
