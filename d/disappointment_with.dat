5|$|Elvis Is Back! was {{released}} on April 8, 1960, in stereo and monaural versions. The album reached number two on Billboards Top LP's and topped the UK Albums Chart.

5|$|In {{spite of}} good {{critical}} reception, the film {{did not perform}} very well at the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically.

By early August 2009, the film had in fact been seen by {{more people in the}} United States than in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} <b>disappointment</b> <b>with</b> his second-place {{finish and}} {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 1849, Nicolae Bălcescu {{met with}} Kossuth in Debrecen, and, despite his {{personal}} <b>disappointment</b> <b>with</b> the Hungarian discourse and his ideal of full political rights for Romanians in the region, agreed to mediate an understanding with Iancu, {{which resulted in}} a ceasefire and a series of political concessions.

5|$|Thorpe {{returned}} to {{competition at the}} New South Wales Championships in December 2005. He raced in the 200m and stated his intention to retire after the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Thorpe announced that due to a desire {{to concentrate on the}} 100m freestyle, he had dropped his pet event, the 400m. He was unmoved by national coach Alan Thompson, who implored him to continue swimming the event. In February, Thorpe qualified for the 2006 Commonwealth Games by winning the 100m and 200m freestyle in times of 49.24s and 1min 46.42s respectively. He expressed <b>disappointment</b> <b>with</b> his performances; he speculated that he may have misjudged his new training schedule and anticipated further improvement.|$|E
5|$|Virgin America's founder Richard Branson {{expressed}} <b>disappointment</b> <b>with</b> {{the merger}} between Alaska Airlines and the airline he founded. In July 2016, Virgin America's shareholders approved the merger, leaving the {{approval by the}} United States Department of Justice as the only foreseeable hurdle. In September 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Alaska Airlines by consumers to block the merger between the two carriers, which the Alaska Air Group settled in court in December 2016. Subsequently, the Department of Justice approved the merger, which was completed on December 14. Following the acquisition, the {{former chief financial officer}} of Alaska Airlines, Peter Hunt, became the president of Virgin America, while the former chief operating officer and president of Alaska Airlines, Ben Minicucci, became the chief executive officer.|$|E
5|$|At the Great City Games in Manchester, England in May, he set {{his sights}} on {{breaking}} Tommie Smith's 44-year-old world best mark over a 200m straight. He beat Smith's time of 19.5 by finishing in 19.41seconds – including a first 100m of 9.88 and a first 150m of 14.41seconds. He suffered from hamstring difficulty after the run but returned to compete at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon in July – his first meeting of the 2010 IAAF Diamond League. Running over 200m, he finished in 19.76seconds but was beaten to the line by Walter Dix, who returned from a year-long hiatus. A week later he attended the British Grand Prix and, in spite of poor conditions, he gained a victory over his rival Asafa Powell with a 9.93-second run. He set a meet record of 19.72seconds at the Herculis meeting in Monaco later that month, but expressed <b>disappointment</b> <b>with</b> his race execution as Yohan Blake came close to overhauling him at the finish.|$|E

Upon close inspection, and within the broader context of book history in Spain, the poem brings to light a quiet ambivalence about book ownership.

5|$|Montejo was {{appointed}} alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor) of Tabasco in 1529, and pacified that province {{with the aid}} of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo. D'Avila was sent from eastern Yucatán to conquer Acalan, which extended southeast of the Laguna de Terminos. Montejo the Younger founded Salamanca de Xicalango as a base of operations. In 1530 D'Avila established Salamanca de Acalán as a base from which to launch new attempts to conquer Yucatán. Salamanca de Acalán proved a <b>disappointment,</b> <b>with</b> no gold for the taking and with lower levels of population than had been hoped. D'Avila soon abandoned the new settlement and set off across the lands of the Kejache to Champotón, arriving there towards the end of 1530. During a colonial power struggle in Tabasco, the elder Montejo was imprisoned for a time. Upon his release, he met up with his son in Xicalango, Tabasco, and they then both rejoined d'Avila at Champotón.|$|E

5|$|On 19 January 1957, Jordan {{signed the}} Arab Solidarity Agreement (ASA) with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria which entailed those countries' {{financial}} assistance to replace the annual British aid to Jordan that ended with the abrogation of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty in November 1956 (the treaty was officially and mutually abrogated in March 1957). However, implementation of the ASA was hindered by Egypt and Syria's inability or unwillingness to subsidize the Jordanian army, whose budget rivaled that of their own armies. Furthermore, by then, Abu Nuwar was steadily losing Hussein's confidence due to dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar among the army brass and the negative effects that his anti-Western hostility was having on relations with Jordan's principal Western allies, the UK and US; Hussein viewed the latter two as much-needed alternatives of financial support to Jordan in lieu of his <b>disappointment</b> <b>with</b> the ASA.|$|E
5|$|The Clan Class {{was based}} upon the Britannia Class design, {{incorporating}} a smaller boiler and various weight-saving measures to increase the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive for its intended area of operations, the west of Scotland. The Clan Class received a mixed reception from crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving favourable reports as regards performance. However, trials {{in other areas of}} the British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive made it hard to adhere to timetables. Reports exist that suggest a degree of the <b>disappointment</b> <b>with</b> these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they were only a Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
5|$|Despite its <b>disappointment</b> <b>with</b> {{the award}} of Paris Tribunal of Arbitration, Venezuela abided by it. However, {{half a century}} later the {{publication}} of an alleged political deal between Russia and Britain led Venezuela to re-assert its claims. In 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government the Memorandum of Severo Mallet-Prevost (Official Secretary of the U.S./Venezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration), written in 1944 to be published only after Mallet-Prevost's death. This re-opened the issues, with Mallet-Prevost surmising a political deal between Russia and Britain from the subsequent private behaviour of the judges. Mallet-Prevost said that Martens had visited England with the two British arbitrators in the summer of 1899, and subsequently had offered the two American judges a choice between accepting a unanimous award along the lines ultimately agreed, or a 3:2 majority opinion even more favourable to the British. The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3:2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately went along with Martens in order to avoid depriving Venezuela of valuable territory to which it was entitled.|$|E
