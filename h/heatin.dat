Plants respond to high {{ambient temperature}}s by several architectural adaptations, collectively called the High Temperature Acclimation Response (HTAR). Despite the important societal and economic impact of these adaptations, the molecular mechanisms underlying HTAR and thermosensing are hardly understood. I have identified a novel growth regulator that enhances HTAR using a chemical genetics screen. This novel growth regulator, named <b>Heatin,</b> does not affect plant growth under control temperatures. In this project, I propose to use <b>Heatin</b> to understand the mechanisms underlying HTAR. I propose to identify the plant protein targets of <b>Heatin</b> and to uncover genetic networks targeted by <b>Heatin.</b> A transcriptome analysis will reveal genes regulated by <b>Heatin.</b> In addition, a genome-wide association study that links genomic loci to the <b>Heatin</b> response will be performed. This information will be combined with the transcriptomics results. Genes that are transcriptionally regulated by <b>Heatin</b> and map to genes/genomic loci associated with <b>Heatin</b> sensitivity, and the genes coding for Heatin’s protein targets, will be studied in detail to understand their role in HTAR. Such analysis will deliver novel insights in the molecular networks how plants regulate HTAR.
