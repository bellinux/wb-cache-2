5|$|Although the {{increase}} in jobs for women has had benefits in policy changes for families with working parents, there has been debates about {{the conditions of the}} work places. In Mexico, there is an influx of the maquila industry, which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations. The mostly female workforce is often <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> having unsafe working conditions, and stress is a major cause of many illnesses of these women.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} day dawned, the 9th SS Panzer Division {{continued}} to reinforce the German blocking line. Krafft's unit withdrew overnight and joined Spindler's line, coming under his command. Spindler's force was now becoming so large as more men and units arrived at the new front, that {{he was forced to}} split it into two battle groups: Kampfgruppes Allworden and Harder. The defensive line now blocked the entire western side of Arnhem and had closed the gap <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> Frost alongside the river the previous evening.|$|E
5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than at {{the other}} gates, so that Khalid {{would be unable to}} move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success were achieved in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E

5|$|Even before Adolf Hitler {{seized control}} of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were evident. Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their complaints were <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> interested parties with ulterior motives, and the League interfered as little as possible. The system suffered an apparent death blow with Poland's rejection of its treaty in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} {{proposals}} to examine nuclear {{power as a}} possible response to climate change, anti-nuclear campaigners and scientists in Australia emphasised claims that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself could become {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Anti-nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors: fears <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> anti-nuclear power political parties in the lead-up to a national election in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, others found his personality to be annoying and obnoxious, while panning his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered to be among the most appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E

5|$|Generally {{the bedrock}} of {{the west of the}} town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies {{to the west of the}} town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E
5|$|Hsp90 is <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> {{cancer cells}} to support {{activated}} oncoproteins, including many kinases and transcription factors. These clients are often mutated, amplified or translocated in malignancy, and Hsp90 works to buffer these cellular stresses induced by malignant transformation. Inhibition of Hsp90 {{leads to the}} degradation or instability of many of its client proteins. Thus, Hsp90 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus {{was heavily}} <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> American and European sealers and whalers, {{leading to the}} near {{extirpation}} of the Atlantic population.

5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} this interaction, Presley and Jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both felt they had missed out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having {{spent most of their}} lives feeling <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E
5|$|Public {{interest}} in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> members of the upper class. This attitude reached its climax {{a few years later}} when Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Versailles {{stipulated that}} Germany must {{relinquish}} {{several of its}} territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliationâthey especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war. The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later <b>exploited</b> <b>by</b> Hitler for political gain.|$|E
