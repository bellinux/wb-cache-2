40|$|The term ‘filling in’ was {{developed}} in the context of research into UK devolution in order to move beyond the literature on the ‘hollowing out’ of the national state. We critically unpack the concept of <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> and assess its value, identifying three main ambiguities. First, we emphasise the need to distinguish between what we term structural and relational forms of <b>filling</b> <b>in,</b> ensuring a clear analytical separation between structure and agency. Second, we examine the associated scalar politics of devolution, arguing that <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> and hollowing out are not scale-specific processes. Third, we distinguish between <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> as originally advanced, which is time-specific in relation to the process of devolution, and ‘pure’ forms of <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> which can be seen as time-neutral. <b>In</b> abstracting <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> from the context of devolution in this way, our purpose is to render it capable of wider application to the study of other processes of state restructuring...|$|R
