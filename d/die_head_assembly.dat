30|$|The {{manufacture}} of HDPE pipes of 32  mm outer diameter involves an extrusion process for extruding a hollow pipe using blow molding technique. The elements required for extrusion process are the extruding machine setup and PolyEthylene (PE) granules. The selected {{material for the}} pipe (PE granules) is first heated in the mixer machine. After attaining the required temperature, it is manually fed into the extruder machine through a feeder. Here, the material enters into the long barrel of the machine where the material is fed all through the process through the feeding zone, melts in the melting zone and is pushed into the <b>die</b> <b>head</b> in the pushing zone. Here, the barrel {{is divided into three}} zones to maintain equal material flow rate throughout the process. For this purpose, a rotating screw is fixed inside the barrel (which would be almost the size of the barrel). This screw pushes the material from the feeder to the <b>die</b> <b>head.</b> The <b>die</b> <b>head</b> is fixed, based on the diameter of the pipe required. At this <b>die</b> <b>head,</b> pressurized air is sent in between the material for attaining hollow shape. The pipe coming out of the <b>die</b> <b>head</b> is cooled using cooling water supply for the solidification purpose. Proper cooling temperature should be maintained for the solidification and smooth finish of the pipe at the <b>die</b> <b>head.</b> The pipe coming out of <b>die</b> <b>head</b> is first sent into the cooling tank and then it is pulled by the take-off machine. The speed of the take-off machine is set based on the required pipe thickness. This pipe will be further sent for pressure testing to test the withstanding pressure. HDPE plastic pipes are mainly used for transportation of water {{from one place to another}} place. Hence, these pipes undergo tremendous pressure by water. Higher withstanding pressure is supposed to result in a better condition of the pipe. Therefore, the withstanding pressure should be set the higher the better.|$|R

5000|$|Tape motion on many systems was bidirectional, i.e. tape {{could be}} read either forward or {{backward}} {{at the request of}} the controlling computer. Because the supply vacuum column kept a small, constant tension in the reverse direction, the capstan could feed backwards without the tape bunching up or jumping out of path.

The print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> is positioned {{in a controlled manner}} relative to a working plane, and is connected to two reservoir containers (2, 3, 4) in which liquid to paste-like photolinkable materials each having a different photosensitivity level are stored. The respective material is delivered via the print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> to the selected locations in the region of the working plane. The device comprises a print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> (1), a radiation source assembly, and a heat source controllable by a control unit acting on a thermal photolinkable material layer separated on a working plane (E). The print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> is positioned in a controlled manner relative to the working plane, and is connected to two reservoir containers (2, 3, 4) in which liquid to paste-like photolinkable materials each having a different photosensitivity level are stored. The respective material is delivered via the print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> to the selected locations in the region of the working plane. The radiation source assembly emits electromagnetic radiation in an areal manner depending upon the photosensitivity of the photolinkable material that is delivered to selected locations on the working plane. The radiation source assembly comprises a laser light source (L) as a single radiation source whose laser beam is focused with the aid of an optical unit for beam deflection- and focusing into a region of the photolinkable material layer, which is delivered in an areal manner onto the working plane by the print <b>head</b> <b>assembly,</b> and initiates two-photon or multi-photon processes in the focus region within the photolinkable material layer. The two-photon or multi-photon processes lead to the solidification of the photolinkable material in the selected locations. The radiation source assembly comprises a first radiation source irradiating in the areal manner onto the working plane. The first radiation source: emits an electromagnetic radiation having a first wavelength or a first wavelength spectrum, which differs from the wavelength of the laser beam; and comprises a LED or diode array or an other light source having limited spectral regions. The optical unit producing a widening laser beam is present in the device by which a laser beam cross-section is expandable to a flat illumination of the photolinkable material that is delivered to the selected locations on the working plane. An optical switching element is provided that supplies laser beam either the unit for beam deflection- and focusing or the laser beam. The optical unit reducing a light intensity of the widening laser beam is introduced in an optical path of the laser beam. The print head assembly: is formed for discharging the photolinkable materials such that the photolinkable material is delivered on the working plane under formation of a flat layer with a uniform layer thickness and a flat surface layer; and comprises pressure nozzles (5, 6) arranged along a line by which the photolinkable material is uniformly delivered. A non-contact working measuring system is provided that detects the layer thickness and/or a layer surface quality of the photolinkable material layer deposited on the working plane. A control unit is provided that controls {{on the basis of a}} target/actual-comparison of the print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> in a trap of faulty layer thickness and/or the layer surface quality to corrective measures. The photolinkable material is stored in an other photolinkable structure material, an other reservoir unit, and a support material. The support- and the photolinkable structure material are delivered via two different pressure nozzles of the printhead assembly to the selected locations on the respective material of the common working plane. The photolinkable material is stockpiled in the other reservoir unit by which the printhead assembly is delivered in an other working plane.
