500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, Ford {{promised to}} release a [...] "real {{comeback}} album" [...] {{later in the year}} with drummer Chuck Spradlin, saying that 2009's nu metal-inspired Wicked Wonderland, {{was too much of a}} collective project with ex-husband Jim Gillette. [...] "A lot of people have told me that they want a real Lita Ford album, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean. They are going to get it", she was quoted as saying at the time.|$|E

6000|$|In silence {{they crossed}} the lawn together. Once only ere they reached the house, her ladyship looked back. [...] "I would <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are plotting," [...] she said through her teeth.|$|R
60|$|They changed {{clothes at}} the cottage. I could repeat {{the words in}} my mind, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> meant of themselves, but I {{attached}} no meaning to them in any other connexion.|$|R
60|$|What {{need to tell}} me that! I {{had never}} seen one of that kind in all my life, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were and for <b>what</b> purpose <b>they</b> had come. I grasped the elbows of my chair, and neither spoke nor moved.|$|R
60|$|MISS T. A little--not very much. I can't doctor them, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{ought to}} eat, and I am {{in charge of}} our stable.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for that," [...] said Angela. [...] "I {{particularly}} dislike receiving apologies, even when <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are for. What yours are for, I can't imagine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, come," [...] said Newman. [...] "I {{am not a}} barbarian, by a good deal. I am {{very much}} the reverse. I have seen barbarians; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are." ...|$|E
50|$|Tears, idle tears, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't, my lord: quite different. I've none of thim ideas at all, {{and never}} had, thank God. <b>I</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> we can do, and <b>I</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can do:--breed a hoss in Ireland, train {{him in the}} North of England, and run him in the South; and he'll do your work for you, and win your money, steady and shure." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had on a}} long {{frock coat}} that reached nearly to his knees. He was leading a little {{procession}} of very heavy men in morning coats, upstairs towards the private luncheon rooms. They moved like a funeral, puffing as they went. I had seen company directors before and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were at sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is very interesting," [...] Mr. Sabin remarked. [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were? To be {{permitted}} {{a glimpse into}} the inward workings of a brain like yours is indeed a privilege!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shan't {{be sure of}} that," [...] I returned, [...] "till <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think! However, I repeat," [...] I added, [...] "that I shouldn't {{even then}} care. I don't mind admitting that she much {{interests}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father has}} been on the prairies, where there's lots of wild ones, but he didn't hear 'em speak. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want without talkin'," [...] {{answered}} Ben, suspecting a joke, but not exactly seeing what it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{understand}} anything noble! No, indeed! They think every one like their own beautiful brother! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> came {{for all the}} time; {{they wanted to know}} whether Norman was able to work these holidays, and you told them the very thing they wanted to hear. How they will rejoice with that Harvey, and make sure of the Randall!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1948, Davis {{was cast}} in the melodrama Winter Meeting. Although she was {{initially}} enthusiastic, she soon learned that Warner had arranged for [...] "softer" [...] lighting {{to be used to}} disguise her age. She recalled that she had seen the same lighting technique [...] "on the sets of Ruth Chatterton and Kay Francis, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> meant". She began to regret accepting the role.|$|R
60|$|Auberon. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{put on the}} posters; but {{the plays}} are written and acted--produced with great success.|$|R
6000|$|He {{admitted}} {{after an}} instant {{that there was}} something in that. [...] "But how can I face them till <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are? Do you want him," [...] he then braced himself to ask, [...] "to marry your daughter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|After a pause he said: [...] "Look here, I've {{never seen}} you before; but you shall judge of the whole story. Old Putnam and I were friends in the same mess; but, owing to some {{accidents}} on the Afghan border, I got my command much sooner than most men; only we were both invalided home for a bit. I was engaged to Audrey out there; and we all travelled back together. But on the journey back things happened. Curious things. The result of them was that Putnam wants it broken off, and even Audrey keeps it hanging on--and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think I am. So do you.|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{nothing to}} drink out of, only common wine-glasses; and it's my belief Jemima 'd never cook a dinner as he'd look at. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are,--them sort of young men. They're {{worse than a}} dozen ladies {{when you come to}} vittels." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{mention of}} money cast a chill upon their talk; and Mrs. Lander said gloomily, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> as <b>I</b> ca'e {{so much for}} that will Mr. Milray made for me, after all. I did want to say ten {{thousand}} apiece for Mr. Landa's relations; but I hated to befo'e him; I'd told the whole kit of 'em so much about you, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would think." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{the first}} few bubbles of boiling lava rose level at last with {{the top of the}} Floor of the Hawaiians, I caught the final words of their triumphant song. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> meant; they were simple and easy. [...] "Pélé has avenged herself on the WHITE MAN'S FOOT; the White Man's Foot that trod her floor; we offer up the white man's body in expiation to Pélé." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the very}} thing. It's what the women's pages call atmosphere. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> meant before. That house has beautiful, sweet atmosphere--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, señor, I {{should not}} like it at all. I don't care how full of bats the rooms are, now that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are. As for Dias, I {{have no doubt that}} the first time he heard them he was just as frightened." ...|$|E
6000|$|SHE: [...] "Oh, respect--reverence! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean in {{the mouths}} of men. If you respected, if you reverenced me, could you dare to tell me, after my {{unguarded}} trust of you during the past months, that you had been all the time secretly in love with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you feel}} them pipes getting hot," [...] {{he said to}} them, [...] "I warn you to stop. I have been in {{countries}} where there are volcanoes, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are. There's enough of them in this world, and there's no need of making new ones." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least. <b>I</b> always <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will say. <b>I</b> can't at all {{guess what}} this Mr. Deronda would say. What does he say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she announced, [...] "we use {{olive oil}} in our cooking, so we must be dagoes. <b>I</b> never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were before. <b>I</b> thought it was slang." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> about Californians. They were Americans, all right. But {{they were}} not miners. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were, and was very glad to see their backs." ...|$|R
6000|$|Re-entering the drawing-room, she {{had found}} that Owen had thrust the obnoxious letters into the waste-basket, each unopened envelope, with the contents, rent down the middle.

60|$|Then I {{pulled my}} horse round and rode ahead. As I went, my ears being very quick, I heard {{the other two}} talking together. At least, I suppose that I heard them; at any rate, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> said, although, strangely enough, nothing at all comes back to me of their tale of an attack upon a ship or of what then I {{did or did not}} do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor his dog, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor {{anything}} that is his, except--except, Lily, the dearest friend that he has {{on the face of}} the earth. He cannot have a friend that will go further for him than I will. He will never know how far I will go to serve him. You don't know his people. Nor do I know them. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are. His sister is married to a marquis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Priests!" [...] {{said the}} old man with sudden passion. [...] "Priests! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> 'un. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> want in England? That's what I say. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> want in England?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know, sir,' {{answered}} Dolly, {{not sure}} {{but he was}} bantering her; 'I can't say. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> might wish at home. I couldn't give an opinion, sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> only <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> said, {{we could}} have such happy times together. How can I ever learn?" [...] sighed Betty, as she was driving Daisy home one day at sunset.|$|R
