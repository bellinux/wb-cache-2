Corbett was Vice-President) and with Corbett serving as the US Senator in Washington from 1867-1873, the combination of their other duties, business acumen and constant drive in recognising new opportunities, meant that their interests went beyond the wholesale market. In February 1871, Corbett’s (previously H.W. Corbett & Co.) and Failing’s (originally J. <b>Failing</b> <b>and</b> Co. <b>and</b> then <b>Failing</b> <b>and</b> Hatt) dry goods and hardware businesses were amalgamated into a new major partnership, Corbett, <b>Failing</b> <b>and</b> Co., which became the largest wholesale hardware business in the Pacific Northwest.|$|R

5|$|Ireland– February 2011– After a high {{deficit in}} the government's budget in 2010 and the {{uncertainty}} surrounding the proposed bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the 30th Dáil (parliament) collapsed the following year, {{which led to a}} subsequent general election, collapse of the preceding government parties, Fianna <b>Fáil</b> <b>and</b> the Green Party, the resignation of the Taoiseach Brian Cowen {{and the rise of the}} Fine Gael party, which formed a government alongside the Labour Party in the 31st Dáil, which led to a change of government and the appointment of Enda Kenny as Taoiseach.|$|E

5|$|On June 18, 1998, {{a severe}} storm damaged the estate. Heavy rains caused the {{drainage}} system to <b>fail</b> <b>and</b> {{a cascade of}} water surged over the retaining wall. This caused a mudslide, damaging the estate's foundation. Furthermore, the large oak tree {{at the center of}} the courtyard fell down on top of the house. The next year, another storm collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing. A 1999 grant from Save America's Treasures helped defray costs to re-roof Taliesin III, to stabilize its foundation, and to connect it to a local sewage treatment plant.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should <b>fail,</b> <b>and</b> also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E

A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.|$|E

Thomas Clarkson continued to travel, visiting anti-slavery groups throughout Britain, motivating activists and acting as an ambassador for the anti-slavery cause to other countries, while Buxton pursued the cause of reform in Parliament. Public meetings and petitions demanding emancipation continued, with an increasing number supporting immediate abolition rather than the gradual approach favoured by Wilberforce, Clarkson and their colleagues.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1965, Buddhist {{protests against}} junta-appointed {{civilian}} Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương broke out across South Vietnam. The unrest came after Huong had unveiled {{plans to expand}} conscription and {{the war against the}} communists, and demonstrations were at their largest in I Corps, a Buddhist and anti-war escalation stronghold. In Huế, matters degenerated into a riot as 5,000 demonstrators attacked the United States Information Service Library and burned 8,000 books. Khánh and Thi were thought to have {{turned a blind eye to}} the rioting in order to allow the disorder to ruin the Huong government and allow them to inherit power. Khánh decided to have the armed forces replace Huong, and on the morning of 27 January, Khánh staged a bloodless putsch with the support of Thi and Kỳ. However, many of the officers had agreed to Khánh's plan in hopes he would <b>fail</b> <b>and</b> discredit himself.|$|E

The first known road that reached the settlement was established in 1804, when land along a highway from St. Lawrence County {{to the town of}} Chester in Warren County was populated by the West family. Minerva was mainly limited to the vicinity of the old highway, but as more people settled along the road, the town began to grow. For a time, the town boasted several water-powered sawmills, and the highway was used to transport lumber. However, the lumber industry began to <b>fail,</b> <b>and</b> by 1840, the logging and lumber system had been replaced by crops. The town initiated river drives, which continued until 1950.|$|E
