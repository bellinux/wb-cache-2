5|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the origin of the}} rings. One <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.|$|E

40|$|As {{the title}} of the thesis indicates, I {{addressed}} the number of the staff and their qualification representation at the individual departments of the hospital in Písek. I cooperated with head nurses as well as other nursing staff in the hospital and acquired information from them. The first <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> that the number of the nursing staff work load at standard surgical departments corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed as the average number of staff at surgical departments was higher than the methodology states. The second <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> that the number of the nursing staff work load at standard internal departments corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. The number of staff at internal departments was also higher than the recommendations of the method; neurology was the only department where the number of staff was lower than recommended. The second <b>hypothesis</b> also <b>was</b> not confirmed. The third <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> that the number of the nursing staff work load at nursing beds corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. The number of the staff at nursing beds was higher than recommended by the method. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The fourth <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> that the qualification representation of the nursing staff at standard surgical departments corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The fifth <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> that the qualification representation of the nursing staff at standard internal departments does not correspond with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed. The last, sixth <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> that the qualification representation of nursing staff at nursing beds does not correspond with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method and this <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> also confirmed. I believe that the thesis can be used in practice as a template and groundwork for determining the correct number and qualification representation of nursing staff at various medical facilities...|$|R

The other objective was {{to find out what}} kinds of complicated deliveries occur in Nemocnice Písek, a. s. /Písek Hospital/ the most. <b>Hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> set for the objectives. The first <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to confirm that birth injuries after complicated childbirth are healed per secundam. The second <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to confirm that women after complicated childbirth feel that they will not manage care for their family. The third <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to confirm problems with economic support of a family in the cases of single mothers after complicated childbirth.

5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} Anahim hotspot is {{supplied}} by a miniplume.

Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Reality of {{cooperation}} of a stoma nurse with shift nurses Pernicious diseases of intestines and rectum {{often lead to}} creation of a temporary or permanent intestinal outlet alias stoma. Having been diagnosed, the patient is confided {{to the care of}} healthcare workers, in particular nurses, who endeavour to provide the patient with the highest possible quality care in the most intensive manner. At present, almost every hospital has a specially trained stoma nurse who should play the role of an advisor or coordinator in the nursing team. Regrettably, non-cooperation between shift nurses and the stoma nurse harm in particular the patient. Five <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> raised. The first <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to confirm whether the shift nurses on surgical wards cooperate with the stoma nurse more efficiently than the shift nurses in other than surgical wards. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed. The second <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to confirm whether the stoma nurse provides the shift nurses with regular information on developments in the concerned area. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The third <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to confirm whether the shift nurses cooperate with the stoma nurse as early as in the period before the operation; this <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> aimed at surgical nurses and was not confirmed. The fourth <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> to verify whether the shift nurses have sufficient information from the stoma nurse so that they could substitute her adequately when she <b>is</b> absent. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The fifth hypothesis verified whether the shift nurses ask the stoma nurse to provide them with information concerning correct handling of the stomal equipment. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The data were collected in the quantitative research supplemented with an interview with the stoma nurse. The shift nurses in surgical and non-operational wards obtained anonymous questionnaires. The research was conducted in seven hospitals in the Region of South Bohemia. The objectives were fulfilled. The information will be provided to deputy managers for the nursing care and stoma nurses. We believe that our results may contribute to higher efficiency of the cooperation between nurses, which will {{have a positive impact on}} provision of comprehensive care of patients with a stoma...|$|R

50|$|The first <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> that motor neglect {{may be due}} to {{a deficit}} in, or {{inhibition}} of, automatic actions involving the right hand.

5|$|The nebular <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} widely {{accepted}} model {{in the field of}} cosmogony to explain the formation and evolution of the Solar System (as well as other planetary systems). It suggests that the Solar System formed from nebulous material. The theory was developed by Immanuel Kant and published in his Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels ("Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens"), published in 1755. Originally applied to the Solar System, the process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the Universe. The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) or solar nebular model. It offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System, including the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of the planets, and their motion {{in the same direction as}} the Sun's rotation. Some elements of the nebular hypothesis are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation, but most elements have been superseded.|$|E
