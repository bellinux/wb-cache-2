5000|$|In his {{investigations}} of the peculiar manner in which iron filings arrange themselves on a cardboard or glass in proximity to the poles of a magnet, Faraday conceived the idea of magnetic [...] "lines of force" [...] extending from pole to pole of the magnet and along which the filings tend to place themselves. On the discovery being made that magnetic effects accompany the passage of an electric current in a wire, it was also assumed that similar magnetic lines of force whirled around the wire. For convenience and to account for induced electricity it was then assumed that when these lines of force are [...] "cut" [...] by a wire in passing across them or when the lines of force in rising and <b>falling</b> <b>cut</b> the wire, a current of electricity is developed, or to be more exact, an electromotive force is developed in the wire that sets up a current in a closed circuit. Faraday advanced what has been termed the molecular theory of electricity which assumes that electricity is the manifestation of a peculiar condition of the molecule of the body rubbed or the ether surrounding the body. Faraday also, by experiment, discovered paramagnetism and diamagnetism, namely, that all solids and liquids are either attracted or repelled by a magnet. For example, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium, etc., are paramagnetic (attracted by magnetism), whilst other substances, such as bismuth, phosphorus, antimony, zinc, etc., are repelled by magnetism or are diamagnetic.|$|E
30|$|This general process {{facilitates}} {{the conversion of}} an alien community to a natural forest through selective removal of the invading nurse trees, when the nurse trees have relatively small stem diameters. However, sometimes the nurse stand is composed of large, branchy and useful trees {{of one or more}} alien tree species {{that could be used for}} timber, poles, fuelwood or charcoal (Geldenhuys & Bezuidenhout 2011). The first priority would then be to remove all utilizable stems before the rehabilitation actions are implemented. The non-harvestable tree debris could be left on site but in sections not longer than 2  m (as bird perch sites, as micro-sites for seedling establishment and small animals and micro-organisms, to protect seedlings against browsers, and as a slow-release ‘fertilizer’ through natural wood decomposition). However, if such an alien tree stand grows inside the riparian zone or on the banks of a river, then the first priority would be the safety and security of the river in terms of people’s lives, infrastructure (bridges, pipelines, water pumps, etc.), and ecotourism activities on and along the river. Then all alien trees should be removed in one action to prevent stream blockage during flooding, by drifting branch wood and deformed non-harvestable main stems, which may cause associated increased flood levels and infrastructure damage. If good native forest regeneration were present in such an alien tree stand, then care should be taken to minimize damage to the native tree regeneration by the <b>falling</b> <b>cut</b> nurse stand trees. But even if the native tree regeneration is damaged by the cut trees, then most of the regenerating woody species will recover through relatively fast vegetative regrowth. In this latter case of removing large tree debris along the river, the non-harvestable tree debris could be burnt on site with care to keep the burnt spot footprint small and to prevent scorch of the regenerating plants of native woody species.|$|E

50|$|Static {{rejuvenation}} {{may also}} occur, in rare instances, when a downstream knickpoint erodes its way upstream to a lake which establishes base level for its tributaries. When the knickpoint reaches the lake, the lake drains, and the base level of upstream waters lowers rapidly {{from that of}} the (now former) lake to that of the river downstream of the knickpoint. At some point in the future, a quite dramatic example will appear when Niagara <b>Falls</b> <b>cuts</b> its way back to Lake Erie.|$|R

50|$|Queenston is a Compact Rural Community and unincorporated place 5 km {{north of}} Niagara Falls in the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada. It is bordered by Highway 405 {{to the south}} and the Niagara River to the east; its {{location}} at the eponymous Queenston Heights on the Niagara Escarpment led to the establishment of the now-defunct Queenston Quarry in the area. Across the river and the Canada-US border is the village of Lewiston, New York. The Lewiston-Queenston Bridge links the two communities.This village is {{at the point where the}} Niagara River began eroding the Niagara Escarpment.

40|$|Kite flying is {{a popular}} sport among children. Most of the {{injuries}} sustained during kite flying are due to <b>falls,</b> <b>cuts,</b> head injuries, or fractures. Injury with innocent-looking kite string in the maxillofacial region is rare. A 4 ½-year-old male patient with a clean cut, deep incised wound exposing the fat and muscle was treated with primary closure. Kite flying is associated with injuries ranging from simple cuts to grave lacerations or head trauma. The severity of lacerations depends on the abrasive material that is often placed on the string of the kite to increase its ability to cut. Injuries related to kite flying are preventable.

Skaters may be disqualified for false starts, impeding, and cutting inside the track. False starts occur when a skater moves before the gun goes off {{at the start of}} a race. Skaters are disqualified for impeding when one skater cuts in front of another skater and causes the first skater to stand up to avoid collision or <b>fall.</b> <b>Cutting</b> inside the track occurs when a skater's skates goes inside the blocks which mark the track on the ice.

50|$|The rapids of Merced Falls {{was used}} in the 1890s to power several watermills located in the town.

With the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad north-south across the Central Valley, many towns including Merced Falls that were not on the railroad fell into disrepair. The rapids themselves were inundated by McSwain Dam, built across the Merced River in the 1960s. Merced Falls is now surrounded by irrigated farmland, and the community itself is almost abandoned.|$|R

50|$|Few better {{illustrations}} {{of this type}} of forms are to be found than that presented in the district of the Great Lakes. The chief upland belt or escarpment is formed by the firm Niagara limestone/dolostone, which takes its name from the gorge and <b>falls</b> <b>cut</b> through the upland by the Niagara River. As in all such forms, the Niagara Escarpment has a relatively strong slope or infacing escarpment on the side towards the upland, and a long gentle slope on the other side. Its relief is seldom more than 200 or 300 ft and is generally small. Its continuity and its contrast with the associated lowlands on the underlying and overlying weak strata suffice to make it an important feature. The escarpment would lie straight east-west if the slant of the strata were uniformly to the south. However, the strata are somewhat warped and so the escarpment's course is strongly convex to the north inthe middle, gently convex to the south at either end.|$|R
