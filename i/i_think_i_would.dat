500|$|During the war, {{relations}} between writers in Nigeria and Biafra were strained. Achebe and John Pepper Clark had a tense confrontation in London over their respective support for opposing {{sides of the}} conflict.

500|$|The Giants allowed six {{sacks in}} their week seven 17–12 {{loss to the}} Seattle Seahawks. Seahawks {{defensive}} end Jacob Green outplayed offensive tackle Karl Nelson and recorded a career-high four sacks. Phil Simms threw four interceptions but coach Bill Parcells denied he was struggling, [...] "ou'd like not to take a sack in the scoring zone, but sometimes it's hard {{to know when to}} throw it away. Two of Phil's interceptions were rebounds {{that had nothing to do}} with the quarterback. On the interception on fourth and 14 at the end, he was trying to make a play. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have thrown there, too. The other interception was his mistake. I don't think he's in a slump." ...|$|E

Tony James of Sigue Sigue Sputnik, a pop-cyberpunk band, and former bassist for Generation X, weighed in. Though sympathetic to his former band mate, he felt the stylistic change didn't fit Idol. [...] "Billy is always cool but he does Billy Idol rebel yellin the best, i felt cyberpunk was a wrong turning for him..he has his sound..stay great as u are Bill..." [...] In 2001 Steve Stevens was asked if Idol's declining popularity and the failure of Cyberpunk was related to their split.

[...] During that hearing, he also stated: [...] "Some people might say—and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sympathise with this view—that perhaps if we had delayed the ceasefire by a few more days, we might have got rid of Saddam Hussein." ...|$|E

2500|$|The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, {{follows the}} {{traditional}} Tibetan Buddhist assertion that inappropriate sexual behaviour includes {{lesbian and gay}} sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse with one's own monogamous partner, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation. In a 1994 interview, he stated: [...] "If someone comes to me and asks whether homosexuality is okay or not, I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say 'if two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay'." [...] However, in his 1996 book Beyond Dogma, he states, [...] "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else... homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper {{is the use of}} organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact." ...|$|E
