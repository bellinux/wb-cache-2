A range of sometimes elaborate cleaning symbioses also exist between many different species, especially in marine fish with their cleaning stations.

40|$|Male {{reproductive}} {{phenotypic plasticity}} related to environmental–social conditions is common among teleost fish. In several species, males adopt different mating tactics {{depending on their}} size, monopolizing mates when larger, while parasitizing dominant male spawns when smaller. Males performing alternative mating tactics are often characterized by a strong dimorphism in both primary and secondary reproductive traits. According to studies on sex-changing species and on species where only one male morph is reproductively active, male alternative phenotypes are expected to vary also in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in forebrain preoptic area (POA). Here, we compared the intra- and inter-sexual variations in number and size of GnRH neurons, along with gonads and male accessory structure investment, in two goby species, the <b>grass</b> <b>goby,</b> Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, and the black goby, Gobius niger, characterized by male alternative mating phenotypes. In both species, older and larger males defend nests, court and perform parental care, while younger and smaller ones try to sneak territorial male spawning. We found that <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> and black goby have different patterns of GnRH expression. <b>Grass</b> <b>goby</b> presents a clear intra-sexual dimorphism in GnRH expression, related to the occurrence of alternative mating tactics, while in the black goby, only inter-sexual differences are observed.

Females from different size/age classes differed in the timing and level of reproductive investment. The oldest females (3 + years old) appeared earlier in the spawning habitat, investing more {{at the beginning of}} the breeding season. In turn a later arrival in the spawning habitats has been observed for younger females (0 +) and smaller individuals of 1 + and 2 + age classes.

40|$|Peculiar {{fertilization}} dynamics, with males releasing sperm in mucous trails lasting several hours, characterize some demersal spawning fish. The {{mating system}} {{was investigated in}} a natural population {{of one of these}} species: the <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> Zosterisessor ophiocephalus (Pallas, 1814), a large coastal goby inhabiting seagrass meadows in shallow brackish water. Adult males ranged in size from 7. 4 to 23 [*]cm total length, but only larger ones were observed to dig and defend a burrow, where they performed parental care on eggs laid by one to several females. Field observations together with analyses of age, sperm production, trail sperm content and sperm competition tests indicated the occurrence of alternative male mating tactics, likely the expression of an ontogenetic gradient. Larger males are older than smaller ones, and while the former are territorial, the latter “sneak” territorial male spawns. The ejaculate characteristics indicate that <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> males have functionally polymorphic spawns: in fact sperm trails of larger males last longer and release fewer sperm than those of smaller males. Sperm production over several days is more constant in larger than in smaller males, but the total number of sperm released is higher in the latter. The influence of seminal fluid in the functional intraspecific variability in sperm release in this species is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Seminal fluid {{often makes}} {{up a large}} part of an ejaculate, yet most {{empirical}} and theoretical studies on sperm competition have focused on how sperm characteristics (number and quality) affect fertilization success.

As a consequence males may be expected to allocate their investment in both sperm and seminal fluid in relation to the potential level of competition. <b>Grass</b> <b>goby</b> (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus) is an external fertilizer with guardsneaker mating tactics, where sperm competition risk varies according to the tactic adopted. Here, we experimentally manipulated <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> ejaculates by separately combining sperm and seminal fluid from territorial and sneaker males. While sperm of sneaker and territorial males did not differ in their performance when they interacted with their own seminal fluid only, sperm of sneakers increased their velocity and fertilization rate in the presence of territorial males’ seminal fluid. By contrast, sneaker males’ seminal fluid had a detrimental effect on the performance of territorial males’ sperm. Sperm velocity was unaffected by the seminal fluid of males employing the same tactic, suggesting that seminal fluid’s effect on rival-tactic sperm is not based on a self/non-self recognition mechanism. Our findings show that cross interactions of sperm and seminal fluid may influence the fertilization success of competing ejaculates with males investing in both sperm and seminal fluid in response to sperm competition risk...|$|E

The complexity of harmful effects that contaminants may cause in fish over time was assessed. General condition indices (somatic liver index, and gonadal somatic index), cytochrome P 450 enzymes, acetylcholinesterase activity and ovarian morphology were {{integrated with the}} content of organochlorines (OCs—hexachlorobenzene, DDTs and polychlorinated biphenyls) in liver and ovaries and p-nonylphenol (NP) and lower ethoxylate (NPE 1 – 2) content in muscle and ovaries as well. Samples collected from the western basin of the lagoon near the Orbetello sewage treatment plant had somatic liver index values and two P 450 activities significantly higher than those collected from the same basin at the Albegna river delta and in the Ansedonia canal in the eastern basin (P PCBs > HCB) were particularly lower in samples from STP compared to levels detected in sites AC and AR. Light microscopy of ovaries revealed that although the gonads were sexually mature, {{the diameter of the}} oocytes and eggswas smaller than that commonly reported. High levels of OCs and NPs were, in fact, observed in <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> ovaries, and the differences observed between acetylcholinesterase activities among investigated sites suggest exposure to insecticides as well.

While evolutionary studies have provided {{explanations of the}} adaptive function of this dramatic male phenotypic diversity, the proximate control of its expression has still to be completely understood. Several observations, primarily from sex-changing species, indicated a major role of social interactions in reproductive axis regulation and consequently in the expression of alternative male phenotypes. Here we documented changes along the male reproductive axis in response to social context in a gonochoristic species, the <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, where fully functional alternative male mating tactics appear to be expressed as an ontogenetic gradient. In the <b>grass</b> <b>goby,</b> larger and older males dig a nest and perform parental care, while smaller males sneak fertilization during territorial male spawning. Territorial males are characterized by a higher number of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in forebrain preoptic area, smaller testes, larger seminal vesicles, and viscous ejaculates that last longer and contain fewer sperm than those of sneakers. To experimentally investigate the role of social factors in inducing changes along the male reproductive axis, sneakers were tested in two different situations: nesting alone or with ripe females. Sneakers that mated and performed parental care showed dramatic changes in brain, reproductive apparatus morphology, and ejaculate traits. GnRHimmunoreactive cells in forebrain preoptic area increased in number, reaching values typical of wild-caught parental males. Testes size decreased while seminal vesicle size increased and ejaculates showed lower sperm densities. These results were discussed {{within the framework of}} the social transduction hypothesis, which predicts that social experience should mediate, through a cascade of internal processes, shifts between morphs throughout life...|$|E

A predictive model was also developed to assess the temporal shift of reproductive peaks as a response to inter-annual thermal fluctuations. This model allowed the detection of deviations from the median level, indicating that during warmer years, the reproductive peak tended to occur earlier than during colder years. The model is therefore proposed as a tool to predict anticipated consequences of climate change on fish phenology in transitional waters, regarding recurrent biological phenomena, such as reproduction and recruitment...|$|E

Compared to the lagoon inlet area, gobies and mussels from the industrial district (Marghera) showed significant DNA adduct levels and increased frequencies of cytogenetic alterations (evidence of genetic damage was absent or inconsistent in other sites). The substantial levels of aromatic and chlorinated contaminants detected in mussels from Marghera also support the exposure of native organisms to genotoxic agents...|$|E

40|$|According {{to their}} origin the Black Sea gobies {{can be divided}} to Ponto-Caspian relicts and Mediterranean immigrants. The {{increase}} of species diversity in the Black Sea {{is a consequence of}} Mediterranean immigrants. The present study investigated the variability in Cytochrome b sequences isolated from two former Mediterranean immigrant species: Gobius niger and Zosterisessor ophiocephalus. The annotated at NCBI Cyt b sequences of the species were also used to extend the reach of the study. The analyses demonstrated that Black Sea inhabited by four haplotypes of G. niger. Four other haplotypes were found in sequences of Mediterranean black gobies. In the Black Sea haplotype, 6 is predominant and 83. 5 % of all G. niger representatives belong to it. Three other haplotypes (H_ 1; H_ 7 and H_ 8) were found to form isolated populations. The Tajima D-test indicated that in the Black Sea G. niger in a stage of expansion and significant evolutionary pressure according to data from Maximum Composite Likelihood model of Tamura-Nei, which can explain the accumulation of mutation and appearance of new haplotypes. Unlike G. niger, Z. ophiocephalus populations are shrinking according to Tajima D-test and only one haplotype is still surviving in isolated locations in the Black Sea.

40|$|Allozymes and {{microsatellites}} {{were used}} to assess the level and distribution of genetic variation in <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> population samples collected from the Venice Lagoon between October 2001 and May 2002. Eighteen enzymatic loci were examined in 434 individuals, 14 of which resulted to be monomorphic, and 4 (GPI-B*, LDH-B*, PGM-A*, PGM-B*) showed 2 alleles scored in 6 individuals only. Comparison with previous data suggests that genetic variation has been eliminated in the Venice Lagoon population during the last few years at three loci. In contrast, analysis of 11 microsatellites in a subset of 192 individuals revealed substantial molecular variation. Analysis of molecular variance showed a lack of genetic differentiation inside the lagoon with respect to site and date of collection, sex, and level of pollution. Significant variation in allelic frequencies was found at microsatellite loci when small (one year old) males were compared to large males (two and three years old), suggesting that a complex population dynamics occurs in this species. The very low level of polymorphism of allozymes could be due to the evolutionary history of the species, or, considering the difference between small and large males, could be the result of recent effects of drift. The second hypothesis is supported by the comparison with previous allozyme studies of the species in the same area, that suggests that loss of heterozygosity at three loci occurred in the last 10 years...|$|E
40|$|In {{fish species}} with {{alternative}} male mating tactics, sperm competition typically occurs when small males that are unsuccessful in direct contests steal fertilization opportunities from large dominant males. In the <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, large territorial males defend and court females from nest sites, while small sneaker males obtain matings by sneaking into nests. Parentage assignment of 688 eggs from 8 different nests sampled in the 2003 - 2004 breeding season revealed {{a high level}} of sperm competition. Fertilization success of territorial males was very high but in all nests sneakers also contributed to the progeny. In territorial males, fertilization success correlated positively with male body size. Gonadal investment was explored in a sample of 126 grass gobies collected during the period 1995 - 1996 in the same area (61 territorial males and 65 sneakers). Correlation between body weight and testis weight was positive and significant for sneaker males, while correlation was virtually equal to zero in territorial males. That body size in territorial males is correlated with fertilization success but not gonad size suggests that males allocate much more energy into growth and relatively little into sperm production once the needed size to become territorial is attained. The increased paternity of larger territorial males might be due to a more effective defense of the nest in comparison with smaller territorial males...|$|E
40|$|Accessory {{structures}} {{to the male}} reproductive system are known in several families of teleost, but their role in sperm production patterns and fertilization dynamics is still unclear. The intraspecific variability in seminal vesicles, shown by the <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, presents an opportunity to examine both its possible correlation to alternative male mating tactics and the function of these accessory structures. In this species, males are known to release sperm {{in the form of}} sperm trails, bands of mucosubstances in which sperm are embedded. Surgical removal of seminal vesicles and histochemistry demonstrate that mucins, involved in the production of sperm trails, are secreted by the seminal vesicles. Gametes show a high longevity; sperm motility lasts on average 80 minutes. Eggs can be fertilized for several hours and {{do not need to be}} laid over trails because sperm are able to reach them via the surrounding water. Gonosomatic and seminal vesicle somatic indices, histology and histochemistry of gonads and seminal vesicles, sperm counts, and sperm trail longevity, suggest the presence of alternative male mating tactics in this species. Larger males have smaller testes and larger seminal vesicles compared to those of smaller males. The major role of seminal vesicles is mucin secretion in larger males, sperm storage in smaller ones. Trails of larger males last longer and release sperm more constantly over time than those of smaller males. Overall differences between males support the presence of differences in the intensity of sperm competition, with larger males performing nesting behaviour while smaller ones sneak spawning...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} somatic energy storage, {{measured}} as body lipid proportion, {{was investigated in}} the <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, by comparing the per cent lipids across three reproductive groups—large males (territory holding, caring for eggs, males), small males (sneaker males) and females—and across a seasonal phase including the entire breeding season and a post-reproductive period. Furthermore, the pattern of some indicators of somatic and reproductive investment, such as gonadosomatic index (GSI) and liversomatic index (LSI), was investigated, {{as well as the}} relationship between lipid content and fish body size was studied over time in both sexes. Results showed that the amount of somatic lipids depends largely on the different levels of reproductive investment shown by the breeding individuals. Females had the lowest levels of somatic lipids {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season when large males reached, by contrast, the highest levels. Large males showed a strong decrease in their reserves as the breeding season proceeded, and their replenishment was significantly slower than that of smaller males, which had relatively high levels already in September. Analysis of the trends of GSI and LSI revealed that the difference between females and males in the primary reproductive investment (gonadic mass) can explain most of the differences in the levels of somatic energy storage. The relationship between body size and lipid content changed over time, being positive and statistically significant at the beginning of the breeding season for each reproductive group, indicating that during these phases all the breeding individuals had accumulated energy in their tissues and that the breeding season reduced their somatic energy storage although with different intensity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{development}} of the technology of the controlled rearing of marine fish {{remains one of the}} priority strategic trends of {{development of}} national mariculture. A study of the possibility of using polyculture for cage culture has a particular interest. Joint cultivation of several species of fish in the same cage, as practice of fish farming has demonstrated, does not have a tangible positive effect. At the same time, the use of cages of special design can provide significant additional fish products through the use of additional aquaculture objects. The ecological state of water areas, where the cages are located, is of great importance. High fish stocking density and the use of artificial feeds can serve as a source of powerful biogenic and organic pollution, which is especially important for shallow water areas with weak water exchange. The purpose of the study is to develop the methods for joint fish production in cage mariculture capable to provide high fish production and to weaken organic pollution of shallow water areas where cage farms are located. Methodology. The studies were conducted in 1999 and 2004. Cages of special design (internal 10 m 3 and external 18. 75 m 3) installed in the brackish Shabolat Lagoon were used for rearing, steelhead trout, haarder, <b>grass</b> <b>goby</b> and round goby in polyculture. The standard aquaculture research methods were used. For express-analysis of environment hydrochemical parameters in cage location area the following devices were used: "ECOTEST- 2000 T" (О 2, NO 2, NO 3, NH 4, CO 2, phosphates, pH); termooksimetr "АJА- 101 М" (Т; О 2); "pH meter- 150 M); Refractometer "ATAGO- 100 " (salinity and water density). Findings. The results of marine fish cultivation in cages in polyculture in the shallow Shabolat lagoon are presented. It has been shown that joint cultivation of salmon, mullet and gobies in specially designed cages in shallow marine lagoons allows using artificial and natural feeds more fully and provides a high yield of commercial fish that results in significant additional products with a decrease in pollution level of the water area where the cages are installed. Originality. An original method for rearing marine fish in polyculture in specially designed cages has been developed. The perspective of culturing salmon, mullet and gobies in the polyculture has been demonstrated experimentally. The proposed technology ensures high efficiency of cage mariculture, allows getting additional production through the use of additional facilities and a reduction in the level of organic pollution in shallow water areas where cage farms are located. Practical value. The results of the study can be used to create cage mariculture farms in shallow seaside lagoons. Creating marine fish polyculture in specially designed cages will increase the efficiency of cultivation, reduce feed costs and reduce pollution in shallow water areas...|$|E
