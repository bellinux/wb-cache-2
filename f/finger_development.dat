In this study, the viscous fingering instability that develops daring the displacement of oil-in-water (0 /W) emulsions by water is investigated. For this purpose, a horizontal rectilinear Hele-Shaw cell is used as an analogue for the porous media. The emulsions are prepared by dispersing a mineral oil in water using non-ionic surfactants. Different concentrations of oil were used to generate different emulsions that are characterized by examining their droplets size distribution and viscosity. The emulsions are displaced at different injection rates and the developments of the instability are characterized qualitatively by identifying the main mechanisms of <b>finger</b> <b>development</b> and growth. These results and {{the correlations between the}} properties of the fluids and the flow patterns are used to understand the flow dynamics and its effects on the viscous fingering instability.

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the popular agrohydrological model SWAP has been used to evaluate modelling of soil water flow and crop growth at field situations in which water repellency causes preferential flow. The parameter sensitivity in such situations has been studied. Three options to model soil water flow within SWAP are described and compared: uniform flow, the classical mobile-immobile concept, and a recent concept accounting for the dynamics of <b>finger</b> <b>development</b> resulting from unstable infiltration. Data collected from a severely water-repellent affected soil located in Australia were used to compare and evaluate the usefulness of the modelling options for the agricultural management of such soils. The study shows that an assumption of uniform flow in a water-repellent soil profile leads to an underestimation of groundwater recharge and an overestimation of plant transpiration and crop production. The new concept of modelling taking finger dynamics into account provides greater flexibility and can more accurately model the observed effects of preferential flow compared with the classical mobile–immobile concept. The parameter analysis indicates that the most important factor defining the presence and extremity of preferential flow is the critical soil water content. Comparison of the modelling results with the Australian field data showed that without the use of a preferential flow module, the effects of the clay amendments to the soil were insufficiently reproduced in the dry matter production results. This means that the physical characteristics of the soil alone are not sufficient to explain the measured increase in production on clay amended soils. However, modelling with the module accounting for finger dynamics indicated that the preferential flow in water repellent soils that had not been treated with clay caused water stress for the crops, which would explain the decrease in production. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{injected}} in an aquifer rises {{quickly to}} the top of the reservoir and forms a gas cap from where it diffuses into the underlying water layer. Transfer of the CO 2 to the aqueous phase below is enhanced due to the high density of the carbon dioxide containing aqueous phase. This paper investigates the behavior of the diffusive interface in an enclosed space in which initially the upper part is filled with pure carbon dioxide and the lower part with liquid. Our analysis differs from a conventional analysis as we take the movement of the diffusive interface due to mass transfer and the composition dependent viscosity in the aqueous phase into account. The same formalism can also be used to describe the situation when an oil layer is underlying the gas cap. Therefore we prefer to call the lower phase the liquid phase. In this paper we include these two effects into the stability analysis of a diffusive interface between CO 2 and a liquid in the gravity field. We identify the relevant bifurcation parameter as q = ?Ra, where ? is the width of the interface. This implies the (well known) scaling of the critical time ?Ra? 2 and wavelength ?Ra? 1 (The critical time tc and critical wavelength kc are defined as follows: ?(k) ? 0 ??t ? tc; equality only holds for t = tc and k = kc). Inclusion of the interface upward movement leads to earlier destabilization of the system. Increasing viscosity for increasing CO 2 concentration stabilizes the system.

Secondly, we compare the ability of different multi-metal deposition processes to develop finger marks on a range of surfaces with that of other currently used development processes. All published multi-metal deposition processes utilise an initial stage of colloidal gold deposition followed by enhancement of the marks with using a physical developer. All possible combinations of colloidal gold and physical developer stages were tested. The method proposed by Schnetz was shown to be the most effective process, however a modification which reduced the pH of the enhancement solution was revealed to provide the best combination of effectiveness and practicality. In trials comparing the modified formulation with vacuum metal deposition, superglue and powder suspensions on surfaces which typically give low finger mark yields (cling film, plasticised vinyl, leather and masking tape), the modified method produced significantly better results over existing processes for cling film and plasticised vinyl. The modified formulation was found to be ineffective on both masking tape and leather. It is recommended that further tests be carried out on the modified multi-metal deposition formulation to establish whether it could be introduced for operational work on cling film material in particular.

Mineralogical and textural changes are interpreted considering local marked disequilibria {{in a system that}} resembles a small-scale high-T metamorphic process (e. g., contact aureoles in pyrometamorphism). In such conditions, rapid heating induces significant overstepping in mineral reaction, preventing stable phase formation and favoring metastable ones. High-T transformations in non-carbonate materials include microcline structure collapse and/or partial transformation into sanidine; and mullite plus sanidine formation at the expenses of muscovite and/or illite at T � 800 °C. Mullite forms by muscovite-out topotactic replacement, following the orientation of mica crystals: i. e., former (001) muscovite are ^ to (001) mullite. This reaction is favored by minimization of free energy during phase transition. Partial melting followed by <b>fingered</b> structure <b>development</b> at the carbonate-silicate reaction interface enhanced high-T Ca (and Mg) silicates formation in carbonate-rich materials.

The choice of computer vision to perform that task is motivated {{by the absence of}} a satisfying method for realtime guitarist <b>fingering</b> detection. The <b>development</b> of this computer vision method follows preliminary manual and automated analyses of video recordings of a guitarist. These first analyses led to some important findings about the design methodology of such a system, namely the focus on the effective gesture, the consideration of the action of each individual finger, and a recognition system not relying on comparison against a knowledge-base of previously learned fingering positions. Motivated by these results, studies on three important aspects of a complete fingering system were conducted. One study was on realtime finger-localization, another on string and fret detection, and the last on movement segmentation. Finally, these concepts were integrated into a prototype and a system for left-hand fingering detection was developed.

40|$|Tactile acuity {{is known}} to decline with age in adults, {{possibly}} {{as the result of}} receptor loss, but less is understood about how tactile acuity changes during childhood. Previous research from our laboratory has shown that fingertip size influences tactile spatial acuity in young adults: those with larger fingers tend to have poorer acuity, possibly because mechanoreceptors are more sparsely distributed in larger fingers. We hypothesized that a similar relationship would hold among children. If so, children’s tactile spatial acuity might be expected to worsen as their fingertips grow. However, concomitant CNS maturation might result in more efficient perceptual processing, counteracting the effect of fingertip growth on tactile acuity. To investigate, we conducted a cross-sectional study, testing 116 participants ranging in age from 6 to 16 years on a precision-controlled tactile grating orientation task. We measured each participant's grating orientation threshold on the dominant index finger, along with physical properties of the fingertip: surface area, volume, sweat pore spacing, and temperature. We found that, as in adults, children with larger fingertips (at a given age) had significantly poorer acuity, yet paradoxically acuity did not worsen significantly with age.

40|$|Sandy beaches {{worldwide}} often display pronounced morphological features, such as crescentic bars, rip {{channels and}} beach cusps. Sometimes also a {{less well known}} pattern of transverse finger bars develops. These bars are relatively small, attached to the inner bar or the shoreline, and have in general an oblique orientation. Four years of time-exposure images permit to study the occurrence of transverse finger bars in the surf zone of a beach on the Gold Coast, East Australia. Transverse finger bars are thus observed to occur here on 24 % of the study period. The finger bars occur in patches of 3 to 15 bars, with an average transverse finger bar event duration of 5 days. The presence of bars is related to intermediate energy wave conditions. When the offshore wave height is higher than 1. 2 m., transverse finger bars are never observed. In {{the majority of the}} cases, the crests of the transverse finger bars point against the direction of the incoming waves: up-current oriented bars. The hypothesis that, apart from the wave conditions, also the overall morphology of the nearshore zone is of influence to transverse <b>finger</b> bar <b>development,</b> is tested by looking to the shape of the shore parallel bars at the time of transverse finger bar occurrence. It is shown that finger bar occurrence is often coinciding with a state of the shore parallel bars that reflects low to intermediate energy conditions. A morphodynamic model has as well been applied to investigate the Gold Coast transverse finger bars. This model describes self-organization processes in the nearshore zone: the feedback between waves, breakers, depth-averaged currents and bed evolution. The model proved capable of describing the initial growth of up-current transverse finger bars, with characterstics corresponding well to the observations. The model has been used to study the mechansm of transverse finger bar growth. It explains why only waves with a minimal offshore angle of 20 degrees with respect to the shore normal, and an intermediate height promote transverse finger bar growth. The longshore current is found to be the main factor controlling transverse finger bar formation, although also the effect of the turbulent sediment resuspension by the rollers formed on wave breaking plays a role...|$|R

A one-way downscaling approach that involves using {{a series of}} sub-models in simulation procedures was proposed to efficiently simulate problems with high-scale discrepancies. This study evaluated the effects of different degrees of small-scale permeability variations on the vertical migration of dissolved CO 2. The sequential Gaussian simulation model was used to generate unconditional random permeability fields for different natural logarithm of permeability (lnk) variations (i. e., lnk variances and correlations in x and z directions). The results showed an identical transition zone of dissolved CO 2 near the top boundary, where a constant CO 2 gas saturation was specified. The local permeability variations can trigger fingerings and enhance the vertical convection of the dissolved CO 2. The number of fingerings depends on the variations in permeability near the front interface of the dissolved CO 2 (i. e., the bottom edge of the transition zone for the dissolved CO 2). However, the <b>fingering</b> patterns and <b>developments</b> are constrained by the permeability variations along the fingering paths.

40|$|Doswell has {{proposed}} a mechanism for mammatus called double-diffusive convection, the mechanism responsible for salt fingers in the ocean. The physics of salt fingers and mammatus are different. Unlike the ocean where the diffusivity is related to molecular motions within solution, the hydrometeors in clouds are affected by inertial and gravitational forces. Doswell misinterprets the vertical temperature profiles through mammatus and fails to understand the role of settling in volcanic ash clouds. Furthermore, given that mixing {{is a much more}} effective means of transferring heat in the atmosphere and given idealized numerical model simulations of mammatus showing that the destabilizing effect of subcloud sublimation is an effective mechanism for mammatus, this reply argues that double-diffusive convection is unlikely to explain mam-matus, either in cumulonimbus anvils or in volcanic ash clouds. In preparing our review article on mammatus (Schultz et al. 2006), we were amazed at the number of previously published papers that would make claims about mammatus mechanisms without considering the observational evidence or offering simple physical ar-guments to support or refute their proposed mecha-nisms. Before and after publication of our review, some people would make the claim to us that salt fingers formed by double-diffusive convection in the ocean were analogous to mammatus. Admittedly, the physical appearance of salt <b>fingers</b> and their <b>development</b> along a boundary between two fluids provides a seductive analogy to mammatus. Repeatedly, we asked these pro-ponents of the salt-fingers analogy for a simple physical argument, scale analysis, or theoretical calculation that could serve as a testable hypothesis to support or refute this proposed mechanism.

This is crucial for finger balance and therefore <b>finger</b> functioning. Recent <b>developments</b> in the technique of ultrasonic measurements have made it possible to accurately measure tendon displacements over a large range of motion in-vivo. The change in tendon displacement divided by the change in corresponding joint angle (dl/d?) was used to estimate joint angle dependent MA’s (MAest) of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and extensor digitorum communis (EDC) tendon at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the long finger. In addition, MA’s were obtained from the joint geometry for each individual subject (MAgeo). Two sessions of 3 repetitions of active flexion-extension motion of the long finger were conducted by each of the five subjects enrolled in this study. The intra subject repeatability between the two sessions at 0 degrees of flexion for the FDS and EDC tendon was good (ICC > 0. 95, p = 0. 004 and 0. 101 respectively) but rather weak for the FDP (ICC = 0. 630, p = 0. 157). The obtained MAest values were underestimated in comparison to the MAgeo values. Thus, this method proved to be promising, but should be further validated and developed to yield sufficiently reliable results. Once fully developed, the in-vivo estimation of MA’s can be used to determine the subject specific muscle MA balances around the finger joints. These MA balances can be an important parameter for a musculoskeletal finger model. In addition, it can be a generic measure for finger pathologies where finger balance is disturbed.
