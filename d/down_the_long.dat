5|$|Although a court roll of 1389 {{mentions}} two gardens, {{there is}} no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, {{as can be seen in}} a portrait of the house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace, which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. The garden is still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded. A single rose arbour remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.|$|E
25|$|Before the Barnsley and Shepley Lane Head Turnpike was built, {{this small}} hamlet was {{situated}} on the packhorse route from Penistone to Huddersfield. Merchants would travel from Penistone, through Thurlstone, along Broadstones Road and Dearne Dike Lane to Five Lane Ends, down Piper Wells Road, Cross Lane and Carr Lane, before turning <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> drive into Shepley Carr. The route would then follow the fields (before they were enclosed), past the Shepley War Memorial, and into the village. The travellers would then head out towards Stocksmoor and Farnley Tyas through Stones Wood (where Devil worship once took place). Some old locals tell stories of a ghostly coach and fours furiously speeding <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> drive on wintry nights before vanishing at the hamlet. The present house at Shepley Carr is the third building on this site and dates from 1862. A house which stood on the site previously burnt down in 1740.|$|E
25|$|To {{the strains}} of the Grenadiers Slow March, the Escort to the Colour then troops the colour <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> line of Nos 6-2 Guards. The colour itself is borne by the Ensign {{in front of the}} line of guards, but the ranks of the Escort {{interweave}} with their ranks. For Nos 6-2 Guards, who maintain the 'present arms' position, the long trooping, especially on a hot day, requires stamina. As this is done the Massed Bands move back in slow time to their original places.|$|E

25|$|Two asterisms are {{prominent}} in Carina. One {{is known as}} the 'Diamond Cross', which is larger than the Southern Cross (but fainter), and, {{from the perspective of the}} southern hemisphere viewer, upside <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> axes of the two crosses being close to parallel. Another asterism in the constellation is the False Cross, often mistaken for the Southern Cross, which is an asterism in Crux. The False Cross consists of two stars in Carina, Iota Carinae and Epsilon Carinae, and two stars in Vela, Kappa Velorum and Delta Velorum.|$|E
25|$|It {{was further}} theorized that the abrupt change in {{transverse}} rotational axis during the ship's descent <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> launch ramp caused the bow to press against the chute {{itself as the}} stern hit the water. This may have caused a crack somewhere in the keel, contributing to admission of water to the hull. Regardless of the exact cause, it was eventually determined that full responsibility {{for the loss of}} the steamship was due to the shipyard's technical mistakes during launch and not in the design or construction of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Lindsay Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Water of Leith, flows southwest <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> North East Valley at the northern end of Dunedin's urban area. This valley, lying between Pine Hill and Signal Hill, houses a residential suburb consisting of one main road with streets heading off it up the steep hills on either side. One of these streets, Baldwin Street, is listed as the world's steepest street. The original North East Valley post office was located near the foot of Baldwin Street, but was relocated to the Gardens to be nearer the retail area. North East Valley's 2001 population was 4,266.|$|E
50|$|Barry {{also used}} {{a number of}} enfilades in his {{extension}} to the National Gallery, London, built as an art gallery. These have been extended and added to in the recent Sainsbury Wing (despite the wing being {{at an angle to}} the earlier building), so that now <b>the</b> view <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> enfilade traverses fifteen rooms.|$|R

25|$|The antenna {{for such}} a system {{would have to be}} large only in the {{horizontal}} direction, and could be very thin vertically. This had advantages for installation on aircraft, but it would be even more practical if the beam could be steered electronically, as opposed to mechanically. By delaying the signal slightly as it travelled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> antenna, which could be arranged through a number of means, the phase angle would vary, causing the resulting signal to be focussed in a given direction. Since the antenna didn't have to move in order to scan, this led to the possibility of embedding the antenna in the leading edges of the aircraft wings, or similar solutions.|$|E
500|$|At first, Magruder's {{units were}} behind Stonewall Jackson's column while marching <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Bridge Road, {{which led to}} Malvern Hill. Along this road were several {{adjoining}} pathways. One such road, called the Willis Church Road by some locals and the Quaker Road by others, led south from Glendale to Malvern Hill. Lee's maps labeled this [...] "Quaker Road". Another of these paths began near a local farm and angled southwest toward an upriver point on the River Road—some locals called this the Quaker Road, including Magruder's guides, who led Magruder's army down this road rather than the Quaker Road shown on Lee's maps. James Longstreet eventually rode after Magruder, and persuaded him to reverse course. This incident delayed Magruder's arrival to the battlefield for three hours.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} {{necessarily}} a hotel restaurant from {{the inception of}} the Ritz, the current hotel restaurant, L'Espadon (The Swordfish) was established in 1956 by Charles Ritz. He was a keen fishing enthusiast so named the restaurant after a fish. The restaurant is inspired by the legendary first chef of the hotel, Auguste Escoffier, serving [...] "traditional French culinary style with contemporary overtones". The cuisine is by the award-winning chef Michel Roth, the ninth head chef of the hotel; the restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide. The head chef was formerly Guy Legay, cited as one of Paris's greatest chefs, who had served from at least 1986 to beyond 1999. In 1999, Esquire magazine wrote, [...] "the dining room, L'Espadon, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> corridor of mirrors and display cases, has a glittering Regency formality that seems to swirl around you, and it's easy enough to imagine Hemingway sitting down with Dietrich to a dish of chef Guy Legay's buttery scrambled eggs..." [...] The restaurant decor is described as [...] "opulent with trompe l’oeil ceilings, swagged drapes, and views into the garden." [...] The courtyard garden is rich in greenery and contains several statues and a fountain. The hotel hires five or so florists to provide fresh flowers.|$|E

[...] Sometimes, the woman appears to be trying to hitch a ride down the mountain. [...] Invariably, the observers are said to be frightened and just ignore the woman, believing her to be Maria Makiling.|$|E
2500|$|Driscoll and de Zavala {{argued over}} {{how best to}} {{preserve}} the building. [...] De Zavala wished to restore {{the exterior of the}} buildings to a state similar to its 1836 appearance, focusing on the convent (then called the long barracks), while Driscoll wanted to tear <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> barracks and create a monument similar to those she had seen in Europe: [...] "a city center opened by a large plaza and anchored by an ancient chapel".|$|E
2500|$|The palace complex {{consisted}} of a small, almost square, -storey-high main palace with dome and lanterns. [...] It is positioned exactly at the centre {{of what is known}} as a [...] "hunting star" [...] (Danish, jagtstjerne), a number of straight intersecting paths in a game hunting reserve. [...] During a hunt it was permissible to shoot freely straight <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> paths, which radiated out from the centre. [...] The dome hall measured 15 x 15 m, and had a height of 27 m. [...] The sumptuous room featured stucco by C.E. Brenno and a plafond by Hendrick Krock.|$|E

Kipling seemed to take to golf, occasionally practising with the local Congregational minister, and even playing with red-painted balls when the ground was covered in snow. However, wintertime golf was [...] "not altogether a success {{because there were no}} limits to a drive; the ball might skid two miles (3km) <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> slope to Connecticut river." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{was totally}} and {{permanently}} {{paralyzed from the}} waist down, and unable to stand or walk without support. [...] For the next few months, he confined himself to indoor pursuits, including resuming his lifelong hobby of stamp collecting. [...] In December 1921, after he had recuperated for several months, a physiotherapist began working with him {{to determine the extent}} of the damage. He was able to perform small exercises on his own, moving one muscle and then another. He was fitted with heavy steel braces that locked at the knee and provided enough stability that he could stand with crutches. In 1922, at Springwood, he worked diligently to make his way across the room. He set himself the goal of getting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> driveway, managing to do it once, but never trying again.|$|E
2500|$|On August 27, in {{anticipation}} of air raids, workmen had begun taking down the stained glass windows of the Sainte-Chapelle. The same day, curators at the Louvre, summoned back from summer vacation, and aided by packers from the nearby La Samaritaine and Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville department stores, began cataloging and packing the major works of art, which were put into crates and labeled only with numbers to disguise their contents. The Winged Victory of Samothrace statue was carefully wheeled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> stairway on a wooden ramp {{to be put on}} a truck for its departure to the Château de Valençay in the Indre department. Trucks used to move scenery for the Comédie Française were used to move the larger paintings, including [...] Gericault's Raft of the Medusa. The art works were carried in slow convoys of trucks, convoys, with headlights off to observe the blackout, to the châteaux of the Loire Valley and other designated locations.|$|E
