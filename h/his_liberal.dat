5|$|Frederick was {{severely}} reproached {{by his father}} for <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> ideas, so he spent {{a large portion of}} time in Britain where Queen Victoria frequently allowed him to represent her at ceremonies and social functions.|$|E
5|$|He {{served as}} a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Parliament of India, from 12 May 1986 to 11 May 1992, after being {{nominated}} by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Shankar composed the dance drama Ghanashyam in 1989. <b>His</b> <b>liberal</b> views on musical co-operation led him to contemporary composer Philip Glass, with whom he released an album, Passages, in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} OPP did {{come at a}} cost for Dr Khan as <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> views and {{self-help}} initiatives were questioned and criticized by certain interest groups. At two occasions, {{he was accused of}} blasphemy. However, all allegations against him were acquitted by the courts of law and cleared by independent religious scholars.|$|E
5000|$|The 1985 {{election}} {{marked the}} successful political comeback of Bourassa and <b>his</b> <b>Liberals,</b> while also putting sovereignty {{as an issue}} to rest until a decade later.|$|R
5|$|After these preparations, {{the premier}} called a provincial {{election}} for June 29, 1937. Macdonald campaigned on his government's record. On election day, <b>his</b> <b>Liberals</b> were rewarded with 25 of the 30 {{seats in the}} legislature.|$|R
25|$|Thatcher and <b>his</b> <b>Liberals</b> were reelected in 1967, {{but were}} {{defeated}} {{in a landslide}} by Allan E. Blakeney (1925–2011) and the NDP in 1971. The NDP was reelected in 1975, as the long-dormant Progressive Conservative party made a comeback.|$|R
5|$|With Maryland voters, Mathias {{benefited from}} his {{frequent}} disagreements with the Nixon administration and <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> voting record. On November 5, 1974, he was re-elected by a 57% to 43% margin, though he lost badly in Baltimore City and Baltimore County, where Mikulski was popular.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{vocation}} {{to minister to}} the urban poor, Henson served in the East End of London and Barking before becoming chaplain of an ancient hospice in Ilford in 1895. In 1900 he {{was appointed to the}} high-profile post of vicar of St Margaret's, Westminster and canon of Westminster Abbey. While there, and as Dean of Durham (1913–18), he wrote prolifically and sometimes controversially. The Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church took exception to <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> theological views, which some regarded as heretical, and sought unsuccessfully in 1917 to block his appointment as Bishop of Hereford.|$|E
5|$|On November 11, 1793, Charles IV {{dissolved}} the society. Soon {{the newspaper}} disappeared as well. Espejo {{had no choice}} but to work as a librarian in the National Library. Because of <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> ideas, he was imprisoned on January 30, 1795, being allowed to leave his cell only to treat his patients as a doctor and, on December 23, to die at his home from the dysentery he acquired during his imprisonment. Eugenio Espejo died on December 28. His death certificate was registered in the book for Indians, mestizos, blacks and mulattoes.|$|E
50|$|Despite his {{attempts}} to strike an image as a fresh government, Grimes and <b>his</b> <b>Liberals</b> were defeated in the October 2003 provincial election by the Progressive Conservatives under Danny Williams, bringing an end to 14 years of Liberal rule in Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|R
25|$|In 1921 Giolitti {{founded the}} National Blocs, an electoral list {{composed}} by <b>his</b> <b>Liberals,</b> the Italian Fasci of Combat led by Benito Mussolini, the Italian Nationalist Association led by Enrico Corradini, and other right-wing forces. Giolitti's {{aim was to}} stop {{the growth of the}} Italian Socialist Party.|$|R
40|$|Francis Fukuyama asks: <b>‘Is</b> <b>liberal</b> {{democracy}} prey {{to serious}} internal contradictions, contradictions so serious {{that they will}} eventually undermine it as a political system?’ This paper argues {{that one of these}} ‘internal contradictions’ is the political communications process and it can be sufficiently serious to undermine the democratic system—but such an undermining is not inevitable...|$|R
5|$|Reid was {{nominated}} as the UFA candidate in Vermilion during the 1921 provincial election, {{the first in}} which the UFA ran candidates. The Legislative Assembly of Alberta was dominated by the Liberals, who had governed Alberta since its creation in 1905. To Reid's great surprise, he defeated <b>his</b> <b>Liberal</b> opponent and {{was elected to the}} legislature, along with 37 of his fellow UFA candidates—enough to form a majority government. He chaired the first meeting of the new UFA caucus, at which it selected Herbert Greenfield as Premier. Reid was re-elected in the 1926 and 1930 elections.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{retained}} Chotiner as {{a consultant}} to his first congressional campaign in 1946. In an era when the perceived threat of communism was a major domestic issue, Chotiner advised the future president to link <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> opponent, Representative Jerry Voorhis, to a political organization which was believed to be communist-dominated. Nixon was elected, and hired Chotiner to run his 1950 Senate campaign against Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. Chotiner used a similar strategy in that campaign, stressing Douglas' liberal voting record and printing the accusations on pink paper to hint at communist sympathy. Congressman Nixon easily defeated Douglas, and Chotiner next managed Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign and counseled Nixon through allegations of antisemitism and revelations that there were privately run funds to pay Nixon's political expenses—revelations that the candidate decisively overcame with his televised Checkers speech.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 1723, {{six days}} before his death, Cosimo III {{distributed}} a final proclamation commanding that Tuscany shall stay independent; Anna Maria Luisa shall succeed uninhibited after Gian Gastone; the Grand Duke reserves {{the right to choose}} his successor. Unfortunately for Cosimo, Europe completely ignored it. Gian Gastone, now the Grand Duke, and Anna Maria Luisa were not on good terms. He despised the Electress for engineering his unhappy marriage with Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, while she detested <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> policies: he repealed all of his father's anti-Semitic statutes and revelled in upsetting her. Consequently, the Electress was compelled to abandon her apartment in the left wing of the royal palace, the Pitti, for the Villa La Quiete. She refurbished La Quiete's house and gardens with the assistance of Sebastiano Rapi, the gardener of the Boboli Gardens, and the architects Giovanni Battista Foggini and Paolo Giovanozzi. In the period 1722–1725, the Electress embellished the villa further by commissioning twelve statues of various religious figures.|$|E
500|$|Two {{members of}} the {{government}} resigned {{the day after the}} government lost the vote. As the campaign opened, the Tories trailed in the polls by 15 points. To Pearson and <b>his</b> <b>Liberals,</b> the only question was how large a majority they would win. Peter Stursberg, who wrote two books about the Diefenbaker years, stated of that campaign: ...|$|R
25|$|King's term as Minister of Labour {{was marked}} by two {{significant}} achievements. He led {{the passage of the}} Industrial Disputes Investigation Act and the Combines Investigation Act, which he had shaped during his civil and parliamentary service. The legislation significantly improved the financial situation for millions of Canadian workers. He lost his seat in the 1911 general election, which saw the Conservatives defeat <b>his</b> <b>Liberals.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while <b>his</b> <b>Liberal</b> successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the {{distinctive}} Scottish use of stone architecture declined as it was replaced by cheaper alternatives such as Portland cement, concrete, and mass-production brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals. In {{the twentieth century}} private architecture was increasingly client driven. James Robert Rhind (1854–1918), the son of David Rhind, was successful in the competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following Andrew Carnegie's gift of £100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for seven libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Rhind's libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> use of columns, domes and sculpted features. James Miller (1860–1947) is noted for his Scottish railway stations, such as his 1901–05 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station, and the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan, {{imported}} from the United States and Ontario, gained brief popularity in nativist circles in Saskatchewan and Alberta. The Klan, briefly allied with the provincial Conservative party because of their mutual dislike for Premier James G. [...] "Jimmy" [...] Gardiner and <b>his</b> <b>Liberals</b> (who ferociously fought the Klan), enjoyed about two years of prominence. It declined and disappeared, subject to widespread political and media opposition, plus internal scandals involving {{the use of the}} organization's funds.|$|R

25|$|Lustiger {{received}} his episcopal consecration on 8 December 1979 from Cardinal François Marty, with Archbishop Eugène Ernoult of Sens and Bishop Daniel Pézeril serving as co-consecrators. When installed as bishop, Lustiger avoided all reference to <b>his</b> <b>liberal</b> predecessor Guy-Marie Riobé, a pacifist closely allied to Catholic Action.|$|E
25|$|During Pearson's time as Prime Minister, <b>his</b> <b>Liberal</b> {{minority}} governments introduced {{universal health}} care, student loans, the Canada Pension Plan, the Order of Canada, and the Maple Leaf flag. <b>His</b> <b>Liberal</b> government also unified Canada's armed forces. Pearson convened the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, {{and he kept}} Canada out of the Vietnam War. In 1967, his government passed Bill C-168, which de facto abolished capital punishment in Canada by restricting it to a few capital offenses {{for which it was}} never used, and which themselves were abolished in 1976. With these accomplishments, together with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy, Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century and is ranked among the greatest Canadian Prime Ministers.|$|E
25|$|The Conservative {{manifesto}} for the 2015 {{general election}} contained a {{promise not to}} raise income tax, VAT, or national insurance {{for the duration of}} the parliament. Journalist George Eaton maintains that Osborne did not expect an outright Conservative majority, and expected <b>his</b> <b>Liberal</b> Democrat coalition partners to make him break that promise.|$|E

He angered British farmers {{by refusing to}} reinstitute the Corn Laws in response to poor harvests and cheap imported grain. With Gladstone conducting a massive speaking campaign, <b>his</b> <b>Liberals</b> bested Disraeli's Conservatives at the 1880 general election. In his final months, Disraeli led the Conservatives in Opposition. He had throughout his career written novels, beginning in 1826, and he published his last completed novel, Endymion, shortly before he {{died at the age}} of 76.|$|R

[...] Scott easily retained the premiership, with <b>his</b> <b>Liberals</b> winning 16 seats in the provincial legislature, while Haultain's newly created Provincial Rights Party won only 9.
