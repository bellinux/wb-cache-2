5|$|The Bosque Municipal (Municipal Forest) was {{donated by}} the Ross family in 1935. The main access to the forest <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Ross Casino, near Paseo el Sol; or by a road near the Colegio Preciosa Sangre. The forest has a {{footpath}} surrounded by palms, pines, and many other varieties of trees.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost of {{the beaches}} is Playa Las Terrazas or Playa Principal (The Terraces Beach or Main Beach), which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Ross Park. It is popular for surfing. Near {{the beach and}} at Ross Park, there are balustrades and long stairs dating from the early 1900s. There is a balcony over the rocks at the {{southern}} end of the beach. It is the busiest during the summer months. Several surf schools, such as La Ola Perfecta, and Lobos del Pacífico, are located nearby, as is the fish market at Fishermen Creek.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of teleost species {{belong to the}} clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The {{majority of}} euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleosti. A derived trait of neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, the Acanthopterygii have a spiny dorsal fin which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the soft-rayed dorsal fin. This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may {{also play a role}} in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed spiny ctenoid scales (as opposed to the cycloid scales of other groups), tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} is a {{medium-sized}} rodent that looks {{much like the}} common black and brown rats, but has greater differences in color between the upper- and underparts. The fur is thick and short. The upperparts are generally gray to grayish brown, with the head a bit lighter, and are sharply delimited from the underparts, which are off-white, as are the feet. It has small cheek pouches. The ears {{are about the same}} color as the upperparts, but a patch of light hairs <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them. The tail is dark brown above and may be paler below. The guard hairs are long and have unpigmented, silvery tips. When rice rats swim, air is trapped in the fur, which increases buoyancy and reduces heat loss. As in most other oryzomyines, females have eight mammae.|$|E

His left hand rests on his chest holding a book bearing the words Santo Evangélico on its cover. A skull cap covers his head, and a pectoral cross hangs from his neck, the symbols of Episcopal dignity.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E
5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E

Clutter problem arises when the target object <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a non-uniform background, which {{functions as a}} distractor for the visual task. Hierarchical architecture provides signatures for parts of target objects, which do not include parts of background and are not affected by background variations.|$|E

He will seek to turn with the ball, or distribute it to a player facing the goal, who optimally also <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the opponent's midfielders - or even on the move into the space behind the opponent's defenders.|$|E

25|$|A {{teleprompter}} is {{a display}} device that prompts the person speaking {{with an electronic}} visual text of a speech or script.
