5000|$|Lord {{pushed the}} Hammond-Leslie sound through Marshall amplification, {{creating}} a growling, heavy, mechanical sound which allowed Lord {{to compete with}} Blackmore as a soloist, with an organ that sounded as prominent as the lead guitar. Said one reviewer, [...] "many have tried to imitate Lord's style, and all failed." [...] Said Lord himself, [...] "There's a way of playing a Hammond that's different. A lot of people {{make the mistake of}} thinking that you can play a Hammond with a piano technique. Well, you can, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> are playing a Hammond with a piano technique. Really, you {{have to learn how to}} play an organ. It's a legato technique; it's a technique to achieve legato on a non-legato instrument." ...|$|E
5000|$|His {{debut as}} a vocalist for the band, Dickey Betts {{composed}} [...] "Blue Sky" [...] about his Native American girlfriend, Sandy [...] "Bluesky" [...] Wabegijig, whom he later married. The lyrics leave out any references to gender {{to make it}} nonspecific: [...] "Once I got into the song I realized how nice {{it would be to}} keep the vernaculars—he and she—out and make it like you’re thinking of the spirit, like I was giving thanks for a beautiful day. I think that made it broader and more relatable to anyone and everyone," [...] he later said. Betts initially wanted the band's lead vocalist, Gregg Allman, to sing the song, but guitarist Duane Allman encouraged him to sing it himself: [...] "Man, this is your song and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> and you need to sing it." [...] An embryonic version of the song {{can be found on the}} fan bootleg, The Gatlinburg Tapes, a recording of the band jamming in April 1971 in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.|$|E

[...] She says that during her formative years, she listened to a mixture of her parents' music collections (which included Joni Mitchell, Sun Ra, and South African music) and genres popular in south London such as reggae, soul, R&B, and ragga—she describes her music as [...] "none of those things but all of them". A profile by The Guardian introduced the singer as [...] "part of a new breed of young black, or mixed race, London girls ... who resolutely refuse to make the music that's expected of 'women of colour', such as R&B, hip-hop or grime".|$|E

As {{depicted}} in the documentary Giuliani Time, Parkinson's disease patient John Hynes called Giuliani's show in January 2000 to complain about being cut off from Medicaid after paying more than $100,000 of taxes in his life before he was disabled with the disease. Hynes accused the New York City Human Resources Administration of repeatedly opening fraud investigations on him, then dropping the case for lack of evidence, only to re-open it. Hynes told Giuliani, [...] "The biggest thing you could do to reduce crime would be to resign, sir. Crime would drop like a rock if you resigned. You're the biggest criminal in the city." [...] Giuliani responded, [...] "What kind of little hole are you in there, John? <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> are in a little hole. JOHN! Are you okay there? You're breathing funny." [...] Hynes replied: [...] "No, I'm not okay. I'm sick, and you cut me off my food stamps and Medicaid several times; but I suppose you don't {{give a damn about}} that either." [...] Giuliani replied, [...] "There's something really wrong with you there, John. I can hear it in your voice.... Now, why don't you stay on the line. We'll take your name and your number and we'll send you psychiatric help, 'cause you seriously need it." [...] After Hynes hung up, Giuliani continued, [...] "Man! Look, it's a big city, and you get some real weirdos who hang out in this city, and that's what I was worried about on, uh, New Year's Eve. I wasn't, you know - I figured, the terrorist groups and all that we could keep under control - worried, but who knows what, what's living in some cave somewhere. So, uh, and John called up. John calls up from Queens, but who knows where he's from." [...] Hynes subsequently said, [...] "Mr. Giuliani showed a total lack of respect for all disabled people when he mocked me after I revealed that I was sick." ...|$|E

5000|$|For 7 {{hours from}} 2.00pm on July 2, 1956, {{the day after}} the Steve Allen Show performance, Presley {{recorded}} [...] "Hound Dog" [...] along with [...] "Don't Be Cruel" [...] and [...] "Any Way You Want Me" [...] for RCA Victor at RCA's New York City studio with his regular band of Scotty Moore on lead guitar, Bill Black on bass, D. J. Fontana on drums, and backing vocals from the Jordanaires. Despite its popularity in his live shows, Presley had not planned nor prepared to record [...] "Hound Dog", but agreed to do so at the insistence of RCA's assigned producer Steve Sholes, who argued that [...] "'Hound Dog' was so identified with Elvis that fans would demand a record of the concert standard." [...] According to Ace Collins: [...] "Elvis may not have wanted to record 'Hound Dog', but he had a definite idea of how he wanted the finished product to sound. Though he usually slowed it down and treated it like a blues number in concert, in the studio Elvis wanted the song to come off as fast and dynamic." [...] While the producing credit was given to Sholes,the studio recordings reveal that Presley produced the songs himself, which is verified by the band members. Gordon Stoker, First Tenor of The Jordanaires, who were chosen to provide backup vocals, recalls: [...] "They had demos on almost everything that Elvis recorded, and we'd take it from the demo. We'd listen to the demo, most of the time, and we'd take it from the demo. We had (Big) Mama Thornton's record on 'Hound Dog', since she had a record on that. After listening to it we actually thought it was awful and couldn't figure out why Elvis wanted to do that." [...] However, what Stoker did not realize was that Presley wanted to record the version he saw in Las Vegas by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys that he had been performing since May. As session pianist Emidio [...] "Shorty Long" [...] Vagnoni left to work on a rehearsal for a stage show, Stoker plays piano on this recording of [...] "Hound Dog". As Stoker was unable to also sing first tenor, [...] "the Jordanaires {{try to come up with}} a combined sound as best they can to cover it, and Gordon laughs as he states, 'That's one of the worst sounds we ever got on any record!' However Elvis insists on doing the song, and the results, albeit without Gordon singing tenor, will still do more than please the masses. Gordon also related that Elvis very much knew in his mind what he wanted the final results to be so they didn't spend a lot of time working out tempos."In response to journalist Dave Schwensen, who said: [...] "I remember reading an interview a few years ago with Keith Richards from The Rolling Stones, ... "He was talking about the second guitar break on the recording of 'Hound Dog' and said <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> just took off your guitar, dropped it on the floor and it got the perfect sound.

"It was just… Sometimes in the studio you do it too many times and you go past that peak. Like three takes before was really the one you should use. That was it. We had done the thing, ("Hound Dog"). I think it was printed somewhere that we did it about forty or sixty … I don't know, give or take. But if someone was counting it off, just a couple notes and we stop, that's a take. You know?

40|$|Increasingly, dialectological {{descriptions}} of linguistic differences {{appear to be}} based on an overly simple conception of the relation between language and space. In a time of increased mobility it is ever more difficult to retain the idea of dialects – or language – as belonging in one particular territory. People and dialects are constantly on the move, and as a consequence territories are increasingly linguistically heterogeneous, and individuals are expanding their linguistic repertoires. The idea of a strong connection between place, individual and language is thus increasingly challenged. Yet that idea, though in transformation, seems {{in one form or another}} to persist. It seems worth asking, therefore, what <b>it</b> takes to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> belong. Do you need to speak a language “the native way” to pass as a “true” representative of a given place? Which variety of the local dialect would you have to speak? Would it be acceptable to speak a levelled dialect? Could you switch between different dialects, or speak with an accent? Put differently: in late-modernity, globalized Norway, what are people’s preconceptions about the connections that exist or ought to exist between language, body, and place? What expectations do people have regarding connections between language and identity?
