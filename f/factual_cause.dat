40|$|Bryant Arroyo {{was arrested}} in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on September 26, 1994 in {{connection}} with baby Jordan Anthony Shenk’s death. On May 10, 1995, {{he was convicted of}} first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. The medical examiner testified at Arroyo’s preliminary hearing and trial that Jordan was killed by blunt trauma to the chest and abdomen, and that the manner of death was homicide. My investigation of this case clearly showed that Jordan {{died as a result of}} serious illnesses that led to his cardiac arrest and bleedings on September 25, 1994. He had brain disease (spongiosis of the cerebral cortex and white matter, and focal Purkinje cell dropout in the cerebellum); aspiration pneumonitis; sepsis; inflammation of the liver, gallbladder, and the mesentery; thymus atrophy; and weight loss. These lesions and symptoms have been reported in children with propionic acidemia and other metabolic problems involving branched amino acids. The baby’s symptoms and lesions indicate that he probably suffered from genetic illness that led to the development of propionic acidemia and his death. The government and the medical authority in the State of Pennsylvania should evaluate the medical evidence that shows Bryant Arroyo was falsely accused and unjustly con-victed of killing Jordan Anthony Shenk because the <b>factual</b> <b>causes</b> of illness and death in this case were not revealed to the jury. I believe that Bryant should be released from prison immediately and compensated for his pain and suffering and time wrongly spent in prison...|$|R

He was placed on mechanical ventilation and treated with epinephrine, IV fluids, antibiotics, ulcer prophylaxis, and sodium bicarbonate.

An autopsy was performed and the medical examiner alleged that Steven {{died as a result}} of multiple blunt force injuries to the head and other regions of his body, and that the manner of death was homicide. Armando Castillo, Steven’s caretaker was accused of killing Steven. He was arrested and indicted. A jury convicted him in May of 1999 and sentenced him to 27 years in prison for killing Steven. My review of the medical evidence reveals that Steven was suffering from severe lymphocytopenia and immune depression, acute bronchopneu-monia, bacterial infections, acute and chronic peritonitis, kidney infections, and liver damage. He had blood lymphocyte counts of 568 - 693 cells/µL, which is well below normal. Gram-stain study and blood culture of Steven’s blood sample taken at 30 minutes following admission revealed the presence of Gram-positive cocci and Staphalococcus coagulase negative.

40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} legal {{doctrine}} res ipsa loquitur ('the thing speaks for itself) {{in the context}} of delictual claims for compensation for medical negligence in South African law. The thesis accepts that the doctrine is defensible in principle: a civil court may justifiably draw an inference that a defendant's negligent conduct was a <b>factual</b> <b>cause</b> of the harm suffered in simple cases where there is uncontradicted evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case. However, it is argued that the South Africa Appellate Division's rejection of the doctrine {{in the context of}} medical negligence in 1924 remains justified. It is sometimes thought that the doctrine would assist plaintiffs in complex medical cases by easing the difficulty of establishing a cause of action on a balance of probabilities. However, the thesis argues to the contrary that applying the doctrine in the context of medical negligence claims in South Africa is potentially unjust to claimants and defendants alike. Judgments of medical negligence cannot be made soundly without a proper appreciation of the relevant medical facts. The availability of the doctrine, in the South African context, provides a motivation for plaintiffs to advance insufficiently-prepared evidence, sometimes without the views of experts. This results in the oversimplification of complex medical realities, which increases the risk that courts may reach conclusions regarding negligence and factual causation for reasons that are unjustifiable from a medical perspective. Insufficiently-prepared evidence is also vulnerable to rebuttal by defendant-doctors on 'exotic' or inadequate grounds from a medical perspective, resulting in the unjust rejection of negligence claims. By enabling a superficial approach to deciding questions of medical negligence in the South African context, the doctrine may promote the erroneous assumption that bad medical outcomes typically result from medical wrongdoing. To make its case, the thesis draws on case studies of a variety of medical procedures and contrasts the operation of res ipsa loquitur in South Africa against English legal experience. Differences between the two systems of medical negligence cast doubt on the notion that the English approach should be transplanted to South Africa. Rather than relying on the res ipsa loquitur doctrine to bolster claims made without medical expert evidence, the South African plaintiff should instead rely on constitutional arguments, appealing to basic rights to bodily integrity and dignity, to justify the injection of a degree of flexibility into the common-law elements of a delictual claim...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to consider whether the articles 6 : 107 and 6 : 108 BW should be reconsidered. These articles grant third parties an action to bring an independent claim against the tortfeasor in personal injury cases. The characteristics of these articles are threefold. First, these claims are derived from the liability towards the direct victim. Second, the actions are of a limited of nature. Finally, when the damage suffered by the third party is a consequence of the injury or death of someone else, these apply on an exclusive basis: a right to full compensation cannot be allowed on the basis of tort law. The main aim of these articles is to set clear boundaries for liability in personal injury cases. Someone is a ‘third party’ when his damage is caused by the death or injury of someone else. That direct nature is determined in fact, but that factual determination is followed by a normative conclusion: a factual third party cannot be awarded full compensation. In my opinion this is a mistaken starting point. The focus should be on the question whether a protected interest exists and whether the tortfeasor has infringed that protected interest. Next, from the perspective of private enforcement two questions should be distinguished. First, which third party damage should be compensated when the foundation is found in the liability towards the direct victim? Second, under which circumstances should the interest of third parties autonomously be protected by tort law? To start with the first question. The government has tried to expand the scope of the derived actions. In my opinion there is one argument against this solution: the fact that liability is founded on one party cannot be directional for the compensation of third party damage which cannot be qualified as the transferred loss. The tortfeasor is first responsible for the damage caused by his wrongful act towards the person against who liability exists. By making exceptions for the benefit of one type of third party or for one of his losses, boundaries will be difficult to explain and maintain. In my opinion another solution is more appropriate: answering the second question of enforcement. The necessity of making exceptions is mostly advocated in favour of next of kin. Decisive in concluding that the interest of family members should autonomously be protected is that I consider the interest of ‘direct family members’ to be the most protectable interest next to someone’s life and health. A family is a unit which forms the essence of someone’s personality. By taking someone from that unit or seriously injuring that person, a family member is directly forced to reconsider life choices. Tort law should facilitate the (new) choices which family members are forced to make. The essence of my conclusions is that the system of articles 6 : 107 and 6 : 108 BW should be reconsidered as far as its exclusive scope is concerned. General tort law should be decisive for someone’s position in tort law, not the <b>factual</b> <b>cause</b> of someone’s damage...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} the level of fear experienced by students aged 13 to 30 years, in response to different types of anti-smoking fear appeals. It seeks to extend and validate Quinn et al. 's study by specifically comparing adolescent and young adult responses to fear appeals. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 548 useable questionnaires were collected via a self-administered questionnaire based on established scales. Factor analysis, T tests and ANOVA were used to replicate Quinn et al. 's analysis of the data. Findings – The main {{results are consistent with}} previous findings that adolescents and non-smokers experience more fear. Further, general health and <b>factual</b> appeals <b>cause</b> the most fear across all ages but adolescents were more fearful of factual appeals and social ostracism appeals than young adults possibly indicating that factual and social appeals are better targeted at adolescents than young adults. The results were broadly similar to Quinn et al. 's results. Practical implications – Advertisers often use realistic fear appeals {{to attract the attention of}} the intended recipient, to scare the recipient into processing the information, and to get them to act in response to the anti-smoking message. However, because adolescents and nonsmokers experience more fear, social marketers, governments, schools and parents need to customise fear appeals to suit these recipients.

The docu ments cover the years 1984 - 1988, which began with prosperity and ended with severe losses. An analysis of how the company communicated this information to its shareholders offers some insights into the motivation and priorities of the Cross & Trecker management. This analysis suggests that a company's public communications are more complex than has been thought. Specific methodology used is based on systemic theory, developed by Halli day (1976, 1978, 1985 a, 1985 b) and others and employs the systems of transitivity (verb structures), thematic structure (subjects), context and cohesion, and condensations. Verb structures show a predictable increase in passive constructions as the years pass and profits decrease. Regarding other verb structures, however, the results were more complex, including an increase in the use of verbs of "being. " Combined with the analysis of thematic structures, which show an increase in nonhuman agents, and contextual features shown by cohesion and condensa tions, the conclusion is that, as the news becomes more negative, linguistic structures suggest a <b>factual,</b> "objective" situation <b>caused</b> by circumstances not attributable to any persons who might otherwise be thought responsible...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{phenomena}} and natural disasters occur across {{the regions of}} the United States. While science now provides <b>factual</b> documentation for <b>causes</b> of meteorological and geological events, most Native American tribes lacked scientific explanations of these occurrences. Native Americans, however, sought to explain the effects and often devastation resulting from meteorological and geological events in some manner. The religions and mythologies of many cultures provide explanations for the occurrence of natural phenomena through supernatural intervention. The presentation of myths by geographic region {{provided the basis for}} analysis of explanations for natural phenomena. Regional analysis of myths suggests that commonalities exist among Native American Groups experiencing similar meteorological and geological events. Furthermore, common themes span across regional boundaries. For example, the use of a Thunderbird, a large bird with glowing eyes, as an explanation for the occurrence of thunder and storms occurs in every region of the United States. Another common theme is the use of a storm by a supernatural force as punishment for unacceptable behaviors of the earth's inhabitants. The most frequent example of this is the theme of a flood that destroys many inhabitants {{at some point in the}} history of the tribe. Often, storms and other natural phenomena have explanations based in the creation myth of the tribe. Another theme in myths regarding natural phenomena is the resolution of opposing forces. In many myths, the opposition exists between humans and nature, weather beings or spirits, or animals and nature. Myths regarding natural phenomena occasionally contain the attempt by humans or animals to gain control over nature or natural elements. The results of this control vary from favorable to unfavorable for those involved. A final theme exhibited in many myths is the function of a supernatural force associated with weather as a guardian, protector, and provider. The belief in these guardians provides Native Americans with assurance that they will be protected, and provided for, especially in times of natural disasters or storms. Research indicates that compilation of myths regarding natural phenomena facilitates regional and cross-cultural analysis and understanding of the role of supernatural intervention in Native American comprehension of natural phenomena.

40|$|Recent appellate {{decisions}} {{reveal a}} chaotic contributory infringement doctrine that offers little direction to entrepreneurs {{trying to balance}} digital innovation with legal strictures. Aware of the problem, both the Supreme Court and legal scholars urge a modeling of contributory infringement on common law tort rules. But common law tort is an enormous subject. Without further instruction, the subject area is too vast and contradictory to offer a realistic template for reform. Even when the narrower body of tort law for secondary actors is consulted, there is still too much variation in the existing precedent to provide the necessary guidance. Instead of simply instructing the courts to consult tort law, we stress two specific reforms to make contributory infringement decisions more logical and predictable. First, tort law’s rules for causal analysis provide a significant resource for contributory infringement doctrine. The intuitive appeal of causal reasoning {{as well as its}} frequent presence in other legal subjects makes it a natural fit for contributory infringement doctrine. In particular, we urge courts wrestling with contributory infringement to adopt tort law’s bifurcation of factual causation and the separate public policy questions of proximate cause. An unfortunate trend in the recent contributory infringement decisions has been a blending of these two legal issues, resulting in normative decisionmaking cloaked in empirical language. Observing a strict line between <b>factual</b> and proximate <b>cause</b> would cure this problem and produce precedents less threatening to nascent technologies. Second, courts can profit from the refinements in causal analysis already developed in the field of epidemiology. By modeling the complex interaction between causal agents, epidemiologists gain a better sense of where resources should be deployed in combating diseases that adversely affect public health. We advocate similar moves in intellectual property law to help determine which intermediaries should face liability for others’ infringing conduct. Epidemiologists sort out causal effects by explicitly defining minimally sufficient multiple component mechanisms, distinguishing between general and specific causation, and identifying suitable referents for each identified link on a causal chain. By borrowing from the epidemiologist’s playbook, judges evaluating contributory infringement disputes can separate the causal from the non-causal and the actionable from the non-actionable instead of relying on hazy intuition to determine the viability of online business models...|$|R
40|$|Positive law is two-{{dimension}}al: it has {{a justice}} (or ideal) dimension (and requisite) and a factual (or real) dimension (and requisite). Both are essential. Hence positive law lapses when {{either of the two}} is absent. In terms of the factual requisite, law remains in place as actual norms of law (unlike mere norm-formulations), provided that a minimum degree of effectiveness is maintained; that is to say, only as long as the subjects of the law consistently and voluntarily act in accordance with such norm/s, and provided further that deviant conduct is remedied by effective coercive measures. "Norm/s" that lose the factual dimension lapse into mere norm-formulations and no longer qualify as positive law. Thus viewed, a realistic grasp of the content of law is co-dependent on actual conduct, regardless of what the norm-formulations purport positive law to entail, because the norm-formulations may have lost track of the actual state of the law. Grasping the actual content of law, including constitutional law, therefore requires not only analysing the norm-formulations of the formally recognised sources of the law, but more specifically social and political observation which may reveal the following: (1) 	actual behaviour that closely corresponds with a legal norm-formulation, in which case the formulations reliably happen to reflect (and by implication to describe) the actual state of law; or (2) 	conduct that regularly deviates from the norm-formulations (usus) by the deviators who deem themselves legally bound to act as they are acting (opinio iuris), in which case new (substituting) law has in fact come into being, without such substituting law being reflected in a new (amended) norm-formulation; or (3) 	large-scale but inconsistent and irregular deviant conduct where the deviators do not consider themselves legally bound to act in the various deviant ways, combined with haphazard enforcement, thus allowing deviators to get away with their transgressions. Unlike the first scenario, the purported norm (law) as reflected in the norm-formulations is in part unsettled but unlike as in the second scenario, no new norm (law) has come into being. A legal lacuna opens up - that is, an area not regulated by existing legal norms. Viewed {{from the perspective of the}} factual dimension, law, including constitutional law, is much more susceptible to the volatility of unpredictable changes and instability than what the doctrine of the rule of law and constitutional supremacy purport it to be. The doctrine holds law (and the constitution) to be formulation driven, and therefore formal-static in nature, in that the law remains essentially static until the norm-formulations (the text) are amended in terms of the prescribed amendment procedures prescribed by the constitution. Consequently, the prevalent doctrine of the rule of law and constitutional supremacy fail to account for the <b>factual</b> dimension which <b>causes</b> it (the doctrine) to obscure the inner workings of the factual dimension of law, and therefore acts as a hindrance to understanding the nature and content of (positive) law, including the constitution. ...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the {{everyday}} talk of people who take part in an online support group on depression. Although the popularity of online support groups has increased over the years, illustrated by {{a growing number of}} people -both patients and family members-, who turn to the Internet to join these groups, little is known about their daily practices. This study aims {{to explore the}}se conversational practices based on a detailed examination of participants' talk within such groups. The conversational materials that are collected are analysed with the help of discursive psychology, a perspective developed by the British social psychologists Edwards, Potter and Wetherell. The view on language that is favoured within this approach can best be illustrated by considering its three main concepts: construction, action and non-cognition. With the notion of construction, discursive psychology puts forward the view that through language people construct different versions of reality. It is pointed out how these versions are themselves also rhetorically designed. The view that language is oriented towards action draws attention to the fact that people do things with language rather than merely describing the world as it is. This view runs counter to the perspective that language is an abstract system of reference that describes how things essentially are. Discursive psychology considers language an instrument in the hands of participants, which enables them to accomplish different kinds of interactional functions, e. g., blaming, complementing or inviting someone, taking responsibility or presenting a particular state of affairs as factual. The view that language is oriented towards social action implies a non-cognitive view on reality. That is to say, cognitively inspired notions like hoping, wanting but also emotion words like anger or jealousy are not taken as expressions of particular states of mind or feelings, nor are they considered as explanatory concepts per se. Rather, discursive psychology considers them a topic of study and examines the ways in which these concepts are employed by participants to fulfil different kinds of interactional goals. To give an example, a study of marriage counselling sessions by Edwards has shown how the husband and wife define jealousy both as an enduring character trait, as well as a warranted reaction to flirtatious behaviour of the other. The study shows how offering these descriptions enables the couple to manage issues of responsibility and blame for their marital problems. The theoretical concepts that typify a discursive psychological approach are closely related to the way the conversational materials are collected and analysed (see Chapter 3). Starting point for the analysis is to consider how participants themselves take up a particular utterance. This point of view, also described as the next-turn proof procedure, argues that participants themselves determine whether a particular utterance counts as an accusation or a description, rather than any informed guesses made by the researcher. Apart from this validation procedure, there are a number of other principles that discursive psychology considers helpful in analysing the data that are collected. First, there is the variation in descriptions that offers a starting point to examine the discursive work that particular utterances accomplish. A second principle is the rhetorical organisation of talk that draws attention to the fact that every description is designed in such a way so as to counter an alternative description. A third analytical lever that can be helpful is the so-called accountability feature which illustrates participants' orientation to the normative accountability of their behaviour, thereby pointing to the discursive business that is locally accomplished. To further contribute to the quality and validity of the analysis, discursive psychology attempts to integrate the findings with existing studies and presents the integral materials to the reader, who is thereby in a position to judge the interpretations made by the researcher. At the centre of attention in this study is an online support group for people with depression. For quite some time, communication via computers has been studied from the perspective of Reduced Social Cues, as developed by Sproull and Kiesler. The findings that were reached within this tradition have been influential in that they have described this type of communication predominantly as anti-normative and leading to polarised and extreme outcomes. Recent theoretical models like the SIDE model, developed by Spears and Lea, and the SIP perspective, developed by Walther, have countered this largely negative view by propagating that normative influence can very well be transmitted in online environments, depending on whether a social or personal identity is salient. Although both models do not consider medium characteristics to determine the process of communication nor its outcomes, they do provide a rather mechanistic view of the communication process, and of the way in which people construct identities. This is partly caused by the fact that these studies are based on experiments. Other studies, predominantly from a sociological or ethnographic point of view, have redirected their focus of attention to the diverging ways in which people actually use the different options this medium offers. However, these types of research have not taken into account the everyday talk of people who interact online, which is an area of attention that is also overlooked in studies which focus on online support groups in particular. The current image of computer mediated communication processes is therefore still to a large extent determined by the assumptions put forward by the Reduced Social Cues perspective. Communication via the Internet is in this view taken to be largely unproblematic and straightforward, because it is argued that the interaction is not hindered by so-called status effects, e. g., the alleged influence of factors like age or gender in face-to-face conversations. Online interaction is also typified as transient, because any tangible effects of the communication process are lacking: there are only messages that appear and disappear on a computer screen. Also with regard to interaction in online support groups, an image is put forward of a straightforward and easy exchange of experiences and advice among those who are 'like-minded'. Against the backdrop of this research, this study attempts to undertake a detailed exploration of participants' everyday talk in an online support group on depression. The conversational materials that are collected are the contributions written to this support group during a period of two years. A first gloss of the data has resulted in the identification of three broad areas of attention, which are explored in greater detail in chapters 4, 5 and 6 (see for a detailed overview of how these areas have been identified, Chapter 3). This study focuses on the way people describe themselves and their illness, and the kinds of interactional functions that are accomplished in doing so. In particular, this study aims to examine how participants: introduce themselves in this group by attributing particular identity categories to themselves and other people;interactionally manage to ask for support and provide 'support' to others;interactionally manage to request advice and offer 'advice' to others. Chapter 4 shows how participants present themselves when they visit this support group for the first time. Exploring these first fragments demonstrates how people do not start addressing their feelings and problems in relation to depression straightaway. Remarkably, participants begin their messages by providing extensive explanations of how their depression has come about. The chapter demonstrates how these explanations, which are most of the time presented as external from the speaker, enable participants to explain for their depression on the basis of objective and <b>factual</b> <b>causes.</b> In this way, participants resist the claim that their depression is an illness that merely resides in peoples' heads, on the basis of which it could be considered an imaginary disease. It also works to show their ability to take into account the reasons behind their depression, which enables them to stress their personal competence. Maintaining a sense of personal competence is also an important concern when participants present themselves vis-à-vis other participants in this group. By presenting themselves as being positively different form others (e. g., 'sensitive', or 'intellectually demanding') participants are able to address their depression, without suffering a lack of personal competence. Also when they address their depression while emphasising that they have continuously tried to improve their situation, participants are offered an opportunity to portray themselves as depressed but competent. In this way, participants are able to address their illness, while countering the impression that depression can easily be overcome if the person who is depressed is willing to do something about it. Chapter 5 describes how participants show a pervasive concern with accounting for their request for help. Contrary to what one might expect, talking about one's feelings and asking for help in a support group for peers is far from straightforward. This chapter demonstrates a number of discursive 'strategies' that participants employ and which illustrate their awareness as to whether their request for support is appropriate. It was shown how participants may describe their depression as a result of emotions, which operate autonomously from themselves. Participants may also describe their request for support as an expression of honest feelings, which is as such, hard to refute. Two other discursive resources that participants may draw on is to describe their problems in relation to the troubles other participants are having and attend to the consequences of posting their down feelings for the well-being of the group. This chapter thus shows how calls for help are not automatically considered 'appropriate' in this support group. Remarkably, this chapter simultaneously demonstrates that participants present talking about their feelings of depression as a moral obligation. As such, participants find another discursive 'strategy' to account for their call for help. Chapter 5 shows that what counts as a 'norm' is not clearly defined, nor can its meaning be determined at the outset. On the contrary, what counts as an 'appropriate' request for support is subject to continuous negotiation. The chapter also illustrates how participants refer to normative expectations that ostensibly contradict each other, and also, how they render different normative expectations applicable in different situations. Thus, we have seen how participants attend to their call for support as something to account for, while at the same time defining talking about your feelings of depression as a moral obligation. Chapter 6 draws attention to the ways in which participants interactionally manage to ask for advice and provide advice to others. It was shown how advice was given by defining it as a 'technical matter', which made available the suggestion that offering advice is an uncomplicated matter. At the same time however, we see that participants in this group collectively define 'advice' as a general category, as inappropriate. The fragments that are presented in this chapter show how participants reject advice, since it makes inferentially available that they are depending on others to offer advice to them. In those instances, participants resist this claim by presenting their contribution as merely 'venting' or 'unloading', which can happen relatively autonomously from others. This chapter also demonstrates how personal experience in this group does not automatically count as a relevant basis to provide advice. Interestingly, when we consider that we are dealing with a group for peers where we may expect sharing experiences to be an important aspect that constitutes such a group, what we see is that participants continuously emphasise their individually different circumstances as a discursive 'strategy' to reject advice. Chapter 7 provides an overview of the findings and formulates recommendations for practice and future research. An important conclusion this study draws is that next to providing and asking for support and advice, this support group offers participants the possibility to construct 'adequate' and 'appropriate' identities, by offering descriptions of who they are and how their depression has come about. The latter may serve as a better illustration of the possible value this group holds for its participants than the mere fact that this group provides an opportunity to exchange advice and support. Another important issue this study demonstrates is that presenting oneself as depressed but competent poses an important concern for participants, and it has shown the different ways in which participants orient to this concern. One of the ways in which participants portray themselves as competent is by offering extensive explanations of how their depression has come about. This offers insight in the possible themes of conversation that participants of these groups consider relevant. Future research may draw attention to whether the kinds of concerns that are demonstrated to be important for participants in this support group, e. g., constructing 'adequate' and 'appropriate' identities, might also prove to be important for participants who take part in other support groups. This chapter also formulates the recommendation that user-centred research offers an important contribution in exploring the possibilities of this new medium. The added value of this type of research can be further illustrated when we compare it with the kinds of studies that consider media characteristics such as anonymity to determine the type of communication and its outcomes, without considering the ways in which the medium is put to use by its users. The chapter thus states that paying attention to participants' actual uses of the medium is an important route for future research...|$|R
