6000|$|RICHARD. Yes: I'll come. (He {{rises and}} takes a step towards his own coat; then recollects himself, and, {{with his back to}} the sergeant, moves his gaze slowly round the room without turning his head until he sees Anderson's black coat hanging up on the press. He goes composedly to it; takes it down; and puts it on. The idea of himself as a parson tickles him: <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the black sleeve on his arm, and then smiles slyly at Judith, whose white face shows him that what she is painfully {{struggling}} to grasp is not the humor of the situation but its horror. He turns to the sergeant, who is approaching him with a pair of handcuffs hidden behind him, and says lightly) Did you ever arrest a man of my cloth before, Sergeant? ...|$|E

I swear to God, none of us did it. It had been there the whole time. It was the curse of El Dorado!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Understatement {{often leads}} to litotes, a rhetorical {{construct}} in which understatement is used to emphasize a point. It is a staple of humour in English-speaking cultures. For example in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, an Army officer has just lost his leg. When asked how he feels, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his bloody stump and responds, [...] "Stings a bit." ...|$|E

5000|$|It is November 9, 1957, and Sam Beckett has [...] "leaped" [...] {{into the}} body of Melvin Spooner, a {{mortician}} in Riven Rock, Massachusetts, who also serves as the coroner. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the body of Hilla Doehner, a young German immigrant. Although it initially appears that she drowned herself, Sam determines that she was in fact murdered. He realizes that he is there to solve her murder, but grows obsessed with her.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stereotype}} of English understatement {{has been exploited}} in humour, for example in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. In one scene, a suburban dinner party is invaded by Death, who wears a long black cloak and carries a scythe. [...] "Well," [...] says one party guest, [...] "that's cast rather a gloom over the evening, hasn't it?" [...] In another scene, an Army officer has just lost his leg. When asked how he feels, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his bloody stump and responds, [...] "Stings a bit." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ray's biographer W. Andrew Robinson {{describes}} {{one particular}} {{scene from the}} screenplay as follows: [...] "In a series of fantastically quick, short steps over the lotus leaves, the Alien reaches {{the shore of the}} pond. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the grass, examines the blade and is off hopping into the bamboo grove. There the Alien sees a small plant. His eyes light up with a yellow light. He passes his hand over the plant, and flowers come out. A thin, soft high-pitched laugh shows the Alien is pleased." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} a quick frown. Decidedly he was annoyed.|$|R

50|$|In {{the opening}} scene, a cross {{stands in the}} center of the stage and a crowd is surging about it. Presently Agnello, a young nephew of the Duchess Gismonda, enters. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a tiger in a pit, preferring to keep his {{distance}} from it, and discusses a statue of Aphrodite, next to the cross, with some comrades. Zaccaria and his accomplice Gregorez appear. They plan to lure Francesco, Gismonda's son, to the edge of the pit, and shove him in, making it look like an accident. The excitement above has driven the captive tiger into a frenzy.|$|E
5000|$|It's dawn in the woods. Mother and Father Swan, {{with their}} little cygnets, coast across a pond. The Night Watchman of the forest, Mr. Owl, awakens. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the {{sleeping}} Peterkin, {{a young boy}} satyr, and wonders what mischief he will get into today. Peterkin wakes up, and, prodded by a croaking frog, picks up his flute and starts to play it loudly. When the mother birds in their nests up above tell him to [...] "Be quiet!" [...] and boast about their own well-behaved families (i.e., their eggs), Peterkin decides {{to get back at}} them.|$|E
50|$|Samir and Marie {{discuss the}} events and their relationship. Marie decides that they should focus on their future, while Samir appears conflicted. Ahmad prepares to return to Iran. He says {{farewell}} to the children and attempts to talk to Marie {{about the end of}} their marriage, but Marie does not let him, stating that she doesn't need to know such things now. Meanwhile, Samir visits his wife in hospital with a selection of perfumes, which the doctors have recommended in order to possibly initiate a response. He sprays on some of his cologne and leans over her, asking her to squeeze his hand if she can smell it. A tear runs down her face and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her hand, which is holding his.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a curly {{head and}} a sweet pretty face that he knew.|$|R

5000|$|Several critics lauded Grimes' {{interactions}} with Walsh in [...] "18 Miles Out." [...] Writing for CNN, Henry Hanks said that [...] "Rick {{made it clear}} to Shane that he had to respect his rules from now on." [...] Alex Crumb of The Faster Times evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "wholly satisfying," [...] while Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich appreciated the fight scene involving Grimes and Walsh; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Berriman of SFX summated: [...] "It's shocking when Shane hurls a wrench at Rick’s head, but even more shocking that Rick is prepared to cut and run and leave him for dead. Rick's change of heart when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the two dead walkers on the floor and is reminded of the friendship between himself and his former partner is a beautifully played moment, which speaks volumes without a single line of dialogue being uttered. The fact that, come the end, he's willing to trust Shane again after all that has gone on between them is genuinely touching." ...|$|E
5000|$|Frisky is seen {{running through}} the hallway where he sees his ball, and he pounces on it and it rolls under the carpet. As he goes after the ball by {{crawling}} under the carpet, he's not quite sure where it is, so he takes a sniff and bites down on the ball and comes {{out from under the}} carpet, ball held tightly in his teeth (typical puppy-style). He throws the ball up into the air and tries to catch it as it falls back to the floor but he misses, and his empty jaws snap shut. He throws the ball up again, but this time it doesn't come down right after, and as he's {{trying to figure out where}} the ball is, it drops out of the air and hits him on the head. He gets scared and scampers off behind a wall, yelping all the way. Angrily, he jumps out at the ball and barks at it and walks away, but has to stop for a moment as he has to scratch. A flea falls to the floor as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> it and gives it a sniff. It jumps at him and he yelps, but as he leaves, the flea jumps back into his fur. Frisky's mistress (Bea Benaderet) notices him scratching away and says, [...] "So, Mr. Frisky - I see YOU need a bath! Well, there's no time like the present." ...|$|E
5000|$|Trainer : Controls the mount's train angle (bearing). He sits in {{the right}} front corner of the mount. (See the far right man in the Mk21 open mount picture.) In front of him, are his optical sight, hand wheels, and train drive {{controls}}. Between his knees is a large box called the Train Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the train power drive. On top of the box, is a window {{with a set of}} dials that indicate the train angle of the gun, and the automatic train orders electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials also tell him the difference between the gun's present train angle and the ordered train angle. He changes the bearing of the gun, by moving his hand wheels, until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the train drive into Auto. This disengages his hand wheels, and gives train angle control to the Fire Control System. Then, he reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Train in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the train drive to local. In local control, he controls the gun's train angle with his hand wheels to keep his sight's vertical cross hair on the target.|$|E

50|$|John then narrates the {{beginning}} of the lives of his future band mates Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison and also {{the rest of his life}} until the point he meets Paul for the first time and they decide to play together. He then meets George and makes a writing partnership with Paul which works in a way to which if one of them writes a song they both get credit. Then John narrates the band's touring until they meet Brian Epstein for the first time and he agrees to get them a recording contract. When he does the band considers firing Pete Best as drummer but do not know who will replace him. Paul suggests Ringo Starr and he has been listening in the whole time and agrees so once again John starts to narrate but stops at the height of Beatlemania when his father returns to try to reap the fruits of John's success and tells him to go away so John narrates a huge portion of the Beatles' career and stops at the point where he meets Yoko Ono and develops a relationship with her. Some years later in John's career with the Beatles he becomes deeply depressed and is visited by a version of his cosmic self who tells him(self) that he needs to stop being so down on himself and get back to work writing and performing music. He agrees but little does John know former President of the United States Richard Nixon has an anti-Lennon plan in place and splinter cell assassin named Mark David Chapman has been brain-washed to kill Lennon when commanded to. So Lennon exits his apartment building The Dakota and is gunned down by Chapman. John is now dead and back in his plane (which is apparently heaven) <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his former life and decides to make sure Chapman cannot get out of his murder charge on government pardon. He enters Chapman's thoughts and tells him to plead guilty. John then narrates once more the rest of his band mates' lives from 1980 through to the present and John one last time addresses the reader, saying that he has found peace and learned that peace can be found anywhere if one just imagines it.|$|E
5000|$|Pointer : [...] Controls the mount's {{elevation}} and firing. He sits in {{the left}} front corner of the mount. In front of him, are his optical sight, hand wheels, and elevation drive controls. To his right, about elbow high, is a large box called the Elevation Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the elevation power drive. Through a window {{on top of the}} box, he sees a set of dials that indicate the elevation of the gun, and the automatic elevation orders coming from the Fire Control System. Above the Indicator Regulator is the Electrical Fire Select Switch. It is a rotary switch with three positions: Off, Local, and Auto. Off disables the electrical firing system on the mount. Local enables the electric firing key on his right hand wheel. Auto enables the off mount electrical firing circuit from the Fire Control System. Just outside his right knee, is the Percussion Select Lever. This mechanical lever has two positions: Safe, and Armed. When it is in the armed position, the mechanical linkage for percussion firing is enabled. His right footrest is at one end of this linkage, and the firing pin sear in the breech block is at the other. By rocking his right foot forward, he fires the gun. Electrical firing is the primary firing method. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials tell him the difference between the gun's present elevation and the ordered elevation electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. He changes the elevation of the gun, by moving his hand wheels, until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the elevation drive into Auto. This disengages his hand wheels, and gives elevation control to the Fire Control System. Then, he moves the Electrical Fire Select Switch to [...] "AUTO", and reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Elevation in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the elevation drive and the Electrical Fire Select Switch to local. In local control, he controls the gun's elevation with his hand wheels to keep his sight's horizontal cross hair on the target. At the command of the Mount Captain, he fires the gun by squeezing the firing key on his right hand wheel.|$|E

The priest is seated at center and facing {{to the left}} as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a large book in his lap. He is wearing a dark robe and a dark skullcap, and a rope around his waist {{which serves as a}} belt. The light wall of the mission is visible behind him.
