From {{the start of the}} new century, music hall artistes and theatre managers had been in dispute over working conditions, a reduction in pay and perks, and an increased number of matinée performances. [...] The first significant rift was a 1906 strike, initiated by [...] The Variety Artistes' Federation. The following year, the Music Hall War commenced, which saw the Federation fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music-hall performers. Although popular enough to command her own fees, Lloyd supported the strike, acted as a picket for the strikers and gave generously to the strike fund. To raise spirits, she often performed on picket lines and took part in a fundraising performance at the Scala Theatre. During one demonstration, she recognised someone trying to enter and shouted, [...] "Let her through, girls, she'll close the music hall <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> can." [...] The singer was Belle Elmore, later murdered by her husband, Dr. Crippen. The dispute ended later the same year with a resolution broadly favourable to the performers. In 1909, Lloyd appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in Dundee where a critic for The Courier noted [...] "Her bright smile and fascinating presence {{has much to do with}} her popularity, while her songs are of the catchy style, perhaps not what a Dundee audience is familiar with, but still amusing and of an attractive style." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that actress Elizabeth Banks would guest {{star on the}} show, and in this episode, she played right-wing CNBC anchor Avery Jessup, and love interest to Alec Baldwin's Jack Donaghy. In an interview with Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello, Banks revealed that she approached the show's staff about making an appearance on the show. [...] "I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true." [...] She said that on her first day on set she [...] "begged" [...] producers if she could use a teleprompter—in which she is first introduced in the episode on the set of her show The Hot Box, with her interviewing Jack and another guest (Douglas Rees)—so that she could deliver her lines quickly, explaining that her fast delivery would help [...] "sell" [...] the comedy and her 30 Rock character. They agreed to it, though, a problem ensued when they could not figure the prompter out, which resulted in Banks [...] "throwing fastballs at [...] and him battling them back as fast as possible and hoping they could cut it together <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> were doing it." [...] Banks revealed to Ausiello that she had no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having [...] "too much fun" [...] making movies to commit to a television show full-time. According to a February 2010 report in the New York Post, after the airing of this episode, the Avery character was based on CNBC news anchor Melissa Francis, and it was Francis who [...] "pitched" [...] the character to a 30 Rock producer. Banks, however, denied this report, calling it [...] "false".|$|E

2500|$|The {{wind was}} driving the fire westward, so he ordered the boat to go to Whitehall {{and became the first}} person to inform the king of the fire. According to his entry of 2 September 1666, Pepys {{recommended}} to the king that homes be pulled down {{in the path of the}} fire in order to stem its progress. Accepting this advice, the king told him to go to Lord Mayor Thomas Bloodworth and tell him to start pulling down houses. Pepys took a coach back as far as St Paul's Cathedral before setting off on foot through the burning city. He found the Lord Mayor, who said, [...] "Lord! what can I do? I am spent: people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> can do it." [...] At noon, he returned home and [...] "had an extraordinary good dinner, and as merry, as at this time we could be", before returning to watch the fire in the city once more. Later, he returned to Whitehall, then met his wife in St. James's Park. In the evening, they watched the fire from the safety of Bankside. Pepys writes that [...] "it made me weep to see it". Returning home, Pepys met his clerk Tom Hayter who had lost everything. Hearing news that the fire was advancing, he started to pack up his possessions by moonlight.|$|E
