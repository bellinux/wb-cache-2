40|$|Abstract. Cognitive radio (CR) is a {{promising}} technology that enables opportunistic {{utilization of the}} temporarily vacant spectrum to mitigate the spectrum scarcity in wire-less communications. Since secondary users (SUs) should vacate the channel in use immediately after detecting the reappearances of primary users (PUs) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the route reliability is a distinctive chal-lenge for routing in CRNs. Furthermore, the throughput requirement of an SU session should be satisfied and it is always preferable to select a route with less negative influ-ence on other current or latish sessions. To account for the route reliability challenge, we study the <b>joint</b> <b>link</b> and channel assignment routing problem for CRNs. It is formu-lated in a form of integer nonlinear programming (INLP), which is NP-hard, {{with the objective of}} minimizing the interference of a new route to other routes while providing route reliability and throughput guarantee. An on-demand route discovery algorithm is proposed to find reliable can-didate paths, while a <b>joint</b> <b>link</b> and channel assignment routing algorithm with sequentially-connected-link coor-dination is proposed to choose the near-optimal route for improving the route reliability and minimizing negative influence.

In particular, processes in this class may be induced by any policy, possibly non-stationary, even anticipative and aware of the entire sample paths, including the future, of the arrival, estimated and true channel state processes, as long as it has no knowledge on the current true channel state, besides that available through the estimated channel state...|$|E

In this paper, we study the <b>joint</b> <b>link</b> scheduling and power control problem, focusing on maximizing the network throughput. We formulate the MAximum THroughput link Scheduling with Power Control (MATH-SPC) problem, and present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to provide optimal solutions. However, simply maximizing the throughput leads to a severe bias on bandwidth allocation among all links. In order to enhance both throughput and fairness, we define a new parameter, the Demand Satisfaction Factor (DSF), to characterize the fairness of bandwidth allocation. We formulate the MAximum Throughput fAir link Scheduling with Power Control (MATA-SPC) problem and present an MILP formulation for this problem. We also present an effective polynomial time heuristic algorithm, namely, the Serial LP Rounding (SLPR) heuristic. Our numerical results show that bandwidth can be fairly allocated among all links/flows by solving our MATA-SPC formulation or using our heuristic algorithm {{at the cost of}} a minor reduction of network throughput...|$|E
