5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over {{what had once been}} her face.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
500|$|Scurvy curs! {{they were}} my abhorrence; I should have liked {{nothing better than to}} have been the death of every one of them. In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it. He <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> very patiently; but when I had finished, shook his head, and told me, in confidence, that they were [...] "taboo".|$|E

500|$|Winehouse's {{parents have}} each written memoirs about their {{daughter}} and donated {{the proceeds from}} both books to the Amy Winehouse Foundation. In the introduction to Mitch Winehouse's biography, entitled Amy: My Daughter (2012), he explained: [...] "Apart from being her father, I was also her friend, confidant and adviser—not that she always took my advice, but she always <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> out." [...] Her mother Janis published Loving Amy: A Mother's Story, in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Dave Van Ronk {{gives this}} {{account of the}} song's origin: [...] "Bob Dylan <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> fooling around {{with one of my}} grandmother's favorites, 'The Chimes of Trinity,' a sentimental ballad about Trinity Church, that went {{something}} like Tolling for the outcast, tolling for the gay/Tolling for the , long since passed away/As we whiled away the hours, down on old Broadway/And we listened to the chimes of Trinity. He made me sing it for him a few times until he had the gist of it, then reworked it into 'Chimes of Freedom.' Her version was better." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} primarily positive reviews, with critical attention mostly {{going to}} Veronica and Logan's relationship. Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a positive review, noting that [...] "bviously {{the most notable}} aspect of this episode was the Logan-Veronica hookup. Again, it seemed really sudden, but {{in the sense that}} they are both mercurial teenagers it seemed right, particularly when they didn't know how to handle themselves afterward." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+", writing that [...] " [...] kisses Logan! You <b>heard</b> <b>me!</b> How could you not, with all the exclamation points!" ...|$|E

500|$|Recognizing Dylan's {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{progress}} of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: [...] "Grossman {{came up to me and}} said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You <b>heard</b> <b>me.</b> We got a thing going here'". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's Music Row in February 1966.|$|E
500|$|English {{rock group}} the Yardbirds {{recorded}} [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{during their first}} American tour in 1965. [...] It is based on Johnny Burnette's adaptation, but Beck biographer Annette Carson comments their [...] "propulsive, power-driven version, however, deviated radically from the original... recording plucked the old Rock & Roll Trio number from obscurity {{and turned it into}} a classic among classics". [...] The Yardbirds' lead guitarist Jeff Beck, who is a fan of early rockabilly, said that he introduced the song to the group: [...] "They just <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> play the riff, and they loved it and made up their version of it". [...] Giorgio Gomelsky, the group' first producer, states that Sonny Boy Williamson II's use of blues harp to imitate train sounds during his 1963 UK tour with the Yardbirds also inspired the band's adaptation of the song.|$|E
500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled {{at the top of my}} voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E

500|$|... "Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... We know how picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, you can wait 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way... I was amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I can get on it. I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? She was my fave. [...] Lauryn to me is the goddess. I'd love to meet her. I'm pretty sure she's <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> talk about her a billion times." [...] Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track, plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Australia's Herald Sun if Brown knew him, Harris replied, [...] "Well, he's never <b>heard</b> of <b>me,</b> that's the funniest thing. But the producer he's worked with, DJ Frank E, has definitely <b>heard</b> of <b>me.</b> He's a respected producer, he's worked with Tiësto on a few tracks, perhaps that's where the link is. It's all a bit of fun." [...] Brown later spoke with Harris and upon hearing the similarities between the two songs, had Harris' name added to the songwriting credits.|$|R

2500|$|Lane {{was born}} in Austin, Texas, in April 1928. [...] When he was three months old, he was {{abandoned}} by his birth parents, a prostitute and pimp. He was found, covered in newspapers, in a dumpster. Lane later recalled, [...] "My father was called Texas Slim. I never saw him - I don't know if he's the one that told my mother to throw me away. A pimp told my mother I had to go. They {{put me in a}} trash can and took off. Some people <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> crying. They thought it was a cat." ...|$|E

[...] Recalling the experience in 1956, Benny said Ed Sullivan had invited him to guest on his program (1932), and [...] "the agency for Canada Dry ginger ale <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> and offered me a job." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1999 Nina Shatskaya {{went to the}} USA {{with a view of}} {{recording}} her Russian romances. [...] "Investors hoped that there would be some kind of a romance revival. They wanted to make a high-budget product involving the leading Russian poets and composers. But producer Maksim Dunayevsky decided to make it a pop record and since I've never been keen on pop music, the project flopped," [...] she later explained. The recorded material was taken back to Russia but remained unreleased. [...] "I was well aware that the material we recorded was primitive and had nothing whatsoever to do with what I'd been dreaming of. I felt like I'd been given one chance and squandered it," [...] she later admitted. She spent in America six months and spoke warmly of her vocal coach Seth Riggs. [...] "When I first came to him, he was jovially dismissive of the Russian vocal school. Having <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> he was impressed and said I had brilliant technique, for which I have to thank Natalya Andrianova," [...] the singer recalled.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the Conservatives' {{surprise}} {{victory in}} the April 1992 general election, for these reasons, the ERM policy proved increasingly unsustainable and collapsed on Black Wednesday, when Lamont was forced to withdraw the pound from the ERM despite assuring the public {{that he would not}} do so just a week earlier. He faced fierce criticism at the time for his apparent insouciance {{in the face of the}} collapse of the stated central plank of his economic policy. Later that month, at a press conference in the garden of the British embassy in Washington, DC in response to a question as to why he appeared so cheerful, Lamont commented that it was a beautiful morning, adding, [...] "My wife said she <b>heard</b> <b>me</b> singing in the bath this morning," [...] a response which led to the story that he was singing in the bath with happiness at leaving the ERM. After Major left office and published his memoirs, Lamont publicly denied Major's version of events, claiming that Major had effectively opted out of his responsibilities and left Lamont to carry the can for that day's actions. On the evening of Black Wednesday and for days after, Major contemplated resigning, drafting a statement to that effect, but wrote Lamont a note instructing him not to resign.|$|E
