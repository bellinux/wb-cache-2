5|$|Principal {{production}} {{appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> about March 25, 1933. Van Dyke was back aboard a commercial ship, headed for California, while Frank Messenger (aboard the Nanuk) continued to shoot second unit footage {{for the next}} month or two.|$|E

5|$|A tie {{can occur}} when the scores of both teams are equal at the {{conclusion}} of play, provided that the side batting last has completed their innings. Only two matches <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> in a tie in Test cricket history, neither of which involved Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|Nash himself {{claimed that}} he could <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> Bodyline in two overs without needing to resort to a leg field, as he {{believed}} that the English batsman could not hook and a few overs of sustained, fast short pitched bowling would have caused England to abandon their Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|Off the field, Miller was {{dogged by}} {{speculation}} {{as to whether}} he would honour a contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the English Lancashire League, which would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> his Test career. Miller resolved that he would remain in Australia, and accepted a job offer in New South Wales, but kept his decision private.|$|E

5|$|The Roman era of Switzerland is {{traditionally}} held to <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> in 401AD, when Stilicho withdrew all {{troops from the}} Rhine and the Danube. However, {{it has been argued}} that the withdrawal was only temporary and partial, and that Roman control of these rivers was reestablished in 411–413 with the assistance of tribes moving south from Germania.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} eruptions of Lassen Peak {{occurred}} in April through June 1917, {{when a new}} crater was created at {{the summit of the}} mountain. Less explosive activity continued through 1921. Some authorities, such as the Smithsonian, consider the eruption of Mount Lassen to <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> on June 29, 1917.|$|E
5|$|There {{has never}} been a railway to Mersea Island. During the railway mania of the mid-19th century, goods were transported by boat and barge. In 1911, local {{businessmen}} proposed a railway between Colchester and the island, which would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> at a pier next to the Esplanade in the south, with an additional station in West Mersea on what is now East Road. The plans were abandoned due to the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Sorabji's biography, {{particularly}} his early life and musical beginnings. He studied music with Charles Arthur Trew from the early 1910s until around 1915, during a private education that is thought to <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> {{at about the same}} time. He reportedly started to learn the piano from his mother at an early age, and he later received help (but no lessons) from his mother's friend Emily Edroff-Smith.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{commissioned}} officer, mercenary, or both, Standish apparently came to Holland around 1603 and, {{according to}} historian Tudor Jenks, {{may have seen}} service during the siege of Sluis in 1604, in which Vere's English troops were involved. The subsequent Twelve Years' Truce (1609–1621) between Spain and the Dutch Republic might <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> Standish's service.|$|E

5|$|After Grant's army {{slipped past}} Lee's army {{to cross the}} James River, Hancock {{found himself in a}} {{position}} from which he might <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> the war. His corps arrived to support William Farrar Smith's assaults on the lightly held Petersburg defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and had been on the field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost. After his corps participated in the assaults at Deep Bottom, Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army, effective August 12, 1864.|$|E
5|$|After {{successful}} athletics {{events at}} the Commonwealth Games, conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and Sebastian Coe as, at the time, the United Kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to the capability of installing an athletics track having been dropped from the designs for a rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Had {{either of the two}} larger stadium proposals developed by Arup been agreed for funding, then Manchester would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> up with a venue capable of being adapted to hosting large-scale athletics events through the use of movable seating.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal and Manchester United first {{played a}} {{competitive}} match in October 1894; as of May 2017, the two clubs have {{faced each other}} 226 times in total. United have won 94 to Arsenal's 82, and 50 matches <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> in a draw. Wayne Rooney has scored the most goals in the fixture with 12, while Ryan Giggs has made {{the highest number of}} appearances with 50. Several players have featured for both clubs at different stages of their career, including Brian Kidd, Andy Cole, David Platt, Robin van Persie, Danny Welbeck and former manager George Graham.|$|E

5|$|Attalus was now {{forced to}} return to Asia, for he had learned at Opus that, at the {{instigation}} of Philip, Prusias I king of Bithynia, related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Soon after, the Romans also abandoned Greece to concentrate their forces against Hannibal, their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal having been achieved. In 206BC the Aetolians sued for peace on conditions imposed by Philip. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205BC, formally ending the First Macedonian War. Attalus was included as an adscriptus {{on the side of}} Rome. He retained Aegina, but had accomplished little else. Since Prusias was also included in the treaty, the war between Attalus and Prusias must also <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> by that time.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these two}} seasons, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, {{according to the}} rules of the day, would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Abercrombie {{begin with}} his {{reliance}} on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached {{him that the}} French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> quickly.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} four rounds of fixtures, all twelve matches <b>had</b> <b>ended</b> in draws. The first win of the tournament came in the fifth round, when Titans beat Lions by nine wickets.
