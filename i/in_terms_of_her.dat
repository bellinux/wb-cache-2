5|$|Camille and {{executive}} producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature {{a family that}} resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed {{by a pair of}} successful parents with white-collar professions. Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively. The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed. However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as frequently as Cosby had originally intended. Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille. The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to expess <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> relationship with her husband and children.|$|E
25|$|Other {{religious}} titles for Roman women include magistra, a high priestess, female expert or teacher; and ministra, {{a female}} assistant, particularly one {{in service to}} a deity. A magistra or ministra would {{have been responsible for}} the regular maintenance of a cult. Epitaphs provide the main evidence for these priesthoods, and the woman is often not identified <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> marital status.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} of her {{greatest}} earning, she was generous to friends, theatre people in need, and charities. While in Europe, the Menken continued to play to the American public as well, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> image. As usual, she attracted a crowd of male admirers, including such prominent figures as the writer Charles Dickens, the humorist Tom Hood, and the dramatist and novelist Charles Reade.|$|E

25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, {{there has to be}} a nonfictional element, but more often than not the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E
500|$|Most notably, she {{received}} the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1983, {{the first woman}} to win that prize unshared, credited by the Nobel Foundation for discovering [...] "mobile genetic elements"; it was more than 30 years after she initially described the phenomenon of controlling elements.

After an introductory [...] "zero" [...] issue in 2010, the series launched fully in 2011 with Batwoman #1 along with DC's company-wide renumbering of its titles that year. Writers J.H. Williams III and W. Haden Blackman chose to expand Kate's supporting cast both <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family (the Kanes, including Elizabeth, Bette and other relatives), and the [...] "Batman Family" [...] she is more loosely connected to. Issue seventeen was also a milestone as it featured Kate proposing to her girlfriend, Maggie Sawyer.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the short}} {{planning}} and execution {{time for the}} concert, it received positive responses from music critics. Most reviewers agreed that despite the simplistic nature of the acoustic concert, her vocals was {{the best part of}} the concert. Izzat Mohd Anuar from MyNewsHub commented on this fact as [...] "Opting to appear simplistic <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dresses and stage decorations, Siti does not compromise from her vocals side where she is still able to show her 'fangs' (vocals) that are still potent and unchanged." [...] One reviewer from Kosmo! also shared the same sentiment. The reviewer commented, [...] "For this concert, in accordance to its acoustic theme, Siti does not go over the top. ... But, the most important fact that the audience should know is how she spellbinds the audience for more than two hours just by listening to her singing <b>her</b> selection <b>of</b> hits that are well-kept in her art (music) portfolio." ...|$|R
5000|$|Like {{most of the}} {{so-called}} [...] "Harvey Girls", appearing also in the Richie Rich Girlfriends title, Dot reached her peak between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s, eventually eclipsing Audrey <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> sales. <b>Her</b> popularity began to wane during the 1970s as an industry-wide distribution slump began forcing child-oriented comics off the newsstands. Dot's eponymous title stalled between 1982 and 1986, before being permanently discontinued in 1994.|$|R

500|$|In April 2010, it was {{revealed}} that producers were [...] "battling" [...] to keep Robbie with the show after she told them that she would like to leave when her contract expired {{at the end of the}} year. Producers began negotiating with Robbie to renew her contract and a spokesperson said [...] "Margot isn't going anywhere for a long while yet.

500|$|Becky {{is not an}} {{aspirational}} character, she {{strives to}} be normal, satisfied with a [...] "hard up lifestyle". She has changed since her early days, having calmed down a little <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone {{had said to me}} that in three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron's biographer Spencer Kansa was of {{the opinion}} that Cameron {{exhibited}} parallels with the Australian artist and occultist Rosaleen Norton, both <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> physical appearance and the similarities between their artistic styles. Harrington also saw similarities in the work of Cameron and the artists Leonora Carrington and Leonor Fini. On the website of the Cameron–Parsons Foundation, Michael Duncan expressed the view that Cameron's work rivals that of [...] "fellow surrealists" [...] like Carrington, Fini, Remedios Varo, and Ithell Colquhoun, while also appearing [...] "fascinatingly prescient" [...] of the works by later artists Kiki Smith, Amy Cutler, Karen Kilimmck, and Hernan Bas.|$|E

Boldboy enjoyed excellent health before a sudden deterioration in September 1998 led to his being euthanised at the age of twenty-eight.|$|R
500|$|Another theme {{present is}} the {{symbolic}} {{nature of the}} house. Margaret Scanlan stated that as in books like Mansfield Park and Jane Eyre, The Good Terrorist [...] "defines a woman <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house". Writing in the journal Studies in the Novel, Katherine Fishburn said that Lessing often uses a house to symbolise [...] "psychological or ontological change", and that here, [...] "the house... symbolizes Alice's function in the story". Yelin described The Good Terrorist as [...] "an urban, dystopian updating of the house-as-England genre, ... England is represented by a house in London". Writing in [...] "Politics of Feminine Abuse: Political Oppression and Masculine Obstinacy in Doris Lessing's The Good Terrorist, Lalbakhsh and Yahya suggest that the house, and the [...] "oppressive relations" [...] in it, reflect similar oppressive relations in society.|$|E
500|$|... "Go to the Top" [...] {{was written}} by Kumi, while {{production}} was handled by Clarabell. Clarabell {{was in charge of}} the song's arrangement and production, including the synthesizers, keyboards, and drum machine. Kiyoto Konda played the electric guitar during the chorus and song breaks. The song was described as an electronic dance song that, according to Patrick St. Michel from The Japan Times, [...] "featured elements of contemporary stateside electronic dance music (EDM)." [...] The song was noted for its numerous musical elements including 8-bit music, dance-pop, and dubstep. Koda said that she had become [...] "languish" [...] after having [...] "life-changing events such as marriage and having a baby,". She felt the effects left her [...] "not knowing what direction I was going to take," [...] <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> musical sound and lyrical delivery.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So {{no matter how bad}} things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E
5000|$|Foray {{number five}} was <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> tonnage sunk, <b>her</b> most successful; she {{destroyed}} the Gogovale on 4 August 1940 about [...] west southwest of Bloody Foreland (County Donegal in Ireland).

2500|$|Such {{documents}} {{began to}} become {{widely available in}} the late 19th century, but even when historians began to cite them to suggest Eleanor was not the perfect queen Strickland praised, many rejected the correction, often expressing indignant disbelief that anything negative was said about Eleanor. [...] Only in recent decades have historians studied queenship {{in its own right}} and regarded medieval queens as worthy of attention. These decades produced a sizeable body of historical work that allows Eleanor's life to be scrutinized <b>in</b> the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own day, not those of the 17th or 19th centuries.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of her fashion and style {{has been extensively}} written about by both designers and fashion stylists and has generally proved favorable. American designer Marc Jacobs wrote of Sevigny in 2001: [...] "The fashion world is fascinated by her. Because not only is she talented, young and attractive, she stands out {{in a sea of}} often clichéd looking actresses." [...] <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own personal style, Sevigny cited the Australian film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), which features schoolgirls dressed in elaborate Victorian clothing, as a major inspiration; she has also cited it as one of her favorite films. She has also been outspoken in her favoritism of vintage clothing over designer pieces: [...] "I still prefer to buy vintage over spending it all on one designer", she told The Times. [...] "I'll go to Resurrection or Decades and be like, 'Oh, I'm going to buy everything,' but {{a lot of it is}} extremely expensive, so I'll go to Wasteland and satisfy that urge and it's not too hard on the pocketbook. Then there's this place called Studio Wardrobe Department where everything is like three dollars".|$|E
500|$|Among {{the music}} {{teachers}} at SPGS, most significantly <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> musical development, Joseph encountered the emergent composer Gustav Holst, then little known, who taught her composition. After leaving the Royal College of Music in 1898 Holst had earned his living as an organist, {{and as a}} trombonist in various orchestras, while awaiting critical recognition as a composer. In 1903 he gave up his orchestral appointments to concentrate on composing, but found that he needed a regular income. He became a music teacher, initially at the James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich; in 1905 he was recommended to Frances Gray by Adine O'Neill, a former pupil of Clara Schumann, who taught piano at SPGS. He was first appointed on a part-time basis to teach singing, and later extended his activities to cover the school's wider music curriculum including conducting and composition. According to the composer Alan Gibbs, Joseph quickly came under Holst's spell, and adopted his principles as her own. Holst later described her as the best girl pupil he ever had: [...] "From the first she showed an individual attitude of mind and an eagerness to absorb all that was beautiful".|$|E
500|$|Her {{marriage}} to O'Malley was well received; Staci Krause of IGN wrote: [...] "Their {{relationship has been}} a roller coaster and {{it was nice to}} see this turn of events, as she really is a perfect contrast to George." [...] Discussing the character <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> relationship with Hahn, Williams was largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] LGBT website AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Sloan's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] AfterEllen.com included Torres in their list of the Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking her at No. 6 and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. The character was also listed in Wetpaint's [...] "10 Hottest TV Doctors on TV".|$|E

500|$|The writers {{ensured that}} {{although}} they were changing the storyline circumstances, the characters remained the same with minimal changes to their personalities. According to series writer Matt Berry, the time jump allowed the writers {{to work with the}} characters [...] "without most of the baggage they’d accumulated in the earlier years, and put them into starting places so we could move them forward and build in new story arcs." [...] For this reason, the writers treated the season premiere as a pilot, in which, according to Daily, they [...] "could give the women a new drive." [...] Daily identified the Susan character as having undergone the greatest change, stating that she has given up on looking for a [...] "fairy-tale romance" [...] and is emotionally distant in her new relationship. He also stated that the character of Gabrielle has dealt with the biggest change <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> circumstances, as she continues to deal with her husband's blindness and their financial problems. Actress Eva Longoria had to gain weight and wear additional body padding for her character's new storyline. Dana Delany stated that her character, Katherine, who was portrayed as an antiheroine in the previous season, is more relaxed following the time jump. However, Delany clarified that while Katherine is now friends with the other characters, she and Bree would become frenemies {{as a result of their}} business partnership. Nicollette Sheridan, commented that Edie, who played an integral role in the season's mystery story arch, is [...] "a lot more conscientious about things , without losing her comedic edge." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacques started 1968 by {{appearing}} with Spike Milligan and Frank Thornton in thirteen {{episodes of}} the sketch show The World of Beachcomber, {{based on the}} Beachcomber column in the Daily Express newspaper and broadcast on the BBC from January to April. Shortly after the series finished, she appeared alongside Frankie Howerd in his sketch show, Howerd's Hour, on ITV. She continued her busy schedule with appearances in six films for 1969, including another with Sellers, The Magic Christian. Here she portrayed a character named Ginger, who {{was described as a}} [...] "grotesque figure", with an [...] "insatiable lust for bestsellers on the atrocities of World War Two". She also appeared on television alongside Harry Secombe and Roy Castle in Pickwick, which was based on the musical of the same name, and in Carry On Christmas, broadcast on Christmas Eve. Although 1969 had been busy, 1970 was relatively quiet <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> professional output: apart from an episode of Catweazle, she appeared alongside Willoughby Goddard in a six-episode series of Charley's Grants.

During the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards Madonna started performing [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi", sporting black hair and wearing an Indian sari. Lenny Kravitz then appeared playing the guitar, which paved way to [...] "Ray of Light". A religious group called the World Vaishnava Association (WVA) claimed that Madonna offended Hindus with the performance by wearing Hinduism symbols on her head. A spokesperson for the association stated that the mark (called an Om) {{is a symbol of}} chastity, harmony and purity, and is designed to show [...] "dedication to God". The representative also said that because Madonna simulated a sexual act and wore a see-through tank top onstage while wearing the mark, she offended both Hindus and Yogis. A spokesperson for Madonna stated that the singer did not understand why WVA was upset as she had not done anything insulting, and did not wish to insult anyone. However, the vice president of WVA [...] claimed that [...] "the Hindu community and Eastern spiritual seekers the world over should be happy for Madonna personally <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> genuine interest in enlightened life, and grateful to her for her sincere efforts to attract others to the same".|$|E
