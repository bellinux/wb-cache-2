5|$|Long ago, the {{continent}} of Archanea was invaded by the Dolhr Empire, led by the Shadow Dragon Medeus. Anri, a youth from Altea, defeated the Shadow Dragon using the divine sword Falchion. The Kingdom of Archanea was restored and the world entered an age of peace. However, 100 years later, Medeus is resurrected by the evil wizard Gharnef, who has conquered the mage-state of Khadein. The two form an alliance with the kingdoms of Macedon and Grust in order to conquer the world. Cornelius, the king of Altea and successor of Anri, takes up Falchion and leaves to battle them, leaving his son Marth and daughter <b>Elice</b> {{in the care of}} a bastion manned by Altea's ally, Gra. However, Gra betrays Altea to Dolhr; Cornelius is killed, Falchion is stolen, and <b>Elice</b> sacrifices herself so Marth can escape. Accompanied by a handful of knights, he takes refuge in the island nation of Talys.|$|E

Gotoh sends Marth to the Fane of Raman to find the materials needed to create Starlight; he also rescues the divine dragon, Tiki. Marth then invades Macedon and deposes the tyrannical King Michalis {{with the aid of}} Michalis' sister Minerva. There, Gotoh reforges Starlight. Marth invades Khadein once more, defeats Gharnef, reclaims Falchion, and rescues <b>Elice.</b> He then makes his way to Dohlr, battles, and defeats Medeus, returning peace to the land.

5|$|Several years later, Marth repels {{a pirate}} {{invasion}} of Talys, leading its king {{to conclude that}} {{he is ready to}} battle Dolhr; he sends Marth out with several of his most trusted men and his daughter, Princess Caeda. Marth first rescues the kingdom of Aurelis and enlists the aid of its king's younger brother, Duke Hardin and his retainers. He meets Princess Nyna, the last survivor of the Archanean royal family and leader of the resistance against Dohlr. She gives him the Fire Emblem, a legendary treasure given to the hero destined to save the world. The two march to Archanea and free it from Grust's grasp. After briefly invading Khadein in search of Falchion, Marth retakes Altea. He learns that his mother was killed in the invasion and that Gharnef is holding <b>Elice</b> prisoner. Marth next battles Grust and their top general, Camus, who rescued Nyna from execution at Dohlrian hands; he chooses to uphold his honor as a knight of Grust, and Marth is forced to defeat him.|$|E

With his father killed and his sister <b>Elice</b> captive, Marth must muster a force to defeat the will driving the invasion: the dark dragon Medeus and his subordinate Gharnef. Marth's allies include the princess and Pegasus knight Caeda, Marth's mentor Jagen, kindly Princess Nyna of Archanea's Royal Family, and the Archsage Gotoh. His quest leads him to recovering Falchion, a magical sword which can defeat Medeus and which only Marth can wield due to his ancient heritage as a descendant of Anri, the warrior who defeated Medeus. Having recovered both Falchion and the magical Fire Emblem shield, Marth confronts Gharnef and Medeus, the latter of whom is leader of the last surviving tribe of Manakete, an ancient tribe which could shapeshift into dragons. In the end, Marth defeats Medeus and restores peace, surrendering the Fire Emblem to Archanea for safekeeping.|$|E

30|$|It is {{well known}} that {{fracture}} parameters of quasibrittle material like concrete cannot be determined by directly applying the concepts of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) because of the existence of large and variable size of fracture process zone (FPZ) ahead of a crack-tip. In order to account for and characterize FPZ in the analysis, several non-linear fracture mechanics models have been developed which primarily involve cohesive crack model (CCM) or fictitious crack model (FCM) (Hillerborg et al. 1976; Modeer 1979; Petersson 1981; Carpinteri 1989; Planas and <b>Elices</b> 1991; Zi and Bažant 2003; Roesler et al. 2007; Park et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2008; Kwon et al. 2008, Cusatis and Schauffert 2009, <b>Elices</b> et al. 2009; Kumar and Barai 2008 b, 2009 b) and crack band model (CBM) (Bažant and Oh 1983), two parameter fracture model (TPFM) (Jenq and Shah 1985), size effect model (SEM) (Bažant et al. 1986), effective crack model (ECM) (Nallathambi and Karihaloo 1986), KR-curve method based on cohesive force distribution (Xu and Reinhardt 1998, 1999 a), double-K fracture model (DKFM) (Xu and Reinhardt 1999 a, b, c) and double-G fracture model (DGFM) (Xu and Zhang 2008).|$|R

Chen and Liu (2010) continued the experimental study on the thermal expansion factor of the cables used in the spatial structures. Sun et al. (2011) analytically and experimentally investigated the thermal expansion mechanism of the steel cables under the natural environmental temperatures. However, most of the previous experimental studies focused on the mechanical properties of the steel strand or reinforcements under low temperatures. The information on the thermal expansion of the steel strand under low temperatures ranging from 20 to −  165  °C is still quite limited.|$|R

30|$|In this study, the {{concrete}} fracture energy was obtained using the three point notched beam test method developed by Hillerborg et al. (Cem Concr Res 6 (6): 773 – 782, 1976). A total of 12 notched concrete beams were tested under two different loading conditions: constant stroke control and constant crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) control. Despite individual fracture energies {{obtained from the}} two different loading conditions showing some variation, the average fracture energy from both loading conditions was very similar. Furthermore, the results obtained {{support the idea that}} a far tail constant “A” could change the true fracture energy by up to 11  %, if it is calculated using CMOD instead of LVDT. The far tail constant “A” is determined using a least squares fit onto a straight line according to <b>Elices</b> et al. (Mater Struct 25 (148): 212 – 218, 1992) and RILEM report (2007). It was also observed that the selection of the end point can produce variations of the true fracture energy. The end point indicates the point in the experiment at which to stop. An end point of 2  mm has been recommended, however, in this study other end points were also considered. The final form of the bilinear softening curve was determined based on <b>Elices</b> and Guinea’s methods (1992, 1994) and RILEM report (2007). This paper proposes a bilinear stress–crack opening displacement curve according to test results as well as the CEB-FIP model code.|$|R
40|$|The methods {{proposed}} by <b>Elices</b> and co-workers [1], [2] and [3] and by Hu and Wittmann [4] {{are commonly used}} to determine the size-independent specific fracture energy (GF) of concrete by correcting the size-dependent specific fracture energy (Gf) measured by the RILEM work-of-fracture method. In the boundary effect model of Hu and Wittmann [4], the change in the local fracture energy (gf) is approximated by a bilinear function, whereas the method of <b>Elices</b> et al. [1] consists in determining the non-measured work-of-fracture by adjusting the tail of the P-δ curve that corresponds to the final part of the test. Acoustic emission (AE) experiments on notched specimens (Muralidhara et al. [5] and [6]) have revealed that under loading the AE events follow approximately a tri-linear distribution; initially the number of events increases almost linearly reaching an extended plateau when the number of events remains nearly constant and eventually the number reduces as the crack approaches the back stress free boundary of the specimen, reminiscent of the development of R-curve in a finite size specimen. This paper exploits this observation and proposes a tri-linear model for the determination of the size-independent specific fracture energy for three different concrete mixes ranging in compressive strength from 57 to 122 MPa. Remarkably, it is found that the resulting size-independent specific fracture energy GF determined by this tri-linear model and by the bi-linear model of Hu and Wittmann [4] is very nearly the same and independent {{of the size of the}} specimen...|$|R
40|$|Integrins are a {{group of}} non-covalently {{associated}} het-erodimers of and subunits that function in cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesions (see, for reviews, Humphries, 1990; Hynes, 1992). Integrins have been clas-sified according to their subunits, each of which may asso-ciate with different subunits. There are at least eight 1 integrins (11, [...] ., 81), that are widely distributed on most cell types. 1 integrins act primarily as cell surface adhesion receptors for extracellular matrix molecules including fibronectin, laminin, collagens and vitronectin. Some 1 integrins apparently bind to a single extracellular matrix ligand, while others are more promiscuous in their ligand recognition. However, members of 1 integrins may also function as cell-cell adhesion molecules (Larjava et al., 1990; <b>Elices</b> et al., 1990; Marchisio et al., 1991; Taichman et al., 1991). Moreover, the ligand-binding specificity of 1 integrins may differ in various cell types at least in vitro, thus generating additional functional diversity within the family (<b>Elices</b> and Hemler, 1989; Languino et al., 1989). The great diversity of integrin receptors and their versa-tility in ligand binding raises the problem of determining their exact function in the various adhesive processes that ake place during embryogenesis and in the adult organism. Are the different integrins that bind common ligands inter-changeable in every tissue or do they show tissue and func-tional pecificities and, thus, participate in defined adhesion events?

3000|$|The values {{determined}} by the work-of-fracture method as proposed in RILEM recommendation (RILEM 1985) are dependent on the specimen size and shape used in the test, as demonstrated and analyzed by several researchers in the past (Hu and Wittmann 1992; Kwon et al. 2008; Muralidhara et al. 2011; RILEM 2004; Vydra et al. 2012). The two most popular models to obtain a size-independent specific fracture energy of concrete (also called true fracture energy (Karihaloo et al. 2003)) are the boundary effect model of Hu and Wittmann (1992) and the experimental correction model to avoid energy dissipations proposed by Guinea et al.

The direct method of determining the tensile softening curve of concrete is a stable tensile test, however this procedure has drawbacks such as the crack location not being known (Reinhardt et al. 1986; Bažant and Planas 1998). Accordingly, many researchers prefer indirect procedures such as the three-point bending test. The three-point bending test for the tensile properties of concrete {{is based upon the}} cohesive models of Hillerborg et al. (1976) which were further developed by Planas et al. (1999) and Guinea et al. (1994). Coronado and Lopez (2005, 2008) proposed experimental procedures for predicting the fracture behavior of externally bonded FRP strengthened concrete structures using three point bending tests and splitting tensile tests according to Guinea et al. (1994), Planas et al. (1999) and <b>Elices</b> et al. (2002). It was found that the bilinear softening curves approximated from the two tests successfully predicted the experimentally observed strain, strain distribution, failure loads and failure mode. Recently the ACI 446 committees collated research results and produced a draft ASTM test standard (ACI 446 2009) for the fracture toughness i.e. the fracture energy of concrete. The draft standard mentions that the precision and bias of the test methods are not yet known and that a consensus should be developed in order to publish an official ASTM standard for determining the tensile toughness of concrete (Gerstle 2010). Bažant and Yu (2011) recently pointed a nonuniqueness of cohesive softening law especially for small size concrete specimen (D =  25  mm). For larger specimens (D =  215  mm), differences of load–CMOD graphs were negligible no matter what cohesive softening curves are used. Therefore, fracture test of specimens of one size is insufficient especially for small sized concrete structures. However, size effect testing could be avoided if following values are known a priori. It was recommended that G [...]...|$|R
