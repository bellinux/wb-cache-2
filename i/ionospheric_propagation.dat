50|$|Rayleigh fading {{is viewed}} as a {{reasonable}} model for tropospheric and <b>ionospheric</b> signal <b>propagation</b> as well as the effect of heavily built-up urban environments on radio signals. Rayleigh fading is most applicable when there is no dominant propagation along a line of sight between the transmitter and receiver. If there is a dominant line of sight, Rician fading may be more applicable. Rayleigh fading is a special case of two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) fading.|$|R
40|$|Quasi-periodic {{fluctuations}} in the returned ground-scatter power from the SuperDARN HF radars {{have been linked to}} the passage of medium-scale gravity waves. We have applied a technique that extracts the first radar range returns from the F-region to study the spatial extent and characteristics of these waves in the CUTLASS field-of-view. Some ray tracing was carried out to test the applicability of this method. The EISCAT radar facility at Tromsø is well within the CUTLASS field-of-view for these waves and provides a unique opportunity to assess independently the ability of the HF radars to derive gravity wave information. Results from 1 st March, 1995, where the EISCAT UHF radar was operating in its CP- 1 mode, demonstrate that the radars were in good agreement, especially if one selects the electron density variations measured by EISCAT at around 235 km. CUTLASS and EISCAT gravity wave observations complement each other; the former extends the spatial field of view considerably, whilst the latter provides detailed vertical information about a range of ionospheric parameters.

40|$|ABSTRACT COST (Co-operation in {{the field}} of Scientific and Technical Research) is an {{important}} instrument supporting co-operation among scientists and researchers across Europe now joining 35 member countries. Scientific projects in the COST framework are called COST Actions and have the objectives embodied in their respective Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The main objectives of the COST Actions within the European <b>ionospheric</b> and radio <b>propagation</b> community have been: to study the influence of upper atmospheric conditions on terrestrial and Earth-space communications, to develop methods and techniques to improve existing and generate new <b>ionospheric</b> and <b>propagation</b> models over Europe for telecommunication and navigation applications and to transfer the results to the appropriate national and international organizations, institutions and industry dealing with the modern communication systems. This paper summarizes in brief the background and historical context of four ionospheric COST Actions and outlines their main objectives and results. In addition, the paper discusses the dissemination of the results and the collaboration among the participating institutions and researchers...|$|R
50|$|Ground wave {{radio signal}} {{propagation}} {{is ideal for}} relatively short distance propagation on these frequencies during the daytime. Sky-wave <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> is not possible during the day because of the attenuation of the signals on these frequencies caused by the D region in the ionosphere. In view of this, lower frequency radio communications stations need {{to rely on the}} ground-wave propagation to achieve their coverage.|$|E
50|$|High Frequency Internet Protocol (HFIP or HF-IP) {{is usually}} {{associated}} with Automatic Link Establishment and HF radio data communications. HFIP provides protocol layers enabling internet file transfer, chat, web and email. HFIP commonly uses <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> of radio waves to form a wide area network that can span thousands of kilometers. HF transceivers in HFIP service typically run 20 to 150 Watts for portable or mobile units, up to approximately 2000 Watts transmitter output for high power base stations with HFIP servers.|$|E
50|$|Automatic Link Establishment, {{commonly}} known as ALE, is the worldwide de facto standard for digitally initiating and sustaining HF radio communications. ALE is a feature in an HF communications radio transceiver system that enables the radio station to make contact, or initiate a circuit, between itself and another HF radio station or network of stations. The purpose {{is to provide a}} reliable rapid method of calling and connecting during constantly changing HF <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation,</b> reception interference, and shared spectrum use of busy or congested HF channels.|$|E
50|$|Shortwave {{bands are}} {{frequency}} allocations for use within the shortwave radio spectrum (the upper MF band {{and all of}} the HF band). They are the primary medium for applications such as maritime communications, international broadcasting and worldwide amateur radio activity because they take advantage of <b>ionospheric</b> skip <b>propagation</b> to send data around the world. The bands are conventionally stated in wavelength, measured in metres. Propagation behavior on the shortwave bands depends on the time of day, the season and the level of solar activity.|$|R

50|$|The Kp-index is {{used for}} the study and {{prediction}} of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> of high frequency radio signals. Geomagnetic storms, indicated by a Kp = 5 or higher, have no direct effect on propagation. However they disturb the F-layer of the ionosphere, especially at middle and high geographical latitudes, causing a so-called ionospheric storm which degrades radio propagation. The degradation mainly consists of a reduction of the maximum usable frequency (MUF) by as much as 50%. Sometimes the E-layer may be affected as well. In contrast with sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID), which affect high frequency radio paths near the Equator, the effects of ionospheric storms are more intense in the polar regions.|$|E

50|$|In {{broadcast}} engineering, phased arrays {{are used}} by many AM broadcast radio stations to enhance signal strength and therefore coverage {{in the city of}} license, while minimizing interference to other areas. Due to the differences between daytime and nighttime <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> at mediumwave frequencies, it is common for AM broadcast stations to change between day (groundwave) and night (skywave) radiation patterns by switching the phase and power levels supplied to the individual antenna elements (mast radiators) daily at sunrise and sunset. For shortwave broadcasts many stations use arrays of horizontal dipoles. A common arrangement uses 16 dipoles in a 4×4 array. Usually this is in front of a wire grid reflector. The phasing is often switchable to allow Beam steering in azimuth and sometimes elevation.|$|E

Much about <b>ionospheric</b> and <b>propagation</b> on 160 meters is still not completely understood. Phenomena such as [...] "chordal hop" [...] propagation are frequently observed, {{as well as other}} unexplained long-distance propagation mechanisms. Inexplicable radio blackouts - sometimes encountered on the AM broadcast band - also occur on 160 meters. Many of these phenomena have been investigated in the scientific community also.|$|R

50|$|The {{ionosphere}} {{extends from}} altitudes of approximately 50 km to 400 km and {{is divided into}} distinct plasma layers denoted D, E, F1 and F2 in increasing altitude. Refraction of radio waves by the ionosphere rather than the atmosphere can therefore allow NLOS links of much greater distance for just one refraction path or 'hop' via one of the layers. Under certain conditions radio waves that have undergone one hop may reflect off the Earth's surface and experience more hops, so increasing the range. The positions of these and their ion densities are significantly controlled by the Sun's incident radiation and therefore change diurnally, seasonally and during Sun spot activity. The initial discovery that radio waves could travel beyond the horizon by Marconi in the early 20th century prompted extensive studies of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> for the next 50 years or so, which have yielded various HF link channel prediction tables and charts.|$|E
