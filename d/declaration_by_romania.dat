2500|$|The Hindenburg Line ( [...] or Siegfried Position) was a German {{defensive}} {{position of}} World War I, built {{during the winter}} of 1916–1917 on the Western Front, from Arras to Laffaux, near Soissons on the Aisne. In 1916, the German offensive at the Battle of Verdun had been a costly failure. The Anglo-French offensive at the Battle of the Somme had forced a defensive battle on the Germans, leaving the western armies (Westheer) exhausted. On the Eastern Front, the Brusilov Offensive had inflicted huge losses on the Austro-Hungarian armies in Russia and forced the Germans to take over more of the front. The <b>declaration</b> of war <b>by</b> <b>Romania</b> had placed additional strain on the German army and war economy. Construction of the Hindenburg Line in France was begun by the Germans in September 1916, to make a retirement from the Somme front possible, to counter an anticipated increase in the power of Anglo-French attacks in 1917.|$|R

50|$|Though {{interposition}} and nullification are similar, {{there are}} some differences. Nullification {{is an act of}} an individual state, while interposition was conceived as an action that would be undertaken by states acting jointly. Nullification is a <b>declaration</b> <b>by</b> a state that a federal law is unconstitutional accompanied <b>by</b> a <b>declaration</b> that the law is void and may not be enforced in the state. Interposition also involves a <b>declaration</b> <b>by</b> a state that a federal law is unconstitutional, but interposition as originally conceived does not result in a <b>declaration</b> <b>by</b> the state that the federal law may not be enforced in the state. Rather, the law would still be enforced. Thus, interposition may be seen as more moderate than nullification.|$|R
