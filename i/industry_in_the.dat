5|$|Despite being a {{major power}} of the cotton <b>industry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first quarter of the}} 19th century, the Strutts' company began to lose out to {{competition}} from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to the raw materials and new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology {{at the start of the}} 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies. Although the cotton <b>industry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site.|$|E
