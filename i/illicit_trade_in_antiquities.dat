40|$|This chapter {{will provide}} a broad {{overview}} of the the, smuggling, and illegal sale of cultural objects from Latin America. First, I will describe the two categories of Latin American cultural property covered by this chapter (pre-Conquest artefacts, colonial sacred art), and then consider the form and functioning of the <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> Latin American <b>antiquities.</b> I will discuss the on-the-ground devastation of the historic <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> looted Latin American objects and present {{a model of a}} historic antiquities trafficking network. is will be illustrated by two case studies: the the and trafficking of a large Maya sculpture from the site of Machaquilá, Guatemala, and of the Church of Challapampa, Peru. Thee paper will close with a brief recommendation and an outline of the various outside forces that appear to {{play a significant role in}} the continued looting and trafficking of Latin American cultural objects. Among these important forces to consider are deforestation, human migration, the narcotics trade, local and regional instability, community insecurity, poverty, globalization, and developmental disparities. If reducing the <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> Latin American cultural property is our goal, then all current and future policy must address these issues...|$|R
40|$|The {{portable}} {{nature of}} objects {{of art and}} antiquity means that such objects are able to cross borders with relative ease. The market in these objects is therefore international in nature, ranging from transactions involving the well-known international auction houses to local antiques dealers. This module will consider the economic exploitation of art as a commodity and will consider the sale of art and antiquities. It will also consider the protection afforded to artists who have created works of art. The art market is said to deal in “opinions” rather than facts, since the ability to accurately attribute objects to particular artists is often a difficult task. The subjects of authenticity and attribution are consequently {{an essential part of}} this module, together with the legislation relating to sale of goods and <b>trade</b> descriptions. The <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> art and <b>antiquities</b> has become a global concern. The <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> takes many forms, including the buying and selling of objects which have been illegally excavated from archaeological sites, the looting of objects during times of conflict, including the widespread looting of art and antiquities during the Second World War, as well as the illegal export of such objects. This raises issues of provenance and due diligence for dealers and auctioneers who deal with art and antiquities. Equally, museum professionals must ensure that existing objects within their collections, new acquisitions or inward loans of works have a clear provenance. In all of these spheres, this module will consider international conventions relating to art and antiquities, some elements of private international law relating to cross-border transactions, criminal offences relating to art and antiquities as well as the various Codes of Practice of dealers and museums. ...|$|R

The draft law seeks to comport Swiss law with the broad goals of international conventions on the protection and transfer of cultural property. However, given Switzerland 2 ̆ 7 s past reluctance to curtail the <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>antiquities,</b> it remains unclear whether this measure will pass or if passed, whether the law would be adequately enforced. The primary aim of this Comment is to detail the history of international law as it pertains to cultural property and draw attention to the Swiss role in fostering the illicit trade of cultural property. Principally, the Comment will focus on the illegal art trade and the laundering of items through Switzerland. Many argue that various international treaties and regulations are required to combat the problem. 2 ̆ 70 This Comment will argue that Switzerland and conduit countries like it ought to reform their property laws and {{take an active role in}} the international discussion on cultural heritage.

40|$|The idea of {{cultural}} heritage as an 'international public good' {{can be traced}} back to the Preamble of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, according to which "damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever means damage to the cultural heritage of all mankind". How this idea {{of cultural}} heritage as a global public good can be reconciled with the effective enforcement of protection norms is the subject of this study. Bringing together world experts in protecting cultural heritage, 'Enforcing international cultural heritage law' examines the different ways that cultural heritage property can be protected, including protection at the international level, enforcement in domestic courts, and the role of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. The book is divided into three sections. The first section assesses international law and analyses the interaction between international and domestic norms of public and private law. It discusses the different methods of international enforcement, the role of international and mixed criminal tribunals and courts, and the means for protecting cultural heritage in times of armed conflict. The second section addresses the role of national courts, discussing such topics as: barriers to domestic enforcement of international norms, the refusal to enforce foreign law, the difficulty of territorial boundaries in relation to underwater heritage, and the application of criminal sanctions by domestic courts. The final section of the book surveys alternatives to the legal enforcement of the norms protecting cultural heritage, including arbitration, soft law, and diplomacyIntroduction / Francesco Francioni and James Gordley.

40|$|Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) {{proliferation}} {{was undertaken}} by the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) as the next important issue in international relations after {{the success of the}} International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL). This dissertation focuses on the reasons why the issue of SALW resulted in an Action Program rather than an international convention. Thus, this result was considered as unsuccessful by the advocates of regulating the <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> SALW. The study provides a social movement theoretical approach, using framing, political opportunity and network analysis to explain why the advocates of regulating the <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> SALW did no succeed in their goals. The UN is taken as the arena in which NGOs, States and International Governmental Organizations (IGOs) discussed the <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> SALW. ^ The findings of the study indicate that the political opportunity for the issue of SALW was not ideal. The network of NGOs, States and IGOs was not strong. The NGOs advocating regulation of SALW were divided over the approach of the issue and were part of different coalitions with differing objectives. Despite initial widespread interest among States, only a couple of States were fully committed to the issue till the end. The regional IGOs approached the issue based on their regional priorities and were less interested in an international covenant. The advocates of regulating <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> SALW attempted to frame SALW as a humanitarian issue rather than as a security issue. Thus they were not able to use frame alignment to convince states to treat SALW as a humanitarian issue. In conclusion {{it can be said that}} all three items, framing, political opportunity and the network, play a role in the lack of success of advocates for regulating the <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> SALW. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{consultation}} paper explores what legislative reforms, and other changes, {{would be needed}} if New Zealand were to become {{a party to the}} Protocol to Eliminate <b>Illicit</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>in</b> Tobacco Products. Overview Since 2005 New Zealand has been a party to an international treaty that aims to prevent harms from tobacco use, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) : the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). The Protocol to Eliminate <b>Illicit</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>in</b> Tobacco Products, negotiated under this Treaty, aims to provide a global response to the <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> tobacco products. The Government is undertaking consultation to inform decision-making as to whether it should agree to become a party to it. This consultation document puts forward two options for consideration: 	Option 1 : New Zealand does not become a party to the Protocol and continues with its current approach to preventing <b>illicit</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> tobacco products. 	Option 2 : New Zealand becomes a party to the Protocol and makes the necessary changes to meet the mandatory requirements of the Protocol. New Zealand’s existing laws already comply with many of the obligations in the Protocol. However, if New Zealand became a party to the Protocol, some legislative reforms would probably be needed, along with new systems, processes and initiatives to support them. This {{consultation paper}} explores these implications. The closing date for submissions is: 5 pm Friday 12 June 2015...|$|R
