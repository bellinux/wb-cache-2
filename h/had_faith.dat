5|$|Helene Bertha Amalie Riefenstahl {{was born}} in Germany on 22 August 1902. Her father, Alfred Theodor Paul Riefenstahl, owned a {{successful}} heating and ventilation company and wanted his daughter to follow him into the business world. Since Riefenstahl was the only child for several years, Alfred wanted her {{to carry on the}} family name and secure the family fortune. However, her mother, Bertha Ida (Scherlach), who had been a part-time seamstress before her marriage, <b>had</b> <b>faith</b> in Riefenstahl and believed that her daughter's future was in show business. Riefenstahl had a younger brother, Heinz, who was killed at the age of 39 on the Eastern Front in Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Richard {{started to}} {{complain}} {{of pain in}} his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a surgical bypass in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still <b>had</b> <b>faith</b> in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just {{a little over two}} months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E

5|$|In early 1989, Schottenheimer {{was fired}} as Browns head coach, {{and took the}} head {{coaching}} job with the Kansas City Chiefs. He still <b>had</b> <b>faith</b> in Junkin, unlike the Browns, and traded a fifth-round pick {{to bring him to}} Kansas City. Two weeks after the trade, a report came out that Junkin had taken steroids provided by a doctor to treat an injured ankle, and had failed a drug test at the scouting combine as a result. Entering the 1989 Kansas City Chiefs season, Junkin competed with Walker Lee Ashley for the second inside linebacker spot alongside Dino Hackett. Ashley won the job, and Junkin played five games before a shoulder injury sidelined him {{for the rest of the}} season. He was released from the Chiefs after season's end, and retired after not being signed by any team through the 1990 season.|$|E

He offered Alex Ferguson the chance to sign Barnes for Manchester United, but Ferguson rejected the opportunity to sign Barnes as he still <b>had</b> <b>faith</b> in United's left winger Jesper Olsen.

25|$|The older Calvinistic {{emphasis}} on free grace was given {{new life in}} Methodist publications, preaching God's wonderful method of saving even the worst of sinners. It was viewed with suspicion and distrust by mid and late 18th century Anglican priests, since it carried with it the belief that salvation could be obtained without adherence to the moral law as delivered in the Ten Commandments. Men were not damned for the crimes they committed but for not believing in the great truths of the Gospel. If men <b>had</b> <b>faith</b> in the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice, they might be under no dread of what they did, because he stood clean before the eyes of God from the day in which Christ died upon the cross.|$|E

In 1969, Fjellfly bought a de Havilland Heron from Tokyo and flew it back, arriving in February 1970. After a simple renovation, which included a renewal of the interior, the aircraft was put into service in the scheduled traffic.|$|E
25|$|Initially, when Sima Zhao {{wanted to}} put Zhong Hui in charge of leading the Wei army to conquer Shu, Shao Ti (邵悌) warned him that Zhong Hui might rebel against Wei {{because he was in}} command of an army of thousands, was single, and had no family to worry about. Sima Zhao laughed and said he {{understood}} Shao Ti's concern very well, but chose to let Zhong Hui lead the Wei army because he <b>had</b> <b>faith</b> in Zhong's ability to conquer Shu. He also predicted that Zhong Hui would not succeed even if he rebelled because of two reasons. First, the people of Shu would not support Zhong Hui because they were already fearful after witnessing the fall of Shu. Second, the Wei forces would not support Zhong Hui because they were already exhausted and homesick after the campaign.|$|E
