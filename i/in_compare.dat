The Scanian plains are an important resource for the rest of Sweden since 25–95% of the total production of various types of cereals come from the region. Almost all Swedish sugar beet comes from Scania; the plant needs a long vegetation period. The same applies also to corn, pea and rape (grown for its vegetarian oil), although these plants are less imperative <b>in</b> <b>compare</b> with sugar beets.
