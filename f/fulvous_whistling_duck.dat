5|$|The <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> has a {{very large}} range {{extending}} across four continents. It breeds in lowland South America from northern Argentina to Colombia and then up to the southern US and the West Indies. It is found in a broad belt across sub-Saharan Africa {{and down the east}} of the continent to South Africa and Madagascar. The Indian subcontinent is the Asian stronghold.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> feeds in {{wetlands}} by day {{or night}} on seeds {{and other parts of}} plants. It is sometimes regarded as a pest of rice cultivation, and is also shot for food in parts of its range. Despite hunting, poisoning by pesticides and natural predation by mammals, birds and reptiles, the large numbers and huge range of this duck mean that it is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} {{the population of}} the <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> to be from 1.3–1.5million individuals. This may be an underestimate since regional assessments suggest 1million birds in the Americas, 1.1million in Africa and at least 20,000 in South Asia. Although the population appear to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and huge breeding range mean that this duck is classified by the IUCN as being of Least Concern. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{birds in}} Asia can be {{confused}} with the similar lesser <b>whistling</b> <b>duck,</b> although that species is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down the back of the neck. Juvenile <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>ducks</b> are very like young lesser <b>whistling</b> <b>ducks,</b> but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than <b>whistling</b> <b>ducks</b> and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced <b>whistling</b> <b>ducks</b> are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|R
5|$|Breeding {{coincides with}} the {{availability}} of water. In South America and South Africa, the main nesting period is December–February, in Nigeria it is July–December, and in North America mid-May–August. In India, the breeding season is from June to October but peaking in July and August. <b>Fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>ducks</b> show lifelong monogamy, although the courtship display is limited to some mutual head-dipping before mating and a short dance after copulation in which the birds raise their bodies side-by-side while treading water.|$|R
50|$|The Virginia Aquarium Aviary was a half-acre habitat located {{behind the}} March Pavilion, and {{was home to}} 70 birds of about 30 species {{including}} a great horned owl, turkey vultures, great blue herons, brown pelicans, <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>ducks,</b> great egrets, and ruddy ducks. Many of the birds had been injured and rehabilitated, {{and could not be}} released back into the wild. The aviary was badly damaged by a storm in the winter of 2015: though no birds were killed, most had to be dispersed to other wildlife centers. At the moment there is no birds or aviary at the Virginia Aquarium.|$|R
5|$|The <b>fulvous</b> <b>{{whistling}}</b> <b>duck</b> or {{fulvous tree duck}} (Dendrocygna bicolor) is a whistling duck that breeds {{across the}} world's tropical regions in much of Mexico and South America, the West Indies, the southern US, sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It has mainly reddish brown plumage, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call which is given in flight or on the ground. The preferred habitat is shallow lakes, paddy fields or other wetlands with plentiful vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The {{whistling}} ducks, Dendrocygna, are {{a distinctive}} {{group of eight}} bird species within the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> forms a superspecies with the wandering whistling duck. It has no recognised subspecies, although the birds in northern Mexico and the southern US {{have in the past}} been assigned to D. b. helva, described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than D. b. bicolor.|$|E

50|$|Several hundred {{thousand}} {{ducks and geese}} use the refuge as wintering habitat while wood <b>ducks,</b> <b>fulvous</b> and black-bellied <b>whistling</b> <b>ducks,</b> and mottled ducks nest on the refuge during the breeding season. The refuge offers fishing, hunting, boating, wildlife observation, and hiking.|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{availability}} for Afrotropical waterbirds {{is highly}} dynamic with unpredictable rainfall patterns and ephemeral wetlands resulting in diverse movement strategies among different species. Movement strategies among waterfowl encompass resident, regional and intercontinental migrants, but little quantitative information exists on their specific movement patterns. We studied the movement ecology of five Afrotropical waterfowl species marked with satellite transmitters in Malawi, Mali and Nigeria. Resident species, including White-faced <b>Whistling</b> <b>Ducks</b> Dendrocygna viduata, <b>Fulvous</b> <b>Whistling</b> <b>Ducks</b> Dendrocygna bicolor and Spur-winged Geese Plectropterus gambensis, remained sedentary {{during the rainy}} season and only flew limited distances during other months. In contrast, Knob-billed Ducks Sarkidiornis melanotos made short regional movements ? 50 km in all months and showed little site fidelity to previously used habitats in subsequent years. Garganey Anas quequedula followed an intercontinental strategy and made long-distance jumps across the Sahara and Mediterranean to their Eurasian breeding grounds. Most species flew farthest during the dry season, as mean daily movements varied from 1. 5 to 14. 2 km and was greatest in the winter months (January-March). Total distance moved varied from 9. 5 km for White-faced <b>Whistling</b> <b>Ducks</b> (October-December) to 45. 6 km for Knob-billed Ducks (April-June). Nomadic behaviour by Knob-billed Ducks was evidenced by long exploratory flights, but small mean daily movements suggested that they were relying on previous experience. Improving our understanding of these movement strategies increases our ability to assess connectivity of wetland resources that support waterfowl throughout their annual cycle and focuses conservation efforts on their most important habitats.

25|$|Although not {{extensively}} studied, the delta’s {{significance for}} migratory birds is indisputable, {{as it is}} the principal freshwater marsh in the region. A total of 358 bird species have been documented in the Colorado River Delta and upper Gulf of California region. From these, two are listed as endangered, six as threatened, and sixteen are under special protection in Mexico. Two wintering species and five breeding species have been locally extirpated, including the southwestern willow flycatcher, the <b>Fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck,</b> and the sandhill crane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Whistling</b> <b>ducks</b> {{were first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758: the black-bellied <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> (then Anas autumnalis) and the West Indian <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> (then Anas arborea). In 1837, William John Swainson named the genus Dendrocygna to distinguish <b>whistling</b> <b>ducks</b> {{from the other}} waterfowl. The type species was listed as the wandering <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> (D. arcuata), formerly named by Thomas Horsfield as Anas arcuata.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{subspecies}} {{associated with this}} bird, D. a. arcuata (Indonesian wandering <b>whistling</b> <b>duck),</b> D. a. australis (Australian wandering <b>whistling</b> <b>duck),</b> and D. a. pygmaea (New Britain wandering <b>whistling</b> <b>duck).</b>|$|R
50|$|The plumed <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> (Dendrocygna eytoni), {{also called}} the grass <b>whistle</b> <b>duck,</b> is a <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> that breeds in Australia. It is a {{predominantly}} brown-coloured duck with a long neck and characteristic plumes arising from its flanks. The sexes are similar in appearance.|$|R
25|$|The wing bar {{is unique}} among living {{whistling}} ducks. When on the ground, {{it may be}} hard to discern the light flanks present in many of these waterfowl. The <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> (D. bicolor) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly {{rather than the other way}} around. Juvenile D. autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (D. viduata), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.|$|E
500|$|The <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> {{is found}} in lowland marshes and swamps in open, flat country, and it avoids wooded areas.

500|$|The <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> has {{expanded}} its range in the West Indies, and into the southern US. A series of invasions from South America and reaching the eastern US commenced around 1948, fueled by rice cultivation, and breeding was recorded in Cuba in 1964, and Florida in 1965. Some Florida birds still winter in Cuba. In Africa, it bred on the Cape Peninsula between 1940 and the 1960s. A survey of eighteen species which had colonised the area in recent decades found that most were wetland species that had used irrigated farmland as [...] "stepping stones" [...] across the arid country separating the peninsula from the breeding main range. However, {{the status of the}} two whistling duck species featured in the research is dubious since they are popular ornamental species, so their origin is unclear.|$|E

500|$|The <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> is [...] long; {{the male}} weighs , {{and the female}} averages {{marginally}} lighter at [...] It is a long-legged duck, mainly golden-brown with a darker back and an obvious blackish line {{down the back of}} its neck. It has whitish stripes on its flanks, a long grey bill and grey legs. In flight, the wings are brown above and black below, with no white markings, and a white crescent on the rump contrasts with the black tail. All plumages are fairly similar, but the female is slightly smaller and duller-plumaged than the male. The juvenile has paler underparts, and appears generally duller, especially on the flanks. There is a complete wing moult after breeding, and birds then seek the cover of dense wetland vegetation while they are flightless. Body feathers may be moulted throughout the year, although each feather is replaced only once annually.|$|E
500|$|The <b>fulvous</b> <b>whistling</b> <b>duck</b> feeds in {{wetlands}} by day or night, {{often in}} mixed flocks with relatives such as white-faced or black-bellied whistling ducks. Its food is generally plant material, including seeds, bulbs, grasses and stems, but females may include animal {{items such as}} aquatic worms, molluscs and insects as they prepare for egg-laying, which may then comprise up to 4% of their diet. Ducklings may also eat a few insects. Foraging is by picking plant items while walking or swimming, by upending, or occasionally by diving {{to a depth of}} up to [...] Favoured plants include water snowflake, aquatic ragweeds, bourgou millet, shama grass, Cape blue water lily, waxy-leaf nightshade, beakrush, flatsedge and polygonums. Rice is normally {{a small part of the}} diet, and a survey in Cuban rice fields found that the plants taken were mainly weeds growing with the crop. However, in a study in Louisiana, 25% of the diet of incubating females consisted of the cereal.|$|E
