5|$|In 1934, the club's NHL {{franchise}} {{was transferred}} to St. Louis, although the Association continued its ownership of the franchise and player contracts {{as well as the}} senior club. On October 15, 1935, the NHL bought back the franchise and players' contracts for $40,000 and suspended its operations again. Under the agreement, the NHL paid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> and took back possession of the franchise. If the franchise was resold, the proceeds would go to the Ottawa Hockey Association.|$|E
50|$|Some {{variants}} of Cee-lo {{have been described}} that reverse the rules of winning and losing rolls <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> {{who is not a}} banker, making a 1-2-3 a win <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>player,</b> and 4-5-6 a loss. If such a rule is followed to the extent that triples become a losing roll <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>player,</b> then this slightly increases the advantage to the banker.|$|R

A positive game represents a win <b>for</b> <b>the</b> left <b>player,</b> a negative game <b>for</b> <b>the</b> right <b>player,</b> a zero game <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second <b>player</b> to move, and a fuzzy game <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first <b>player</b> to move.|$|R

5|$|Season {{ticket sales}} in 1950–51 reached {{an all-time high}} and Carlisle {{challenged}} strongly for promotion as well as achieving a draw with Arsenal at Highbury in the FA Cup. But it ended badly because Shankly accused the club's board of reneging on a bonus promise <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> should the team finish in the top-three. Shankly resigned and took up an offer from Grimsby Town. Shankly's overall record in league football at Carlisle was 42 wins and 22 defeats from 95 matches.|$|E

5|$|The {{title of}} the ABC's {{documentary}} The Chappell Era, broadcast in 2002, encapsulated Chappell's significance to Australian cricket. Subtitled Cricket in the '70s, it chronicled {{the rise of the}} Australian cricket team under Chappell, the fight for better pay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> and professionalisation of the game through WSC. During the program, Chappell reiterated his criticisms of cricket's administration at the time.|$|E
5|$|While captaining Australia, I was {{approached}} on three separate occasions before WSC to play 'professional' cricket, {{and each time}} I advised the entrepreneurs to meet the appropriate cricket board because they controlled the grounds.

But if <b>the</b> <b>player</b> so chooses, <b>the</b> predictor will already have made its decision, making it impossible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> decision to affect the predictor's decision.|$|R
5|$|Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi {{stated that}} he had no plans to make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. Itoi has said that, of the three, he had the strongest drive to create the first Mother video game, and that it was made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> He made the second game as an {{exploration}} of his personal interests, and wanted to run wild with the third. While reflecting on Mother 3 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell small parts of the story, and felt this was a core theme in the series' development.|$|E
5|$|At the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Ricky Walden 4–1 in {{the last}} 16, John Higgins 5–1 in the quarter-finals, and Barry Hawkins 6–2 in the semi-finals. He defeated Ding Junhui 9–3 in the final to win his third Welsh Open title, and the 26th ranking title of his career. In the last frame of the final, he compiled a record 12th maximum break in professional competition, breaking the previous record of 11 maximum breaks that he had held jointly with Stephen Hendry. During the season O'Sullivan competed at the Players Tour Championship, and finished second on the European Tour Order of Merit, to qualify <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Players</b> Championship Grand Final. There he defeated Scott Donaldson 4–0 {{in the last}} 32, but lost 3–4 against Yu Delu in the last 16, despite making a 140, the highest break of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes, and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> not the spectators. The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks, and did not make them feel very welcome. They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that the All Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and the All Blacks were not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E

5|$|During the 1937 season, Verity {{played only}} one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and {{although}} batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did not look dangerous and was left out of the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Players</b> and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s the FA Cup final was {{the only}} {{football}} match to be televised nationally, resulting in heightened media attention <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> and clubs involved. The Players' Union successfully requested an additional £5 per man for appearing in a televised match, the first time such appearance money had been paid. Birmingham's players signed an exclusive contract with the BBC committing them to appear only on BBC programmes in {{the weeks leading up}} to the final, though their post-match celebration would be covered live by the regional commercial station ATV. The match itself attracted a television audience of fivemillion, a high figure for the period.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1903 season, Hirst {{suffered}} a leg injury. This, coupled with other players' absences, was {{partly responsible for}} a poor start to the season by Yorkshire, and although the team recovered, it could only achieve third place in the County Championship. When Hirst returned his bowling speed was reduced, but during the season he rediscovered his swing bowling. In completing the first of 10 consecutive doubles, he took 128 wickets {{at an average of}} 14.94 and scored 1,844 runs at an average of 47.28. For Yorkshire, he topped both the batting and bowling averages and had the third highest batting average in the country. Hirst played in two end-of-season games <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Players</b> against the Gentlemen; his 124 not out in the second match was his only century in the Players versus Gentlemen series.|$|E

5|$|Experimental {{blending}} of Western and Malagasy musical elements was occurring simultaneously {{among a number}} of northwestern bands and musicians of Jaojoby's generation. Although no single individual can be credited with creating the modern salegy genre, Jaojoby ranks among the earliest originators of the nascent musical style. A desire for greater freedom to write songs and further develop the syncretic modern salegy style led Jaojoby to leave Los Matadores in 1975 <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Players,</b> another regional band that was less well-established but more willing to take risks. The band was managed by a Chinese shopkeeper who provided them with a sound system and generator. The band toured northwestern Madagascar {{for the next four years}} with increasing success, recording two 45rpm singles and performing in Mahajanga, Diego-Suarez, and other towns and villages throughout the region before disbanding in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Grace's bad wicket batting {{skills were}} fully {{tested in the}} first innings at The Oval and he scored 40 {{in a total of}} only 76, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley taking five wickets each <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Players.</b> The Players replied with 122 to take a first innings lead of 46. Grace took 2–37 in support of Allan Steel who claimed 6–60. The Gentlemen {{produced}} a much better batting performance on the Friday and scored 202, Grace again top-scoring with 63. He then took 3–30 as the Players were bowled out for 101, the match ending on Friday afternoon.|$|E

At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority. Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.|$|E
