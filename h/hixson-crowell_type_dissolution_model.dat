40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} solubility in limiting dissolution rates {{of a number of}} important radionuclides from spent fuel and high-level waste. Two simple <b>dissolution</b> <b>models</b> were used for calculations that would be characteristics of a Yucca Mountain repository. A saturation-limited <b>dissolution</b> <b>model,</b> in which the water flowing through the repository is assumed to be saturated with each waste element, is very conservative in that it overestimates dissolution rates. A diffusion-limited <b>dissolution</b> <b>model,</b> in which element-dissolution rates are limited by diffusion of waste elements into water flowing past the waste, is more realistic, but it is subject to some uncertainty at this time. Dissolution rates of some elements (Pu, Am, Sn, Th, Zr, Sm) are always limited by solubility. Dissolution rates of other elements (Cs, Tc, Np, Sr, C, I) are never solubility limited; their release would be limited by dissolution of the bulk waste form. Still other elements (U, Cm, Ni, Ra) show solubility-limited dissolution under some conditions. 9 references, 3 tables...|$|R

In this work, a mathematical model was developed that incorporates both the dissolution of the capsule shell and the slug within the capsule shell.

The capsule slug <b>dissolution</b> <b>model</b> incorporated mass transfer principles, Markov chain theory, and the influence of hydrodynamics on capsules dissolution using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -predicted velocity profiles. To complete the model, the mass transfer coefficients (determined experimentally and theoretically) were incorporated. The model was validated by statistically comparing the simulated profiles to the experimental data using the similarity factor. In addition, this model can provide insights into the dissolution mechanism where a drug product may either disintegrate or erode during dissolution testing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new polymer <b>dissolution</b> <b>model</b> was {{developed}} by incorporating the polymer chain disentanglement mechanism into the relevant transport equations. The disentanglement time {{was used as a}} dissolution characteristic time controlling the moving position of the solvent-polymer boundary. A dimensionless dissolution number was defined as the ratio of the characteristic polymer disentanglement time to the characteristic solvent diffusion time. The dissolution number was shown to be proportional to the square of the gel layer thickness. Scaling law expressions for the dependence of the gel layer thickness and the polymer dissolution rate on polymer molecular weight were also derived. Solution of the <b>model</b> for one-dimensional <b>dissolution</b> showed three distinct dissolution stages and confirmed the proposed scaling law relations for the gel layer thickness and the dissolution rate. Experimental studies of dissolution of polystyrene and poly(methy 1 methacrylate) in methyl ethyl ketone were used to verify the model, and two <b>types</b> of polymer <b>dissolution</b> behavior were observed. For dissolution of polystyrene in MEK, the solvent diffusion behavior was Fickian and a constant gel layer thickness was observed during the stationary dissolution stage. The effect of polymer molecular weight on the gel layer thickness was investigated for nine monodisperse samples, with n,, ranging from 28 000 to 2 830 000. The experimental results showed that the dependence of the gel layer thickness on molecular weight is more prominent in the high molecular weight region. The polystyrene data verified the new <b>dissolution</b> <b>model.</b> The <b>dissolution</b> of PMMA in MEK was controlled by crack propagation as no significant gel layer was observed...|$|R
30|$|Filament <b>dissolution</b> <b>model</b> was {{proposed}} by Russo et al. [82 – 84] exclusively for unipolar RRAM devices, although later revisions {{by the same}} group [85, 86] made this model suitable for bipolar devices as well. This model {{is based on the}} fundamental concept of Joule heating and filament temperature change. The model primarily focuses on the RESET transition of the devices, i.e., the transition from LRS to HRS. This is because of the high resistance associated with the RESET transition and this is where the major physical transformation in the device takes place. The model is based on the concept of conductive filament ruptured or dissolute under the effect of significant temperature change [84]. This temperature change in the filament is caused due to Joule heating. The proposed filament <b>dissolution</b> <b>model</b> has been deemed as self-accelerated due to the process of the rupture of filament accelerates by itself under suitable conditions.|$|R

30|$|On {{the face}} of it, the {{equations}} seem pretty complex to evaluate. But in reality, they are analytical in nature which makes them easily solvable in a numeric solver and can be implemented in an electric simulator. This is a major advantage of this model. Almost all of the models which employ the concept of temperature change in the filament follow {{the basic principles of}} the filament <b>dissolution</b> <b>model</b> [82, 83] discussed further in the “Filament Dissolution Model” section. During set operation, the temperature rises due to the increase in the CF radius, while it falls due to a decrease in the CF radius during the reset operation. This creates a positive feedback loop between the two processes leading to a self-accelerated reaction. This forms the basis of the filament <b>dissolution</b> <b>model</b> and all models incorporating the temperature effects in the device converge on this phenomenon [82, 83, 86 – 89, 92].|$|R

30|$|In this letter, we have {{investigated}} the reset statistical characteristics of the conductive bridge random access memory (CBRAM) device based on a Cu/HfO 2 /Pt structure connected to a transistor. The experimental {{results show that the}} reset voltage increases with on-state resistance and the reset current decreases with it, which can be well explained by the thermal <b>dissolution</b> <b>model.</b> Since the on-state resistance has strong influence on the reset switching parameters, the resistance screening method is employed to decompose the resistance into several ranges. The distributions of the reset voltage and current studied in different resistance ranges are compatible with the Weibull model. The Weibull slopes of reset voltage and current {{have nothing to do with}} the on-state resistance. The scale factor of the reset voltage linearly increases with the on-state resistance while that of the reset current decreases with it in linearity, respectively. These results are all consistent with the thermal <b>dissolution</b> <b>model.</b> Our work is of great significance on the deep understanding of the switching mechanism and the improvement of the uniformity of RRAM devices.|$|R

Among these studies, Parker and Park (2004) and Park and Parker (2005) proposed and verified an upscaled <b>dissolution</b> <b>model</b> where the temporal downstream concentration as well as mass flux from the entrapped DNAPL were a function of average groundwater velocity and, more importantly, {{a function of the}} ratio between DNAPL mass at any time to the original spilled mass to some power or (M/M 0) β [...]. Saenton and Illangasekare (2007), on the other hand, developed an upscaled natural <b>dissolution</b> <b>model</b> which considered soil’s heterogeneity (in terms of variance of ln K), spatial distribution and spreading of DNAPL mass in the source zone (in terms of spatial moment), and a dissolution length (Saba and Illangasekare 2000).

40|$|Traditional <b>dissolution</b> <b>models</b> {{are based}} in the {{analyses}} of bulk solution compositions and {{ignore the fact that}} different sites of a surface dissolve at different rates. Consequently, the variation of surface area and surface reactivity during dissolution are not considered for the calculation of the overall dissolution rate, which is expected to remain constant with time. The results presented here show the limitations of this approach suggesting that dissolution rates should be calculated as a function of an overall surface reactivity term that accounts for the reactivity of each of the sites that constitute the surface. In contrast to previous studies, here the focus is put on studying the surface at different dissolution times. Significant changes in surface topography of CaF 2 were observed during the initial seconds and up to 3200 hours of dissolution. The observed changes include the increase of surface area and progressive exposure of the most stable planes, with consequent decrease in overall reactivity of the surface. The novelty of a proposed <b>dissolution</b> <b>model</b> for fluorite surfaces, when compared with traditional <b>dissolution</b> <b>models,</b> is that it differentiates the reactivity of each characteristic site on a surface, e. g. plane or step edge, and considers the time dynamics. The time dependency of dissolution rates is a major factor of uncertainty when calculating long term dissolution rates using equations derived from dissolution experiments running for short periods of time and using materials with different surface properties. An additional factor of uncertainty is that the initial dissolution times are the most dynamic periods of dissolution, when significant variations of surface area and reactivity occur. The results are expected to have impact in the field of nuclear waste management and to the larger geological and material science community.
