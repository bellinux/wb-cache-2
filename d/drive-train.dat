2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, <b>drive-train</b> and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of wind farms has accelerated research into improving the reliability of wind turbines to reduce operational and maintenance costs. A critical component in wind turbine <b>drive-trains</b> is the gearbox, which is prone to different types of failures due to long-term operation under tough environments, variable speeds and alternating loads. To detect gearbox fault early, a method is proposed for an effective fault diagnosis by using improved ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and Hilbert square demodulation (HSD). The method was verified numerically by implementing the scheme on the vibration signals measured from bearing and gear test rigs. In the implementation process, the following steps were identified as being important: (1) {{in order to increase}} the accuracy of EEMD, a criterion of selecting the proper resampling frequency for raw vibration signals was developed; (2) to select the fault related intrinsic mode function (IMF) that had the biggest kurtosis index value, the resampled signal was decomposed into a series of IMFs; (3) the selected IMF was demodulated by means of HSD, and fault feature information could finally be obtained. The experimental results demonstrate the merit of the proposed method in gearbox fault diagnosis...|$|R

By incorporating alternative energy <b>drive-trains</b> into vehicles that also use combustion engines, they allow for a slightly cleaner mode of transportation. The paper investigates the effect of externally loading the engine and hence shifting the fuel consumption curve to leanest air fuel ratio to obtain a better driving range. The mechanical design for this test was done in CATIA. The bike is powered by a single cylinder, 4 Stroke air-cooled 125 cc conventional petrol engine and a 360 W/ 15 A geared DC Motor (Jack Erjavec and Jeff Arias, 2012). The bike’s design is chopper in nature with a high front rake angle. Motor gets its power from the batteries and drives the vehicle when the engine’s cut off, controlled by an electronic control unit. Our system enables approximately a 40 % increase in the bike’s overall driving range, lesser air and noise pollution, enhanced comfort in city drive at low speeds and greater co-generative efficiency.

40|$|Considering {{the full}} {{dynamics}} of the different conversion stages from ocean waves to the electricity grid is essential to evaluate the realistic power flow in the drive train and design accurate model-based control formulations. The power take-off system for wave energy converters (WECs) {{is one of the}} essential parts of wave-to-wire (W 2 W) models, for which hydraulic transmissions are a robust solution and offer the flexibility to design specific <b>drive-trains</b> for specific energy absorption requirements of different WECs. The potential hydraulic drive train topologies can be classified into two main configuration groups (constant-pressure and variable-pressure configurations), each of which uses specific components and has a particular impact on the preceding and following stages of the drive train. The present paper describes the models for both configurations, including the main nonlinear dynamics, losses and constraints. Results from the mathematical model simulations are compared against experimental results obtained from two independent test rigs, which represent the two main configurations, and high-fidelity software. Special attention is paid to the impact of friction in the hydraulic cylinder and flow and torque losses in the hydraulic motor. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the models in reproducing experimental results, capturing friction effects and showing similar losses...|$|R
40|$|In a sensing rich system, a {{large amount}} of data can be {{obtained}} over time and utilized to improve the performance and functionality of a robotic system. Data-driven approaches emphasize on the utilization of auxiliary sensors, sensor fusion, and data learning. Real-time control systems of robotic systems often run at kilo-Hertz sampling frequencies. New data is obtained from a variety of feedback sources every one or a few milliseconds. Auxiliary sensors provide additional feedbacks and enable sensor fusion. This dissertation presents a series of data-driven approaches to improve the sensing and control of robot manipulators from several aspects, including sensor fusion for motion sensing, statistical learning for feedback compensation, nonparametric learning control, and intelligent modeling and identification. In regard to the limited sensing capability of conventional indirect <b>drive-trains</b> of industrial robots, a sensor fusion approach based on auxiliary optical and inertial sensors is introduced for direct motion sensing of robot end-effectors. The approach is especially useful to applications where high accuracy is required for end-effector performance in real-time. Meanwhile, for the scenarios where auxiliary sensor are not allowed, a statistical learning algorithms is developed for sensing compensation so that control of systems with limited feedback capability can be significantly improved. A major application of the approach is vision guidance of industrial robots. The proposed learning approach can significantly increase the visual tracking bandwidth without requiring high-speed cameras. Besides improving the sensing capability of robots, nonparametric learning control is developed to control systems with complex dynamics. A major motivation of the approach is robotic laser and plasma cutting. Furthermore, to obtain high-fidelity models more efficiently, planning and learning algorithms are discussed for intelligent system modeling and identification. The applications of the proposed approaches range from vision guided robotic material handling to precision robotic machining. Various tests are designed to validate the proposed approaches...|$|R

40|$|TutorialTwo {{types of}} prime movers are {{continuously}} applied for rotating machinery: mechanical and electric drives. This tutorial focuses on electric drives, which are actually composed of separate components: electric motor, frequency converter (optional), and electric network including transformers. The main {{aim of this}} tutorial is to explain the phenomena of electric drives related to the torsional vibrations. All the components of an electric drive may affect torsional dynamics of the system. Naturally the main concern is torsional excitations. Another aspect is the electromechanical interaction in the air-gap of the motor that produces electromagnetic torsional stiffness and damping. These and other similar phenomena, related to the electric drives, have been observed on test fields and site conditions. The scope of the paper includes the most common induction, synchronous and permanent magnet motors. First, the various rotor structures of electric motors are discussed. Then, the effects of electromagnetic stiffness and damping on the torsional dynamics are introduced. Next, the main electric excitations are presented and their effect on drivetrain dimensioning is discussed. Various modelling and analysis methods are also presented for <b>drive-trains</b> with an electric motor. The previous sections focus on the motor without any frequency converter. The rest of the paper deals with the variable speed drives. First the main voltage source inverter, current source inverter and load commutated inverter drive types, their operational principles and application areas are introduced. Then the harmonic and inter-harmonic torsional excitations are explained that depend on the configuration {{and control of the}} frequency converter. The main functionality of a variable speed drive system is the speed-control feedback loop. This loop is used to maintain the preset speed. Although this feedback loop is also a potential source of instability it can with proper tuning be used to damp low frequency torsional resonances. The analysis guidelines and design principles are distributed throughout the paper. The paper is concluded with summary and main recommendations...|$|R
40|$|President’s Message AITPM President’s Message, July 2009 Hello fellow AITPM members, It’s {{now very}} early July so many Australians {{are going to}} {{experience}} a range of new, or increases in, fees, charges, and perhaps taxes by State and local governments. For example, Queenslanders are to be hit at the petrol pump, no longer living with the luxury of the State’s previous 8 c per litre fuel subsidy, bringing general motorists’ fuel costs into line with the other States. A consolation is that they now don’t {{have to live with}} the real or perceived “price gouging” that has appeared in the past to make Queensland prices much closer than 8 c to those in other States. Environmental lobbyists argue that this Government’s decision brings public transport costs closer to parity with private transport. However, my sense from sloppy petrol price elasticities is that the State’s motorists will get used to the reversal of what was a reverse tax pretty quickly, an amount which can be less than day-of-the week fluctuation. On the other hand, withholding this State revenue may help in some way the funding of the several major public transport infrastructure projects in progress; not to mention some of the cost of running the Transit Authority’s expanding service commitments. Other policy actions, such as a Federal Government review of taxation on employees’ package vehicles, which might discourage rather than encourage excess kilometres travelled, may have a greater environmental benefit. Of course, a downside is that many vehicles used so are Australian built, and discouraging fleet turnover may damage an industry which faces ever increasing uncertainty, and particularly at the present, is in need of some care and attention. I for one hope to this end that the new 4 cylinder (1. 8 L petrol or 2 L diesel) so called “true Holden” Cruze and Toyota’s pending Camry Hybrid are both roaring successes, and will be taken up in droves as fleet and employee use vehicles. I’m not sure what <b>drive-trains</b> Ford and Holden plan to drop into their next full sized models but even if they’re not Australian sourced, let’s hope they coordinate the requisite performance expected by the “Aussie Battler” with suitable green credentials. I am also encouraged to see that already many Government fleet vehicles are smaller in size, but still fit for purpose. For instance, my local police station uses the Camry based Aurion as a district car. I close again in reminding everyone that AITPM’s flagship event, the 2009 AITPM National Conference, Traffic Beyond Tomorrow, is being held in Adelaide from 5 to 7 August. www. aitpm. com has all of the details about how to register, sponsor a booth, session, etc. Best regards all, Jon Bunke...|$|R
