40|$|An on- farm {{trial was}} {{conducted}} by feeding intensively with locally available cereal crop residue based complete rations (mash form) and compared them with conventional sole grazing system to assess the meat parameters in native ram lambs. Two rations, viz., sorghum (R-I) and maize (R-II) straw-based complete rations (50 % roughage, 50 % concentrate) were prepared mash form and fed to ram lambs intensively and results compared with conventional grazing (R-III) ram lambs. Results indicated that, the carcass weight, breast <b>and</b> <b>shank,</b> neck <b>and</b> <b>shoulder,</b> leg, loin, rack and deboned meat proportions in ram lambs fed sorghum and maize straw-based complete rations were comparable (P> 0. 05) and also no difference in meat characteristics was observed in the solely grazed animals. Based {{on the results of}} this study, it is concluded that, feeding of crop residue based complete rations could not affect the quality of meat over grazing ram lambs...|$|R

30|$|A slim-hole well {{has been}} defined {{in a number of}} {{different}} ways (<b>Shanks</b> <b>and</b> Williams 1993; Finger and Jacobson 2000; Jahn et al. 2008), all of which refer to the drilling of a well with a well-bore typically less than 7 in. in diameter.

5000|$|A lip strap is a {{piece of}} horse tack made of rolled leather or {{occasionally}} thin chain, used sometimes on some types of English-style curb and Pelham bits. The lip strap runs between the bit <b>shanks</b> <b>and</b> passes through a special center ring on a curb chain sometimes called the [...] "fly link." [...] The lip strap attaches to rings at midpoint of the <b>shanks</b> <b>and</b> buckles on the near side.|$|R
25|$|Hooks are {{designed}} as either single hooks—a single eye, <b>shank</b> <b>and</b> point; double hooks—a single eye merged with two <b>shanks</b> <b>and</b> points; or triple—a single eye merged with three <b>shanks</b> <b>and</b> three evenly spaced points. Double hooks are formed {{from a single}} piece of wire and {{may or may not have}} their shanks brazed together for strength. Triple hooks are formed by adding a single eyeless hook to a double hook and brazing all three shanks together. Double hooks are used on some artificial lures and are a traditional fly hook for Atlantic Salmon flies, but are otherwise fairly uncommon. Triple hooks are used on all sorts of artificial lures as well as for a wide variety of bait applications.|$|R
