5|$|In an {{announcement}} for the Super Smash Bros. Invitational, a tournament {{which was held}} at E3 2014, Nintendo revealed an official GameCube controller adapter for the Wii U, which allows players to use GameCube controllers with the game, {{as well as a}} Smash Bros. themed <b>game</b> <b>controller.</b> The adapter and controllers were released alongside the game and are also available separately, but vary depending on the region.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{gameplay}} involves one-on-one 2.5D style fighting. Mortal Kombat uses {{a single}} two-dimensional fighting plane (at 60 frames per second), although characters are rendered in three-dimensional fashion, {{intended to give}} depth and range to portrayals of various projectiles. Unlike previous Mortal Kombat games, four buttons on the <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> represent attacks and are each linked to a corresponding limb.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Move is a motion-sensing <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> {{platform}} for the PlayStation 3 video game console by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). Based on the handheld motion controller wand, PlayStation Move uses the PlayStation Eye webcam to track the wand's position and the inertial sensors in the wand to detect its motion. First revealed on June 2, 2009, PlayStation Move was launched in Q3/Q4 2010. Hardware available at launch included the main PlayStation Move motion controller and an optional PlayStation Move sub-controller.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of God of War {{focuses on}} combo-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and a secondary weapon acquired {{later in the}} game. It features quick time events that require the player to complete various <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. It also features puzzles and platforming elements.|$|E
5|$|Vagrant Story is a solo action {{role-playing}} game, {{in which}} the player controls Ashley Riot from a third-person perspective while exploring Leá Monde and the catacombs underneath. The player may also switch into first-person perspective {{to allow for a}} 360° view using the START button or right analog stick on the <b>game</b> <b>controller.</b> Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a three-dimensional field map. Navigation is in real-time, and areas accessed by the player are stored in an in-game map menu.|$|E
5|$|In combat, a quick time event (QTE) feature, {{also called}} context {{sensitive}} attacks, is initiated when the player has weakened a strong foe. The player performs {{a sequence of}} actions on the <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt. This allows for limited control of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence, which, if successful, ends the battle; failure usually results in damage to the protagonist. Similar in function is a quick time sex mini-game {{in the form of}} an encounter with female twins, which has become a regular feature throughout the series.|$|E

5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to {{look into}} a corner using a new head {{tracking}} feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a <b>game</b> <b>controller.</b> In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the previous installments, with a focus on combo-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features quick time events that require the player to complete <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to three magical attacks as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. The control setup was reconfigured for the PSP, as it has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2's controller. Ready at Dawn's solution for the controls received praise from critics.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} is {{very similar}} to the previous installment, and focuses on combo-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—Athena's Blades—and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features quick time events that require the player to complete various <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. In addition to its vastly similar gameplay, God of War II features improved puzzles and four times as many bosses as the original.|$|E

5|$|The user {{interface}} and game controls are unified across the PC and home console versions. Players {{have the option}} of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> to play; the former two are achieved on PlayStation 4 via wireless or USB keyboard and mouse. By default, the system is navigated through drag and drop windows on PC. Navigation on the PlayStation version of Final Fantasy XIV is accomplished with a XrossMediaBar-like interface due to platform users' familiarity with the set-up. This bar is used to access all menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. The head-up display for both versions includes a message log, party status menu, mini-map, and action bar. The player may customize the location of all of these elements.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. Using a special <b>game</b> <b>controller,</b> players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes {{in time with the}} music increases the player's score and builds up the performance meter, while missing notes will cause the meter to drop. Should the meter fall below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to the player's score multiplier by one, up to a maximum of four times the original multiplier. Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current multiplier (up to 8x).|$|E
5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a <b>game</b> <b>controller.</b> Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E

5|$|The PC {{version of}} Metal Gear Solid was {{released}} in North America, Europe and Asia in late 2000. This version was published by Microsoft Game Studios and developed by Digital Dialect. It supports {{the use of a}} keyboard or a USB <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> with at least six buttons (with the manual recommending the Sidewinder Game Pad Pro). It also supports Direct3D-capable video cards, allowing for a high resolution of up to 1024x768. The PC version is simply labelled Metal Gear Solid on the packaging, but the actual game uses the Metal Gear Solid: Integral logo, although it has some differences as well from the PlayStation version of Integral and lacks some of its content. The biggest change was reducing the number of discs from three to two, which was done by giving each disc two separate executable files, one for the main game (mgsi.exe) and the other for the VR training portion (mgsvr.exe), thus eliminating the need for a stand-alone third disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features {{a cross between a}} sword and a violin on a white background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had a cross between a violin and a <b>game</b> <b>controller.</b> The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E

5|$|DJ Hero is {{a rhythm}} video {{game and a}} {{spin-off}} of the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision worldwide in October 2009 for the PlayStation 2 and 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles. The game is based on turntablism, requiring {{the use of a}} special <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> that includes a turntable surface with three buttons, a crossfader bar, and an effects dial, in addition to other controller buttons used to manipulate in-game menus. In a manner similar to Guitar Hero, players use the turntable controller to mimic the actions of a disc jockey (DJ), such as scratching and crossfading between two different songs, as graphical representations of these actions scroll down on screen towards the player in time with the music. Unlike previous Guitar Hero games, there is no performance meter, and instead players are simply challenged to obtain the best score possible in order to earn stars (from zero to five for each mix) to unlock new songs, venues, and characters. The player can attempt these songs at one of four difficulties (Easy to Expert), with higher difficulties providing more actions for the player to perform within the song.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a <b>game</b> <b>controller</b> or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E
5|$|The Kinect, a motion-sensing {{input device}} made by Microsoft and {{designed}} as a video <b>game</b> <b>controller,</b> was first introduced in November 2010, and was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra-wide 1080p camera, which can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor. It employs higher-end processing power and new software, can distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and can determine a user's heart rate by looking at his/her face. Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers {{as part of a}} plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered its biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000 after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among the investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet; with more than 11 percentage points declining Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion. For the 2010 fiscal year, Microsoft had five product divisions: Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division and Entertainment and Devices Division.|$|E
