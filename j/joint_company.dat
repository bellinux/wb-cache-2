5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a <b>joint</b> <b>company,</b> Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units.|$|E

The venture was officially founded in 1974. The two primary roles for CFMI were to manage the program between GE and SNECMA, and to market, sell and service the engine at a single point of contact for the customer. CFMI was made responsible for the day-to-day decision making for the project, while major decisions (developing a new variant, for example) required the go-ahead from GE and SNECMA management.|$|E

In fact the colour of the cars, which was later to become legendary, was unintentional - they had initially been painted white as was traditional for German cars, but the paint was stripped away to reduce weight. The cars set speed records up to 435km/h (270mph). The team {{was guided by}} the great Rennleiter (racing team manager) Alfred Neubauer until the company ceased racing {{at the start of}} WWII.|$|E
25|$|The ITA's {{solution}} was to ask ABC and Rediffusion to merge {{to form a new}} company.

Instead, the parent companies formed a <b>joint</b> <b>company</b> called Thames Television Holdings Limited (trading as Thames Television), which took over the staff of ABC in Teddington and a minority of staff from Rediffusion. Management and on-screen talent was mainly provided by ABC.|$|E

New share capital of £3.3 million could be raised, with an additional £1.1 million if required. Holders of shares in the existing canal companies exchanged them for new shares. The Ellesmere and Chester was valued at £250,004, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction at £150,000, and the Shrewsbury at £75,000. The company carried forward debts and liabilities of £800,207.|$|E

25|$|During 1993 Borland {{explored}} {{ties with}} WordPerfect {{as a possible}} way to form a suite of programs to rival Microsoft's nascent integration strategy. WordPerfect itself was struggling with a late and troubled transition to Windows. The eventual <b>joint</b> <b>company</b> effort, named Borland Office for Windows (a combination of the WordPerfect word processor, Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database) was introduced at the 1993 Comdex computer show. Borland Office never made significant in-roads against Microsoft Office. WordPerfect was then bought by Novell. In October 1994, Borland sold Quattro Pro and rights to sell up to million copies of Paradox to Novell for $140 million in cash, repositioning the company on its core software development tools and the Interbase database engine and shifting toward client-server scenarios in corporate applications. This later proved a good foundation for the shift to web development tools.|$|E

25|$|In November 2008, Bajatović was {{appointed}} to replace Saša Ilić as general manager of Srbijagas. As {{this is not a}} ministerial position, he was not required to resign from parliament. One month after his appointment, he concluded a significant deal between Srbijagas and the Russian firm Gazprom wherein Serbia sold a 51% stake in its state oil monopoly to Russia in return {{for the construction of a}} strategic Russian pipeline through Serbia via an initiative that ultimately became known as South Stream. Bajatović took part in several further deals with Gazprom after this time, and in late 2009 he indicated Serbia's ambition to become a major hub for the distribution of Russian gas in Europe.

25|$|Not long after, GWN {{continued}} to expand within Western Australia, acquiring Mid-Western Television (owner of VEW-8 Kalgoorlie) in December 1985 for 7 million, and Geraldton Telecasters (owner of GTW-11) in March 1987 {{for an undisclosed}} amount. The takeovers gave the network a monopoly over all commercial television services in regional Western Australia. In 1987, Bendat and Kerry Stokes merged their media interests into <b>joint</b> <b>company</b> BDC Investments. Later that year, Northern Star Holdings purchased BDC for 206 million. Northern Star were forced to sell GWN to satisfy existing media regulations. GWN was sold back to Stokes in December 1988 for 54 million, who upgraded equipment throughout the network. In April 1990, the callsigns BTW and GSW were merged, to become SSW. During the late 1980s, GWN was promoted as GWN Satellite and aired programs from mostly the Nine Network plus a few from Seven and Ten with TVW's Seven News (from Perth) providing the national news link.|$|E
25|$|Rather than accept {{another season}} with the <b>joint</b> <b>company,</b> Santley decided to {{establish}} a new English Opera enterprise at the Gaiety Theatre, working with the theatre's music director and conductor, Meyer Lutz. In autumn 1870 he launched a successful nine-week run at the Gaiety with Hérold's Zampa. He refused to sing Don Giovanni but he did stage Fra Diavolo (with himself in title role), and, in the lead-up to Christmas, The Waterman. Performances of Fra Diavolo continued through February 1871, while Lortzing's Czar und Zimmerman (as Peter the Shipwright) was staged for Easter. This production proved a success but Santley could not persuade the Gaiety's manager, John Hollingshead, to produce Auber's Le Cheval de bronze as a follow-up. Feeling that his long-cherished project of an English lyric theatre could never be accomplished, he decided to turn his back on the stage altogether. Instead, in 1872-1873, he set out on a concert tour of in the United States and Canada.|$|E
