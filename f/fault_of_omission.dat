Capture-recapture {{is a technique}} which provides an estimates <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> remaining in a software artifact. This helps managers {{to make a decision}} whether a re-inspection is required or not. At a higher level, software requirements document consists <b>of</b> general <b>faults,</b> <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> and <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> comission. A common belief is that the faults that are visible in the artifact are easier to detect by the inspectors. The nature <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> that could be detected by inspectors has not been empirically studied. Using the inspection data from varying number of students, we analyzed the category (general or <b>omission</b> or comission) <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> that are easier to detect by the inspectors. The results from this study shows that <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> comission are significantly easier to detect by the inspectors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} problem of Approximate Agreement. This is a gener aJization of Byzantine Agreement, where {{processors}} are oniy required to obtain values that are close together, rather than identical. We offer new multi-round algorithms in several different models of computation, distinguished by the degree of synchrony {{in the system and}} the malevolence allowed to faulty processors. For each model we also examine the theoretical limits on attainable performance (measured by the reduction in the range of values), and show that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal with increasing ratio of non-faulty pro cessors to faulty ones. There are two main conclusions we can draw from these algorithms and lower bounds. First, if process failures are restricted to fau’ts <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> only (that is, a faulty processor is not allowed to send a wrong message, although it is allowed to crash, and therefore not send any message) then twice as much reduction can be achieved in each round of the algorithm as in a model where <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> commission are possible. This relationship holds in both synchronous and asynchronous systems. Second, we show that in syxchronous systems algorithms that combine information from different rounds of message exchange can perform bettor than algorithms that treat each round separately. This extra performance is obtained by detecting which processors are faulty, and removing them from the system. h contrast, in asynchronous systems with <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> only {{there is no way to}} improve performance by using multiple rounds together rather than independently...|$|R

Your Lordship's conduct may bring to mind the story of a company of strolling comedians, who gave out the play of Hamlet as the performance of the evening.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} reasoning about the reliability of fault-tolerant systems with two "channels" (i. e., components) of which one, A, supports only a claim of reliability, while the other, B, by virtue of extreme simplicity and extensive analysis, supports a plausible claim of "perfection. " We begin with the case where either channel can bring the system to a safe state. We show that, conditional upon knowing pA (the probability that A fails on a randomly selected demand) and pB (the probability that channel B is imperfect), a conservative bound on {{the probability that the}} system fails on a randomly selected demand is simply pA. pB. That is, there is conditional independence between the events "A fails" and "B is imperfect. " The second step of the reasoning involves epistemic uncertainty about (pA, pB) and we show that under quite plausible assumptions, a conservative bound on system pfd can be constructed from point estimates for just three parameters. We discuss the feasibility of establishing credible estimates for these parameters. We extend our analysis from <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> to those <b>of</b> commission, and then combine these to yield an analysis for monitored architectures of a kind proposed for aircraft...|$|R
40|$|The schema {{is the key}} {{artefact}} used {{to describe}} the structure of a relational database, specifying how data will be stored and the integrity constraints used to ensure it is valid. It is therefore surprising that to date little work has addressed the problem of schema testing, which aims to identify mistakes in the schema early in software development. Failure to do so may lead to critical faults, which may cause data loss or degradation of data quality, remaining undetected until later when they will prove much more costly to fix. This thesis explores how mutation analysis – a technique commonly used in software testing to evaluate test suite quality – can be applied to evaluate data generated to exercise the integrity constraints of a relational database schema. By injecting faults into the constraints, modelling both <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> and commission, this enables the fault-finding capability of test suites generated by different techniques to be compared. This is essential to empirically evaluate further schema testing research, providing a means of assessing the effectiveness of proposed techniques. To mutate the integrity constraints of a schema, a collection of novel mutation operators are proposed and implementation described. These allow an empirical evaluation of an existing data generation approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of the mutation analysis technique and identifying a configuration that killed 94...|$|R

It is hurried and broken, as a man's speech may be hurried and broken when he is driven to it {{by a sense of}} burning injustice and intolerable wrong. But it is true--and I defy any man to read it without rising with the conviction of its truth. Consider the cloud of witnesses. Consider the minute and specific detail in the evidence. Consider the undenied system which must prima facie produce such results. Consider the admissions of the Belgian Commission. Not one shadow of doubt can remain in the most sceptical mind that the accusations of the Reformers have been absolutely proved. It is not a thing of the past. It is going on at this hour. The Belgian annexation has made no difference. The machinery and the men who work it are the same. There are fewer outrages it is true. The spirit of the unhappy people is so broken that it is a waste of labour to destroy them further. That their conditions have not improved is shown by the unanswerable fact that the export of rubber has not decreased. That export is the exact measure of the terrorism employed. Many of the old districts are worked out, but the new ones must be exploited with greater energy to atone. The problem, I say, remains as ever. But surely the answer is at hand. Surely there is some limit to the silent complicity of the civilized world? ...|$|R
5000|$|When the United Australia Party Government of Joseph Lyons came {{to power}} in January 1932, it passed the Financial Agreement Enforcement Act, thereby forcing the NSW {{government}} to adhere to its debt commitments and to cut government spending.Lang appealed the decision to the High Court. When the court ruled that the law was valid, Lang ordered Treasury officials to withdraw all the state's funds from government bank accounts so that the federal government could not gain access to the money. Game advised Lang that in his view this action was illegal, and that if Lang did not reverse it he would dismiss the government. Lang stood firm, and issued a leaflet in defiance of Game. Game then reluctantly decided to exercise his reserve powers and called Lang to Government House to dismiss him. However, Lang was not the first to hear of his dismissal. The pianist Isador Goodman, who had been befriended by Sir Philip and Lady Game, was at Government House for dinner that night. There were a number of interruptions, and Goodman asked if he perhaps ought to leave. Game replied, [...] "No, that's not necessary. You see, I am about to dismiss the Premier."On 13 May 1932 Game dismissed Lang's government and appointed the UAP leader, Bertram Stevens, as Premier. Stevens formed a coalition with Michael Bruxner's Country Party and immediately called an election, at which Lang's NSW Labor Party was heavily defeated.

40|$|Relational {{databases}} are a vital {{component of}} many modern soft- ware applications. Key {{to the definition}} of the database schema — which specifies what types of data will be stored in the database and the structure in which the data is to be organized — are integrity constraints. Integrity constraints are conditions that protect and preserve the consistency and validity of data in the database, preventing data values that violate their rules from being admitted into database tables. They encode logic about the application concerned, and like any other component of a software application, need to be properly tested. Mutation analysis is a technique that has been successfully applied to integrity constraint testing, seeding database schema <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> both <b>omission</b> and commission. Yet, as for traditional mutation analysis for program testing, it is costly to perform, since the test suite under analysis needs to be run against each individual mutant to establish whether or not it exposes the fault. One overhead incurred by database schema mutation is the cost of communicating with the database management system (DBMS). In this paper, we seek to eliminate this cost by performing mutation analysis virtually on a local model of the DBMS, rather than on an actual, running instance hosting a real database. We present an empirical evaluation of our virtual technique revealing that, across all of the studied DBMSs and schemas, the virtual method yields an average time saving of 51 % over the baseline...|$|R
