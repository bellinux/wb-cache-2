5000|$|Hill farming {{has been}} {{supported}} by both the British government and EU policies, {{one of the most}} influential EU scheme being The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). [...] The CAP provided production-based direct (<b>headage)</b> which gave incentive to stock beef cattle and sheep at high densities. [...] This led to, in some circumstances, overgrazing which damages natural and semi-natural vegetation. [...] Because of overgrazing and issues with the accumulation of surpluses, the CAP was reformed. The two most recent reforms to the CAP were Agenda 2000 in 1999 and the Mid Term Review of June 2003 and April 2004. These changes are phasing out support and protections linked to production, and are providing more support on environmental and rural developments.|$|E

Specifically the policies promote the reduction of stocking densities, reduction of employment of additional farm labour, movement away from reliance on beef cattle, increased specialization, and to keep farming land in “good agricultural condition” rather than farm abandonment.

At 1999 -prices, producing a fixed milk quota with low to moderate yielding cows (6000 to 6600 kg milk annually) is most profitable. Silage offered ad libitum is profitable. A three cut harvesting system is more profitable than two cuts. Changes in the milk price have no effects on production. If forage crops is the only possible land use, increased area payments have no effects on production. If non-forage crops are also grown, increased area payments for forage crops result in {{a higher proportion of}} the land being used for temporary grass (ley) and in cheaper forage, making higher silage intake per cow profitable. Higher intake of silage achieved through supplementing less con-centrates, results in lower milk yield per cow. By increasing <b>headage</b> payments, milk yield falls, as it is optimal to have more cows to produce the same quota output. Reduced product and concentrate prices combined with higher area and <b>headage</b> payments result in more cows and lower yields.

40|$|The {{switch in}} {{emphasis}} from market support {{systems in the}} 1992 CAP reform toward direct payments resulted in {{a dramatic increase in}} financial support terms, from £ 336. 7 million in 1991 to £ 915. 3 million in 1999 (current prices). The impact of this change in Irish agricultural policy was to increase substantially the dependency of farmers, with the exception of dairy farmers, on the ‘cheque in the post ’ for a farm income. It is the impact of these changes on the distribution of farm income which is of concern in this study. In line with these policy changes the proportion of average family farm income derived from the market (as opposed to direct payments) decreased from 73. 3 per cent in 1993 to 37. 1 per cent in 1997. At the same time the corresponding proportions for direct payments increased from 26. 7 per cent to 62. 9 per cent. Analysis of the distribution of family farm income by deciles (based on FFI) and for all farms indicates a more equitable distribution of income between 1993 and 1997. This improvement in equity is attributed to the effects of direct payments on farm incomes. Analysis decomposing the individual effects of selected measures show that (i) the suckler cow premia, and (ii) the <b>headage</b> payments (Livestock <b>headage</b> payments in the Disadvantaged Areas) were the most effective measures in favouring income distribution equity. Cross compliance schemes (REPS and extensification) and the special beef premia had a more moderate effect in terms of equity while the arable aid payments contributed least to farm income equity. The market-derived income component had a high negative effect on equity of farm income distribution. The inclusion of a high proportion of dairy farmers among those with high farm incomes is a likely factor in this respect. 3 Impact of Direct Payments on Farm Income Distributio...|$|E

However, current CAP biodiversity support schemes (extensification, agro-environmental premiums) are also implemented at a very low level (e.g. {{due to a lack}} of official inspection) regardless of the farming practices actually used (Poux et al. 2006). These schemes have had, therefore, very limited effect in counteracting the intensification process observed in many Greek livestock farms or in promoting the utilisation of bigger pastoral areas or longer grazing periods. Since biodiversity is a complex concept, different indicators need to be pragmatically integrated into a common framework, which is essential for effective biodiversity monitoring and conservation and a basis for result-orientated subsidies (de Bello et al. 2010).|$|E

30|$|The {{stabilisation}} of <b>headage</b> payment rights after 1992, both {{at national}} and individual levels, brought {{instability in the}} sector since farmers opted to increase their flocks in order to press for higher quotas and to benefit from high milk prices. Crop subsidies further affected most sheep and goat farming systems since prices decreased also for concentrate feeds, thus leading farmers to utilise them more in feeding their flocks. Then, Greece consolidated, by the Reg. (E.E.C) 1107 / 96, as Products of Designated Origin [PDO] 20 dairy-farming products (cheeses) of which 18 were made of sheep and goat milk. At that point, a 'milk war' broke out as large dairy enterprises competed in offering high prices for sheep and goat milk, as each aimed to secure a bigger market share in the sector. Nevertheless, overproduction of milk and higher final product prices soon resulted in an over-supply of cheese, so milk prices fell sharply in the subsequent years, gradually returning to the former levels by 2000. A stable period in production and product prices followed until 2005.|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} {{purpose of this}} paper is to estimate the extent to which decoupled payments under the Single Payments Scheme (SPS) are being used (either explicitly or implicitly) in England to support the continuation of activities that were previously supported by area and <b>headage</b> payments. In the absence of a farm survey, the methodology consists of using information on farm accounts collected through England’s Farm Business Survey (FBS), to estimate a multi-output cost function differentiated by farm size and farm type. This cost function, calibrated to match regional prices in England, is used to estimate the level of cross-subsidisation in the first full year after implementation of the SPS (2005 / 06). Results indicate that cross-subsidisation was occurring, which might infer that many farmers across England are coupling their payments. Whilst, these results are for the first year, and in that sense may reflect a transitional situation, they are nevertheless important because they provide empirical evidence to inform the discussion concerning the impact and future development of the SPS.

During this period the mid-term review of the CAP (Council Regulation 1782 / 2003) introduced the option of decoupling sheep and goat support payments, one objective of which was to promote more environmentally sustainable agriculture.

The effects on farm business viability were monitored and results compared with two relevant sub samples of Farm Business Survey recorded farms. The study showed that farming profitability declined sharply over the study period but that participant case study farm profitability exceeded that of non-participants by an average of £ 4024 per year. This was attributable to a combination of factors which included larger average farm size, the ESA premium and more intensive farming operations. Subsidies received by both types of farms were almost totally on the "per head" basis and averaged £ 270 per hectare. Without these both classes of farms would have been highly unprofitable. The status of the ESA premium compared with these figures was an average of 4. 5 percent of business turnover or £ 2358 per farm, well below that of <b>headage</b> based subsidies.

30|$|The {{application}} of E.C. Reg. 1782 / 2003 {{at the beginning}} of 2005 brought a new era in the sector. Full decoupling has been imposed by the Greek government for the sheep and goat sector as it was for most of the Greek agriculture sectors, which meant that production-oriented subsidies would have been paid on a 'historic rights' basis, i.e. a comprehensive subsidy was calculated {{on the basis of the}} unitary 2002 <b>headage</b> payment and the farmer's payment rights (calculated as the average of 3 years) and the amount 'frozen' until 2013. This was expected to have positive impacts by favouring the replacement of specialised crop systems with mixed crop and livestock systems and by returning non-profitable arable land to pasture lands. Sheep and goat farmers who had grazing land in their 'historic records' had to maintain these lands in good condition by grazing (maintaining a density of 1.4 head/ha), while the landless farmers, who used to use 'communal grazing land', had to continue breeding at least 50 % of their animals. The compensatory premium for breeding in the LFAs continued largely unaffected, while some agri-environmental measures (these including extensification and organic farming) were applied sporadically. The implementation of 'cross compliance' rules did not result in many constraints for sheep and goat farmers, except for the animal identification rules, since many traditional farmers were reluctant to enter the system and keep records.|$|E

3000|$|During the 1970 s and 1980 s, {{there is}} {{evidence}} that a combination of market trends and CAP support payments encouraged many hill farms to increase stock numbers and the intensity of land management in these areas (Baldock et al. 2002). The market trends show a steady increase in sheep and cattle numbers, largely because the support payments were <b>headage</b> payments with farmers receiving payments per head for their number of breeding ewes. As (Baldock et al. 2002) point out, this strongly influenced farmer behaviour and led to {{an increase in the number}} of stock grazing upland areas. By the early 1990 s the major threat to biodiversity in upland areas was overgrazing by sheep and cattle (English Nature 1996). Following the 1992 CAP reforms, cross-compliance conditions were introduced on sheep and beef support payments which were specifically designed to deter overgrazing, and during the 1990 s stock numbers in these areas stabilised (Baldock et al. 2002). In the same period, environmental schemes for upland farms specifically sought to reduce overgrazing of moorland, as well as encouraging a range of positive management actions, including restoring traditional field boundaries and protecting farm woodlands from damage by livestock, through fencing. However, in 2002, the government’s nature conservation agency re-stated that overgrazing was one of the key issues undermining favourable status on Natura 2000 sites in England (English Nature 2002)and it was expressed again by Natural England (NE) in 2009 (NE 2009), the English government's nature conservation agency.

40|$|In {{many parts}} of Europe, decades of {{production}} subsidies led to the steady intensification of agriculture in marginal areas, but the recent decoupling of subsidies from production decisions means {{that the future of}} farming in these areas is uncertain. For example, in the uplands of the United Kingdom, an area important both for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision, hill farmers steadily increased stocking densities in response to <b>headage</b> payments but must now reconfigure farm businesses to account for the shift to the Single Farm Payment scheme. We examined hill farming in the Peak District National Park as a case study into the future of marginal agriculture after decoupling. We surveyed 44 farm businesses and from this identified six representative farm types based on enterprise mix and land holdings. We developed linear programming models of production decisions for each farm type to examine the impacts of policy changes, comparing the effects of decoupling with and without agri-environment and hill farm support, and evaluating the effects of removal of the Single Farm Payment. The main effects of decoupling are to reduce stocking rates, and to change the mix of livestock activities. Agri-environmental schemes mediate the income losses from decoupling, and farmers are predicted to maximise take up of new Environmental Stewardship programmes, which have both positive and negative feedback effects on livestock numbers. Finally, removal of the Single Farm Payment would lead to negative net farm incomes, and some land abandonment. These changes have important implications for ongoing debates about how ecological service flows can be maintained from upland areas, and how marginal upland farming communities can be sust ained.

40|$|When the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was {{originally}} {{established in the}} early 1960 s, {{the aim of the}} policy was to encourage farmers to produce more by offering them subsidies and putting systems in place that would guarantee farmers a high price for their products. However, by the 1980 s this has led to large surpluses of products and calls for reform. As a consequence several reform and adjustments of the CAP took place in the 1990 s culminating in 1999 with the introduction of the Agenda 2000 reform. This led to the last major reform of the CAP in 2003. The main aspect of the 2003 reform was the replacement of numerous income and production subsidy schemes by the Single Payment Scheme. This meant that payments to farmers were no longer linked to production or number of animals kept. Instead, a form of basic income support is given to farmers who maintain their land according to agricultural and environmental compliance requirements. Regarding the Common Market Organization of the beef and veal, the 2003 reform of the CAP severed the link between <b>headage</b> and payments and replaced it by a single farm payment based on historical entitlements. A system of premiums remains in force, subject to certain conditions, in the form of additional payments to the farmer in order to avoid production abandonment. After a survey of the CAP policy on direct aids and in the beef sector, this chapter develops a microeconomic model for analysing the impact of market prices and premiums on beef production. The modeling framework is dynamic. It takes into account the cattle herd renewal resulting from biological constraints, the heterogeneity of the herd composition and the fact that producers have the choice between keeping an animal in the herd and slaughtering it. It characterizes the parameters that influence beef supply decisions as well as cattle herd management by taking into account time adjustments, price expectations and CAP support instruments. Results show that producers¿ decisions are influenced both by market prices and direct support schemes, but the impact is different depending on the herd composition. JRC.

Particular emphasis {{has been given to}} the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, reform of which was an important element in the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round (UR), and which is to be subject to further reforms under Agenda 2000. Nevertheless, attention has also been given to modelling the effects of other Uruguay Round outcomes in manufactures and services, so that the reform of the CAP can be assessed within the liberalised global setting. Chapter 1 describes the UR agreement in general, and the Agricultural Agreement in detail. Chapter 2 discusses the construction of computable general equilibrium models. This informs the consideration given in Chapter 3 to the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model and to results from several papers that use the model for the analysis of the UR, as well as other UR CGE models. The GTAP version 2 database is examined in Chapter 4 (the latest version, released in June 1998, is covered in Chapter 7). Chapter 5 gives attention to the finer detail of the standard GTAP model, and describes the modifications and extensions made to this model, such as the modelling of partiallyspecific- factors and endogenous subsidy rates and a means of decomposing welfare changes in the GTAP model. Chapter 6 presents the resuUs from modelling the Uruguay Round with the aggregation and model developed in Chapters 4 and 5. The main resuUs for these simulations show that the global welfare gain and regional gains to the EU, the USA and Japan are comparable to studies discussed in Chapter 3. Chapters 7 and 8 use the most recent GTAP database, which gives wider coverage of regions, sectors and factors than the version used in earlier chapters. Chapter 7 augments the model of Chapter 5 with production quotas for milk and sugar, explicit modelling of compensation and <b>headage</b> payment, intervention prices and support buying, and detailed representation of the EU export subsidy commitments. Chapter 8 reports the resuUs of simulations using this in a model 'projected' to 2005. The main resuUs are that the UR leads to welfare losses in the EU, which are partially reduced through Agenda 2000, and that in all scenarios, the redistributional impacts of reforms are far greater than the overall welfare changes. Finally, Chapter 9 offers some conclusions and suggestions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{payments}} are recurring non-market transfers to farmers {{whether they are}} production related or not. There are three main types: (a) compensatory allowances (<b>headage),</b> (b) premia and (c) agri-environmental payments. In 1998 total payments amounted to £ 967. 3 million, up from £ 158. 4 million in 1992. The objectives {{of this study were}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} these payments in maintaining farm units, their implications for farm efficiency and competitiveness and their impact on sustaining viable farm units and rural areas. Data from the National Farm Survey shows the average level of payment was £ 6, 670 in 1997 but varied substantially by farm size. For instance, farms over 100 ha on average received £ 28, 207 in contrast with £ 3, 305 for farms between 10 and 20 ha. Similarly, the distribution of payments by different farm systems shows considerable variation with tillage farmers receiving £ 15, 760 and cattle farms receiving less than £ 6, 000. The most significant feature, however, is the extent of the dependency of farm incomes on direct payments. For instance, on tillage and drystock farms these payments represented close to, or even exceeded the family farm income earned. This means that the income from sales are just about sufficient to cover the costs of production; the cheque in the post being the farm income. Without direct payments large segments of the farm population would operate at a loss; a situation which obviously could not be sustained. The impact of direct payments on farm efficiency and competitiveness is not so clear cut. Analysis of 1996 NFS data shows that the response on cattle farms to increased levels of direct payments was to reduce farm output. However, in terms of farm practice the dominant response was to increase stock numbers and farm inputs, such as feed and fertiliser. This latter response can be taken as adjustments to ensure sufficient stock numbers to maximise the level of payments and not necessarily a contradiction of reduced output responses. For instance the dominant anticipated response to a decoupled payment system is a reduction in farm inputs and stock numbers, a response associated with the more progressive sector of farmers. Notwithstanding the present level of these payments it is clear that the viability of farm units on most small to medium-sized drystock farms can not be assured in a farm context only. Increasingly farmers and their spouses are opting for off-farm employment to supplement their household incomes and to sustain the viability of the family farm unit. Ultimately the optimum use of family labour which is marginal or surplus to farm activities, is deployment off the farm; this clearly has a positive influence on the viability of rural areas.

40|$|Proposals for the {{mid-term review}} of the Common Agricultural Policy were set out in a Communication issued by the European Commission on July 10 th 2002. They {{can be divided into}} two categories: those {{extending}} the current process of reform initiated since 1992; those for completing the shift from product support to producer support. The extension of the 1992 reform process calls for: a final 5 % cut in the cereals intervention price (involving a reduction from Euro 101. 31 to Euro 95. 35 from 2004 / 5, with compensation in line with the Agenda 2000 formula), and a modification of the EU's import regime for cereals and rice (see accompanying article); a modification of special payments for durum wheat to encourage quality production for manufacturing purposes; a reduction of the rice intervention price by 50 % to bring it into line with world market prices (to Euro 150 per tonne by 2004 / 5), with compensation being paid equivalent to 88 % of the reduction in line with the Agenda 2000 cereals sector reforms; in the beef sector a major simplification of the direct aid payments to encourage safer and more quality focused production methods; an extension of reforms in the dairy sector. It is believed that in the cereals sector these final modifications will bring prices into line with world market prices and allow exports (except for rye) without any need for export refunds. In the beef sector it is believed that by decoupling the <b>headage</b> payment and replacing it with a single income payment per farm based on historical entitlement, less intensive forms of beef production will be encouraged. The overall aim of these reforms is to 'enhance the competitiveness of EU agriculture by setting intervention as a real safety-net measure, allowing EU producers to respond to market signals while protecting them from extreme price fluctuations'. The longer term objective involves finalising the shift from product support to producer support through 'the introduction of a decoupled system of payments per farm, based on historical references and conditional upon cross compliance to environmental, animal-welfare and food-quality criteria. ' This will take account of the Agenda 2000 reforms and will cover as many sectors as possible. Under this scheme EU farmers will have complete flexibility to determine what they produce in response to market signals. In the first stage the scheme will cover all products currently subject to reform, with the dairy sector being added when the Agenda 2000 decisions have been implemented. Other sectors still scheduled for reform, such as the sugar, olive oil and certain fruit and vegetable regimes will be incorporated into this wholly decoupled farm payment scheme later on. According to the Commission proposals 'although the new scheme will not cover all sectors at this stage, farmers revceiving the new decoupled farm payments will have flexibility to farm all products on their land including those which are still under coupled support, except if these productions have been exceptionally and explicitly excluded. ' A system of farm audits to ensure cross compliance with the various standards established will be supported through payments of Euro 5000 per annum made available for this purpose. A system of compulsory long term environmental set-aside will also be introduced. A system of 'dynamic modulation' is also being proposed through which 'all direct aid payments will be reduced progressively in arithmetic steps of 3 % per year to reach 20 %, the maximum agreed in Agenda 2000 '. However, this is to be applied selectively on the basis of farm size in order to rebalance the current flow of resources between larger and smaller EU farms. By the end of these changes the 'maximum sum paid to a farm will be Euro 300, 000 '. Direct aid beyond this amount will be transferred to the rural development pillar of the CAP, which is to be considerably strengthened. Both the scope and level of funding for rural development is to be expanded. New chapters will be added to the rural development regulation dealing with food quality-assurance and certification schemes and support to producer groups for the promotion of products produced under quality-assurance and certification schemes (including geographically designated and organic products). These new elements will allow for the payment of 'temporary and degressive [progressively declining] aid to farmers to help them implement demanding standards based on Community legislation in the fields of environment, food safety, animal welfare and occupational safety standards' and are intended to promote good farming practices. Payments will start at Euro 200 per ha in year one and be phased down over five years. This reflects EU concerns over the difficulties of 'simultaneously enhancing the competitiveness of EU agriculture and rural areas while responding to the higher costs resulting from requirements of promoting higher environmental, food safety, food quality and animal welfare standards'. Comment: The final cereals-sector price reduction will complete EU efforts to enhance the competitiveness of cereal and cereal-based value-added food products, by bringing EU prices into line with world market prices. This, along with the modification of direct aid payments for durum wheat will do away with the need for export refunds and will fuel the continued expansion of simple EU cereal-based value-added food-product exports, which has been underway since 1996. The 50 % reduction in the rice intervention price will greatly reduce the value of the trade preferences extended under the Cotonou Rice Declaration and the EBA initiative. The proposed reforms will also seek to insulate EU farmers from the cost-increasing effects of higher EU standards. ACP suppliers will however have to carry these extra costs on the sale price of their products and this will squeeze profit margins at a time of declining EU prices. The introduction of wholly decoupled farmer support will make the EU's farm support programmes more WTO compatible, whilst protecting EU farmers from extreme price fluctuations. As the European Commission has pointed out with reference to the US Farm Bill, this is likely to shift the burden of price fluctuations onto third-country producers, who enjoy no such safety net protection. ACP governments will need to look carefully at the implications this will have for the positions they adopt in both the on-going WTO agriculture negotiations and the forthcoming economic partnership agreement negotiations with the EU.
