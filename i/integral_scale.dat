The <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> corresponds to that in which energy from larger scales is incoming into a turbulent regime.

40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} a {{sampling}} scale triplet of spacing, extent and support is used to define the spatial dimensions of a monitoring network or a field study. The spacing is the average distance between samples, the extent {{is the size of}} the domain sampled and the support is the averaging area of one sample. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine what is the bias and the random error (uncertainty) introduced by the sampling scale triplet into estimates of the mean, the spatial variance and the <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> of a variable in a landscape. The <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> is a measure of the average distance over which a variable is correlated in space. A large number of two dimensional random fields are generated from which hypothetical samples, conforming to a certain sampling scale triplet, are drawn which in turn are used to estimate the sample mean, spatial variance and <b>integral</b> <b>scale.</b> The results indicate that the biases can be up to two orders of magnitude. The bias of the <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> is positively related to the magnitude of any of the components of the scale triplet while the bias of the spatial variance is different for different components of the scale triplet. All sampling scale effects are relative to the underlying correlation length of the variable of interest which is closely related to the <b>integral</b> <b>scale.</b> The <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> can hence be used for sampling design and data interpretation. Suggestions are given on how to adjust a monitoring network to the scales of the variables of interest and how to interpret sampling scale effects in environmental data...|$|E

40|$|Micro air {{vehicles}} (MAVs) {{are small}} {{remotely piloted aircraft}} designed to fly at low altitudes and speeds and were developed for specific mission roles of low altitude reconnaissance and sensing. The MAV’s low-speed flight {{close to the ground}} exposes the MAV to the low-altitude region of the atmospheric boundary layer that results in relatively high turbulence levels, long <b>integral</b> length <b>scales</b> and low Reynolds numbers. In this research work, turbulence intensities comparable to those experienced by MAVs flying at low speeds and altitudes are replicated in two wind tunnel facilities using mesh grids. Three airfoils in two and three-dimensional configurations were exposed to grid turbulence of varying turbulence intensities and <b>integral</b> length <b>scales</b> at low Reynolds numbers. However, the <b>integral</b> length <b>scales</b> were considered shorter than those found in the atmospheric boundary layer. The pressure based method was used to calculate the time-averaged aerodynamic performance of each of the airfoils at several turbulence intensities, <b>integral</b> length <b>scales</b> and Reynolds numbers. The wind-tunnel tests of the three airfoils in smooth flow and {{in the presence of the}} grid turbulence showed that the freestream turbulence intensity and longitudinal <b>integral</b> length <b>scale</b> does significantly influence the time-averaged aerodynamic behavior of the three airfoils. The effect of the increase in the freestream turbulence intensity and longitudinal <b>integral</b> length <b>scale</b> on the flat plate, circular arc and Clark-Y airfoils were only beneficial to the time-averaged aerodynamic performance of these airfoils if the freestream turbulence intensity and longitudinal <b>integral</b> length <b>scale</b> were increased to certain values. This phenomenon was attributed to the receptivity effect that is commonly found in boundary layer research. As the independent variation of turbulence intensity and <b>integral</b> length <b>scale</b> was not possible, it is difficult to draw definite conclusions about the influence of each parameter. However, whilst the aerodynamic performance generally improved on the turbulence intensity and <b>integral</b> length <b>scale</b> increase, this was shown to be not always the case. Since the changes in the aerodynamic performance for a thin symmetrical flat plate, a cambered version of the same flat plate and a commonly used thicker cambered airfoil (Clark-Y airfoil) were significant, it is recommended that the effects of turbulence intensity, length scale and Reynolds number be further studied and focused on increasing the replicated length scales to those found in the atmospheric boundary layer...|$|R

Two grids were used to investigate the effects of turbulence length scale on the surface pressure response. A large grid which produced turbulence with an <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> 13 % of the chord and a smaller grid which produced turbulence with an <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> 1. 3 % of the chord. Measurements were performed at angles of attack, alpha from 0 to 20. An array of microphones mounted subsurface {{was used to measure}} the unsteady surface pressure. The goal of this measurement was to characterize the effects of angle of attack on the inviscid response. Lift spectra calculated from pressure measurements at each angle of attack revealed two distinct interaction regions; for omega(sub r) = omega b / U(sub infinity) is less than 10 a reduction in unsteady lift of up to 7 decibels (dB) occurs while an increase occurs for omega(sub r) is greater than 10 as the angle of attack is increased. The reduction in unsteady lift at low omega(sub r) with increasing angle of attack is a result that has never before been shown either experimentally or theoretically. The source of the reduction in lift spectral level appears to be closely related to the distortion of inflow turbulence based on analysis of surface pressure spanwise correlation length scales. Furthermore, while the distortion of the inflow appears to be critical in this experiment, this effect {{does not seem to be}} significant in larger <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> (relative to the chord) flows based on the previous experimental work of McKeough suggesting the airfoils size relative to the inflow <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> is critical in defining how the airfoil will respond under variation of angle of attack.

40|$|Although {{connectivity}} {{is acknowledged}} {{as a key}} factor of a catchment hydrological behaviour, it still misses reference evaluation methodologies. Therefore {{the objective of the}} paper is to evaluate different quantitative indicators of hydrological connectivity, using the concepts of structural and functional connectivity commonly used in ecology. The indicators were tested on contrasted numerical fields of microtopography that present distinct hydrological responses. The investigated structural connectivity indicators, mostly used so far in porous or fractured media, were the semivariogram, the bivariate entropy <b>integral</b> <b>scale,</b> the n-point rectilinear connectivity <b>integral</b> <b>scale,</b> the connectivity function <b>integral</b> <b>scale,</b> the percolation threshold and the Euler number. The first three indicators were not able to discriminate between the three extreme types of micro-topographical fields whereas the last three indicators were successful. However, relating the latter three indicators to the hydrological response of a topographical field appears uncertain. We therefore proposed a functional connectivity indicator by adapting the 'volume to breakthrough' concept: the degree of surface connection {{as a function of the}} surface storage filling. This indicator was capable of discriminating between the micro-topographical types. It could be used to conceptualize the process of depression filling and therefore may become an effective characteristic of an elementary representative area in large scale hydrologic model.

The macrodispersion coefficients have been derived for the solute transport in two- and three-dimensional domains.

Sensitivity analysis indicates that the values of macrodispersion coefficients are positively related to the changes of indicator correlation scale, <b>integral</b> <b>scale</b> and the difference of the mean log conductivity between different units. But, in this example the macrodispersion coefficients are more sensitive to the indicator correlation scale than to the <b>integral</b> <b>scale.</b> The cross term in the macrodispersion coefficients has an increasing contribution when the contrast of the mean log conductivity increases.
