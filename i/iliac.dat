5|$|Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a {{very large}} and {{dangerous}} type of DVT. It is characterized by an acute and almost total venous occlusion of the entire extremity outflow, including the <b>iliac</b> and femoral veins. The leg is usually painful, tinged blue in color, and swollen, which may result in venous gangrene.|$|E
5|$|Three {{channels}} facilitate lymphatic drainage {{from the}} cervix. The anterior and lateral cervix drains to nodes along the uterine arteries, travelling along the cardinal ligaments {{at the base}} of the broad ligament to the external <b>iliac</b> lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes. The posterior and lateral cervix drains along the uterine arteries to the internal <b>iliac</b> lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes, and the posterior section of the cervix drains to the obturator and presacral lymph nodes. However, there are variations as lymphatic drainage from the cervix travels to different sets of pelvic nodes in some people. This has implications in scanning nodes for involvement in cervical cancer.|$|E
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the <b>iliac</b> crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E
5|$|The hominid Australopithecus afarensis {{represents}} an evolutionary transition between modern bipedal humans and their quadrupedal ape ancestors. A number of traits of the A. afarensis skeleton strongly reflect bipedalism, {{to the extent}} that some researchers have suggested that bipedality evolved long before A. afarensis. In overall anatomy, the pelvis is far more human-like than ape-like. The <b>iliac</b> blades are short and wide, the sacrum is wide and positioned directly behind the hip joint, and there is clear evidence of a strong attachment for the knee extensors, implying an upright posture.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pelvis}} {{is not entirely}} {{like that of a}} human (being {{markedly}} wide, or flared, with laterally orientated <b>iliac</b> blades), these features point to a structure radically remodelled to accommodate a significant degree of bipedalism. The femur angles in toward the knee from the hip. This trait allows the foot to fall closer to the midline of the body, and strongly indicates habitual bipedal locomotion. Present-day humans, orangutans and spider monkeys possess this same feature. The feet feature adducted big toes, making it difficult if not impossible to grasp branches with the hindlimbs. Besides locomotion, A. afarensis also had a slightly larger brain than a modern chimpanzee (the closest living relative of humans) and had teeth that were more human than ape-like.|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the <b>iliac</b> blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} phylogenetic analyses of the group, Gardiner (1983) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade: a bone {{at the back of the}} skull, the parasphenoid, is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull, the pterygoid; large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids; the stapes (a bone involved in hearing) is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward; the cleithrum, a bone in the pectoral girdle, is thin; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch. Additional features were given by Godfrey et al. (1987), including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital at the back of the skull, small projections (uncinate processes) on the ribs, and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single <b>iliac</b> blade. These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies.|$|E
25|$|The Deep Circumflex <b>Iliac</b> Artery Free flap is {{technically}} {{more difficult than}} the TRAM flap, and shaping the new breast seems more challenging than with the TRAM or gluteal flap because of its fusiform shape. Asymmetrical donor site after unilateral breast reconstruction. The blood supply to the flap is less robust and sometimes the deep circumflex <b>iliac</b> vein is small, making venous anastomosis required to transfer the flap more difficult. Part of the donor site scar may be visible in swimsuit. Improper reinsertion of donor site muscles on the <b>iliac</b> crest can cause postoperative complications, like a hernia. Also, nerve paresthesias are possible.|$|E
25|$|In {{the pelvis}} area, {{at the level}} of the last lumbar vertebra, the {{abdominal}} aorta, a continuation the descending aorta, splits into a pair of common <b>iliac</b> arteries. These immediately split into the internal and external <b>iliac</b> arteries, the latter of which descends along the medial border of the psoas major to exits the pelvis area through the vascular lacuna under the inguinal ligament.|$|E
25|$|Bone marrow, which {{requires}} extraction by harvesting, that is, drilling into bone (typically the femur or <b>iliac</b> crest).|$|E
25|$|The <b>iliac</b> crests {{are higher}} and more {{pronounced}} in males, making the male false pelvis deeper and more narrow than in females.|$|E
25|$|The testis has {{collateral}} {{blood supply}} from 1. the cremasteric artery (a {{branch of the}} inferior epigastric artery, which is {{a branch of the}} external <b>iliac</b> artery), and 2. the artery to the ductus deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical artery, which is a branch of the internal <b>iliac</b> artery). Therefore, if the testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood supplies.|$|E
25|$|The renal artery {{of the new}} kidney, {{previously}} branching {{from the}} abdominal aorta in the donor, is often connected to the external <b>iliac</b> artery in the recipient.|$|E
25|$|The bladder is {{supplied}} by the vesical arteries and drained by the vesical veins. The superior vesical artery supplies blood to {{the upper part of}} the bladder, and the inferior vesical artery, supplies the lower part. Both are branches of the internal <b>iliac</b> arteries. The uterine arteries and vaginal arteries also supply blood in females. Venous drainage of blood supplying the bladder begins in a network of small vessels on the outer and back surfaces of the bladder. These coalesce and pass backwards along the lateral ligaments of the bladder into the internal <b>iliac</b> veins.|$|E
25|$|The rectum {{receives}} {{blood from}} both the inferior mesenteric artery and the internal <b>iliac</b> artery; the rectum is rarely involved by colonic ischemia due to this dual blood supply.|$|E
25|$|The renal vein {{of the new}} kidney, {{previously}} draining to {{the inferior}} vena cava in the donor, is often connected to the external <b>iliac</b> vein in the recipient.|$|E
25|$|The Rubens flap {{consists}} of the peri-iliac fat pad {{which is based on}} the deep circumflex <b>iliac</b> artery and vein. The flap pedicle is 5–6cm. long and the blood vessels are approximately 2.5mm. in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Blood is {{supplied}} to the vagina via the vaginal arteries, {{branches of the}} internal <b>iliac</b> arteries. These form two vessels called the azygos arteries which lie on the midline of the anterior and posterior vagina. Other arteries which supply the vagina include branches of the uterine artery, the middle rectal artery, and the internal pudendal artery, all branches of the internal <b>iliac</b> artery. Three groups of lymphatic vessels accompany these arteries; the upper group accompanies the vaginal branches of the uterine artery; a middle group accompanies the vaginal arteries; and the lower group, draining lymph from the area outside the hymen, drain to the inguinal lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|The paired {{testicular}} arteries arise {{directly from}} the abdominal aorta and descend through the inguinal canal, while the scrotum {{and the rest of}} the external genitalia is supplied by the internal pudendal artery (itself a branch of the internal <b>iliac</b> artery).|$|E
25|$|Two main veins drain {{blood from}} the vagina, {{one on the left}} and one on the right. These form a network of smaller veins (an anastomosis) {{on the sides of the}} vagina, {{connecting}} with similar networks of the uterine, vesical and rectal networks. These ultimately drain into the internal <b>iliac</b> veins.|$|E
25|$|The last of {{the lymph}} sacs, the paired {{posterior}} lymph sacs, develop from the <b>iliac</b> veins. The posterior lymph sacs produce capillary plexuses and lymphatic vessels of the abdominal wall, pelvic region, and lower limbs. The posterior lymph sacs join the cisterna chyli and lose their connections with adjacent veins.|$|E
25|$|The epigastric {{region is}} the upper central square and {{contains}} {{the bottom edge}} of the liver {{as well as the}} upper areas of the stomach. The diaphragm curves like an upside down U over these three regions. The central right region is called the right lumbar region and contains the ascending colon and the right edge of the small intestines. The central square contains the transverse colon and the upper regions of the small intestines. The left lumbar region contains the left edge of the transverse colon and the left edge of the small intestine. The lower right square is the right <b>iliac</b> region and contains the right pelvic bones and the ascending colon. The lower left square is the left <b>iliac</b> region and contains the left pelvic bone and the lower left regions of the small intestine. The lower central square contains the bottom of the pubic bones, upper regions of the bladder and the lower region of the small intestine.|$|E
25|$|Less commonly, the iliopsoas tendon {{catches on}} the {{anterior}} inferior <b>iliac</b> spine (AIIS), the lesser trochanter, or the iliopectineal ridge during hip extension, as the tendon moves from an anterior lateral (front, side) to a posterior medial (back, middle) position. With overuse, the resultant friction may eventually cause painful symptoms, resulting in muscle trauma, bursitis, or inflammation in the area.|$|E
25|$|The lymph {{drained from}} the bladder begins {{in a series}} of {{networks}} throughout the mucosal, muscular and serosal layers. These then form three sets of vessels: one set near the trigone draining the bottom of the bladder; one set draining the top of the bladder; and another set draining the outer undersurface of the bladder. The majority of these vessels drain into the external <b>iliac</b> lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|In an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima {{and enters}} the media layer. The high {{pressure}} rips the tissue of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart. This can propagate {{along the length of}} the aorta for a variable distance forward or backwards. Dissections that propagate towards the <b>iliac</b> bifurcation (with the flow of blood) are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the flow of blood) are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100mm of the aortic valve, so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a hemopericardium. Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the <b>iliac</b> bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.|$|E
25|$|Surgery {{may be used}} if medical {{management}} fails or in case of cervical lacerations or tear or uterine rupture. Methods used {{may include}} uterine artery ligation, ovarian artery ligation, internal <b>iliac</b> artery ligation, selective arterial embolization, B-lynch suture, and hysterectomy. Bleeding caused by traumatic causes should be management by surgical repair. When there is bleeding due to uterine rupture a repair can be performed {{but most of the}} time a hysterectomy is needed.|$|E
25|$|The genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2) leaves psoas major {{below the}} two former nerves, {{immediately}} divides into two branches that descends along the muscle's anterior side. The sensory femoral branch supplies the skin below the inguinal ligament, while the mixed genital branch supplies {{the skin and}} muscles around the sex organ. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2, L3) leaves psoas major laterally below the previous nerve, runs obliquely and laterally downward above the iliacus, exits the pelvic area near the <b>iliac</b> spine, and supplies {{the skin of the}} anterior thigh.|$|E
25|$|As the {{inflammation}} progresses, the pain begins to localize more clearly {{to the right}} lower quadrant, as the peritoneum becomes inflamed. This peritoneal inflammation, or peritonitis, results in rebound tenderness (pain upon removal of pressure rather than application of pressure). In particular, it presents at McBurney's point, 1/3 of the way along a line drawn from the anterior superior <b>iliac</b> spine to the umbilicus. Typically, point (skin) pain is not present until the parietal peritoneum is inflamed, as well. Fever and an immune system response are also characteristic of appendicitis.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} {{from the}} ascending colon and proximal {{two-thirds of the}} transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The lymph from the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes. The lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain to the internal <b>iliac</b> nodes. The anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes. The pectinate line only roughly marks this transition.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} the iliopsoas, {{a group of}} two or three muscles with a shared insertion on the lesser trochanter of the femur. The psoas major originates from the last vertebra and along the lumbar spine to stretch down into the pelvis. The iliacus originates on the <b>iliac</b> fossa on the interior side of the pelvis. The two muscles unite to form the iliopsoas muscle which is inserted on the lesser trochanter of the femur. The psoas minor, only present in about 50 per cent of subjects, originates above psoas major to stretch obliquely down to its insertion on the interior side of the major muscle.|$|E
25|$|The major {{bones of}} the leg are the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), and {{adjacent}} fibula, and these are all long bones. The patella (kneecap) is the sesamoid bone {{in front of the}} knee. Most of the leg skeleton has bony prominences and margins that can be palpated and some serve as anatomical landmarks that define the extent of the leg. These landmarks are the anterior superior <b>iliac</b> spine, the greater trochanter, the superior margin of the medial condyle of tibia, and the medial malleolus. Notable exceptions to palpation are the hip joint, and the neck and body, or shaft of the femur.|$|E
25|$|The more {{detailed}} regional approach subdivides the cavity into nine regions, with two vertical and two horizontal lines drawn according to landmark structures. The vertical; or midclavicular lines, are drawn as if {{dropped from the}} midpoint of each clavicle. The superior horizontal line is the subcostal line, drawn immediately inferior to the ribs. The inferior horizontal line is called the intertubercular line, and is to cross the <b>iliac</b> tubercles, found at the superior aspect of the pelvis. The upper right square is the right hypochondriac region and contains {{the base of the}} right ribs. The upper left square is the left hypochondriac region and contains the base of the left ribs.|$|E
25|$|The iliohypogastric (T12-L1) and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) {{emerge from}} the psoas major near the muscle's origin, from where they run {{laterally}} downward to pass anteriorly above the <b>iliac</b> crest between the transversus abdominis and abdominal internal oblique, and then run above the inguinal ligament. Both nerves give off muscular branches to both these muscles. Iliohypogastric supplies sensory branches to {{the skin of the}} lateral hip region, and its terminal branch finally pierces the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique above the inguinal ring to supply sensory branches to the skin there. Ilioinguinalis exits through the inguinal ring and supplies sensory branches to the skin above the pubic symphysis and the lateral portion of the scrotum.|$|E
25|$|The lower limbs (human legs) {{have also}} been damaged. The left <b>iliac</b> crest {{contains}} small fractures. The inferior pubic ramus also contains similar fractures. Due {{to the lack of}} evidence of healing, it is likely that all these fractures were part of the postmortem damage to the Lady's body. The right tibia has a defective area {{at the front of the}} distal shaft. The defective area extends 33.5 millimetres above the ankle joint. The metatarsal bones of both feet are broken, and missing from the body. The phalanx bones of both feet are also missing. There is a subcutaneous (hypodermic) filling at the back of the Lady's right hip region, where her buttock is located.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} inserted on or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior <b>iliac</b> spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses {{the head of the}} femur into the acetabulum but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The piriformis originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of the tip of the greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The gluteus maximus has its origin between (and around) the <b>iliac</b> crest and the coccyx from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal tuberosity under the greater trochanter. The gluteus maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, and it comes into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal tuberosity adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the gluteus medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E
25|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within the pelvis {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue, but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to the lumbar region. Lumbosacral plexopathy is often caused by recurrence of cancer in the presacral space, and may refer to the external genitalia or perineum. Local recurrence of cancer attached {{to the side of}} the pelvic wall may cause pain in one of the <b>iliac</b> fossae. Pain on walking that confines the patient to bed indicates possible cancer adherence to or invasion of the iliacus muscle. Pain in the hypogastrium (between the navel and pubic bone) is often found in cancers of the uterus and bladder, and sometimes in colorectal cancer especially if infiltrating or attached to either uterus or bladder.|$|E
