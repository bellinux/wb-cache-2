50|$|There are two {{distinct}} genetically determined types of earwax: the wet type, which is dominant, and the <b>dry</b> <b>type,</b> which is recessive. While East Asians and Native Americans {{are more likely}} to have the <b>dry</b> <b>type</b> of cerumen (gray and flaky), African and European people {{are more likely to}} have the wet type (honey-brown to dark-brown and moist). Cerumen type has been used by anthropologists to track human migratory patterns, such as those of the Eskimos. In Japan, wet-type earwax is more prevalent among the Ainu, in contrast to that country's Yamato majority. The consistency of wet type earwax is due to the higher concentration of lipid and pigment s (50% lipid) in the substance than the <b>dry</b> <b>type</b> (30% lipid).|$|E

40|$|Patterns of {{vegetation}} in fire-prone habitats {{were analyzed by}} ordination. The results showed that vegetation was highly related to soil texture, but was not obviously related to fire history. I concluded that either fire and soil effects are confounded or fire effects have been reduced by long-time fire suppression. Indicators of site productivity [...] height and volume increment of loblolly pine, and stand basal area [...] were weakly related to vegetation type, but not related to soil texture. The lack of a relationship between these indicators and soil texture suggests that site productivity may not be related simply to soil texture and that interactions with other species may obscure the response of loblolly pine to site productivity. The flammable portion of fine fuel was higher in <b>dry</b> <b>types</b> than in wet types {{which is consistent with}} the hypothesis that fire effects will be greater in <b>dry</b> <b>types</b> than in wet types...|$|R

40|$|The western Palaearctic tundra is a {{breeding}} habitat for large populations of European geese. After their arrival in spring, pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) forage extensively on below-ground plant parts, using a feeding technique called grubbing that has substantial {{impact on the}} tundra vegetation. Previous studies have shown a high frequency of grubbing in lowland fen vegetation. In the present study, we examined the occurrence of grubbing in other habitat types on Spitsbergen, in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Goose grubbing was surveyed along 19 altitudinal transects, going from the valley bottom to altitudes dominated by scree. Grubbing was more frequent in the wet habitat type at low altitudes compared to the <b>drier</b> habitat <b>type</b> at higher altitudes. For the <b>dry</b> habitat <b>type,</b> a higher frequency of grubbing was found in study plots with a south-east facing exposure where snowmelt {{is expected to be}} early. This suggests that pink-footed geese primarily use <b>dry</b> vegetation <b>types</b> for grubbing when they are snow-free in early spring and the availability of snow-free patches of the preferred wet vegetation types in the lowlands is limited. <b>Dry</b> vegetation <b>types</b> have poorer recovery rates from disturbance than wet ones. Sites with early snowmelt and <b>dry</b> vegetation <b>types</b> may therefore be at greater risk of long-term habitat degradation. We conclude that the high growth rate of the Svalbard-breeding pink-footed goose population suggests that increasing impacts of grubbing can be expected and argue that a responsible monitoring of the effects on the tundra ecosystem is crucial...|$|R
