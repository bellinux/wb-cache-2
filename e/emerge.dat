First, we describe how one intrapreneurial large firm is investigating <b>emerging</b> markets such as India and China (<b>emerging</b> economies) with <b>emerging</b> technologies to create a worldwide business solution power. Then the investigation of an <b>emerging</b> technology is provided, that of nanotechnology, by a small entrepreneurial firm utilizing <b>emerging</b> market skill sets to define and enable worldwide business solutions.

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to <b>emerge</b> very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which <b>emerge</b> at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps <b>emerge</b> before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to <b>emerge.</b> Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps <b>emerge.</b> Males <b>emerge</b> first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps <b>emerge.</b> The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E

Are these higher than those of developed countries? We perform an event study on 657 deals involving <b>emerging</b> acquirers between 2002 and 2011 and compare with 1936 deals performed by developed country firms both in <b>emerging</b> markets.

In addition, those government bonds will not attract international investors due to greater political risk. In this case, most investors choose to turn away from the <b>emerging</b> markets instead of changing their stock position to the bond position. Thus, the negative spillover <b>emerges</b> more frequently than the flight to quality in the <b>emerging</b> markets.|$|R
