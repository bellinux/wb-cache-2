5|$|An enquiry {{was held}} to resolve the {{question}} of whom should inherit the de Eynsford lands; Eynsford Castle and the other family estates were divided equally between William Heringaud, a powerful landowner in east Kent, and Nicholas de Criol, a smaller local Kentish landowner, {{both of whom were}} descended from William V. The Second Barons' War broke out in 1264 and both men supported the rebels against Henry III. Eynsford, by now unoccupied, was seized by Ralph de Farningham, a royal official, who in turn passed it onto Ralph de Sandwich, a royal judge. De Sandwich squeezed the Heringauds out of their inheritance, making a deal in 1292 with Heringaud's daughter, the lady of Horton Kirby, and de Sandwich and the Criols then became <b>joint</b> <b>owners</b> of the castle. Around 1300, the castle was occupied once again, probably either by the widow of Nicholas or William VI, or a castle bailiff.|$|E

2500|$|In Dockwray v Dickinson , it {{was held}} that where the facts {{indicated}} a conversion of a ship and cargo that the plaintiff was entitled to interest in one-sixteenth {{of the value of}} the property.

The plaintiff was not entitled to damages for the whole ship and cargo which was converted, but only the percentage which he owned. [...] This was one-sixteenth. Selling the ship and cargo was a different situation than one where the ship was converted and subsequently destroyed. If a joint owner of a cargo ship sell the ship and cargo with the consent of the other <b>joint</b> <b>owners,</b> there is a severance of tenancy, and upon delivery, a severance of property. [...] The buyer may bring action in trover. If one of the partners forcibly takes the ship, and it is subsequently lost in a storm in the West Indies, it is considered a destruction of the ship.
