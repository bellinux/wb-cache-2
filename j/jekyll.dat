5|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} early adaptation of Strange Case of Dr <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr Hyde, Sullivan's play influenced subsequent versions. Later adaptations followed his simplification of the narrative, addition of women characters (especially a romance for <b>Jekyll)</b> and highlighting of the moral contrast between <b>Jekyll</b> and Hyde. Most versions retain the practice of having one actor play <b>Jekyll</b> and Hyde, with the transformation seen by the audience. Several early film versions relied more on Sullivan's play than Stevenson's novella.|$|E
5|$|Dr. <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr. Hyde is a four-act play {{written by}} Thomas Russell Sullivan in {{collaboration}} with the actor Richard Mansfield. It is an adaptation of Strange Case of Dr <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr Hyde, an 1886 novella by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. The story focuses on the respected London doctor Henry <b>Jekyll</b> and his involvement with Edward Hyde, a loathsome criminal. After Hyde murders the father of Jekyll's fiancée, Jekyll's friends discover that he and <b>Jekyll</b> are the same person; <b>Jekyll</b> has developed a potion that allows him to transform himself into Hyde and back again. When he runs out of the potion, he is trapped as Hyde and commits suicide before he can be arrested.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} act, {{a group of}} friends (including Sir Danvers Carew's {{daughter}} Agnes, attorney Gabriel Utterson, and Dr. and Mrs. Lanyon) has met up at Sir Danvers' home. Dr. Lanyon brings word that Agnes' fiancé, Dr. Henry <b>Jekyll,</b> will be late to the gathering. He then repeats a second-hand story about a man named Hyde, who injured a child in a collision on the street. The story upsets Utterson because <b>Jekyll</b> recently made a new will that gives his estate to a mysterious friend named Edward Hyde. <b>Jekyll</b> arrives; Utterson confronts him about the will, but <b>Jekyll</b> refuses to consider changing it.|$|E

5|$|The Lyceum {{production}} of Dr. <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr. Hyde {{was scheduled to}} close on September 29, after which Mansfield intended to stage other plays.

However, Mansfield soon reintroduced Dr. <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr. Hyde to his schedule and added performances between October 10 and October 20.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Famous Players-Lasky {{produced}} a feature-length version directed by John S. Robertson. John Barrymore starred as <b>Jekyll</b> and Hyde, with Martha Mansfield as his fiancée. Clara Beranger's script followed Sullivan's play in having <b>Jekyll</b> engaged to Sir Carew's daughter, adding {{a relationship between}} Hyde and an Italian dancer (played by Nita Naldi). The addition of a female companion for Hyde became a feature of many later adaptations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} act, Hyde fears {{that he will}} be arrested for the murder. He gives his landlady, Rebecca, money to tell {{visitors}} that he is not home. Inspector Newcome from Scotland Yard offers Rebecca more money to turn Hyde in, which she promises to do. Hyde flees to Jekyll's laboratory, where Utterson is waiting to confront the doctor about his will; he insults Utterson and leaves. Rebecca, who has followed Hyde, arrives and tells Utterson that Hyde murdered Sir Danvers. In the play's original version, the act ends with <b>Jekyll</b> returning to his laboratory. In later versions (revised after its premiere), the second act contains an additional scene in which <b>Jekyll</b> returns home; his friends think he is protecting Hyde. Agnes, who saw Hyde before her father was murdered, wants <b>Jekyll</b> to accompany her to provide the police with a description, and is distraught when he refuses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} act, Jekyll's servant, Poole, gives Dr. Lanyon a powder and liquid with {{instructions}} from <b>Jekyll</b> {{to give them}} {{to a person who}} will request them.

5|$|In {{writing the}} stage adaptation, Sullivan made several {{changes to the}} story; these {{included}} creating a fiancée for <b>Jekyll</b> and a stronger moral contrast between <b>Jekyll</b> and Hyde. The changes have been adopted by many subsequent adaptations, including several film versions of the story which were derived from the play. The films included a 1912 adaptation directed by Lucius Henderson, a 1920 adaptation directed by John S. Robertson, and a 1931 adaptation directed by Rouben Mamoulian, which earned Fredric March an Academy Award for Best Actor. A 1941 adaptation, directed by Victor Fleming, was a remake of the 1931 film.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jekyll</b> tells Agnes {{that they}} should end their {{engagement}} because of sins he has committed, but will not explain. Agnes refuses to accept this, and tells <b>Jekyll</b> she loves him. He relents, saying that she will help him control himself, and leaves. Sir Danvers joins his daughter, and they talk about their time in Mangalore, India. When Hyde suddenly enters, Sir Danvers tells Agnes to leave the room. The men argue, and Hyde strangles Sir Danvers.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1888, {{three days}} after the Lyceum opening of Dr. <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr. Hyde, Martha Tabram was {{discovered}} stabbed to death in London's Whitechapel neighborhood. On August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, in the same neighborhood. Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by one person, who became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the <b>Jekyll</b> and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The letter writer, who had seen him perform as <b>Jekyll</b> and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.|$|E

5|$|The Broadway {{production}} {{also received}} positive reviews. When it {{opened at the}} Madison Square Theatre, a New York Times reviewer complimented Mansfield for his acting and for overcoming the difficulty of presenting the story's allegorical material onstage. According to a New-York Daily Tribune reviewer, Mansfield gave excellent performances as <b>Jekyll</b> and Hyde despite a few technical production flaws. A Life review praised Sullivan's adaptation, particularly his addition of a love interest for <b>Jekyll,</b> and complimented the performances of Mansfield, Cameron and Harkins.|$|E
5|$|The {{play was}} closely {{associated}} with Mansfield's performance; a 1916 retrospective on adaptations of Stevenson's works indicated that Sullivan's Dr. <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr. Hyde was no longer performed after Mansfield's death. Although Irving obtained the UK performance rights, he never staged the play. His son, Harry Brodribb Irving, produced a new adaptation by J. Comyns Carr in 1910. By that time, {{more than a dozen}} other stage adaptations had appeared; the most significant was an 1897 adaptation by Luella Forepaugh and George F. Fish, made available in 1904 for stock theater performances as Dr. <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr. Hyde, Or a Mis-Spent Life.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for the Spalding war memorial originated with Barbara McLaren (née <b>Jekyll).</b> Barbara was the widow of Francis McLaren—Spalding's Member of Parliament and a Royal Flying Corps officer, {{who was killed in}} a flying accident near RAF Montrose in 1917—and the niece of garden designer Gertrude <b>Jekyll,</b> with whom Lutyens had collaborated on multiple previous projects. Lutyens designed the McLarens' London house on Cowley Street in Westminster in 1911 and shortly after Francis' death in 1917 designed the headstone for his grave in Busbridge in Surrey. He was later responsible for the war memorial in the same village.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} {{described}} by its creators as a sequel to the novella Strange Case of Dr <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr Hyde, rather than an adaptation of it, with the Robert Louis Stevenson tale serving as a backstory within the series. It stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern-day descendant of Dr. <b>Jekyll,</b> who has recently begun transforming into a version of Mr. Hyde (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman also appears as Claire, Tom's wife.|$|E
5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between <b>Jekyll</b> and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as <b>Jekyll.</b> The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E
5|$|Dr. <b>Jekyll</b> and Mr. Hyde was a {{milestone}} in the careers of Sullivan and Mansfield. Sullivan left his banking job to become a full-time writer. He wrote three more plays (none successful), several novels, and a two-volume collection of short stories, {{many of which have}} Gothic elements. Sullivan attempted one more stage collaboration with Mansfield, a drama about the Roman emperor Nero, but they became estranged after its failure. For the actor, playing <b>Jekyll</b> and Hyde helped establish his reputation for dramatic roles; he had been known primarily for comedies. Mansfield continued to struggle financially (in part because of his elaborate, expensive productions) before he achieved financial stability in the mid-1890s with a string of successful tours and new productions.|$|E

William Robinson was a frequent visitor. <b>Jekyll's</b> long relationship with Country Life began when proprietor Edward Hudson first visited Munstead Wood in 1899. Her garden was notably recorded in Country Life in subsequent years by photographer Charles Latham and Herbert Cowley.|$|R
50|$|Wilder wrote ten {{books about}} her {{experiences}} as a gardener that were popular for offering clear, explicit advice rather than flowery nature writing. She also wrote for newspapers and gardening and shelter magazines such as Horticulture, House & Garden, and the New York Times. In particular, she took up the challenge of adapting <b>Jekyll's</b> aesthetic—developed for a substantially different climate and range of plant species—to the needs of American gardeners. The title of her second book, Colour in My Garden, deliberately echoes <b>Jekyll's</b> influential 1908 book Colour in the Flower Garden.|$|R
