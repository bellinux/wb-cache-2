25|$|Canadian painter Jean-Paul Riopelle (1923–2002), {{a member}} of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group Les Automatistes, helped {{introduce}} a related style of abstract impressionism to the Parisian art world from 1949. Michel Tapié's groundbreaking book, Un Art Autre (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapié was also a curator and <b>exhibition</b> <b>organizer</b> who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded Tachisme, Color Field painting, Lyrical Abstraction, Fluxus, Pop Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Neo-expressionism, and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with Hard-edge painting (Frank Stella, Robert Indiana and others) and Pop artists, notably Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Roy Lichtenstein who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by Richard Hamilton in Britain. Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. Minimalism was exemplified by artists such as Donald Judd, Robert Mangold and Agnes Martin.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide a {{holistic}} view of exhibition destination attractiveness by examining perceptions of two of the three key stakeholders (<b>exhibition</b> <b>organizers</b> and visitors) and contrasting them with those of exhibitors. Design/methodology/approach: This research used a mixed method approach, collecting 535 responses from visitors attending nine business-to-business exhibitions in four major cities in China via structured surveys. In addition, eight in-depth interviews with CEOs/owners of leading global and Chinese exhibition companies were conducted. Findings: The findings revealed that exhibitors may go almost anywhere where there is potential for successful business. In contrast, visitors prefer exhibition destinations with good accessibility to minimize travel time and an attractive leisure environment that offers a degree of enjoyment in addition to taking care of business. A destination’s “economic environment” and “cluster effects” were comparatively less important to them. Organizers were cognizant of these differences, contributing to their reluctance in taking large-scale, branded exhibitions to second-tier destinations, despite considerable efforts by these cities to improve their infrastructure. Practical implications: This study offers practical guidelines for destination administrators and <b>exhibition</b> <b>organizers</b> with regard to evaluating destination resources for long-term exhibition development. Originality/value: In contrast to prior studies, this research identifies significant differences in perceptions of exhibition destination attractiveness among all three key industry stakeholders. It also presents a persuasive case for the need to clearly differentiate between the attractiveness of a destination for attracting/hosting exhibitions versus conventions, rather than approaching the subject from a more generic meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE) segment/business events perspective.

50|$|Snelson's 1948 {{innovation}} spurred Fuller {{to immediately}} commission a mast from Snelson. In 1949, Fuller developed an icosahedron {{based on the}} technology, {{and he and his}} students quickly developed further structures and applied the technology to building domes. After a hiatus, Snelson also went on to produce a plethora of sculptures based on tensegrity concepts. Snelson's main body of work began in 1959 when a pivotal exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art took place. At the MOMA exhibition, Fuller had shown the mast and some of his other work.At this exhibition, Snelson, after a discussion with Fuller and the <b>exhibition</b> <b>organizers</b> regarding credit for the mast, also displayed some work in a vitrine.|$|R

Fostering the development of markets and a new identity and desire for such goods within France represented a parallel mission of these institutions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{empirical}} study is to identify the underlying dimensions of exhibition attendance motivations {{from the perspective of}} exhibition attendees. Using delineated motivational factors, this study then compares attendees’ perceptions of motivational factors in two major market segments: trade and public shows.

The results of this empirical research indicate that there are five motivational factors in exhibition attendance, of which information search and market investigation are the two most important motivators. A market segment comparison shows that trade show attendees’ motivations are significantly greater than those of public show attendees across all five factors. The managerial implications for <b>exhibition</b> <b>organizers</b> and exhibitors are discussed in detail. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R
50|$|The Madonna and Child carries {{somewhat}} of a mysterious history {{in terms of its}} location for five centuries. Many questions about this timeless image remain unanswered in terms of where or whom it came from before the mid 19th Century, which is not actually unusual for duecento and trecento paintings. In 1904 the painting was displayed at the Mostra d’arte antica senese, an exhibition at the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena. The first known owner of the painting brought it to the <b>exhibition</b> <b>organizers</b> whom enabled it to be shown. This person is known to be Count Gregori Stroganoff (1829-1910) who held the Duccio as part of his vast collection of art pieces of all disciplines. There are no known records of who owned or where Duccio’s Madonna and Child was held up to the possession of Stroganoff.|$|R
40|$|The {{marginalization}} of women's art within the Canadian art history canon articulates the dichotomy which {{exists between the}} practice of making art in a Canadian context and the selective recording of that practice within written history. Canadian painters Alexandra Luke and Hortense Gordon {{made significant contributions to}} the development and acceptance of abstract art in Canada, not simply through their own art practice, but also as teachers, lecturers and <b>exhibition</b> <b>organizers,</b> especially in Ontario. In spite of this contribution and the local, national and international reputations that both women enjoyed, their work does not appear in a position of significance in Canadian art history texts. The origin and meaning of this marginalization is based on the social construction of gender with the standard canon privileging male production. Feminist intervention in this system has failed to fundamentally improve or change the structure which is power-based and difficult to destabilize...|$|R
