5|$|Intel and SiliconSystems (acquired by Western <b>Digital</b> <b>in</b> 2009) {{used the}} term write {{amplification}} in their papers and publications as early as 2008. Write amplification is typically measured by the ratio of writes committed to the flash memory to the writes coming from the host system. Without compression, write amplification cannot drop below one. Using compression, SandForce has claimed to achieve a typical write amplification of 0.5, with best-case values as low as 0.14 in the SF-2281 controller.|$|E

Early in 1994, in Zürich, Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee had met with Michael Dertouzos to discuss starting a new organization at MIT. In April 1994, Kotok, Steve Fink, Gail Grant and Brian Reid from Digital traveled to CERN in Geneva to speak with Berners-Lee {{about the need for}} a consortium to create open standards and coordinate Web development.

25|$|In 1981, Sony {{unveiled}} the first consumer camera {{to use a}} charge-coupled device for imaging, {{eliminating the need for}} film: the Sony Mavica.

Although its high cost precluded uses other than photojournalism and professional photography, commercial digital photography was born.|$|E

25|$|Signal {{processing}} {{deals with}} the analysis and manipulation of signals. Signals can be either analog, {{in which case the}} signal varies continuously according to the information, or <b>digital,</b> <b>in</b> which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error detection and error correction of digitally sampled signals.|$|E

25|$|Pandemic was {{aided by}} Weta <b>Digital</b> <b>in</b> {{developing}} the game. They provided {{many of their}} digital models, including the fell beasts. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien's original fantasy series, such as a level based loosely around Balin's conquest of Moria, in which Gimli attempts to retake the dwarven city from the orcs. Some inspiration was less direct: the armies of Rohan and Gondor decide not to attack Minas Morgul in the novel, but a level in the game is based on what might possibly have happened if they had. The game uses Howard Shore's score to the films as its soundtrack.|$|E
