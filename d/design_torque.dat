5000|$|These motors are {{relatively}} costly, {{and are used}} where exact speed (assuming an exact-frequency AC source) as well as rotation with a very small amount of fast variations in speed (called 'flutter" [...] in audio recordings) is essential. Applications included tape recorder capstan drives (the motor shaft could be the capstan), and, {{before the advent of}} crystal control, motion picture cameras and recorders. Their distinguishing feature is their rotor, which is a smooth cylinder of a magnetic alloy that stays magnetized, but can be demagnetized fairly easily as well as re-magnetized with poles in a new location. Hysteresis refers to how the magnetic flux in the metal lags behind the external magnetizing force; for instance, to demagnetize such a material, one could apply a magnetizing field of opposite polarity to that which originally magnetized the material. These motors have a stator like those of capacitor-run squirrel-cage induction motors. On startup, when slip decreases sufficiently, the rotor becomes magnetized by the stator's field, and the poles stay in place. The motor then runs at synchronous speed as if the rotor were a permanent magnet. When stopped and restarted, the poles are likely to form at different locations. For a given <b>design,</b> <b>torque</b> at synchronous speed is only relatively modest, and the motor can run at below synchronous speed. In simple words, it is lagging magnetic field behind magnetic flux.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{authors have}} been {{studying}} the fundamental mechanics of legged vehicles {{with the aim of}} establishing generic principles for their mechanical design. The approach to date has been to consider overall machine design and leg mechanism design separately. In leg design there is inevitably a trade-off between workspace (reach) and leg weight for given loading conditions. To understand this trade-off, the effects of leg geometry on both kinematic workspace and leg weight must be investigated. Leg weight is largely a function of the hip and knee design torques; the former is determined by the overall machine design which has been discussed elsewhere. This paper considers the effect of leg geometry on the total <b>design</b> <b>torque</b> that the knee must support through both its structure and the knee actuator. The actuator <b>design</b> <b>torque</b> is also con-sidered. The leg geometry varied includes link lengths and knee twist angles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ferromagnetic {{shape memory}} alloy (FSMA) {{composites}} composed of a ferromagnetic material and a {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) are key material systems for fast-responsive and compact actuators. The function of ferromagnetic material is to induce magnetic force which is then used to induce the stress in the SMA, resulting in the stress-induced martensite transformation (SIM), i. e. change in the Young’s modulus, stiff (austenite) to soft (martensite). This SIM-induced phase change causes larger deformation in the SMA, which is often termed as ‘‘superelastic’’. This paper discusses a simple model by which the stress and strain field in the FSMA composites subjected to bending and torsion loading are computed {{with the aim of}} identifying the optimum geometry of FSMA composites. The results of the present analytical study are utilized to <b>design</b> <b>torque</b> actuator (bending of FSMA composite plate) and spring actuator (torsion of helical FSMA composite spring).

40|$|The Milner {{continuously}} variable transmission (MCVT) is a traction drive transmission based on rolling contacts analogous {{to those found in}} angular contact roller bearings.

A prototype magnetic coupling is used as a basis for demonstrating that the underlying torque transfer characteristic is significantly nonlinear when transmitted torque approaches the maximum <b>designed</b> pull-out <b>torque</b> of the device. It is shown that linear controllers for speed control proportional plus integral (PI) and position control proportional plus derivative (PD) result in acceptable performance provided the magnetic coupling operates below 80 % of <b>designed</b> pull-out <b>torque.</b> To fully compensate for the inherent nonlinearity of the torque transfer characteristic, feedback linearizing control laws and state transformations are derived resulting in exactly linear input-output characteristic for position and speed control of magnetically-geared drive-trains.
