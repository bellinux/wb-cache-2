[...] In the period of the war with Spain, between 1588 and 1604, there was {{an increase in the number}} of peoples arriving in England from Spanish colonial expeditions in parts of Africa. Many of these captives were freed from enslavement on Spanish ships. Their presence was largely a by-product of the slave trade. Slaver John Hawkins, for example, arrived with 300 captives from West Africa. 'Blackamoor' servants were seen as a fashionable novelty and popular in the homes of the wealthy. Among the captives was 'John Come-quick,a blackemore', servant to Capt Thomas Love. Others included in parish registers include Domingo [...] "a black neigro servaunt unto Sir William Winter, buried the xxviith daye of August 1587 and ‘Frauncis a Blackamoor servant to Thomas Parker’,  buried in January 1591. Most were employed as servants and entertainers to the wealthy. Some worked in ports, but were invariably described as chattel labour.The black population may have been several hundred. Racism intensified with the economic upward trajectory of the slave trade, which had become entrenched. Given the darker complexion of mulatto individuals, George Best argued in 1578 that black skin was not related to the heat of the sun but was instead caused by biblical damnation. Reginald Scot later associated black skin with witchcraft, describing (in his book Discoverie of Witchcraft) an unprepossessing devil in 1584 as having [...] "horns on his <b>head,</b> <b>fire</b> in his mouth, a tail, eyes like a bison, fangs like a dog, claws like a bear, a skin like a niger and a voice roaring like a lion". These views existed across British society, including among playwrights and royalty, and was exemplified by the fact that black slaves comprised some of the coach porters of King James VI of Scotland. In 1596, Queen Elizabeth I issued letters to the lord mayors of major cities asserting that [...] "of late divers blackmoores brought into this realm, of which kind of people there are already here to manie..." [...] Sir Thomas Sherley and Caspar Van Senden, a merchant of Lübeck, attempted to capitalise on this by petitioning Elizabeth I's Privy Council to allow them to transport slaves they had captured in Africa to Lisbon, presumably to sell them there. The relevant Privy Council Letters of July 1596 and a draft proclamation from the papers of Robert Cecil have been presented as an attempt to deport these captives from England. [...] However, Van Senden and Sherley's efforts were unsuccessful, as they themselves admitted in correspondence with Sir Robert Cecil.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} 3 D {{numerical}} simulations of two fires fronts (head and backfire) propagating simultaneously through a grassland fuel. The simulations {{were carried out}} using a "fully" physical and three-dimensional fire model (namely WFDS). One of the objectives of this work, was to evaluate the potential for fully physical fire model to simulate the interactions between two fire fronts (a <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> and a backfire), in conditions similar to those encountered during suppression fire operations. A set of numerical simulations was first carried out for standalone head fires propagating through grasslands on a flat terrain and for various wind conditions ranging between 1 and 10 m/s. These results were compared with experimental data and numerical results from the literature. The same calculations were then repeated, with a backfire ignited at the downwind side of the plot. The numerical results highlighted that, for these particular conditions, <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> and backfire can interact, mainly, via two mechanisms: - at relatively large distances (greater than 10 m) the <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> acts on backfire as a screen and reduces the direct action of the wind flow on the backfire, - at relative small distances (nearly equal to 10 m) the gas flow (entrainment) generated {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> promotes the aspiration of the backfire towards the main fire front...|$|E

Grazing significantly reduced the vegetation height, total fuel load, and dead and live fuel fractions whereas plots dominated by perennial grasses had higher values for vegetation height, total fuel load and the quantity of live fuel load. Although fire intensity remained insensitive (P> 0. 05) {{to any of these}} factors, fuel consumption was significantly (P = 0. 021) reduced by grazing, rate of spread was faster in <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> (P = 0. 012), and flame length was shorter in <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> than back fire (P = 0. 044).

30|$|While several {{different}} ignition patterns {{are used to}} affect fire behavior (Johansen 1987), these strategies remain largely unexplored in the fire and restoration literature. Our study suggests that fire ignition pattern influences fire severity and post-fire vegetation in Pacific Northwest prairies. Although average maximum surface temperature did not vary between the two ignition pattern treatments, a 10 -fold difference in residence time suggests that the duration of heating {{may be an important}} factor influencing vegetation response to ignition patterns. This reflects a fundamental difference between the behavior of head and backing fires: <b>head</b> <b>fires</b> spread rapidly among the tops of the grasses, spending less time on the surface, quickly influencing large acreages; backing fires have longer residence times, allowing more thorough combustion of plant material, typically over smaller areas (Keeley 2009). This pattern aligns well with our finding at Glacial Heritage that backing fires were more severe compared to <b>head</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{objectives}} {{of this paper was}} to simulate numerically the interaction between two line fires ignited in a grassland, on a flat terrain, perpendicularly to the wind direction, {{in such a way that}} the two fire fronts (a <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> and a backfire) propagated in opposite directions parallel to the wind. The numerical simulations were conducted in 3 D using the new fuel element module recently implemented in WFDS. We chose a grassland for the fuel layer, because it represents certainly one of the most studied ecosystem, in the frame of experimental campaigns to study the behaviour of surface fires at large scale. The aim of this numerical study is to understand what are the physical phenomena and the favorable conditions of ignition of a counter fire, during a fire suppression operation. The preliminary results highlighted that the two fire fronts interacted only at a relative short distance (10 - 20 m), following this scenario: • The thermal plume above the <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> (representing the main fire front) formed a sort of shelter, protecting the backfire to the direct effect of the wind flow • Before the merging between the two fire fronts, an in-draft flow was observed ahead of the <b>head</b> <b>fire,</b> promoting and accelerating the propagation of the backfire During the last step of the merging of the two fire fronts, a sudden increase of the heat release rate was observed, indicating a significant interaction between the two fires, which can potentially represent a safety problem for people in charge of this kind of operation...|$|E
30|$|Fire {{intensity}} is typically characterized by measures of fire temperature {{and rate of}} spread (RoS; Keeley 2009). In all five burn units, we measured maximum temperature reached at the soil surface using 10 sets of copper tags painted with 24 temperature sensitive paints (OmegaLaq, Stamford, Connecticut, USA), ranging from 79 ° C to 760 ° C, in increments of approximately 28 ° C. We placed tags in 10 randomly chosen quadrats within each burn. At Glacial Heritage and Tenalquot, half of these quadrats experienced a <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> and half experienced a backing fire (n = 5 per burn). At these two sites, we measured RoS by timing {{the spread of the}} flaming front over a 1 m distance at two to four different locations within each burn treatment (<b>head</b> <b>fire,</b> backing fire). Additionally, we visually estimated flame lengths at the same points at which RoS measurements were taken to help characterize the fire intensity. We collected these observational data solely for the purpose of characterizing the burns and therefore did not subject them to statistical analysis.|$|E

30|$|Fire intensities {{are also}} assumed to vary between {{riparian}} and upslope forests. As {{a consequence of}} topography and increased moisture input, riparian zones should retain moisture longer into the summer dry season. Moister conditions reduce flammability and subsequently reduce chances of fire ignition. Therefore, riparian zones should have a reduced flammability compared to corresponding upslope forests. Also, fire ignition location influences initial fire behavior within a stand. Lightning {{is one of the}} primary sources of forest fire ignitions in the Pacific Northwest. Topographically, the upper one-third of hill slopes experience more lightning strikes than the lower two-thirds. Slope position affects initial fire behavior since fires starting {{at the top of a}} slope are more likely to be dominated by backing and flanking fire behavior, while those starting at the bottom of the slope are more likely to be dominated by <b>heading</b> <b>fire</b> (Agee 1993; Pyne et al. 1996). <b>Heading</b> <b>fires</b> typically have a higher intensity and a higher rate of spread than backing fires. A common fire scenario is that a fire ignites from a lightning strike in the upper portion of a slope, burns to the ridge in a <b>heading</b> <b>fire</b> but does not necessarily back down the slope at the same rate or intensity, and then perhaps is extinguished once it reaches a zone of moister vegetation. Occasionally, the channeling effect of wind along headwater riparian areas can intensify fires within those areas (Agee 1994).|$|R
30|$|Ignition {{patterns}} {{could influence}} fire intensity, severity, and vegetation response to fire {{for a number}} of reasons. First, backing <b>fires</b> and <b>head</b> <b>fires</b> create fundamentally different types of <b>fire.</b> <b>Head</b> <b>fires</b> are flashy, wind-driven fires with short residence times, high rates of spread, and longer flame lengths. Backing fires are primarily fuel-driven fires, with long residence times, low rates of spread, and shorter flame lengths. These differences could have specific first- and second-order impacts on community response. In grasslands, fire intensity (as measured by maximum surface temperatures) and severity (as measured by organic matter removed) are likely to be higher in backing <b>fires</b> than in <b>head</b> <b>fires.</b> Variation in maximum temperatures and heating time {{as a result of the}} ignition pattern could have direct impacts on plant tissue death and indirect impacts on seed germination the following season. These impacts may differ based on plant life form and origin; perennials with buds less than 2 cm belowground are much more susceptible to direct fire impacts than annuals with a sufficient seed bank or long-lived woody species with insulating bark (Pyke et al. 2010). Additionally, fire-adapted native plant species may be more resistant to longer duration or higher temperature fires that are required to remove introduced species (DiTomaso et al. 2006), providing an opportunity to utilize certain ignition patterns for invasive control. For these reasons, managers may use different ignition patterns during a prescribed burn to influence fire behavior, severity, and community response (Kilgore and Curtis 1987, Van Wilgen et al. 2004).|$|R

30|$|In the prairies of the Pacific Northwest, USA, {{fire has}} been reintroduced {{as a tool}} for {{reducing}} non-native, invasive plant cover and promoting the growth and establishment of native plant communities. <b>Head</b> <b>fires</b> and backing fires are the two primary ignition patterns used to complete most prescribed burns, but the relative effectiveness of these two methods on invasive plant control and native enhancement is unknown. A clear understanding of the relationship between fire behavior, fire severity, and fire effects on vegetation and how these metrics are affected by fire ignition patterns could help managers fine tune burn prescriptions to better achieve ecological objectives. We used observations from five prescribed burns in the south Puget Sound prairies of western Washington, USA, to evaluate the relationship between intensity, severity, and effects. Additionally, we collected data from two burns on how ignition patterns affected these relationships. We found a significant positive correlation between maximum surface temperature and fire severity, and a decline in perennial taxa with increasing fire severity. We also found that surface temperatures did not differ between ignition patterns, but a greater area burned at moderate severity in backing <b>fires</b> than in <b>head</b> <b>fires.</b> Ignition patterns differentiated plant communities by changing the number of species present within different life form categories. However, this response was contingent upon site history and pre-burn conditions. Native perennial forbs were associated with <b>head</b> <b>fires</b> in a site with high pre-existing native plant species richness. Native and exotic forbs were associated with backing fires at a site with low pre-existing native plant species richness. Thus, managers may want to consider ignition patterns when planning burn prescriptions in order to achieve particular ecological objectives.|$|R
