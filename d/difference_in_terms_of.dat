25|$|There {{is little}} <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> safety and {{efficacy}} between medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol and surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration) in early first trimester abortions up to 9 weeks gestation. Medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or surgical abortion.|$|E
25|$|Enteroclysis {{has shown}} to be very {{accurate}} in diagnosing small bowel diseases, with a sensitivity of 93.1% and specificity of 96.9%. It permits detection of lesion {{which may not be}} seen with other imaging techniques. There is no significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> detection of clinically significant findings, sensitivity or specificity between enteroclysis and CT enterography. Enteroclysis compares favorably with wireless capsule endoscopy and double-balloon endoscopy in the diagnosis of mucosal abnormalities of the small bowel.|$|E

Isaiah's prophecy saw the Merkabah in the World of Beriah divine understanding, restraining his explanation by realising the inadequacy of description. Ezekiel saw the Merkabah in the lower World of Yetzirah divine emotions, causing him to describe the vision in rapturous detail.|$|E

25|$|Further, recent {{research}} has found that ketamine, a sedative, is capable of blocking referred pain. The study was conducted on patients suffering from fibromyalgia, a disease characterized by joint and muscle pain and fatigue. These patients were looked at specifically due to their increased sensitivity to nociceptive stimuli. Furthermore, referred pain appears in a different pattern in fibromyalgic patients than non-fibromyalgic patients. Often this difference manifests as a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the area that the referred pain is found (distal vs. proximal) as compared to the local pain. The area is also much more exaggerated owing to the increased sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{documentation}} of the history and necessity of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first code of conduct for research including medical ethics was the Nuremberg Code. This document had large ties to Nazi war crimes, as it was introduced in 1947, so it didn’t {{make much of a}} <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> regulating practice. This issue called for the creation of the Declaration. There are some stark differences between the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki, including the way it is written. Nuremberg was written in a very concise manner, with simple explanation. The Declaration of Helsinki is written with thorough explanation in mind and including many specific commentaries.|$|E
25|$|Although {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy has}} helped {{to improve the quality}} of life of people living with HIV, there is still a need to explore other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add interleukin 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that interleukin 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but does not make a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, there is probably an increase in side-effects with interleukin 2. The findings of this review do not support the use of interleukin 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.|$|E

Buemi was delighted with the race victory, praising his team for their work and hoped his recent form would continue into the season's following rounds. His team was concerned over his battery overheating; Buemi stated that he drove cautiously {{in the first few}} laps to know where he was and that he had the entire car package under control. Second-place finisher Vergne stated that he was [...] "very happy" [...] because of his team being recently new having had no prior testing of his car and all new personnel and equipment. He said he corrected the problems he had in the season's first two races and felt certain that he would place his focus into winning races: [...] "I think the whole team did a fantastic job, working really, really hard, sometimes many hours overnight and in the end it paid off." [...] Di Grassi, who finished in third, said {{that it was a good}} day for his team although he acknowledged that he was not on the same pace levels as the e.Dams-Renault cars.

2500|$|Shane O'Neill (Seán an Díomais) a {{legitimate}} son of Conn, employed the ambivalent status of Matthew's paternity to affirm his own {{claim to the}} title The O'Neill, although illegitimacy in itself made little or no <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the Irish legal system of derbfine, where five degrees of consanguinity through the male line with a blood ancestor who had held the O'Neill title were required of any claimant. [...] Once Matthew was accepted by Conn as his son, he was as entitled to the O'Neill lordship as Shane, although, if proven, Shane's constant assertion that Matthew was actually an adoptee, affiliated to the O'Neills, rather than the illegitimate issue of Conn would have rendered his claim to the earldom void and would have entirely disqualified him from succession also under derbfine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of Dying Light started in early 2012 by {{the core team}} of Techland, which developed Dead Island in 2011. Reports claimed that Dying Light was originally a Dead Island sequel, but members from Techland later confirmed that the game is [...] "an original title from its very beginning.", and that the team would like to create [...] "something bigger and better" [...] with no relation to any existing IP. Techland's director Adrian Ciszewski also responded {{that there is a}} great <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> creative vision between the studio and the Dead Island publisher Deep Silver and they considered themselves [...] "not in a very good business position" [...] with Dead Island. Therefore, Techland decided to split with publisher Deep Silver and start developing a new IP. Ciszewski also revealed that developing a new game can bring the team more freedom than developing Dead Island 2 and they are free to bring the elements originally planned for Dead Island, such as new types of enemies, combat, skills and day-night cycle which was not implemented due to limited team size and time, to a new project.|$|E
50|$|A formal {{language}} {{that can be}} described by a context-sensitive grammar, or, equivalently, by a noncontracting grammar or a linear bounded automaton, is called a context-sensitive language.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has investigated bilingual sentence processing. How to account for <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> native (L 1) and non-native (L 2) processing is controversial. Some explain L 1 /L 2 <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> different parsing mechanisms, and the hypothesis that L 2 learners adopt ‘shallow’ parsing has received considerable attention. Others assume L 1 /L 2 processing is similar, and explain L 1 /L 2 <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> capacity-based limitations being exceeded during L 2 processing. More generally, the role that working memory plays in language acquisition and processing has garnered increasing interest. Based on research investigating L 2 sentence processing, I claim that a primary source of L 1 /L 2 <b>differences</b> lies <b>in</b> the ability to retrieve information constructed during sentence processing from memory. In contrast to describing L 1 /L 2 <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> shallow parsing or capacity limitations, I argue that L 2 speakers are more susceptible to retrieval interference when successful comprehension requires access to information from memory...|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{we suggest}} dealing with <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the sample {{composition}} by correcting country scores for <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> age and schooling with a mathematical model.

We use data from IEA studies to illustrate how to adjust samples for age, grade, and test month differences. This data is particularly suited to illustrate corrections because the different studies employed various target population definitions. Thereby we can demonstrate how to correct for schooling and age differences and show to what extent such corrections affect comparisons.|$|R
