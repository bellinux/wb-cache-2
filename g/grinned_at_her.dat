6000|$|Out of {{the mist}} of strange faces, blurred hordes of people who swaggered up the office aisle so knowingly, and <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> when she asked questions, individualities began to take form: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have to {{get back}} to the Urals." [...] Sherikov <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> over his bushy black beard as he headed out of the room. [...] "Some very {{important}} business to attend to." ...|$|E
60|$|That cruel monster Finality <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{from across}} the room. Love was lying {{bleeding}} and fettered {{at the feet of}} some intangible, superhuman spectre which Dea Flavia dreaded because it was the Unknown.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sanders stopped {{counting}} {{his money}} {{long enough to}} <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|MURRAY (bluntly). No. (Then with a <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> shocked face.) I don't get them. They're {{something}} I can't {{seem to get}} acquainted with.|$|R
60|$|MURRAY (with a smile). I {{was hoping}} the darn thing would bust. (Miss Howard sniffs. Murray <b>grins</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> teasingly.) It {{keeps you from}} talking to me. That's the real music.|$|R
60|$|She knelt down, {{and with}} the candle in her right hand, pushed aside the lid with her left. From the box there <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> a human skull, {{surrounded}} by its bones. She started back.|$|E
6000|$|Marilla {{would have}} refused but Anne cut a generous second slice. However, she {{reminded}} Davy {{that he ought}} to say [...] "Thank you" [...] for it. Davy merely <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and took a huge bite. When he had finished the slice he said, ...|$|E
60|$|When she exerted the {{pressure}} {{she cried out}} with pain, for she had succeeded only in hurting herself. Billy <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> futility. She dug her thumbs into his neck in imitation of the Japanese death touch, then gazed ruefully at the bent ends of her nails. She punched him smartly {{on the point of}} the chin, and again cried out, this time to the bruise of her knuckles.|$|E
60|$|All this time, however, {{her fingers}} were half unconsciously busy with the knot; and {{happening}} to glance at the flower-wreathed face on {{the lid of the}} enchanted box, she seemed to perceive it slyly <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Unc' Billy Possum, who, by {{slipping}} {{up behind}} her and biting one of her heels, had made her let go of Peter, <b>grinned</b> down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from a safe place in a tree. Jimmy Skunk stood <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in the most provoking manner, and she couldn't do a thing about it, because she {{had no desire to}} have Jimmy use his little bag of perfume. So she talked herself out and then with many parting threats of what she would do, she started for home. Unc' Billy noticed that she limped a little with the foot he had nipped so hard, and he couldn't help feeling just a little bit sorry for her.|$|R
60|$|But she sat transfixed. There they lay--the soft-featured Nee-Koo; the gnarled old face of Gnob; Makamuk, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with his}} lifted upper lip; and lastly, Nossabok, his eyelid, {{up to its}} old trick, drooped on his girlish cheek in a suggestive wink. There they lay, the firelight {{flashing}} upon and playing over them, and from each of them a widening circle dyed the snow to scarlet.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she began}} looking about, {{and noticed that}} what could {{be seen from the}} old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as {{different}} as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{was so far}} {{successful}} that she soon found herself tête-à-tête with the doctor in his own study. She was no whit dismayed by the pair of human thigh-bones which lay close to his hand, and which, {{when he was talking}} in that den of his own, he was in the constant habit of handling with much energy; nor was she frightened out of her propriety even by the little child's skull which <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from off the chimney-piece.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{from the}} {{doorstep}} while Mrs. Meldrum's maid stood there to admit me. [...] "Oh I'm so glad," [...] I said, {{looking at her}} as she paced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering the day when, while she rejoined Lord Iffield, I had indulged in the same observation. Her air of assurance was on this occasion not less than it had been on that; but I recalled that she had then struck me as marching off to her doom. Was she really now marching away from it? ...|$|E
5000|$|Alice (Tina Majorino) - A {{kind and}} curious {{young girl who}} is very nervous about {{performing}} the song Cherry Ripe <b>at</b> <b>her</b> parents' party {{in the beginning of}} the film. After her adventures in Wonderland, she finally gets the confidence to sing. However, she sings the Lobster Quadrille (a song that the Mock Turtle taught her) instead. Everyone loves her performance and she even spots the Cheshire Cat in the audience who <b>grins</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in a term of congratulations.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{she heard a}} hoarse laugh <b>at</b> <b>her</b> side, and turned {{to see what was}} the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen, there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. 'Here I am!' cried a voice from the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, {{just in time to see}} the Queen's broad good-natured face <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> for a moment over the edge of the tureen, before she {{disappeared}} into the soup.|$|R
60|$|One Sunday {{morning in}} late autumn, they walked and talked in the shady garden of Lincoln's Inn. Greek {{they thought it}} was they had been talking; as a matter of fact, a much older language. A young {{gardener}} was watering flowers, and as they passed him he grinned. It was not an offensive grin, rather a sympathetic grin; but Miss Appleyard didn't like being <b>grinned</b> <b>at.</b> What was there to <b>grin</b> <b>at?</b> <b>Her</b> personal appearance? some gaucherie in her dress? Impossible. No lady in all St. Dunstan was ever more precise. She glanced <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion: a clean-looking, well-groomed, well-dressed youth. Suddenly it occurred to Miss Appleyard that she and Grindley junior were holding each other's hand. Miss Appleyard was justly indignant.|$|R
6000|$|He {{put his arm}} {{about her}} waist; it was a large, strong, {{sophisticated}} arm, and very agreeable; he <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with a devastating knowingness, while Kennicott glowed inanely. She flushed; she was alarmed by {{the ease with which}} the big-city man invaded her guarded personality. She was glad, in retreat, to scamper ahead of the two men up-stairs to the hall-room in which Hugh slept. All the way Kennicott muttered, [...] "Well, well, say, gee whittakers but it's good to have you back, certainly is good to see you!" ...|$|E
60|$|That is {{all that}} she {{contrived}} to say. This final disappointment had been beyond the endurance of her nerves. Physically now she completely broke down, a mist gathered before her eyes, the candles seemed to flicker more and more weirdly until their lights assumed strange ghoul-like shapes which drew nearer to her and nearer; faces in the gloom <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and seemed to mock, {{the walls of the}} room closed in around her, her senses reeled, her very brain felt as if it throbbed with pain, and without a cry or moan, only with one long sigh of infinite weariness, she sank lifeless to the ground.|$|E
60|$|Truly it was {{an awful}} {{place in which to}} dwell. There above them towered the great white crucifix; there in the corner were piled the remains of the Portuguese. A skull with long hair still hanging to it <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> a {{withered}} hand was thrust forward as though to clutch her. Oh, no wonder that in such a spot Jacob Meyer had seen ghosts! In front, too, was the yawning grave where they had found the monk; indeed, his bones wrapped in dark robes still lay within, for Jacob had tumbled them back again. Then beyond and all around deep, dark, and utter silence.|$|E
6000|$|NICOLA (<b>grinning</b> amorously <b>at</b> <b>her).</b> I've {{been trying}} all the {{afternoon}} {{to get a}} minute alone with you, my girl. (His countenance changes as he notices her arm.) Why, what fashion is that of wearing your sleeve, child? ...|$|R
60|$|Now on {{the edge}} of the Green Forest was a warm, sunny knoll, which, as you know, is a sort of little hill. It {{overlooked}} the Green Meadows and was quite the most pleasant and comfortable place for a sun-nap that ever was. At least, that is what Old Granny Fox thought. She took sun-naps there very often. It was her favorite resting place. When Bowser the Hound had found her trail and had chased her until she was tired of running and had had quite all the exercise she needed or wanted, she would play one of her clever tricks by which to make Bowser lose her trail. Then she would hurry straight to that knoll to rest and <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own smartness.|$|R
6000|$|No! {{there the}} lips were, {{as they had}} been from the beginning, closed upon each other in that stony self-collected calm, which was only not a sneer. The wonder, if it was one, had passed: and now--did her eyes play her false, or were the snakes round that Medusa's head upon the shield all writhing, <b>grinning,</b> glaring <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with stony eyes, longing to stiffen her with terror into their own likeness? ...|$|R
6000|$|The old Countess of Chacabacque {{had made}} a score of vain {{attempts}} to see her hapless daughter. Ever, when she came, the porters <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> savagely through the grating of the portcullis of the vast embattled gate of the Castle of Barbazure, and rudely bade her begone. [...] "The Lady of Barbazure sees nobody but her confessor, and keeps her chamber," [...] was the invariable reply of the dogged functionaries to the entreaties of the agonized mother. And at length, so furious was he at her perpetual calls at his gate, that the angry Lord of Barbazure himself, who chanced {{to be at the}} postern, armed a cross-bow, and let fly an arblast at the crupper of the lady's palfrey, whereon she fled finally, screaming, and in terror. [...] "I will aim at the rider next time!" [...] howled the ferocious baron, [...] "and not at the horse!" [...] And those who knew his savage nature and his unrivalled skill as a bowman, knew that he would neither break his knightly promise nor miss his aim.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand <b>grins</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|R
60|$|As {{she entered}} the door it seemed certain the grizzled frontiersman {{sitting on the bench}} outside had <b>grinned</b> knowingly <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and winked as if to say he would keep her secret. Mrs. Wentz, the fur-trader's wife, was seated by the open window which faced the fort; she was a large woman, strong of feature, and with that calm placidity of {{expression}} common to people who have lived long in sparsely populated districts. Nell glanced furtively <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and thought she detected the shadow of a smile in the gray eyes.|$|R
60|$|When the {{struggling}} bug had pulled the wire rope taut, {{she opened the}} throttle. The rope trembled. Her car seemed to draw sullenly back. Then it came out--out--really out, {{which is the most}} joyous sensation any motorist shall ever know. In excitement over actually moving again, as fast as any healthy young snail, she drove on, on, the young man ahead <b>grinning</b> back <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Nor did she stop, nor he, till both cars were safe on merely thick mud, {{a quarter of a mile}} away.|$|R
500|$|At the Palmer home, Leland {{smiles at}} himself in the mirror. BOB stares back at him from the {{reflection}} and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a burning smell and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, [...] "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!" [...] as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words [...] "Missoula, Montana" [...] in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter [...] "O" [...] under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger.|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Forcing a laugh.] Gee, Mat, you ain't {{agreeing with}} him, are you? [She comes forward {{and puts her}} arm about his shoulder--with a {{determined}} gaiety.] Aw say, what's the matter? Cut out the gloom. We're all fixed now, ain't we, me and you? [Pours out more beer into his glass and fills one for herself--slaps him on the back.] Come on! Here's to the sea, no matter what! Be a game sport and drink to that! Come on! [She gulps down her glass. Burke banishes his superstitious premonitions with a defiant jerk of his head, <b>grins</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and drinks to her toast.] ...|$|R
60|$|Opposite, a cross-looking {{old woman}} clamours for sausages, gets them, and seems crosser than ever. She scowls round on everyone, with a {{malignant}} expression {{that is quite}} terrifying. A small dog comes and sits {{down in front of}} <b>her,</b> and <b>grins</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Still, with the same savage expression of hatred towards all living things, she feeds him with sausage {{at the end of a}} fork, regarding him all the while with an aspect of such concentrated dislike, that one wonders it does not interfere with his digestion. In a corner, a stout old woman talks incessantly to a solemn-looking man, who sits silent and drinks steadily. It is evident that he can stand her conversation just so long as he has a mug of beer in front of him. He has brought her in here to give her a treat. He will let her have her talk out while he drinks. Heavens! how she does talk! She talks without movement, without expression; her voice never varies, it flows on, and on, and on, like a great resistless river. Four young artisans come clamping along in their hob-nailed boots, and seating themselves at one of the rude wooden tables, call for beer. With their arms round the waist of the utterly indifferent Fraulein, they shout and laugh and sing. Nearly all the young folks here are laughing--looking forward to life. All the old folks are talking, remembering it.|$|R
60|$|And before William {{could see}} {{any way of}} detaining him--or would it be better to detain Katharine?--he had taken his hat, stick, and was holding {{the door open for}} Katharine to pass out. The most that William could do was to stand {{at the head of the}} stairs and say good-night. He could not offer to go with them. He could not insist that she should stay. He watched her descend, rather slowly, owing to the dusk of the staircase, and he had a last sight of Denham's head and of Katharine's head near together, against the panels, when {{suddenly}} a pang of acute jealousy overcame him, and had he not remained conscious of the slippers upon his feet, he would have run after them or cried out. As it was he could not move from the spot. At the turn of the staircase Katharine turned to look back, trusting to this last glance to seal their compact of good friendship. Instead of returning her silent greeting, William <b>grinned</b> back <b>at</b> <b>her</b> a cold stare of sarcasm or of rage.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{men were}} then {{only half a}} mile behind, and running at full speed. They soon came up to where the dogs were holding <b>her</b> <b>at</b> bay. The fight was now a desperate one. The mother never went more than two yards ahead, {{constantly}} looking at the cub. When the dogs came near her, she would sit upon her haunches, and take the little one between her hind-legs, fighting the dogs with her paws, and roaring {{so that she could}} have been heard a mile off. Never was an animal more distressed. She would stretch her neck and snap at the nearest dog with her shining teeth, whirling her paws like the arms of a windmill. If she missed her aim, not daring to pursue one dog lest the others should harm the cub, she would give a great roar of baffled rage, and go on pawing and snapping, and facing the ring, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> them with <b>her</b> mouth stretched wide.|$|R
60|$|How can {{we speak}} with decent {{patience}} {{of a man}} who seriously thought that he should conciliate the conservative and theological elements of the society at his feet, by such an odious opera-piece as the Feast of the Supreme Being? This was designed as a triumphant ripost to the Feast of Reason, which Chaumette and his friends had celebrated in the winter. The energumens of the Goddess of Reason had now been some weeks in their bloody graves; by this time, if they had given the wrong answer to the supreme enigma, their eyes would perhaps be opened. Robespierre persuaded the Convention to decree an official recognition of the Supreme Being, and to attend a commemorative festival in honour of their mystic patron. He contrived to be chosen president for the decade in which the festival would fall. When the day came (20th Prairial, June 8, 1794), he clothed himself with more than even his usual care. As he looked out from the windows of the Tuileries upon the jubilant crowd in the gardens, he was intoxicated with enthusiasm. 'O Nature,' he cried, 'how sublime thy power, how full of delight! How tyrants must grow pale at the idea of such a festival as this!' In pontifical pride he walked {{at the head of the}} procession, with flowers and wheat-ears in his hand, to the sound of chants and symphonies and choruses of maidens. On the first of the great basins in the gardens, David, the artist, had devised an allegorical structure for which an inauspicious doom was prepared. Atheism, a statue of life size, was throned in the midst of an amiable group of human Vices, with Madness by her side, and Wisdom menacing them with lofty wrath. Great are the perils of symbolism. Robespierre applied a torch to Atheism, but alas, the wind was hostile, or else Atheism and Madness were damp. They obstinately resisted the torch, and it was hapless Wisdom who took fire. Her face, all blackened by smoke, grinned a hideous ghastly <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sturdy rivals. The miscarriage of the allegory was an evil omen, and men probably thought how much better the churchmen always managed their conjurings and the art of spectacle. There was a great car drawn by milk-white oxen; in the front were ranged sheaves of golden grain, while at the back shepherds and shepherdesses posed with scenic graces. The whole mummery was pagan. It was a bringing back of Cerealia and Thesmophoria to earth. It stands as the most disgusting and contemptible anachronism in history.|$|R
60|$|In this ballad {{the reader}} will find traces of a {{singular}} superstition, not yet altogether discredited in the wilder parts of Scotland. The lykewake, or watching a dead body, in itself a melancholy office, is rendered, {{in the idea of}} the assistants, more dismally awful, by the mysterious horrors of superstition. In the interval betwixt death and interment, the disembodied spirit is supposed to hover around its mortal habitation, and, if invoked by certain rites, retains the power of communicating, through its organs, the cause of its dissolution. Such enquiries, however are always dangerous, and never to be resorted to unless the deceased is suspected to have suffered foul play, as it is called. It is the more unsafe to tamper with this charm, in an unauthorized manner; because the inhabitants of the infernal regions are, at such periods, peculiarly active. One of the most potent ceremonies in the charm, for causing the dead body to speak, is, setting the door ajar, or half open. On this account, the peasants of Scotland sedulously avoid leaving the door ajar, while a corpse lies in the house. The door must either be left wide open, or quite shut; but the first is always preferred, on account of the exercise of hospitality usual on such occasions. The attendants must be likewise careful never to leave the corpse for a moment alone, or, if it is left alone, to avoid, with a degree of superstitious horror, the first sight of it. The following story, which is frequently related by the peasants of Scotland, will illustrate the imaginary danger of leaving the door ajar. In former times, a man and his wife lived in a solitary cottage, on one of the extensive border fells. One day, the husband died suddenly; and his wife, who was equally afraid of staying alone by the corpse, or leaving the dead body by itself, repeatedly went to the door, and looked anxiously over the lonely moor, for the sight of some person approaching. In her confusion and alarm, she accidentally left the door ajar, when the corpse suddenly started up, and sat in the bed, frowning and <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> frightfully. She sat alone, crying bitterly, unable to avoid the fascination of the dead man's eye, and too much terrified to break the sullen silence, till a catholic priest, passing over the wild, entered the cottage. He first set the door quite open, then put his little finger in his mouth, and said the paternoster backwards; when the horrid look of the corpse relaxed, it fell back on the bed, and behaved itself as a dead man ought to do.|$|R
