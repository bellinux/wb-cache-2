One way of enhancing protein expression is by optimising the codon usage of pathogenic mRNAs for eukaryotic cells.

40|$|The {{strategies}} for developing rotavirus (RV) vaccines {{have always been}} controversial. At present, both the monovalent RV vaccine and the multivalent RV vaccine have displayed excellent safety and efficacy against RV infection and shown cross-reactive immunity, which laid the question whether the multivalent RV vaccine could {{be replaced by the}} monovalent RV vaccine. In this study, we focused on comparing the immunogenicity (serum neutralization activity and protection against homotypic and heterotypic RVs' challenge) of individual standard RV strains (monovalent RV <b>immunogens)</b> and different combinations of them (multivalent RV <b>immunogens).</b> In result, RV <b>immunogens</b> showed general immunogenicity and heterotypic reaction but the multivalent RV <b>immunogens</b> exhibited greater serum neutralization activity and stronger heterotypic reaction than the monovalent RV <b>immunogens</b> (P< 0. 05). As to the protection, the multivalent RV <b>immunogens</b> also revealed more rapid and stronger protection against homotypic and heterotypic RVs' challenge than the monovalent RV <b>immunogens.</b> The results demonstrated that both the monovalent and multivalent RV <b>immunogens</b> exhibited high immunogenicity, but the monovalent RV <b>immunogens</b> could not provide enough neutralization antibodies to protect MA 104 cells against the infection with heterotypic RV strains and timely protection against homotypic and heterotypic RVs, so the multivalent RV vaccine could not be replaced by the monovalent RV vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Current vaccine {{efforts to}} elicit {{cross-reactive}} neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) focus on the engineering of soluble mimetics of the trimeric HIV Env glycoprotein (commonly termed gp 140 <b>immunogens).</b> Such <b>immunogens</b> {{are thought to be}} more effective than previously tested monomeric gp 120 <b>immunogens</b> at eliciting cross-reactive NAbs. Still, the breadth of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by gp 140 <b>immunogens</b> is narrow. Understanding why antibodies elicited by gp 140 <b>immunogens</b> fail to neutralize a wide range of heterologous primary HIV isolates is necessary for improving the design of such <b>immunogens.</b> We previously reported that antibodies elicited in macaques by SF 162 Env-derived gp 140 <b>immunogens</b> fail to neutralize several heterologous “neutralization-resistant” primary HIV type 1 isolates, such as JRFL, ADA, and YU 2. Here we show that by replacing the V 1 region of Env on these heterologous viruses with that of SF 162, we render them highly susceptible to neutralization by the SF 162 gp 140 -elicited antibodies. We observed that viral neutralization was mediated not only by vaccine-elicited anti-V 1 but also by anti-V 3 antibodies and antibodies directed against as yet unidentified Env regions, depending on the heterologous Env background. Our study indicates that common neutralization epitopes are differentially exposed on diverse primary HIV isolates and that the V 1 loop contributes to this differential exposure. Therefore, the antibody responses elicited by soluble gp 140 <b>immunogens</b> will have to overcome several distinct obstacles in order to neutralize diverse primary HIV isolates...|$|R
40|$|The V 1 V 2 {{region of}} HIV- 1 gp 120 harbors a major {{vulnerable}} site targeted {{by a group}} of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) such as PG 9 through strand-strand recognition. However, this epitope region is structurally polymorphic as it can also form a helical conformation recognized by RV 144 vaccine-induced MAb CH 58. This structural polymorphism is a potential mechanism for masking the V 1 V 2 vulnerable site. Designing <b>immunogens</b> that can induce conformation-specific antibody (Ab) responses may lead to vaccines targeting this vulnerable site. We designed a panel of <b>immunogens</b> engrafting the V 1 V 2 domain into trimeric and pentameric scaffolds in structurally constrained conformations. We also fused V 1 V 2 to an Fc fragment to mimic the unconstrained V 1 V 2 conformation. We tested these V 1 V 2 -scaffold proteins for immunogenicity in rabbits and assessed the responses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and competition assays. Our V 1 V 2 <b>immunogens</b> induced distinct conformation-specific Ab responses. Abs induced by structurally unconstrained <b>immunogens</b> reacted preferentially with unconstrained V 1 V 2 antigens, suggesting recognition of the helical configuration, while Abs induced by the structurally constrained <b>immunogens</b> reacted preferentially with constrained V 1 V 2 antigens, suggesting recognition of the beta-strand conformation. The Ab responses induced by the structurally constrained <b>immunogens</b> were more broadly reactive and had higher titers than those induced by the structurally unconstrained <b>immunogens.</b> Our results demonstrate that <b>immunogens</b> presenting the different structural conformations of the gp 120 V 1 V 2 vulnerable site can be designed and that these <b>immunogens</b> induce distinct Ab responses with epitope conformation specificity. Therefore, these structurally constrained V 1 V 2 <b>immunogens</b> are vaccine prototypes targeting the V 1 V 2 domain of the HIV- 1 envelope. IMPORTANCE: The correlates analysis of the RV 144 HIV- 1 vaccine trial suggested that the presence of antibodies to the V 1 V 2 region of HIV- 1 gp 120 was responsible for the modest protection observed in the trial. In addition, V 1 V 2 harbors one of the key vulnerable sites of HIV- 1 Env recognized by a family of broadly neutralizing MAbs such as PG 9. Thus, V 1 V 2 is a key target for vaccine development. However, this vulnerable site is structurally polymorphic, and designing <b>immunogens</b> that present different conformations is crucial for targeting this site. We show here that such <b>immunogens</b> can be designed and that they induced conformation-specific antibody responses in rabbits.
