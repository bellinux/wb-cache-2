25|$|Clemens, your lecture was {{magnificent}}. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never in {{my entire}} life have <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin– the unpardonable sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and <b>I</b> <b>listened,</b> still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E

25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
500|$|When it {{was time}} to sup, the dance ceased, and six and thirty persons sat down to two tables in the same room.

500|$|Wilberforce {{used his}} {{speaking}} voice to great effect in political speeches; the diarist and author James Boswell witnessed Wilberforce's eloquence in the House of Commons and noted, [...] "I saw {{what seemed a}} mere shrimp mount upon the table; but as <b>I</b> <b>listened,</b> he grew, and grew, until the shrimp became a whale." [...] during the frequent government changes of 1781–1784, Wilberforce supported his friend Pitt in parliamentary debates.|$|E

500|$|R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck {{wrote the}} main riff and chorus {{to the song}} on a {{mandolin}} while watching television one day. Buck had just bought the instrument and was attempting {{to learn how to}} play it, recording the music as he practiced. Buck said that [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> back to it the next day, there was a bunch of stuff that was really just me learning how to play mandolin, and then there's what became 'Losing My Religion', and then a whole bunch more of me learning to play the mandolin." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to his audition, Rockwell [...] "immersed" [...] {{himself in}} the role by {{watching}} episodes of The Gong Show {{in an attempt to}} impress the filmmakers. [...] "I went to LA [...] did an old-fashioned screen test, like a real Scarlett O'Hara-type screen test, which you know they don't really do anymore," [...] the actor remembered. For research, Rockwell spent {{two and a half months}} with Barris. [...] "We went to coffee shops and dinner and movies, took walks, went to the zoo; I even filmed him," [...] Rockwell explained. [...] "I had him tape my lines in a tape recorder, and <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to that to get his voice down." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{immediately}} started {{to search for}} a replacement vocalist and found Howard Jones of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones disliked the band's sound when he first heard it. He commented, [...] "I was like, 'Meh.' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch sounded so clean. But the more <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to it, I realized there's some really good songs here". After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest.|$|E

500|$|Kanille told Rimsky-Korsakov to {{continue}} coming to him every Sunday, not for formal lessons but to play duets and discuss music. In November 1861, Kanille introduced the 18-year-old Nikolai to Mily Balakirev. Balakirev in turn {{introduced him to}} César Cui and Modest Mussorgsky; all three were known as composers, despite only being in their 20s. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote, [...] "With what delight <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to real business discussions [...] of instrumentation, part writing, etc! And besides, how much talking there was about current musical matters! All at once I had been plunged into a new world, unknown to me, formerly only heard of in the society of my dilettante friends. That was truly a strong impression." ...|$|E
500|$|The Experience began {{recording}} [...] "Purple Haze" [...] on January 11, 1967, at De Lane Lea Studios in London. According to drummer Mitch Mitchell, he and bassist Noel Redding {{learned the}} song in the studio: [...] "Hendrix came in and kind of hummed us the riff and showed Noel the chords and the changes. <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to it and we went, 'OK, let's do it.' We got it on the third take as I recall." [...] The basic track was recorded in four hours, according to Chandler. [...] Multitrack recording technology allowed engineers to record and complete additional parts on the final master.

[...] Bieber explained on his Twitter that [...] his fans [...] "took him from a small town in Canada" [...] to the [...] "amazing opportunity" [...] he is living now, and feels [...] "grateful for everything" [...] and [...] "blessed" [...] for the support. Bieber confirmed he co-wrote the track with August Rigo. He also told his fans to enjoy it as they are the ones who give him his strength in this.|$|E
500|$|Jon Landau, {{also from}} Rolling Stone, was {{disappointed}} by the singer's effort, writing that she [...] "no longer sings songs", but rather [...] "acts them out". He referenced her catalogue and stated: [...] "I've enjoyed Barbra Streisand's music in the past, but of the 20 albums <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to to write this column, The Way We Were {{was not only the}} most disappointing, but the most difficult to get all the way through." [...] AllMusic's William Ruhlmann awarded the album three out of five stars but found it obvious that the record was [...] "thrown together" [...] instead of being orchestrated and thought out carefully. He also declared that the success of the title track [...] "propelled th album {{to the top of the}} charts".|$|E
500|$|The Chariot is {{frequently}} called a Christian band, which Scogin agreed {{with in a}} 2005 interview: [...] "We are Christians in a band therefore we are a Christian band.

[...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't. It wasn't like, 'Oh, they don't believe the same thing I do,' [...] People care {{too much about the}} fashion of it all. To me, a band's either good or they ain't, and that's the only thing that should matter." ...|$|E
