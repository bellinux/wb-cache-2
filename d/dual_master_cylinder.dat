2500|$|In 1968 Oldsmobile {{continued}} to produce five well appointed 98 body styles. Standard equipment included: <b>dual</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> four way flasher, energy-absorbing steering column, back-up lights, side marker lights, seat belts, cross-flow radiator, rear armrest ashtrays, power brakes, electric clock, special moldings, shoulder belts, Deluxe steering wheel, power steering, carpeted trunk and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl or leather. Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14inches. Engine displacement was increased to the Rocket [...] V8 with 365 horsepower. Ninety-Eight production was in Lansing.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 models {{received}} a facelift. Large wraparound taillamps {{went into a}} new rear end with standard backup lights. [...] "What you'll see inside," [...] claimed the sales brochure for the 1967 Chevelle, [...] "will probably bring on a severe compulsion to go driving." [...] Front disc brakes were available on all models, and a new <b>dual</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> brake system incorporated a warning light. [...] Chevrolet also added 14" [...] wheels and a three speed automatic transmission to their line of transmissions. New safety equipment became standard, including a collapsible steering column. The SS396 continued as its own series with both sport coupe and convertible body styles. The 375-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 was dropped from the options list {{until late in the}} model year and returned with 612 being sold. Seven transmissions were available: two manual three-speeds, two manual four-speeds, an overdrive three-speed, and two automatics. The manual-shift feature of the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was featured. Options included Superlift air shock absorbers, Strato-ease headrests, and special instrumentation.|$|E
2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were also {{introduced}} in 1965. The brakes had a four-piston design with two-piece calipers and cooling fins for the rotors. Pads were in frequent {{contact with the}} rotors, but the resulting drag was negligible and did not affect fuel economy. Further, the light touching kept the rotors clean and did not diminish pad life, which was, in fact, quite high: a projected [...] for the front brakes and about twice that distance for the rear binders. Total swept area for the new system was , a notable advance on the [...] of the previous all-drum system. Per pending federal regulation, {{there was also a}} <b>dual</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> with separate fluid reservoirs (only on models with power brakes for 1965) for the front and rear lines. Road testers rightly applauded the all-disc brakes. Testers found that repeated stops from [...] produced no deterioration in braking efficiency, and even the most sudden stops were rock-stable. The drum brakes remained available, however, as a $64.50 credit option, but only 316 of the 23,562 Corvettes built that year came with drums. A side exhaust system appeared as an option as did a telescopic steering wheel. Also available were alloy spinner rims, at US$322 a set.|$|E
50|$|Braking is {{achieved}} by a disc brake mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have <b>dual</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinders,</b> one for the front {{and one for the}} rear and are adjustable to allow for front/ rear bias changes.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear-wheel drive}} Type 175, 178 and 180 chassis is {{considerably}} {{more sophisticated than}} its 135 predecessor, the front suspension being independent with pivoting horizontal cylinders that contained a powerful coil-spring and hydraulic shock absorber in an oil-bath Dubonnet. The rear was by de Dion, with semi-elliptical springs. Brakes were hydraulic type made by Lockheed. The brake-drums were deeply finned cast-iron, actuated by <b>dual</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> with a balance-bar drums all around.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} used a four-link drive, coil springs, electronic height control network, and hydraulic Direct Action shock absorbers. The 1978 Fleetwood Brougham rode {{on a long}} 121.5” wheelbase and had the luxury length of 221.2”. It was 76.4” wide. Four-wheel self-adjusting disc brakes with a <b>dual</b> hydraulic <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> facilitating independent front and rear operation were standard.|$|R
5000|$|On car #2211 (July 1975), {{a switch}} {{was added to}} the <b>dual</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> along with a small PC board behind the dash to warn of {{problems}} with brake hydraulics, as well as indicating if the parking brake is engaged. Before #2211, the brake lamp was a parking brake engaged indicator only.|$|E
5000|$|Popular Science {{magazine}} reported, [...] "you {{can have}} a 1965 Classic as a penny-pinching economy car or a storming performance job." [...] Additional performance options for 1965 included power front disk brakes with four-piston calipers that were supplied by Bendix. The standard 4-wheel drum brakes also continued to feature AMC's [...] "Double-Safety" [...] master cylinder system. The <b>dual</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> was available in only one [...] "Big Three" [...] car: Cadillac.|$|E
50|$|In a four-wheel car, the FMVSS Standard 105, 1976; {{requires}} that the master cylinder be divided internally into two sections, each of which pressurizes a separate hydraulic circuit. Each section supplies pressure to one circuit. The combination {{is known as a}} <b>dual</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Passenger vehicles typically have either a front/rear split brake system or a diagonal split brake system (the master cylinder in a motorcycle or scooter may only pressurize a single unit, which will be the front brake).|$|E
25|$|For 1967 all Fords {{featured}} a large, padded hub {{in the center}} of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing steering column (introduced late into the 1967 model year), padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the <b>dual</b> brake <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).|$|R
2500|$|In 1967, the Corvair {{line was}} trimmed to the 500 and Monza Hardtop Coupes and Hardtop Sedans, and the Monza Convertible. This model {{year was the}} first with a {{collapsible}} steering column. A <b>dual</b> circuit <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> with warning light, nylon reinforced brake hoses, stronger steel (instead of aluminum) door hinges, [...] "mushroomed" [...] instrument panel knobs and a vinyl-edged day/night mirror were all made standard equipment. Bucket seats in Monza models were now of the same [...] "Astro" [...] style as those on the new-for-1967 Camaro, featuring a new-thin-shell design. [...] Chevrolet introduced a [...] engine warranty on all Chevrolet models including the Corvair. Chevrolet was still actively marketing the Corvair in 1967, including color print ads and an [...] "I Love My Corvair" [...] bumper sticker campaign by dealers, but production and sales continued to fall off drastically. Only 27,253 copies were built.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{available}} engine was AMC's 327 CID L OHV V8, {{in either the}} regular fuel, 2-barrel carburetor and 8.7:1 compression ratio, [...] version or the premium gasoline, 4-barrel version with 9.7:1 compression ratio, [...] version. The 1962 Ambassador came with a <b>dual</b> chamber <b>master</b> brake <b>cylinder</b> that separated {{the front and rear}} brakes so that in the event of the failure of one chamber some braking function would remain. This design was offered by only a few cars at that time. The 1962 models were equipped with [...] "Walker" [...] (brand) flow-through mufflers. The 108 in wheelbase 1962 Ambassador was lighter than its 117 in wheelbase predecessors and when equipped with the [...] 327 CID L V8, it was a spirited performer.|$|R

5000|$|... 1967 {{begins the}} [...] "Second Generation" [...] ChevyVan {{with a whole}} new look to the van and {{offering}} a longer 108" [...] wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time. GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield. 1967 was the only early 2nd generation {{that did not have}} side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional V8 Chevrolet Small-Block engine. Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase 90 in or the new optional long wheelbase 108 in with 5 on 4&3/4" [...] lug bolt pattern. Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van. The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern. The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.For 1967, the 140 hp (100 kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155 hp (116 kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175 hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, V8. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a <b>dual</b> reservoir <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If {{bleeding}} brakes {{because of}} <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> replacement the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is usually [...] "bench bled" [...] before installation. Typically by securing {{it on the}} bench, filling it with fluid, connecting fittings and hoses to route fluid from the outlet ports on the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> back to its reservoir, and repeatedly depressing the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> plunger until bubbles are no longer seen coming from the hoses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Master {{cylinder}} is {{a component}} of hydraulic braking system {{and it is just}} a simple piston inside a <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is the key element of braking system which initiates and controls the braking action. A reservoir is attached to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> to store brake fluid. A <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> having a reservoir and a cylinder formed from a single piece of molded material. The objective of the present work is to minimize the weight to increase mileage in case of general road cars and to increase the speed of the vehicle in case of sports cars. Saving grams at different parts in a car helps us in saving some kilograms {{at the end of the}} design. The plastics have good elastic properties and are strong enough to use for <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The use of plastics in the manufacturing of <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> reduces the weight of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is modeled in PRO-E and the analysis is carried using ANSYS work bench. The automobile components like <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> can be easily modeled in PRO-E and can be easily analyzed using ANSYS...|$|R
50|$|The {{diameter}} {{and length of}} the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> has {{a significant effect on}} the performance of the brake system. A larger diameter <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> delivers more hydraulic fluid to the caliper pistons, yet requires more brake pedal force and less brake pedal stroke to achieve a given deceleration. A smaller diameter <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> has the opposite effect.|$|R
50|$|As piston(s) {{move along}} the bore of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> this {{movement}} is transferred through the hydraulic fluid, {{to result in}} a movement of the slave cylinder(s). The hydraulic pressure created by moving a piston (inside the bore of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder)</b> toward the slave cylinder(s) compresses the fluid evenly, but by varying the comparative surface-area of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and/or each slave cylinder, one can vary the amount of force and displacement applied to each slave cylinder, relative to the amount of force and displacement applied to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{execute the}} {{functioning}} and biasing of force acting on two <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> using single brake pedal a mechanical system, i. e., balance bar is used {{which is designed}} to divide the force applied by the driver on the brake pedal to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Moreover in <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> pushrod’s movement is critical for proper functioning of <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> So to achieve linear motion correct position and orientation of brake pedal and pushrod mounting is required. After motion analysis and practical examination it is shown how to decide the mounting’s of pushrod...|$|R
50|$|The <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{is located}} behind the driver’s side {{dashboard}} {{mounted on the}} vacuum booster. The pressure inside of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is created by a primary and secondary piston. These are pushed by the output rod of the vacuum booster to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated through the brake lines to the brake calipers. When the brake fluid is pushed through the brake lines, the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> chambers are replenished by the reservoir (attached {{to the top of}} the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder).</b>|$|R
50|$|Different {{vehicles}} {{have different}} bleeding patterns. Brakes are usually bled {{starting with the}} wheel that is furthest from the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and working towards the wheel closest to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 1.6 DOHC {{versions}} were {{equipped with}} 256mm front brake rotors and 22mm <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{rather than the}} 236mm disks and 20mm <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> found on the other versions with the less power engines.|$|R

50|$|Roberts searched {{and found}} a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, which was {{perfectly}} suited for the Testarossa body pieces. The Pantera was rigidly modified to withstand the duties of filming. It was raised 1.5 inches for additional ground clearance, 2.5 inch wall-thick square tubing was used to prevent potential roof buckling and added a reinforcing railing {{that doubles as a}} skid plate, an auxiliary braking system designed to assist drivers in controlled spins, the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> was repositioned in the brake line to enable it to feed the rear wheels enabling the driver to lock the aft end on command, and the auxiliary <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> utilizes the original <b>master</b> <b>cylinder's</b> reservoir and is installed in series with the outlet of the original <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> port leading to the rear wheels. When the stock brake is applied, fluid passes freely through the stunt <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> inlet port and compensating port and out the exhaust port to the rear wheels. When the stunt brake is applied, the piston in the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> blocks off the compensating port to the exhaust port and pressurizes the rear brake system, cutting off the original brake <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> besides the compensating port in the stunt brake. BF Goodrich TA's were added for enhanced stick, as were Tilton brake calipers. The improved traction required installation of a hydraulic in-line brake power booster lifted from a Volvo P-1800. It operates on engine vacuum to aid in breaking loose the pavement-hugging TA's. To further enhance the growl of the vehicle, Robert's team installed a NOS port-injected nitrous system, which was later replaced with a plate-type configuration. He also replaced the carburetor replacing the stock with a Predator which reduces fuel lag. A Modine all-aluminum four-core radiator was used to guard against Miami's hot weather, and liquid Auto-Meter gauges to monitor the temperature.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic brakes {{transfer}} {{energy to}} stop an object, normally a rotating axle. In {{a very simple}} brake system, with just two cylinders and a disc brake, the cylinders could be connected via tubes, with a piston inside the cylinders. The cylinders and tubes are filled with incompressible oil. The two cylinders have the same volume, but different diameters, and thus different cross-section areas. The cylinder that the operator uses is called the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The spinning disc brake will be adjacent to the piston with the larger cross-section. Suppose {{the diameter of the}} <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is half the diameter of the slave <b>cylinder,</b> so the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> has a cross-section four times smaller. Now, if the piston in the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is pushed down 40 mm, the slave piston will move 10 mm. If 10 newtons (N) of force are applied to the master piston, the slave piston will press with a force of 40 N.|$|R
