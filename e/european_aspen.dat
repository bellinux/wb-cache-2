40|$|Background : An {{increased}} {{understanding of}} leaf area development {{is important in}} a number of fields: in food and non-food crops, for example short rotation forestry as a biofuels feedstock, leaf area is intricately linked to biomass productivity; in paleontology leaf shape characteristics are used to reconstruct paleoclimate history. Such fields require measurement of large collections of leaves, with resulting conclusions being highly influenced by the accuracy of the phenotypic measurement process. Results : We have developed LAMINA (Leaf shApe deterMINAtion), a new tool for the automated analysis of images of leaves. LAMINA has been designed to provide classical indicators of leaf shape (blade dimensions) and size (area), which are typically required for correlation analysis to biomass productivity, as well as measures that indicate asymmetry in leaf shape, leaf serration traits, and measures of herbivory damage (missing leaf area). In order to allow Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to be performed, the location of a chosen number of equally spaced boundary coordinates can optionally be returned. Conclusion : We demonstrate the use of the software on a set of 500 scanned images, each containing multiple leaves, collected from a common garden experiment containing 116 clones of Populus tremula (<b>European</b> trembling <b>aspen)</b> that are being used for association mapping, as well as examples of leaves from other species.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Forest {{cultures}} in continental part of Croatia are mainly based on bracken-covered areas and moors on deserted agriculture soils and pastures. Successful afforestation i. e. establishment of forest cultures depends {{among other things}} on the understanding of habitats and ecology of forest trees. The choice of best species of forest trees for afforestation needs {{to be based on}} the research in soil and climate characteristics of target habitats. The aims of this research were to show mesoclimatic characteristics of Ličko sredogorje and microclimatic and pedological characteristics of Ličko polje. Also, based on habitat characteristics and ecology of forest trees, the aim was to determine species of forest trees suitable for afforestation of bracken-covered areas. Materials and Methods: Climate, microclimate, pedological and plant nutrition researches were done at the area of Lika highlands. Climate analysis was done according to air temperatures, amount of precipitation, relative air humidity and other climate elements and appearances. Composite soil samples were taken from the depth of 0 - 30 cm in order to determine plant nutrition potential. Samples were prepared for further analysis in the laboratory. Results: The highest average annual air temperature of 9. 6 °C was found at weather station Gračac and the lowest at Korenica station (8. 1 °C). Average amount of precipitation for this region was around 1500 mm. Monthly rain factors were ranging from arid to perhumid. Considering thermal character of the climate, the area has moderately warm climate. Average volumetric soil humidity is 14. 2 %. Soil has strong acid reaction, is very humus, good to richly supplied with total nitrogen, content of physiologically active phosphorus and potassium is low, and C/N ration normal.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the main}} {{aim was to}} study the usability of aspen wood in the mechanical wood processes, especially the factors that affect the usability of aspen wood, which is dried at different temperature levels. The problematic of varying temperatures from level to another seem to have significant effects on distortions. According to the studies conducted, many practical solutions for drying of aspen timber can be made. <b>European</b> <b>aspen</b> sawn timber should be dried in relatively narrow widths, short lengths, edged and sawn pith free. The results achieved give an interesting view for the distortions of aspen wood between HT drying and heat treatment. The most significant result is that cupping seems to decrease when increasing temperature level from HT drying to heat treatment phase. The difference is significant. Other very obvious result is that bow and crook are increasing between these two temperature levels, bow significantly. Also the modelling gives a good background for this result since cupping is reduced by higher temperatures. It can also be assumed that these distortions can be affected for example by sorting out the timber used to different moisture levels before drying. This {{could be a very}} simple solution for practical purposes. From practical point of view, it was also noted during the drying tests performed that the discoloration seem to be no problem for aspen boards dried in temperatures under 150 °C. Altogether, this dissertation covers many interesting points of view of factors affecting distortions of wood in different temperature stages. Aspen as species in use of mechanical wood industries seems to be a species suitable for component production. According to the results, the best yield from aspen timber can be achieved in industry that can utilize relatively short components of sawn wood.

30|$|Our {{study was}} {{performed}} {{in an area where}} moose (Alces alces), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), fallow deer (Cervus dama), and red deer (Cervus elaphus) co-occur. Moose and roe deer are known to browse extensively whereas red deer and fallow deer are mixed feeders, but fallow deer are known to fall closer to the grazer end of the spectrum (Hofmann 1989). In general, these ungulate species tend to overlap in their use of resources (Latham 1999; Mysterud 2000). During our study period (winter), with an abundance of snow, the animals only available food was browse and supplementary fodder provided by the landowners. In our cafeteria test, we mimicked stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), <b>European</b> <b>aspen</b> (Populus tremula) and goat willow (Salix caprea) to test the foraging preferences of these forest ungulates.

30|$|The problem {{related to}} the {{assessment}} of aspen at stand-level inventories is that the low density of the aspen trees results in high estimates of sampling errors. It {{is also possible that}} aspens are not separated from other economically less-important deciduous species in tree stock descriptions for forest management. In validation studies of the inventories by compartments, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) obtained for the total growing stock volume have ranged from 15 %[*]−[*] 38 % (Poso 1983; Haara and Korhonen 2004). However, species-specific errors are considerably higher, being 29 %, 43 % and 65 % for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L.), and the group consisting of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and downy birch (B. pubescens Ehrh), respectively (Haara and Korhonen 2004).
