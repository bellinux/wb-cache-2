He felt himself pulled up sharp by unrecognised grievances. He had been physically cowed, but his injured dignity remained indomitable, and nothing could heal his lacerated feelings. Here was land already--home very soon--a bad pay-day--no clothes--more hard work. How offensive all this was. Land. The land that draws away life from sick sailors. That nigger there had money--clothes--easy times; and would not <b>die.</b> <b>Land</b> draws life away.... He felt tempted {{to go and see}} whether it did. Perhaps already.. It would be a bit of luck. There was money in the beggar's chest. He stepped briskly out of the shadows into the moonlight, and, instantly, his craving, hungry face from sallow became livid. He opened the door of the cabin and had a shock. Sure enough, Jimmy was dead! He moved no more than a recumbent figure with clasped hands, carved on the lid of a stone coffin. Donkin glared with avidity. Then Jimmy, without stirring, blinked his eyelids, and Donkin had another shock. Those eyes were rather startling. He shut the door behind his back with gentle care, looking intently the while at James Wait as though he had come in there at a great risk to tell some secret of startling im-portance. Jimmy did not move but glanced languidly out of the corners of his eyes.--"Calm?" [...] he asked.--"Yuss," [...] said Donkin, very disappointed, {{and sat down on the}} box.|$|E

5000|$|The writer Hennie Aucamp had an {{enormous}} influence on Strydom's development as a cabaret singer, and she still acknowledges him as her mentor. Merwede van der Merwe was another teacher. With the help of these men she sang in such social commentaries as Die Lewe is 'n Grenshotel (Life is a Hotel on the Border), a work whose title alludes to the South African Border War in Angola. This time in Strydom's career proved instrumental in shaping her own voice as one of dissent from the over-riding moral and political opinions of Afrikaners of that time. In her own words: [...] "Daar was 'n oorlog in Angola, en ons het daaroor gesing, gespot, gepraat; nie net daaroor nie, oor sensuur, oor die liefde. Ons is in ons stockings en sykouse en fishnets en shorts. In Afrikaans het ons oor daai verhoog gespring en oor dit wat dekadent en die lewe is 'n pad begin baan vir wat mense vandag in <b>die</b> <b>land</b> kabaret noem". (There was a war in Angola, and we sang about it, mocked it, and talked about it; not only about that, but about censorship, and love. We were in our stockings and fishnets and shorts. In Afrikaans we jumped on that stage and {{laid the foundation for}} what people today call cabaret in this country.) However, her disillusionment with cabaret followed later when television directors and producers were asking her and others to sing translated American songs from musicals like Ebb and Kander's Cabaret. Singing these American songs in forced translation irritated Strydom so much that she decided to go her own way as a solo performer again, so that she could once again sing songs in their intended vernacular.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{rheological}} {{and flow}} behaviour of ceramic pastes with varying solids loadings (solids volume fraction) has been studied. The pastes {{were shown to}} exhibit power law slip flow at both low and high solids loadings, with no slip yield stress. As would be expected, the extrusion rheometry data showed {{an increase in the}} die entry extrusion pressures with solids loading, in a trend {{similar to that of the}} Dougherty–Krieger equation. The <b>die</b> <b>land</b> flow however was shown to exhibit, only within a narrow range of solids loadings of approximately 53 to 56 v/v %, a trend in the <b>die</b> <b>land</b> extrusion pressure that was relatively independent of solids loading. Outside of this range the <b>die</b> <b>land</b> extrusion pressures increased significantly with solids loading in a trend similar to that of the die entry pressures. Using the Mooney analysis method, this was shown to be due to the development of slip flow with solids loading, as is consistent with other studies into the flow behaviour of concentrated suspensions. The slip velocity was also shown to be related to the wall shear stress by way of power law relationship also consistent with results from previous studies of concentrated suspensions using shear thinning liquid phases. The results presented in this report show that by using paste formulations that lie within said range of solids loadings, improved plug flow can be achieved in the <b>die</b> <b>land</b> without a significant change in the <b>die</b> <b>land</b> extrusion pressure at a given flow rate. This offers an advantage in the co-extrusion of ceramic products such as micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells, as a uniform velocity profile results in improved control of the laminate structure...|$|E
40|$|Two low density {{polyethylene}} melts are studied using a coextrusion flow visualisation cell. The cell design enabled two melt streams to {{be observed}} at the confluent region and into the <b>die</b> <b>land</b> to the die exit. The melt streams converge at an angle of 30 ° and flow into a common <b>die</b> <b>land</b> of 1. 0 mm height. The relative stream velocities, hence layer thickness ratio, of the two streams was varied using a restriction plate {{in one of the}} streams. Stress and velocity fields are quantified using stress birefringence and particle image velocimetry techniques. Numerical simulation is conducted using flow history dependent viscoelastic stress calculation based on a modified Leonov model and Flow 2000 ™(tm) software. Simulated stress fields are compared to those experimentally. The simulated stress magnitudes were in good agreement with those determined experimentally. The simulation predicted a high local extensional stress in the minor flow stream just upstream of the entry to the <b>die</b> <b>land.</b> This local stress was also observed in the stress birefringence pattern. Extrudate instability was noted even when the stress field (birefringent pattern) in the convergent region {{and the beginning of the}} <b>die</b> <b>land</b> was stable. However, disturbances were noted in the birefringence and velocity fields near the exit of the <b>die</b> <b>land</b> when the major stream - minor stream layer thickness ratio was greater than 1. 5 : 1. Surface distortion appeared on the surface of the extrudate on the side of the minor flow stream when process conditions promoted instability.

40|$|Co-extrusion {{involves}} simultaneous extrusion {{of multiple}} layers {{and can be}} used to produce functionally graded materials whose layers have different properties. Rheological control is vital for successful co-extrusion. During extrusion, flow in the barrel and <b>die</b> <b>land</b> in a ram extruder should be plug-like, while the paste should be sheared and uniformly elongated in the die entry region. In the barrel of the extruder, the paste flow velocity field was inferred by direct observation of the paste left in the barrel, and evidence for plug flow in the barrel was seen only at low-extrudate velocities. In the <b>die</b> <b>land,</b> the Benbow nonlinear model was employed to assess the paste flow behavior, and plug flow was achieved only when the shear stress applied to the paste by the <b>die</b> <b>land</b> wall was smaller than its yield stress. For co-extrusion, a simple method using thin-walled tubes was found to be effective to prepare layered feedrods.

40|$|Abstract. Samples of AZ 31 wrought {{magnesium}} alloy are hot extruded into forward direction with various initial billet temperatures and extrusion ratios (ERs). Usually the insufficient room temperature formability of magnesium wrought alloys makes processing steps like rolling, extrusion etc. difficult, thus limiting their use for rolled or wrought parts. However, {{in this paper}} experiment is preformed under the hot forward extrusion process for AZ 31 wrought {{magnesium alloy}} with different important parameters. Major process parameters such as punch speed, billet temperatures and ERs are considered and applied to the hot extrusion process with a constant value of the <b>die</b> <b>land.</b> The influence of different billet temperatures and ERs on the hot forward extrusion process is investigated and analyzed {{in terms of the}} grain flow, microstructure, grain size and hardness distribution of formed part for magnesium and Mg alloy. Maximum forming loads for various main parameters is tackled and checked to know the optimum forming load for hot forward extrusion process. Also finest grain sizes and an inhomogeneous microstructure of extruded parts seem to occur near the <b>die</b> <b>land</b> of tool-set due to the anisotropic plastic behavior during the hot extrusion process. Extrusion properties such as extrusion load, grain size, micro hardness and surface quality are compared between the main parameters during the hot forward extrusion process.
