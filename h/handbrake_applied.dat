50|$|The {{footbrake}} operated mechanically on {{the drive}} shaft while a cable operated <b>handbrake</b> <b>applied</b> stopping power to the rear wheels. The wheelbase on these early cars was 2255 mm.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{electrical}} generator (a large dynamo) for the motor permanently {{connected to the}} petrol engine, the early petrol electric controls available were a sprung return throttle pedal (with a hand operated variable latching throttle to set and adjust the idle speed), a brake pedal, a means of steering (wheel, etc) and two usually column mounted levers. One centre off lever operated a three position changeover switch to permit running in either direction, and the other lever operated a wiper across a bank of large high current wire wound resistances which affected the motor and dynamo fields, to give {{the electrical}} effect of gearing. It was (is, {{the author of this}} section has maintained and driven a 1914 TS3 model for over fifteen years as of 2015) very important to set the minimum possible idle speed, or when engaging the direction switch excess load on the system and possible unwanted movement will occur. The resistance [...] "gear" [...] lever is then set to max torque, and then the direction lever set to (say) forward. On releasing the handbrake and pressing the throttle pedal a little the vehicle will glide away smoothly. Giving more throttle and gradually altering the resistance lever will then produce higher speed, with none of the jerking and pauses in acceleration of a gearbox. To stop, the throttle pedal is released, the resistance lever is brought back to [...] "slow speed", the brake applied and as rest is achieved the forward/reverse lever moved to neutral and <b>handbrake</b> <b>applied.</b> There is however NO engine braking available as from a mechanical drive changed into a lower gear, so the system relies totally on the mechanical wheel brakes, which on early chassis applied to the rear axle only.|$|E
5000|$|Parking: Unlike an {{automatic}} car, the P gear is absent in a MMT car. The car should be {{parked in the}} following fashion. In an up-sloping incline, put the gear to M1, or E, <b>apply</b> <b>handbrake,</b> and switch off the engine. In a down-sloping incline, put the gear to R, <b>apply</b> <b>handbrake,</b> and switch off the engine. On level ground, put the gear to R, <b>apply</b> <b>handbrake,</b> and switch off the engine. R or E/M1 substitute the P function in a full automatic.|$|R
50|$|On July 8, Transport Canada {{investigated}} {{a second}} MMA train reported by police as unattended since July 5 on the Vachon Station siding near Frontenac. That train had been parked on a slope with only five handbrakes set, {{and did not}} comply with federal regulations. At least nine brakes should have be used to secure the train on level track, with additional <b>handbrakes</b> <b>applied</b> when on an incline. A local resident had posted online video of an unattended locomotive with a cabin door ajar and an engine left running.|$|R
5000|$|The {{handbrake}} {{cannot be}} used to induce over-steer for maneuvering purposes, as the drivetrain couples {{the front and rear}} axles together. To overcome this limitation, some custom prepared stage rally cars have a special mechanism added to the transmission to disconnect the rear drive if the <b>handbrake</b> is <b>applied</b> while the car is moving.|$|R
50|$|The {{detached}} {{portion of}} no 62 consisted of 12 vehicles, and its length 331 {{feet with a}} weight of 264 tons. <b>Handbrakes</b> were <b>applied</b> to these vehicles. It {{would appear that the}} train staff in the possession of the engine crew was returned to the instrument in the signal box at this time, and all vehicles were {{within the confines of the}} home signals.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>handbrake</b> is <b>applied</b> the (otherwise fixed) end of {{the spring}} is moved forward by a cam which {{releases}} the clutch and the car may stop without affecting the engine. Application of the footbrake has the same effect. This arrangement was deleted from the next model now the driver has control of the throttles and engine braking {{may be used to}} reduce the load on the brakes.|$|R
50|$|One {{peculiarity}} of the R16, {{and later}} Renault 5, design {{is that the}} two back wheel axle shafts are not in-line. The left wheelbase is 70 mm (2.76 in) longer than the right wheelbase, to accommodate the torsion bar suspension. This and the soft front seats gives the car a particularly smooth ride even over big bumps. The suspension has the longest travel on a car of this size; if the <b>handbrake</b> is <b>applied</b> and reverse gear engaged, the rear bumper will raise about one foot.|$|R
50|$|The {{ignition}} key controls the normal expected functions of accessories, ignition circuit and starting. When the {{ignition key}} is momentarily {{moved to the}} start position the main traction battery relay is energised (causing a clunk) which allows the accelerator to move the vehicle as normal. The function of the ignition switch is slightly different from regular cars as only the stop light and the handbrake light (if the <b>handbrake</b> is <b>applied)</b> are displayed. On other cars all the indicator lights are shown to check bulb condition.|$|R
5000|$|Moving {{off from}} an incline: A MMT car rolls {{backwards}} when on an up-sloping incline, unlike an automatic car. To move off from an up-sloping incline, <b>apply</b> <b>handbrake</b> before depressing the accelerator slightly. Do not hold {{the car on}} an incline by depressing the accelerator pedal, as the slipping clutch will overheat and lead to clutch damage.|$|R
25|$|On 1 June 2005 it was {{announced}} that an inquest into the crash would be held at the Guildhall in Windsor, Berkshire. The inquest was expected to last 12 days, starting on 17 October 2005. A delay ensued over whether {{the families of the victims}} should be granted legal aid. The inquest finally began in October 2007. A policeman who had witnessed the crash, PC Brazier, testified at the inquest. He told the jury that he believed the crash was caused by a suicide attempt. The Forensic Accident Investigator, David Price, told the inquest that he had been able to determine that the car had been parked on the level crossing with its engine switched off, the <b>handbrake</b> fully <b>applied,</b> the vehicle's lights switched off, the steering on a partial left-hand turn (which was not consistent with driving across the crossing), and that its fuel tank still contained at least 8 litres (about 2 gallons) of petrol.|$|R
40|$|An {{opportunity}} {{has been}} identified to improve safety and production by revising the Rio Tinto Rail Division’s rules and procedures regarding the application of handrakes. Both anecdotal information and data from past work conducted indicate that handbrakes on trains are being applied according to procedure {{when it is not}} necessary, as the other train braking systems can be relied upon to secure a stationary train on a range of gradients. The process of <b>applying</b> <b>handbrakes</b> is time consuming, and exposes Rio Tinto personnel to associated safety hazards. Engineering calculations that were performed estimate a reduction in both the number of occasions handbrakes need to be applied, and the number of handbrakes that are required for application. These estimates were verified successfully through field trial work, and as a result, changes to operating rules and procedures can be implemented. This will both reduce the Rio Tinto personnel’s exposure to potential safety hazards relating to handbrake application, as well as reducing delays in the transportation of iron ore from mine to port...|$|R
