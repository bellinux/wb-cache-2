Purple Tentacle arrives, hijacks a Chron-o-John and takes it to the previous day {{to prevent them from}} turning off the sludge machine; he is pursued by Green Tentacle in another pod.Laverne: Uh-oh!Green Tentacle: Don't worry guys! This time I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> stop him!}} With only one Chron-o-John pod left, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne use it to pursue the tentacles to the previous day, while Dr. Fred uselessly tries to warn them of using the pod together, referencing the film The Fly. Upon arriving, the trio exit the pod only to discover that they have been turned into a three-headed monster, their bodies merging into one during the transfer. Meanwhile, Purple Tentacle has used the time machine to bring countless versions of himself from different moments in time to the same day to prevent the Sludge-o-Matic from being deactivated. Bernard and his friends defeat the Purple Tentacles guarding the Sludge-o-Matic, turn off the machine and prevent the whole series of events from ever happening. Returning to the present, Dr. Fred discovers that the three have not been turned into a monster at all but have just gotten stuck in the same set of clothes; they are then ordered by Dr. Fred to get out of his house. The game ends with the credits rolling over a tentacle-shaped American flag, one of the more significant results of their tampering in history.|$|E

Eventually, Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Peña were cast; both auditioned early and {{neither of them had}} starred in a feature film before. Robbins said the film presented for him [...] "a great opportunity to go in a different direction. I love doing comedy, but I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do other things as well." [...] The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain Dale Dye, who provided a five-day boot camp military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle and Ving Rhames).|$|E
500|$|Tracy's health {{declined}} {{significantly in}} the 1960s, and Hepburn took a five-year break in her career to care for him. She moved into Tracy's house for this period, and was {{with him when he}} died on June 10, 1967. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral. It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, [...] "I honestly don't <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only say that I could never have left him."

500|$|From a {{very young}} age Mozart had, {{according}} to opera analyst David Cairns, [...] "an extraordinary capacity [...] for seizing on and assimilating whatever in a newly encountered style (was) most useful to him". In a letter to his father, dated 7 February 1778, Mozart wrote, [...] "As you <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> more or less adopt or imitate any kind and style of composition". He used this gift to break new ground, becoming simultaneously [...] "assimilator, perfector and innovator". Thus, his early works follow the traditional forms of the Italian opera seria and opera buffa as well as the German Singspiel. In his maturity, according to music writer Nicholas Kenyon, he [...] "enhanced all of these forms with the richness of his innovation", and, in Don Giovanni, he achieved a synthesis of the two Italian styles, including a seria character in Donna Anna, buffa characters in Leporello and Zerlina, and a mixed seria-buffa character in Donna Elvira.|$|E

500|$|On March 4, 2008, Favre {{formally}} {{announced his}} retirement. Although Favre {{stated that he}} had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he was not up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, {{had nothing to do with}} what the Packers did or didn't do. Seeming to contradict statements made by his agent, Bus Cook, Favre said that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he did not want to play anymore. He said during the conference, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what it comes down to." ...|$|E
500|$|The theme music, [...] "Whatever It Takes", was {{composed}} by Jim McGrath, with lyrics written by Jody Colero and Stephen Stohn. The song include lines such as, [...] "Whatever it takes, I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make it through/Be the best, the best I can be", to convey what Colero calls, [...] "a sense {{of joy and}} optimism." [...] Lisa Dalbello performed the lyrics with a children's choir over an 1980s pop music style tune {{during the first three}} seasons. Dave Ogilvie and Anthony Valcic of Canadian industrial-pop group Jakalope reworked and performed the song with a heavier sound, reflecting the growing maturity of the characters in season four. For seasons six and seven, the theme—still performed by Jakalope—was remixed and stripped of vocals. A fourth version of the theme song, with lyrics sung by Damhnait Doyle, was introduced for the eighth season, and a fifth version of the theme, performed by the in-show band [...] "" [...] is used for the ninth and tenth seasons. For seasons eleven and twelve, a sixth version of the theme song is used, performed by Alexz Johnson. Seasons thirteen and fourteen featured a truncated version of the Alexz Johnson theme.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} {{mostly at}} Blakeslee Recording Company; Additional sessions {{took place at}} Harmonie Park Studios in Detroit and The Music Shed Studios in New Orleans. While recording, he immersed himself in a composite character of classic soul singers from videos he watched, including Al Green, Gladys Knight & the Pips, the Four Tops, and the Temptations. He recorded his vocals with only Brungardt present in the studio, a preference he felt prevented him from [...] "looking for answers from somebody who may not really know". Saadiq said he tended to [...] "record complete takes, and if something isn't quite right but it's got a feel that I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never ever capture again, I'll leave it, even if it's flat. I mean, there are flat parts on my record, because it's not about perfection, it's about the soul." [...] He recorded background vocals for all songs. Saadiq played most of the instruments, including drums, guitar, piano, sitar, and bass guitar, his instrument of choice throughout his career. He viewed the bass playing of James Jamerson {{as an integral part}} of Motown recordings, citing it as the inspiration for his own bass sound on the album.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by {{this early}} success, Kubrick {{quit his job}} at Look and visited {{professional}} filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about {{the technical aspects of}} film-making. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker {{because of the number of}} bad films he had seen, remarking, [...] "I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, but I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make a better film than that". He began making Flying Padre (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called [...] "Sky Pilot", a pun on the slang term for a priest. [...] During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in Flying Padre are later echoed in [...] (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925) and Ivan the Terrible (1944/1958).|$|E
500|$|Vlasic {{spent the}} 1989 {{off-season}} recovering form his injury, while the Chargers added another quarterback to the roster upon drafting Billy Joe Tolliver. After {{working out with}} the team during the preseason, he started the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list. With the Chargers having a reliable starter in Jim McMahon, who had been signed to the team, Vlasic was kept on the list for the season. In 1990, McMahon was released and John Friesz was drafted out of the University of Idaho, leaving Vlasic to compete with Friesz and David Archer for the backup quarterback job. As the preseason began for the 1990 San Diego Chargers season, the team released Archer, and the plan was for Friesz to split backup quarterback duties during the preseason. After an impressive preseason by Vlasic and only a pedestrian one by Tolliver, Chargers coach Dan Henning named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys in the season opener, citing that he was [...] "steadier" [...] than Tolliver. After losing the game 1714, the switch was made back to Tolliver as the starting quarterback, and was eventually named starter {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this, Vlasic remained optimistic, saying, [...] "I feel confident in my ability, and I always have. I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get the job done whatever the situation. I have to believe that." [...] Over the course of the 1990 season, Vlasic played in six games, completing 19 of 40 passes for 168 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 46.7.|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E
