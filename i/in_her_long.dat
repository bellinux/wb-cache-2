She appealed again and again to her husband, who obstinately refused to remit the tolls. At last, weary of her entreaties, he said he would grant her request if she would strip naked and ride through the streets of the town.

25|$|Gutta likes playing {{aggressive}} badminton {{and has a}} great {{affinity for}} the front court, with her skilled netplay, good anticipation {{and the ability to}} play deceptive strokes at the net. She is considered very dangerous in the front court with her good reading of the game and sharp interceptions. She also has a strong smash from the back court and often makes use of deceptive drops. Gutta is vulnerable in a few areas of her game, most evidently in her movement across the court. She can commit certain unforced errors when forced to move out of her favoured positions. She has also had some fitness issues and injury troubles <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> career. Gutta is also known for being one of the only top doubles player to still use the forehand service, since most other doubles specialists opt for the safer backhand serve. She stands unique in this aspect.|$|E
25|$|A decade earlier, the {{illustrator}} Charles Edmund Brock {{extended into}} the 20th century what {{is almost a}} pastiche of the 18th century conversation piece in his “Circe and the Sirens” (1925). In this the Honourable Edith Chaplin (1878–1959), Marchioness of Londonderry, and her three youngest daughters are pictured in a garden setting grouped about a large pet goat. Three women painters also produced portraits using the convention of the sitter in character. The earliest was Beatrice Offor (1864–1920), whose sitter's part in her 1911 painting of Circe {{is suggested by the}} vine-leaf crown <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> dark hair, the snake-twined goblet she carries and the snake bracelet on her left arm. Mary Cecil Allen was of Australian origin but was living in the United States at the time “Miss Audrey Stevenson as Circe” was painted (1930). Though only a head and shoulders sketch, its colouring and execution suggest the sitter’s lively personality. Rosemary Valodon (born 1947), from the same country, painted a series of Australian personalities in her goddess series. “Margarita Georgiadis as Circe” (1991) is a triptych, the central panel of which portrays an updated, naked femme fatale reclining in tropical vegetation next to a pig’s head.|$|E

500|$|Pompeo {{garnered}} widespread acclaim {{from television}} critics for her {{performance in the}} episode; Rick Porter of Zap2it was largely laudatory of Pompeo's performance which he thought [...] "made {{all the difference in}} the episode". He wrote highly of her role in the arc saying, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episod". He noted that although it might not be the [...] "ideal Emmy-submission episode" [...] for Pompeo, because of the amount of time that she spent on screen, it was among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today thought of the episode as [...] "a showcase for Pompeo", agreeing that although she didn't play a prominent part until the later half of the episode, but some memorable and well-played scenes: [...] "from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life."

[...] USA Today also lauded Pompeo saying, [...] " [...] In some ways, the episode (How to Save a Life) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo.

500|$|The title {{character}} of Grey's Anatomy, Meredith, has received both overwhelmingly positive and weary feedback by critics along {{the course of}} the show, with the development of the character garnering praise from majority critics.

[...] When Pompeo did not receive a nomination 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, for her work as Meredith, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times suggested that Pompeo, [...] "has worked very hard [...] to make Meredith Grey an interesting character", and should have received a nomination. IGN Monfette, less impressed by the character, criticized her storyline as [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Robert Rorke of the New York Post was critical of Meredith's relationship with Derek Shepherd, writing: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless 'McDreamy' soliloquies." [...] The development of the character has received praise from critics. Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman.
