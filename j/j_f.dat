5|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} thirty-seven stones {{remaining}} in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring, with the stones perhaps having been removed for use as road metal. In 1915 {{it was reported that}} one of the previously recorded stones had been removed but that three additional stones had been found in the circle. By 1988, Martin <b>J.</b> <b>F.</b> Fowler reported that there were only twenty-nine stones in the circle. Conversely, the following year Burl reported thirty stones, of which three had fallen and twenty-seven remained standing. Originally it may have included around a hundred stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 6 inches) apart.|$|E

He placed the species in the genus Scyllium (a synonym of Scyliorhinus) and gave it the specific epithet , because the type specimens were reportedly collected off the Natal coast of South Africa (though there is suspicion that they were mislabelled and actually came from Algoa Bay). Later authors reassigned this species to the genus Halaelurus. The lined catshark (Halaelurus lineatus) was once treated as conspecific to the tiger catshark, until it {{was described as a}} separate species in 1975.|$|E

5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have been recovered in the store rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have been recovered at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by <b>J.</b> <b>F.</b> Schofield, who claims that a {{decline in the number of}} beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects a decline in their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Rowell {{passed the}} staff college {{examination}} {{for one of}} the two Australian spots. Qualifying in first place gave him a choice between the Staff College, Camberley and its counterpart at Quetta, and Rowell chose the former, attending from 1925 to 1926. At this time, the commandant was Major General Edmund Ironside; the staff included Colonel <b>J.</b> <b>F.</b> C. Fuller and Lieutenant Colonels Alan Brooke and Bernard Montgomery. Fellow students included Captains Frank Messervy and Francis Tuker. From 1935 to 1937, Rowell was on exchange to the British Army as a staff officer with the 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division. He then attended the Imperial Defence College. The class was a distinguished one, including two Victoria Cross winners, Group Captain Frank McNamara from Australia and Lieutenant Colonel George Pearkes from Canada; other students included Lieutenant Colonel William Slim and Wing Commander Keith Park. For his staff work, Rowell was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came {{to believe}} that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the {{relationship}} between the two broke down. On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden to entertain his recuperating wife. He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Among its first publications were Crowley's Collected Works, edited by Ivor Back. His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was <b>J.</b> <b>F.</b> C. Fuller, a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, The Star in the West (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.|$|E

5|$|The {{triumph in}} Caseros was a pivotal {{military}} victory for Brazil. The independence of Paraguay and Uruguay was secured, and the planned Argentine invasion of Rio Grande do Sul was blocked. In {{a period of}} three years, the Empire of Brazil had destroyed any possibility of reconstituting a state encompassing the territories of old Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, a goal cherished by many in Argentina since independence. Brazil's army and fleet had accomplished what Great Britain and France, the great powers of that time, had not achieved through interventions by their powerful navies. This represented a watershed for the history of the region as it not only ushered in Imperial hegemony over the Platine region, but, according to Brazilian historian <b>J.</b> <b>F.</b> Maya Pedrosa, also in the rest of South America. The War of the Triple Alliance eighteen years later would only be a confirmation of Brazilian dominance.|$|E
5|$|The {{war started}} officially on 3 December 1971, when Pakistani {{aircraft}} bombed Indian Air Force {{bases in the}} western part of the country. The Army Headquarters, under the leadership Manekshaw, formulated a strategy as follows: the II Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Tapishwar Narain Raina (later General, and COAS), was to enter from the west; the IV Corps, commanded Lieutenant General Sagat Singh, was to enter from the west; the XXXIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Mohan L. Thapan was enter to from the west; additionally the 101 Communication Zone Area, commanded by Major General Gurbax Singh, was to provide support from the northeast. This strategy was to be executed by the Eastern Command, under Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. Manekshaw instructed Lieutenant General <b>J.</b> <b>F.</b> R. Jacob, chief of staff Eastern Command, to inform the Indian prime minister that orders were being issued for the movement of troops from Eastern Command. The following day, the navy and the air force also initiated full-scale operations on both eastern and western fronts.|$|E
5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines Charles Cathmer Ross {{resigned}} late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer Charles Cockroft on January29, 1937. Neither minister's resignation was {{directly related to the}} dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy, while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health, clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council, government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to patronage. Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of dissent in Social Credit's ranks. Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, <b>J.</b> <b>F.</b> Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and Minister of Agriculture and Trade and Industry William Chant would soon follow. This left Minister of Health Wallace Warren Cross, Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones William Fallow, and Provincial Secretary Ernest Manning as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning was away from the legislature, ill with tuberculosis. On February19, William Carlos Ives of the Supreme Court of Alberta dealt the government another blow when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the interest paid on the province's bonds by half (though this was only a technical defeat, since the government had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April).|$|E
