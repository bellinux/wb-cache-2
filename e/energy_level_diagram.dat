5000|$|The red HeNe laser {{wavelength}} of 633 nm has an actual vacuum {{wavelength of}} 632.991 nm, or about 632.816 nm in air. The wavelengths of the stimulated emission modes lie within about 0.001 nm {{above or below}} this value, and the wavelengths of those modes shift within this range due to {{thermal expansion and contraction}} of the cavity. Frequency-stabilized versions enable the wavelength of a single mode to be specified to within 1 part in 108 by the technique of comparing the powers of two longitudinal modes in opposite polarizations. Absolute stabilization of the laser's frequency (or wavelength) as fine as 2.5 parts in 1011 can be obtained through use of an iodine absorption cell.The mechanism producing population inversion and light amplification in a HeNe laser plasma originates with inelastic collision of energetic electrons with ground state helium atoms in the gas mixture. As shown in the accompanying <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> <b>diagram,</b> these collisions excite helium atoms from the ground state to higher energy excited states, among them the 23S1 and 21S0 (LS or Russell-Saunder coupling, front number 2 tells that an excited electron is n = 2 state) in long-lived metastable states. Because of a fortuitous near coincidence between the energy levels of the two He metastable states, and the 5s2 and 4s2 (Paschen notation [...] ) levels of neon, collisions between these helium metastable atoms and ground state neon atoms results in a selective and efficient transfer of excitation energy from the helium to neon. This excitation energy transfer process is given by the reaction equations: ...|$|E

40|$|Electron-hole {{symmetry}} upon p- and n-doping {{of conducting}} organic polymers is rationalized with Hückel theory {{by the presence}} of symmetrically located intragap states. Since density functional theory (DFT) predicts very different geometries and <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> <b>diagrams</b> for conjugated π-systems than semiempirical methods, it is an interesting question whether DFT confirms the existence of electron-hole symmetry predicted at the Hückel level. To answer this question, geometries of oligothiophene anions with 5 - 19 rings were optimized and their UV/vis spectra were calculated with time-dependent DFT. Although DFT does not produce symmetrically placed sub-band <b>energy</b> <b>levels,</b> spectra of cations and anions are almost identical. The similarity in transition energies and oscillator strengths of anions and cations {{can be explained by the}} fact that the single sub-band <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> of cations lies above the valence band by the same amount of energy as the single sub-band level of anions lies below the conduction band. This and the resemblance of the <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> spacings in valence bands of cations to those in conduction bands of anions give rise to peaks with equal energies and oscillator strengths. © 2008 American Chemical Society...|$|R
