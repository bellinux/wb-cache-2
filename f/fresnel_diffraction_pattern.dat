50|$|In his Optics, Francis Weston Sears {{offers a}} {{mathematical}} approximation suggested by Fresnel that predicts {{the main features}} of diffraction patterns and uses only simple mathematics. By considering the perpendicular distance from the hole in a barrier screen to a nearby detection screen along with the wavelength of the incident light, {{it is possible to}} compute a number of regions called half-period elements or Fresnel zones. The inner zone is a circle and each succeeding zone will be a concentric annular ring. If the diameter of the circular hole in the screen is sufficient to expose the first or central Fresnel zone, the amplitude of light {{at the center of the}} detection screen will be double what it would be if the detection screen were not obstructed. If the diameter of the circular hole in the screen is sufficient to expose two Fresnel zones, then the amplitude at the center is almost zero. That means that a <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> can have a dark center. These patterns can be seen and measured, and correspond well to the values calculated for them.|$|E

Far from its sources, an expanding spherical wave is locally tangent to a planar phase front (a single plane wave out of the infinite spectrum), which is transverse to the radial direction of propagation. In this case, a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is created, which emanates from a single spherical wave phase center. In the near field, no single well-defined spherical wave phase center exists, so the wavefront isn't locally tangent to a spherical ball. In this case, a <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> would be created, which emanates from an extended source, consisting of a distribution of (physically identifiable) spherical wave sources in space. In the near field, a full spectrum of plane waves is necessary to represent the Fresnel near-field wave, even locally. A [...] "wide" [...] wave moving forward (like an expanding ocean wave coming toward the shore) can be regarded as {{an infinite number}} of [...] "plane wave modes", all of which could (when they collide with something in the way) scatter independently of one other.

Fourier optics forms much of the theory behind image processing techniques, as well as finding applications where information needs to be extracted from optical sources such as in quantum optics. To put it in a slightly more complex way, similar to the concept of frequency and time used in traditional [...] Fourier transform theory, Fourier optics makes use of the spatial frequency domain (kx, ky) as the conjugate of the spatial (x, y) domain. Terms and concepts such as transform theory, spectrum, bandwidth, window functions and sampling from one-dimensional signal processing are commonly used.|$|E

40|$|Two {{versions}} of an optoelectronic system undergoing development are depicted. The system {{is expected to}} be capable of measuring a distance between 2 and 10 m with an error of no more than 1 micrometer. The system would be designed to exploit Fresnel diffraction of a laser beam. In particular, it would be designed {{to take advantage of the}} fact that a <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> is ultrasensitive to distance. The two versions would differ in the following respects: In version 1, the focus of the telescope would be in the Fresnel region, and the telescope would have a small depth of focus. As a consequence, the Fresnel pattern would be imaged directly onto the photodetector array; in version 2, a multielement lens module would displace the Fresnel region from the vicinity of the pinhole to the vicinity of the optical receiver. As the distance to be measured varied, the location of the receiver relative to the displaced Fresnel-diffraction region would vary, thereby causing the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> on the focal plane to vary. The multielement lens module would also correct for aberrations. The processing of the digitized <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> in the computer might be accelerated by using only parts of the pattern or even only one small part - the central pixel. As the distance from the pinhole increased, the central pixel would rapidly cycle between maximum and minimum light intensity. This in itself would not be sufficient to uniquely determine the distance. However, by varying the size of the pinhole or the wavelength of the laser, one could obtain a second cycle of variation of intensity that, in conjunction with the first cycle, could enable a unique determination of distance. Alternatively, for a single wavelength and a single pinhole size, it should suffice to consider the data from only two different key pixels in the Fresnel pattern...|$|E

40|$|Fast radio bursts are radio {{transients}} observed mainly around 1. 5 GHz. Their {{peak frequency}} decreases {{at a rate}} of 100 ~ 500 MHz/s and some of them have a broader pulse with an exponentially decaying tail. Common assumptions for fast radio bursts include a dispersion effect resulting in the peak frequency drifting and a scattering effect resulting in pulse broadening. These assumptions attribute the abnormally large dispersion measure and scattering measure to the environmental medium of the host galaxy. Here we show that the radiation of fast radio bursts can be explained as an undulator radiation and the large dispersion measure can be due to a motion effect mainly from the rotation of the source which is probably variable stars. In our scenario, the pulse broadening is near-field effects and the pulse itself represents a <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> sweeping the observer.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new prior for phase {{retrieval}} from X-ray <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns.</b> <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> are achieved by letting a highly coherent X-ray beam propagate in free space after interaction with an object. Previously, either homogeneous or multi-material object assumptions have been used. The {{advantage of the}} homogeneous object assumption is that the prior can be introduced in the Radon domain.

Here, we let the relationship between attenuation and refractive index vary {{as a function of}} the measured attenuation index. The method is evaluated using images acquired at beamline ID 19 (ESRF, Grenoble, France) of a phantom where the prior is calculated by linear interpolation and of a healing bone obtained from a rat osteotomy model.

Reconstruction was performed using the mixed approach but is compatible with other, more advanced models. We achieve more precise reconstructions than previously reported in literature.

40|$|The surface {{morphology}} of the ablation craters generated in LiNbO 3 by 130 fs laser pulses at 800 nm {{has been investigated}} by AFM/SNOM microscopy. The single pulse fluence corresponding to the ablation threshold has been estimated to be ≈ 1. 8 J/cm 2. A complex structure including random cone-shaped protrusions is observed inside the ablated crater. The scale of the protrusion spacing is in the submicron range and the heights are typically of a few tens of nanometers. At and outside the crater rim a novel quasi-periodic wave-like topography pattern is observed in both types of microscopy techniques. The average wavelength, that is slightly dependent on pulse fluence, is (500 - 800 nm) comparable to the light wavelength. This novel topography feature keeps a close similarity with a <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> by an absorbing circular obstacle or impact wave pattern produced {{by a combination of}} heat and shock wave (resemble that of impact crater).

40|$|Geosynchronous (GEO) {{satellites}} {{are essential}} for modern communication networks. If communication to a GEO satellite is lost and a malfunction occurs upon orbit insertion such as a solar panel not deploying {{there is no direct}} way to observe it from Earth. Due to the GEO orbit distance of ~ 36, 000 km from Earth's surface, the Rayleigh criteria dictates that a 14 m telescope is required to conventionally image a satellite with spatial resolution down to 1 m using visible light. Furthermore, a telescope larger than 30 m is required under ideal conditions to obtain spatial resolution down to 0. 4 m. This dissertation evaluates a method for obtaining high spatial resolution images of GEO satellites from an Earth based system by measuring the irradiance distribution on the ground resulting from the occultation of the satellite passing in front of a star. The representative size of a GEO satellite combined with the orbital distance results in the ground shadow being consistent with a <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> when observed at visible wavelengths. A measurement of the ground shadow irradiance is used as an amplitude constraint in a Gerchberg-Saxton phase retrieval algorithm that produces a reconstruction of the satellite's 2 D transmission function which is analogous to a reverse contrast image of the satellite. The advantage of shadow imaging is that a terrestrial based redundant set of linearly distributed inexpensive small telescopes, each coupled to high speed detectors, is a more effective resolved imaging system for GEO satellites than a very large telescope under ideal conditions. Modeling and simulation efforts indicate sub-meter spatial resolution can be readily achieved using collection apertures of less than 1 meter in diameter. A mathematical basis is established for the treatment of the physical phenomena involved in the shadow imaging process. This includes the source star brightness and angular extent, and the diffraction of starlight from the satellite. Atmospheric effects including signal attenuation, refraction/dispersion, and turbulence are also applied to the model. The light collection and physical measurement process using highly sensitive geiger-mode avalanche photo-diode (GM-APD) detectors is described in detail. A simulation of the end-to-end shadow imaging process is constructed and then utilized to quantify the spatial resolution limits based on source star, environmental, observational, collection, measurement, and image reconstruction parameters...|$|E
40|$|The present third {{generation}} synchrotron sources provide intense x-ray radiation in hard x-ray regime to perform coherent x-ray scattering experiments. In 90 ´s several {{attempts have been}} made in performing speckle experiments with x-ray radiation at various surfaces which can provide sub-nm spatial resolution. However, the method is not well established as a routine characterization technique. Several details of the experimental technique and data analysis are not solved. In this work I measured the coherent reflectivity data from various surfaces at EDR (Energy Dispersive Reflectometry) beamline at the bending magnet of BESSY II synchrotron. White x-rays in the useful energy range of 5 <E< 20 keV are provided at EDR beamline. The availability of the measured speckle data at different energies simultaneously provides redundant information and is expected to be useful in making the reconstruction of surface profile simpler. Various samples like smooth wafers of Si and GaAs, patterned surface of GaAs surface grating are investigated. Coherent reflectivity from spatially confined Si wafer is also measured. Due to the specific experimental conditions at EDR beamline the data is always measured in the near-field of the sample. Also the spatial confinement of the incoming beam by an entrance pinhole produces <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> (illumination function) at the sample position. I modified the commonly used GS (Gerchberg-Saxton) algorithm and ER (Error-Reduction) algorithm which takes into account the additional Fresnel propagator term and also the illumination function at the sample position. After testing the modified algorithm for a model surface {{in the form of a}} grating I used the algorithm to reconstruct surface morphology from various static speckle measurements I performed at EDR beamline. The surface profiles reconstructed for different samples from the data at different energies (below the critical energy for the material at a particular incident angle) show almost the same roughness behavior for surface height with mean roughness of ~ 1 nm. With the static speckle data I measured I could retrieve a one-dimensional picture of the sample surface with spatial resolution of ~ 15 µm. The reconstruction of the surface profile from the static speckle data at different energies for a spatially confined Si wafer gives a two-dimensional picture of the sample surface, spatially resolved as well as depth resolved. Due to different penetration depth of x-rays at different energies the reconstructed profile corresponds to different depths inside the sample. Such a two-dimensional information of the sample is accessible only due to the measurement of speckle pattern at different energies simultaneously which is possible only due to the "white" x-rays at EDR bending magnet beamline at BESSY II.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{molecular}} assembly {{at the onset}} of solution-based material formation has the potential to strongly influence the topology of the ensuing molecular aggregate structure, and from there the macroscale physical properties of the resultant material. The present work focuses on the use of engineered, photoactive metal alkoxide precursors in the sol-gel processing of metal-oxide materials. The strategy under investigation seeks to integrate photoinduced structural modification with conventional sol-gel chemical preparations to enable the selective photo-activation of reaction points about the metal center during material formation. The approach thus has the potential to influence the development of intermolecular bonding geometry and to provide an opportunity to enforce or bias longer range structural development processes and resulting network topology. This ability to bias the long range structural development has been shown to provide opportunities both for photoinduced material formation and the potential to control multi-length scale structural characteristics of these materials. The response of a mononuclear, heteroleptic titanium alkoxide (OPy) ₂Ti(4 MP) ₂ [where OPy = pyridine carbinoxide and 4 MP = 4 -mercaptophenoxide] to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in dilute solution and in solid-state samples has been measured. Vibrational spectroscopy (FTIR absorption and Raman scattering) was used to monitor changes in molecular structure upon exposure to 337. 1 and 365 nm light. Assignment of spectral features to vibrational modes of the molecule was aided by a normal-mode analysis of the energy-minimized molecular structure within a density functional theory (DFT) framework. Photoinduced decreases in peak areas were observed in both FTIR spectra of the precursor solutions and Raman data collected from solution-cast films of the precursor material. These changes were associated with vibrational modes localized at the 4 MP ligands. Conversely, no significant modification of vibrational structure associated with the OPy moiety was observed under the excitation conditions examined. In a related study, thin films of the precursor were cast, sampled, and UV-irradiated in scintillation vials under hydrated air (40 % RH) and dry argon to evaluate the influence of local atmospheric composition on the photoresponse. An increase in the magnitude of photoinduced vibrational changes was observed in the moist air environment, again associated primarily with the 4 MP ligand. The results support an interpretation of these structural changes in terms of a preferential enhancement of hydrolysis at the 4 MP site under these conditions. Excitation, with 248 nm light, of a solution of (OPy) ₂Ti(TAP) ₂ [where OPy = pyridine carbinoxide and TAP = 2, 4, 6 tris(dimethylamino) phenoxide] in watercontaining pyridine has been shown to create an insoluble photoproduct in the region of the incident laser beam. Analysis of the photoproduct by Raman spectroscopy indicates the presence of hydrolysis and condensation products as well as features consistent with the unreacted metal alkoxide, indicating destabilization of the alkoxide material that leads to intermolecular linking reactions. Further analysis indicates that it is excitations resonant with the π − π∗ transitions in the aromatic ligands, {{as well as in the}} solvent, that provide this destabilization rather than excitations resonant with the charge transfer band in the molecule. These fundamental studies of the intrinsic molecular-level response of (OPy) ₂Ti(TAP) ₂ to ultraviolet irradiation have lead to the development of a novel thin film deposition process wherein the film is deposited directly from solution onto a substrate only in the regions in which it is exposed to ultraviolet light. Patterned deposition of 100 m wide lines of material was demonstrated using a slit-shaped aluminum shadow mask during exposure. Stylus profilometry confirmed that the average thickness of the photodeposited film varied monotonically with accumulated UV-fluence, exhibiting thicknesses of 10 to 310 nm for fluences of 12 and 192 J/cm 2, respectively. Moreover, the surface profile of the film surface at fluences greater than 12 J/cm² was found to reproduce the near-field, <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> anticipated from the slit mask used. The nanoscale porosity of films deposited from solution using this technique was found to be dependent on the chemistry of the precursor solution used, with a 1 part addition of water to the precursor producing films with 100 nm diameter surface pores, and an 8 part addition of water to the precursor producing films with no visible surface porosity. Post-deposition thermal treatments have been explored as a means to modify the as-deposited chemistry and nanostructure of the photodeposited films. As-deposited films showed spectral characteristics indicating only a partial disruption of the starting molecular structure by the ultraviolet irradiation, retaining many of the ligand-based spectral features of the precursor. Films that were fired to 350 °C under an oxygen atmosphere no longer showed FTIR features corresponding to ligand-based vibrational modes, with the Raman spectrum of the material showing an increase in the wavenumber range that is indicative of Ti-O-Ti bonding, leading to the conclusion that the residual alkoxide ligands had been removed. In contrast films fired to this temperature under argon showed Raman features assigned to graphite-like structures, indicating that the reducing atmosphere led to the retention of the phenyl moieties in the fired films. The experimental results obtained from optical spectroscopy for both (OPy) ₂Ti(4 MP) ₂ and (OPy) ₂Ti(TAP) ₂have been interpreted through the aid of quantum computational models. This modeling procedure, based in the Density Functional Theory framework, has allowed for an optimization of the proposed molecular structures into ground state geometries, from which normal mode analysis routines have been used to produce theoretical Raman and FTIR spectra. Additionally, Density Functional Theory models were used to interpret the excited state behavior of the (OPy) ₂Ti(TAP) ₂ molecule by predicting the high energy molecular orbitals and calculating the transition strength between the lower and upper levels to produce the theoretical ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum. These calculations provided insight into the nature of the photoexcitation pathways available to the molecule upon the absorption of ultraviolet irradiation and the possible nature of the photoproducts formed as a result...|$|E

40|$|Lensless imaging is {{an elegant}} {{approach}} to high-resolution microscopy, which is rapidly gaining popularity in applications where imaging optics are problematic. However, current lensless imaging methods require objects {{to be placed}} within a well-defined support structure, while the light source {{needs to have a}} narrow, stable, and accurately known spectrum. Here we introduce a general approach to lensless imaging without spectral bandwidth limitations or sample requirements. We use two time-delayed coherent light pulses, and show that scanning the pulse-to-pulse time delay allows the reconstruction of diffraction-limited images for all spectral components in the pulse. Moreover, an iterative phase retrieval algorithm is introduced, which uses these spectrally resolved <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> to obtain high-resolution images of complex extended objects without any support requirements. We demonstrate this two-pulse imaging method with octave-spanning visible light sources (in both transmission and reflection geometries), and with broadband extreme-ultraviolet radiation from a high-harmonic source. This demonstrates that our approach enables effective use of low-flux ultra-broadband sources, such as table-top soft-X-ray systems, for high-resolution imaging. Comment: 14 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe phase {{retrieval}} {{process is a}} nonlinear ill-posed problem. The <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> obtained with hard x-ray synchrotron beam {{can be used to}} retrieve the phase contrast. In this work, we present a convergence comparison of several nonlinear approaches for the phase retrieval problem involving regularizations with sparsity constraints. The phase solution is assumed to have a sparse representation with respect to an orthonormal wavelets basis. One approach uses alternatively a solution of the nonlinear problem based on the Fréchet derivative and a solution of the linear problem in wavelet coordinates with an iterative thresholding. A second method is the one proposed by Ramlau and Teschke which generalizes to a nonlinear problem the classical thresholding algorithm. The algorithms were tested on a 3 D Shepp-Logan phantom corrupted by white Gaussian noise. The best simulation results are obtained by the first method for the various noise levels and initializations investigated. The reconstruction errors are significantly decreased with respect to the ones given by the classical linear phase retrieval approaches...|$|R

40|$|We present, for {{the first}} time, two {{complementary}} analytical techniques for calculating the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> from a polygonal aperture illuminated by a plane wave. These frameworks are exact, in {{that they do not}} involve any further approximation beyond the (paraxial) Fresnel integral. Here, we consider regular polygonal apertures, but our results are readily extended to describe near-field diffraction from closed apertures of arbitrary shape. Our results are of fundamental importance and have specific applications where standard methods, such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques, fail. For example, in unstable-resonator mode calculations, both (paraxial beam) ABCD matrix modelling and existing semi-analytical methods can only give accurate results in limited parameter regimes. Consequently, a complete and detailed study of optical fractal laser modes [1] has not previously been possible. A specific advantage of our formalisms is the ability to calculate and store the fine details of {{only a small portion of}} one, or many, complex <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns.</b> Moreover, the explicit mathematical form of our results may also lend physical insight into a wide range of diffraction-related phenomena in physics. For example, insight into the physical origin of excess quantum noise in lasers, where the transverse symmetry of an aperturing element has been shown to play a central role in the observed phenomena [2]. While Fraunhoffer (far-field) <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> have been known for many years, there has been relatively little equivalent published work in the Fresnel (near-field) regime. The far-field approximation allows the expression of <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> and descriptions of derivative concepts (eg in holography, filtering, convolution and coherence) as simple Fourier integrals and transform theorems, respectively. Our new results permit the mathematical and physical expression of near-field <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> in terms of their elemental spatial structures (edge-waves). It is plausible that our results may also open future doors in the development of derivative concepts in Fresnel Optics. The <b>Fresnel</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> consist of a plane-wave (uniform) component, plus a rapidly-varying interference contribution from boundary-diffracted waves from all edges of the aperture. This physical interpretation is present in the mathematical formulations of both the S-Function Method, which deals explicitly with edge-wave combinations, and also the Line-Integral Method, where the Fresnel integral over the aperture area is expressed as a circulation around its edge. Extensive computational investigations have verified that our two approaches are completely equivalent, and produce identical results. The amount of fine detail present in the pattern can be quantified by the Fresnel Number N = a 2 /λL + f(n), where a is the radius of a circle inscribing an n-sided polygon, L is the distance from the aperture to the observation plane (L^ 2 » a^ 2 is a paraxial approximation inherent to the near-field approximation), λ is the wavelength of the illuminating light, and f(n) = 0. 30618 n 2 - 0. 19533 n - 0. 68095 is a term allowing for the geometrical structure of the aperture. As n becomes larger, the level of detail increases. References [1] G. P. Karman, G. S. McDonald, G. H. C. New, and J. P. Woerdman, Nature 402 (1999) 138. [2] G. P. Karman, G. S. McDonald, J. P.
