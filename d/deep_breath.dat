25|$|Montano {{started in}} show {{business}} as a commercial model. He played roles in numerous B movies. He then played major roles in several action movies and a brief television career playing the lead role in the television sitcom Kaya ni Mister, Kaya ni Misis. His breakout role is his portrayal of José Rizal, the Philippine National Hero in the film José Rizal. The film is unprecedented as it portrays Philippine society during Spanish colonization of the Philippines and its relevance {{up to the present}} day. After his first Hollywood movie The Great Raid with Benjamin Bratt, he was cast in another Hollywood movie Another <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> which was never actually shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} of not showing the ping-pong balls live has fueled {{speculation that the}} NBA will occasionally fix the draft lottery if it can benefit the league. The speculation originated with the 1985 draft lottery that sent Patrick Ewing to New York, with the theory being that the NBA wanted to send {{the best player in}} the draft to New York to increase ratings in a large television market. At that time, the NBA used 7 envelopes in a tumbler representing the seven teams with the worst record. Some have speculated that the envelope containing the Knicks logo was refrigerated beforehand, enabling David Stern to recognize and select it. Another conspiracy theory suggests that one of the seven envelopes was thrown into the tumbler, causing one of the corners to fold. After the envelopes were mixed, Stern took a <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> before reaching into the tumbler and picking the envelope with the folded corner. No one has ever explained why all the other teams would go along with the fix. Afterward, the Draft Lottery Format was changed to the current ping-pong ball lottery in a private room with team representatives. However, despite the lack of any evidence, conspiracy theories still persist regarding the annual outcome of the lottery.|$|E
40|$|In awake rats {{a single}} {{recurrent}} larger tidal volume (<b>deep</b> <b>breaths)</b> occurs at regular intervals, followed by oscillations in arterial pressure and heart rate. In {{the present study}} we recorded the changes in blood pressure, heart rate and ventilation during the wakefulness-sleep cycle identified by electrocorticographic records {{in order to determine}} whether the <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> and cardiovascular oscillations were associated with changes in the electrocorticogram. During several episodes of slow-wave sleep (SWS) in 7 rats the <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> and oscillations in arterial pressure and heart rate were preceded by SWS desynchronization. The interval between <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> during SWS was 71 ± 4 s, the period between initial desynchronization and the generation of <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> was 3. 98 ± 0. 45 s and the duration of SWS desynchronization was 11 ± 0. 65 s. Hypotension (- 16 ± 1 mmHg) and tachycardia (+ 15 ± 5 bpm) were observed during <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> in the SWS state. These data indicate that the oscillations in arterial pressure and heart rate during SWS are associated with <b>deep</b> <b>breaths,</b> which in turn are preceded by desynchronization of the electrocorticogram in this state of slee...|$|R

500|$|Later {{releases}} include Christmas Around the World reaching ZMR's Top 100 Radio Playlist; and One <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> also {{holding a}} position on ZMR's Top 100 Radio Chart for over six months. Bill Binkelman writes that while he doubts fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces, {{as well as for}} lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music." [...] Reviewing for Allmusic, Jim Brenholts describes One <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> as a set of smooth adult contemporary pieces in which Joseph adds [...] "world music flair and inspirational touches".

500|$|Ahead of {{the fourth}} series, Russell T Davies {{acknowledged}} that the character of Gwen can be both loved and hated by the audience. He stated that as an actress Myles isn't preoccupied with her character being presented in a sympathetic light, being able [...] "to take that extraordinary <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and not care". io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the TV episode [...] "The Categories of Life", written by Jane Espenson, exposed the character's [...] "human vanity" [...] by showing that she has [...] "started to believe her own hype". In Anders' eyes, the character is responsible for her father's second heart attack because of her rash actions. Anders felt that later episodes in the fourth series continued to illuminate flaws in Gwen's character, describing her as someone with an [...] "addictive personality" [...] who [...] "treats her Torchwood adventures like a drug that she craves" [...] though she knows they [...] "ruin her relationships {{with her husband and}} child".|$|E
500|$|For the 2002 album One <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath,</b> Joseph {{combines}} [...] "structured melodic {{pieces and}} free-form ambient compositions", which [...] "departs dramatically {{from the previous}} more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, Hear the Masses and Rapture". [...] Binkelman writes, [...] "It is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between." [...] For instance, the song [...] "Dance of Life" [...] was inspired by Antonín Dvořák's opera, [...] "Rusalka". [...] It {{is a bit more}} straightforward in its piano presentation, and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says Instrumental Weekly. [...] Then the album closes with its title track, [...] "One Deep Breath", that [...] "floats and meanders for more than ten minutes, bringing in ocean sounds". It is [...] "far and away the most ambient of everything else to be found here", [...] and is [...] "stunning, both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before".|$|E
