The basis for the Rothschild's most famously profitable move was made after the news of British victory had been made public.

Calibration to crude oil futures'' options shows high volatility of oil futures prices, fat-tailed, and right-skewed market expectations, implying a higher probability mass on crude oil prices remaining above the futures'' level.

One of them concerns the degree of competition among the advancing merchants of the rural South. Ransom and Sutch's assertion that such merchants held a 'territorial monopoly'' is usually criticized as being {{at odds with the}} high level of postbellum entry in the rural merchandising sector and the absence of significant costs to entry. The question is still open, as shown by a recent special issue of Explorations in Economic History.

The conventional wisdom is that unadvertised add-ons for high fees help competitors increase profits that are competed away by advertising low prices for the basic products. This theory cannot explain why complimentary add-ons are still offered by some sellers. We show that providing complimentary add-ons can be profitable for sellers with monopoly power under certain demand conditions. If these demand conditions are not met, it is optimal to charge a supplementary fee for the add-on. We also show how pricing policy can be designed to selectively target or deter different consumer segments from purchasing the add-on to boost sellers ’ profits, providing a strategic role for selling add-ons at either below-cost or at exorbitantly high prices. Yet such behavior may have repercussions for economic welfare when it results in socially inefficient giveaways when consumers would be better served with a lower price on the basic product without the add-on or, with the other extreme, when it results in <b>excessively</b> <b>high</b> <b>prices</b> for an add-on that restricts sales and leads to its under-provision from a societal perspective.

40|$|The {{increasingly}} observable {{excess capacity}} in the fixed networks {{calls into question the}} established long-standing pricing standards for wholesale services based on forward-looking long-run incremental costs (FL-LRAIC). The FL-LRAIC standard has worked quite well in expanding markets, although even there price-squeeze problems have appeared. In contracting markets the price-squeeze issue, however, becomes paramount and lower prices both at the wholesale and retail levels would be efficient. This would favor a retail-minus approach (RM) under long-term contraction. Because both expansion and contraction could be relevant in the future, we propose an optional approach based on the wholesale price formula p = min(FL-LRAIC, RM). This will generally protect alternative competitors against price-squeeze {{while at the same time}} allowing the fixed-network incumbent full downward price flexibility. It also protects alternative competitors and end users against <b>excessively</b> <b>high</b> <b>prices.</b> Hence, implementing this option successfully at wholesale level would eliminate the need to regulate retail markets. The combination of RM and FL-LRAIC seems to be most realistic, because it is relatively simple and internationally partly tested already. We show that this option is superior to FL-LRAIC or RM alone and to other approaches, such as short-run marginal costs. We also consider a possible combination with capacity-based charging, which may have particular merits for converged services in next generation networks (NGNs).

The operators own a network infrastructure only in their home country. To allow their subscribers to place or receive calls abroad, they have to buy roaming services provided by foreign MNOs. We show that in absence of international alliances and capacity restrictions, competition between foreign operators would drive wholesale unit prices down to marginal costs. However, operators prefer to form international alliances in which members mutually provide roaming services at inefficiently <b>high</b> wholesale <b>prices.</b> Alliances serve as a commitment device to soften competition on the retail market and harm consumers through <b>excessively</b> <b>high</b> per call <b>prices.</b> Although operators compete in two-part tariffs for subscribers, wholesale roaming prices do not exhibit profit-neutrality as do access prices in related models of net- work interconnection.

In Seoul, the ratio of housing prices to household annual income is about 10 times. This is three or four times higher than the corresponding ratios in advanced countries. To make the matter worse, housing prices continue to rise rapidly in large cities including Seoul (up to twenty per cent per year lately). The <b>excessively</b> <b>high</b> housing <b>prices</b> results in worsening housing affordability, higher wage rates and worker's weakening desire to work. It is a common belief in Korea that speculation is the main reason for such <b>high</b> housing <b>prices,</b> thus the government has applied a series of anti-speculative measures including major increase in capital gains tax and property tax. However, these measures have not been able to eliminate speculative housing prices bubbles. This paper is designed on one hand to evaluate the contribution of speculative activities to housing prices hike and, on the other to verify the presence of bubble in housing prices. In order to quantify the impact of speculation on housing prices, a simple devise is applied; the value of the explained variation of housing prices resulting from a regression analysis is decomposed into the percentage share of each independent variable including the variable for speculation.

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Carrasco {{remained}} loyal to the Republic. His mediation saved the lives of many who were being persecuted. These acts caused him to be the target of denunciations by journalists and being harassed by some factions of the anarchists and communists in Catalonia on the Republican side. Until December 1936 he worked in the Conselleria de Finances (the Catalan finance ministry), but on 17 December the anarchist newspaper Solidaridad Obrera printed a denunciation of him. This situation forced him to move to the Basque Country, where he collaborated with the government of lehendakari José Antonio Aguirre. At the end of his first mission in Bilbao he returned to Barcelona where he learned that there were still those there who sought his death. He then decided to leave again, {{as a representative of the}} Catalan Generalitat with the Government of Euskadi, with his family, and embarked at Bayonne on board the Galdames, set for Bilbao. Carrasco was an admirer of the Basques who had proved capable of protecting the Church and avoiding religious persecution. However, the freighter on which he was sailing was intercepted by the Francoist cruiser Canarias (Battle of Cape Machichaco) and Carrasco was taken to Pasajes, where his family was broken up. The two older daughters, Nuria and Merce, were jailed in San Sebastián, and three younger children Ramon, Josep and Neus, shut up in the asylum of San Jose, in the same city, where, as the children of 'Reds', the nuns forbade them communion. Carrasco, his wife Pilar Azemar de Carrasco, and Rosa Maria, only a few months old, were taken to Burgos. In the middle of August 1937, through the mediation of the International Red Cross, the family of Carrasco i Formiguera were exchanged for the family of General Lopez-Pinto Berizo, Captain General or the commander of the Organic Division of Burgos, and were able to move to Paris. Carrasco was transferred to the Provincial Prison in Burgos and sentenced to death in a summary trial held on 28 August 1937 for the crime of [...] "joining the rebellion"- meaning the rebellion against Franco. Cardinal Francisco Vidal y Barraquer appealed for intervention and on 10 November 1937 wrote to Cardinal Pacelli declaring Carrasco [...] " [...] a practising Catholic" [...] who [...] "always defended the rights of the Church." [...] Pacelli replied that he had made a petition on 15 March 1937, shortly after Carrasco's capture, and again on 30 October. All attempts to have the sentence commuted, or to include Carrasco in an exchange of prisoners, failed. Franco set an <b>excessively</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> for saving Carrasco, -a proposal relayed to the Republican ambassador in Brussels on 5 April mentioned that Carrasco would be exchanged for ten of our officers or twenty un-named ones,- while [...] "the Republican government, although it would have wished to save him, saw him as fundamentally a Republican, but of the opposition." ...|$|R
