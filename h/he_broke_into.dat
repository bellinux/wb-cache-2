5|$|Fingleton {{was unable}} to {{distinguish}} himself on the field while at school, but after joining Waverley, he made quick progress. Fingleton trained early in the morning, before heading {{to the office and}} working in the afternoon so that the articles would be printed in the evening. He {{was unable to}} afford the club membership so a patron sponsored him. At the age of 16, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> the First XI of a grade team which included Test players Alan Kippax, Hanson Carter and Arthur Mailey.

He believed that he was entitled to this former Moldavian fief, its revenue redirected toward paying the Ottoman tribute.

5|$|An {{offensive}}ly-minded defenceman, Niedermayer {{was best}} known for his skating ability and drew comparison's to the game's offensive greats from the time <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> the NHL. He was compared to Paul Coffey for his ability to take the puck from his own goal line and convert a defensive situation into an offensive rush. He often chafed at playing within the Devils' defence-oriented system, feeling it restricted his offensive creativity, but also admitted that he learned to place greater emphasis on his defence and develop his overall game. Niedermayer earned a reputation for inconsistency early in his career. He often played his best games against top opposition, but his failure to consistently apply his skills against all opposition occasionally frustrated his teammates and left his coaches lamenting that he was a player capable of being dominant but often was not. By {{the end of his career}} however, and following his Norris Trophy win in 2004, Niedermayer was regarded as one of the top offensive defencemen of his generation and as one of the game's greatest winners. Niedermayer and former Ducks teammate Corey Perry are the only players in hockey history to win every major contemporary North American and International Competitive titles: the Memorial Cup, World Junior championship, Stanley Cup, World Championship, World Cup and Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> a house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E
