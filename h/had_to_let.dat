25|$|Farragut had two {{problems}} {{to deal with}} in addition to any posed by the Confederates.

Porter was a master of intrigue who had the ear of Assistant Secretary Fox, and Farragut <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the mortars be tried, despite his strong personal belief that they would prove worthless.|$|E

In order to prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic people.

Chopra told that she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of every inhibition probably that she had as a Hindi film heroine and play Jhilmil without thinking of it. She explained that she needed two moments to become Jhilmil because she didn't identify with her character due to difference between her thought and behavior.|$|E
500|$|Lee had to {{work through}} the issue of how to write Anna's personality, in that some of her colleagues felt Anna should be more {{dysfunctional}} and co-dependent, like Vanellope von Schweetz in Wreck-It Ralph. Lee disagreed with that position, but it took her almost a year {{to figure out how to}} convincingly articulate [...] "this is what Anna's journey is. No more than that. No less than that." [...] In the end, Lee successfully argued Anna's journey should be presented as a simple coming-of-age story, [...] "where she goes from having a naive view of life and love– because she's lonely– to the most sophisticated and mature view of love, where she's capable of the ultimate love, which is sacrifice." [...] Lee also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of some ideas that she liked, such as a scene portraying Anna and Elsa's relationship as teenagers, which did not work because they needed to maintain the separation between Anna and Elsa.|$|E

500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> us know that it was him.

Palmer decided to mix the album at Ridge Farm Studios in Dorking, a converted farm that according to Palmer was [...] "about as far away from an L.A. or New York studio as you can get." [...] Palmer made a few additions to the already-recorded songs, including having McCready finish up the guitar solo on [...] "Alive" [...] and tweaking the intro to [...] "Black". Palmer overdubbed a pepper shaker and a fire extinguisher as percussion on [...] "Oceans".|$|E
