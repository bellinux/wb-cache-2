5|$|Chance {{enrolled}} at the University of California, where he pursued a degree in <b>dentistry.</b> He transferred to Washington College in Irvington, California. While playing baseball for the school's baseball team, he received an offer to play semi-professional baseball for a team in Sullivan, Illinois, for $40 a month ($ in current dollar terms), which he accepted.|$|E
5|$|He {{arrived in}} Killarney, Manitoba, in 1903, {{where he worked}} as a farmhand during the harvest. When winter came, he found work as a {{lumberjack}} in Fort William, Ontario. A voyage west followed, and he set up a homestead in east-central Alberta. Once there, he began to practice <b>dentistry,</b> drawing on his army experience. On 9 September 1919, he married Marion Stuart. They had three sons and two daughters.|$|E
5|$|On February 9, 2006, {{after many}} scandals {{regarding}} financial mishandling at the University of Medicine and <b>Dentistry</b> of New Jersey, Corzine nominated Robert Del Tufo, the former Attorney General of New Jersey and U.S. Attorney, {{as chairman of}} the board of trustees. Corzine also nominated Oliver Quinn, Prudential Financial's vice president and chief ethics officer, as vice chairman of the board.|$|E
5|$|Platinum {{is used in}} {{catalytic}} converters, laboratory equipment, {{electrical contacts}} and electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, <b>dentistry</b> equipment, and jewelry. Being a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts; but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects. Compounds containing platinum, such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin, are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide as {{a mixture}} with about 0.5% iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is called {{calamine}} {{and is used}} in calamine lotion. Two minerals, zincite and hemimorphite, have been historically called calamine. When mixed with eugenol, a ligand, zinc oxide eugenol is formed, which has applications as a restorative and prosthodontic in <b>dentistry.</b>|$|E
5|$|ZnO reacts {{slowly with}} fatty acids in oils {{to produce the}} {{corresponding}} carboxylates, such as oleate or stearate. ZnO forms cement-like products when mixed with a strong aqueous solution of zinc chloride and these are best described as zinc hydroxy chlorides. This cement was used in <b>dentistry.</b>|$|E
5|$|A freedom-of-information request in 2015 {{revealed}} that the university received 31,857 undergraduate applications and made 13,302 offers in 2014–15. This resulted in an offer rate of 41.8%, a yield rate on offers of 45.3% and an overall acceptance rate of 18.9%. The School of Medicine received 1,764 applications, only 39 offers were made resulting in an offer rate of just 2.2%. Nursery & Midwifery, Physiotherapy and Clinical <b>Dentistry</b> had the lowest offer rates of 14%, 16% and 17% respectively.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Ohio State's dental school in 1945, Horvath signed {{to play for}} the Cleveland Rams of the National Football League. Horvath, however, applied for a {{commission}} to join the U.S. Navy and was sworn in as a lieutenant j.g. that August. He was sent at first to Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois for training, where he practiced <b>dentistry</b> and acted as an assistant to Brown, who had entered the Navy and was coaching the base's football team. Horvath served in Hawaii and coached a football team there that won a service national championship. He later traveled on assignment as far as China as a naval dental officer.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in <b>dentistry,</b> to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{earned his}} {{secondary}} education at Lutheran High School North in Macomb and Huron High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He moved to {{and graduated from}} the latter to facilitate his participation with the US National Team Development Program, which was based out of Ann Arbor. During his tenure with the Development Program, he made the choice to play NCAA hockey, opting against the major junior Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in order to attend college. The decision was encouraged by his father, who valued Booth's education. Enrolled at Michigan State University while playing for the school's hockey team, he studied <b>dentistry</b> before switching to general management.|$|E
5|$|Dalhousie {{has three}} campuses within the Halifax Peninsula and a fourth, the Agricultural Campus, in Bible Hill, Nova Scotia. The largest, Studley Campus, {{serves as the}} primary campus; it houses the {{majority}} of the university's academic buildings such as faculties, athletic facilities, and the university's Student Union Building. The campus is largely surrounded by residential neighbourhoods. Robie Street divides it from the adjacent Carleton Campus, which houses the faculties of <b>dentistry,</b> medicine, and other health profession departments. The campus is adjacent to two large teaching hospitals affiliated with the school: the IWK Health Centre and the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre.|$|E

It is {{where one of the}} first—and still the largest—air emergency service, Life Flight, was created, and a very successful inter-institutional transplant program was developed. More heart surgeries are performed at the Texas Medical Center {{than anywhere else in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Horvath {{expected}} {{his college}} football career {{to be over}} in 1942. He finished his undergraduate degree that year and enrolled in a graduate program at The Ohio State University College of <b>Dentistry.</b> Ohio State's football program, meanwhile, struggled in 1943 after Brown {{and many of its}} best players entered the military during World War II. Carroll Widdoes, an assistant under Brown, was appointed the acting head coach and led the team to a 3–6 record.|$|E
5|$|Horvath {{graduated}} from dental school in 1945 {{and served as}} a dental officer in the U.S. Navy for two years. Following his discharge, he played professionally for the Los Angeles Rams in 1947 and 1948 before being released and signing with the Cleveland Browns in 1949. The Browns won the All-America Football Conference championship that year. Horvath retired from playing in 1950 and moved to Los Angeles to practice <b>dentistry.</b> He lived there {{for the rest of his}} life. Horvath was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1966 and the Ohio State athletics hall of fame in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Horvath married Shirley Phillips, {{an airline}} hostess after the 1949 season, and {{moved back to}} Los Angeles.

5|$|Schouler {{leaves the}} city to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for {{practicing}} <b>dentistry</b> without a license. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even though she has saved over $200 {{in addition to the}} original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).|$|E
5|$|The Dental Institute is {{the dental}} school of King's {{and focuses on}} {{understanding}} disease, enhancing health and restoring function. The institute is the successor of Guy's Hospital Dental School, King's College Hospital Dental School, Royal Dental Hospital of London School of Dental Surgery, and the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. It {{was a part of}} King's School of Medicine and <b>Dentistry</b> until 2005, when the dental school became the Dental Institute.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Health was {{established}} in 1969 as the Health Division, from the merge of the Faculty of Medicine, and the Schools of Nursing, Laboratory Technicians, and Physiotherapy Technicians. It has {{the largest number of}} postgraduate students in the university, and the second in number of tenured professors. It offers 10 undergraduate programs which includes the degrees of Physician and Surgeon, Nurse, and Dentist, 3 graduate diplomas in medical administration, 22 medical specialties, 4 nursing specialties, 3 <b>dentistry</b> specialties, 5 Master's degrees, and a Doctorate in medical research with 3 emphasis areas.|$|E
5|$|The largest use of {{palladium}} {{today is}} in catalytic converters. Palladium {{is also used}} in jewelry, <b>dentistry,</b> watch making, blood sugar test strips, aircraft spark plugs, surgical instruments, and electrical contacts. Palladium {{is also used to}} make professional transverse (concert or classical) flutes. As a commodity, palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964. Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum. Because it absorbs hydrogen, palladium is a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Under Warren's leadership, {{the school}} grew steadily, adding Schools of <b>Dentistry,</b> Nursing, and Public Health. Against some {{influential}} opposition, Warren established his medical {{school on the}} UCLA campus rather than {{in another part of}} the city. He strove to integrate not only the structures but the faculty with other departments of the university. He fostered the development of a major biomedical library as both a tangible and intellectual link between the life sciences and the health sciences.|$|E

5|$|With {{the monks}} expelled, Charterhouse was requisitioned and {{remained}} {{as a private}} dwelling until its reestablishment by Thomas Sutton in 1611 as a charitable foundation forming the school named Charterhouse and almshouses known as Sutton's Hospital in Charterhouse on its former site. Some of the property was damaged during The Blitz, but it remains largely intact, whilst the school was relocated to Godalming in 1872; part of the site is also now occupied by Barts and The London School of Medicine and <b>Dentistry.</b> Until 1899 Charterhouse was extra-parochial, when it became a civil parish incorporated in the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on higher education. The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903. Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the university in 1927. The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh, to prepare students for leadership in diplomacy and foreign commerce. The School of <b>Dentistry</b> became independent of the School of Medicine in 1956. The School of Business was separated from the SFS in 1957. In 1998 it was renamed the McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough.|$|E
5|$|Greed is a 1924 American silent film, {{written and}} {{directed}} by Erich von Stroheim and based on the 1899 Frank Norris novel McTeague. It stars Gibson Gowland as Dr. John McTeague, ZaSu Pitts as his wife Trina Sieppe and Jean Hersholt as McTeague's friend and eventual enemy Marcus Schouler. The film tells the story of McTeague, a San Francisco dentist, who marries his best friend Schouler's girlfriend Trina.
