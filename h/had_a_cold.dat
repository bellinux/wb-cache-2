5|$|Best and McCartney {{spent three}} {{hours in the}} Davidwache Police Station, and were {{deported}} on 1 December 1960. Lennon's work permit was revoked {{a few days later}} and he went home by train, but as Sutcliffe <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> he stayed in Hamburg. Sutcliffe later borrowed money from Kirchherr (his German girlfriend) for the airfare back to Liverpool in early January 1961. Back in Liverpool, no one contacted each other for two weeks, but Best and his mother made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group's equipment.|$|E
5|$|Sajak and White have starred on the {{syndicated}} version continuously as host and hostess, respectively, since it began, except for very limited occasions. During {{two weeks in}} January 1991, Tricia Gist, the girlfriend and future wife of Griffin's son Tony, filled in for White {{when she and her}} new husband, restaurateur George San Pietro, were honeymooning. Gist returned for the week of episodes airing March 11 through 15, 1991, because White <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> at the time of taping. On an episode in November 1996, when Sajak proved unable to host the bonus round segment because of laryngitis, he and White traded places for that segment. On the March 4, 1997 episode, Rosie O'Donnell co-hosted the third round with White after O'Donnell's name was used in a puzzle.|$|E

25|$|Early in February 1873, Drummond {{returned}} home exhausted from having helped fight a bushfire that was threatening his paddocks and homestead, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> bath and caught pneumonia. He died {{about a week}} later on 8 February 1873, and was buried alongside his parents, his brother and one of his children at Hawthornden.|$|E
25|$|Climbing the Galibier, Eugène Christophe {{broke the}} fork of his bicycle. This {{was the third}} time in his career that this happened. He walked to the top, and down the entire descent before he could fix it. He {{finished}} the stage three hours after the winner. The leader of the race, Alavoine, also suffered from mechanical problems. His chain broke several times, and in the cold rain he had to put it back on. He also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> and could not go along with his competitors. Heusghem attacked on that stage, and won back more than half an hour, and was then third in the general classification.|$|E
25|$|Clementine {{gave birth}} to her fourth child, Marigold Frances Churchill, on 15 November 1918, four days after the {{official}} end of the First World War. In the early days of August 1921, the Churchills' children were entrusted to a French nursery governess in Kent, Mlle. Rose. Clementine travelled to Eaton Hall to play tennis with Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster, and his family. While still under the care of Mlle. Rose, Marigold <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> but was reported to have recovered from the illness. As the illness progressed with hardly any notice, it turned into septicaemia. Rose sent for Clementine, but the illness proved fatal on 23 August 1921, and Marigold was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery three days later.|$|E

25|$|In October 1960, The Beatles left Koschmider's {{club and}} worked at the Top Ten Club, which was run by Peter Eckhorn. When McCartney and drummer Pete Best {{went back to the}} Bambi Kino to get their {{belongings}} they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, they found a condom, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of their room, and set fire to it. There was no real damage, but Koschmider reported them for attempted arson. McCartney and Best spent three hours in a local jail and were deported, as was Harrison, for working under the legal age limit. Lennon's work permit was revoked a few days later and he went home by train, but Sutcliffe <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> and stayed in Hamburg, and then flew home.|$|E
500|$|The major voice work of E.T. for {{the film}} was {{performed}} by Pat Welsh. She smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, which gave her voice a quality that sound effects creator Ben Burtt liked. She spent nine-and-a-half hours recording her part, and was paid $380 by Burtt for her services. He also recorded 16 other people and various animals to create E.T.'s [...] "voice". These included Spielberg, Debra Winger, his sleeping wife, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> a burp from his USC film professor, raccoons, otters, and horses.|$|E
500|$|Sutcliffe's {{popularity}} grew {{after he}} began wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses and tight trousers. Sutcliffe's high spot was singing [...] "Love Me Tender", which drew more applause {{than the other}} Beatles, and increased the friction between him and McCartney. Lennon also started to criticise Sutcliffe, making jokes about Sutcliffe's size and playing. On 5 December 1960, Harrison {{was sent back to}} Britain for being under-age. McCartney and Best were deported for attempted arson at the Bambi Kino, which left Lennon and Sutcliffe in Hamburg. Lennon took a train home, but as Sutcliffe <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> he stayed in Hamburg. Sutcliffe later borrowed money from his girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, in order to fly back to Liverpool on Friday, 20 January 1961, although he returned to Hamburg in March 1961, with the other Beatles.|$|E

500|$|The band's name, {{according}} to Erna's statement in a 1999 interview, [...] "I was {{making fun of}} somebody who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> sore on his lip {{and the next day}} I had one myself and somebody said, It looks like God smacked your face for making fun. The name stuck and they went by Godsmack from then on. We were aware of the Alice in Chains song but didn't really think much about it." [...] In 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled All Wound Up. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.|$|E
500|$|The creators started {{brainstorming}} {{possibilities for}} the short film in June 2014. After early discussions about Olaf, head story artist Marc Smith [...] pitched the idea of {{what might happen if}} Elsa <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> which became the basis for the short's plot. The directors began working on the short in June and by August were back in the recording studio with the cast to lay down vocal tracks. The production of Frozen Fever took six months. All of the animators from Frozen wanted to come back to animate at least one shot on Frozen Fever, resulting in a large number of animator credits for a short film. They struggled to squeeze the animation phase of the short's production into a tight time slot in fall 2014 after animation wrapped on Big Hero 6 and before the studio's animators had to start working on subsequent features.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{episode was}} shot in Cardiff, in November 2004. The weather changed {{frequently}} during filming, and the cast began to fall ill; Eccleston <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold.</b> The production team selected several streets that looked similar. Most of the streets were {{in the community of}} Grangetown. The streets did not require much work for them to resemble 1980s streets; only a few satellite dishes were taken down. The church is St Paul's Church, also in Grangetown. The set of the Tyler's flat was redressed for the time period. For the 1980s style, members of the cast and crew brought in photographs of themselves from the '80s; for example, peach dresses and [...] "big hair" [...] were incorporated, but these elements were not meant to be distracting. Camille Coduri, who played Jackie, wore a wig for this episode. Some of the conversation between Rose and her father in the car was cut because the car had made the dialogue delivery too [...] "bouncy". Piper was scared of holding the baby. Because the baby is present throughout the majority of the episode, but they were limited to how many hours they could work with the infant, an [...] "artificial baby" [...] was used as a placeholder in some scenes.|$|E

500|$|The {{final cut}} of the theatrically {{released}} film runs for 142 minutes, and was dedicated to Allen Greene, Darabont's former agent who died during filming from AIDS. The film's first edit ran for nearly {{two and a half}} hours, which Glotzer considered [...] "long," [...] and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of Red adjusting to life post incarceration; Darabont said that in test screenings the audience seemed to be getting impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that Red would not make it. Another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating Andy's escape tunnel; it was thought this slowed down the action. The film originally <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> open that played out Andy's crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more [...] "punchy" [...] opening. One scripted scene, which Darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule. In the scene, a dreaming Red is sucked into the poster of Rita Hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the Pacific shore, saying [...] "I am terrified, there is no way home." [...] Darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.|$|E
500|$|Some {{points of}} the work were {{inspired}} by Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, and other [...] "hip-hop style eccentrics". The songs on the album have heavy lyrical underlies, noted by several critics. The comic-esque [...] "Way 2 Many Chickz" [...] described as talking about [...] "a string of almost-conquests better left unvanquished": [...] "Chick <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> sore that looked like John McCain." [...] On [...] "Cashmere", Ben J and Legacy [...] "try to outdo each other to win {{the attention of a}} young woman, but, predictably, she spurns them both". The lyrics also cover their difference in style, as seen in [...] "Cricketz", as Legacy raps, [...] "Jeans stay skinny like I starve my fabric, Another damn thing/You’ll never see me care about another man’s jeans." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times responded, [...] "Baggy has been de rigueur in hip-hop for so long it’s easy to forget that 25 years ago, rappers gladly wore tight denim. Now it’s cause for a fight." [...] Some of the lyrics use double entendre, with the duo referring to themselves as [...] "rejects" [...] and [...] "jerks" [...] on [...] "Dot Com", which The Los Angeles Times called [...] "both a double-entendre for the dance moves spurring the craze, and illustrative of their generation’s reclamation of formerly nerdy archetypes." ...|$|E

2500|$|McGee has a {{reputation}} for telling tall tales, and there are occasional jokes linking this propensity to his name [...] "Fibber". [...] In the episode [...] "Fibber Changes His Name" [...] (March 25, 1941), he {{goes so far as to}} claim that [...] "Fibber" [...] is his actual given name and not just a nickname. [...] According to McGee, [...] "I was named after my fourth cousin, Walpole J. Fimmer [...]. but the minister who christened me <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> in his head." ...|$|E

So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for." [...] She also said that [...] "I wrote that song on the end of my bed. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold.</b> I was waiting for my bath to run. I'd found out that he'd got engaged to someone else." ...|$|E
