25|$|On 27 May, Joseph sent Clausel {{an order}} asking {{for him to}} return the {{divisions}} of Barbot, Foy and Taupin, if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> using them. At this time it might take eight to ten days to get a courier through to Clausel's 15,000-man column. On 15 June, Clausel marched from Pamplona, heading for Logroño, hoping to join Joseph. From Logroño he turned northwest and reached Treviño on 22 June, completely unaware of the Battle of Vitoria the day before. At last, Clausel heard about the French defeat and his column marched south to Viana on 23 June. The next day he tried to go north to Salvatierra but turned around when he received reports {{of the magnitude of}} the Vitoria disaster. On 25 June Clausel picked up the garrison of Logroño and marched northeast toward Pamplona. But reports that the British were trying to intercept his column caused him to swerve south and cross the Ebro River at Lodosa on 26 June.|$|E

25|$|Following his loss, Bauman {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> with politics and began organizing bicycle tours. In 1994, he organized Cycle Vietnam, the first large-scale American bicycle tour of that country. In 1996, Bauman created Portland Bridge Pedal, a bicycle tour with a route over all 10 Portland bridges that cross the Willamette River. Bauman {{said he was}} inspired to organize such an event after he had {{a view of the}} 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens from the Marquam Bridge in his car and thought bicyclists should have a chance to enjoy the views normally available only to drivers. The first event drew 7,500 riders; Providence Health & Services began sponsoring the event a year later and renamed it the Providence Bridge Pedal. By 2007, the tour was the third-largest of the largest organized cycle tours in the world, behind New York City's Five Boro Bike Tour and Montreal's Tour de l'Île. Bauman is still involved with the event.|$|E
500|$|After Germany's defeat, Salinger {{signed up}} for a six-month period of [...] "Denazification" [...] duty in Germany for the Counterintelligence Corps. He lived in Weissenburg and, soon after, married Sylvia Welter. He brought her to the United States in April 1946, but the {{marriage}} fell apart after eight months and Sylvia returned to Germany. In 1972, Salinger's daughter Margaret was with him when he received a letter from Sylvia. He looked at the envelope, and without reading it, tore it apart. It {{was the first time he}} had heard from her since the breakup, but as Margaret put it, [...] "when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> with a person, he was through with them." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the season}} ended, Berg {{took his first}} trip abroad, sailing from New York to Paris. He settled in the Latin Quarter in an {{apartment}} that overlooked the Sorbonne, where he enrolled in 32 different classes. In Paris he developed a habit he kept {{for the rest of}} his life: reading several newspapers daily. Until Berg finished reading a paper, he considered it [...] "alive" [...] and refused to let anyone else touch it. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> with it, he would consider the paper [...] "dead" [...] and anybody could read it. In January 1924, instead of heading back to New York and getting himself into shape for the upcoming baseball season, Berg toured Italy and Switzerland.|$|E

Shay was suspended indefinitely in late June 1911 after a fight with an umpire. In October 1911, Shay abruptly resigned as the manager in Kansas City. He declined to say what prompted his resignation {{and said that he}} might not be permanently finished with baseball, but he said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> with the Kansas City club. When asked {{about the possibility of a}} major league managing job, Shay responded, [...] "There is nothing to be said now, but there may be something later." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} month of the season, Ruth {{concluded}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> even as a part-time player. As early as May 12, he asked Fuchs to let him retire. Ultimately, Fuchs persuaded Ruth to remain at least until after the Memorial Day doubleheader in Philadelphia. In the interim was a western road trip, at which the rival teams had scheduled days to honor him. In Chicago and St. Louis, Ruth performed poorly, and his batting average sank to [...]155, with only two additional home runs for a total of three on the season so far. In the first two games in Pittsburgh, Ruth had only one hit, though a long fly caught by Paul Waner probably would have been a home run in any other ballpark besides Forbes Field.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen in {{his living}} room and began {{assembling}} the tools he would need to create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like Indiana Jones and all the stuff we liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished,</b> Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.|$|E
500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> with making music for public consumption, that he {{currently}} has no audience {{and in the}} past few years recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision to stop making music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is what I was doing between 2008 and 2012. I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, so I have a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E
500|$|Krusty is a hard-living {{entertainment}} veteran, sometimes {{depicted as}} a jaded, burned-out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, pornography, Percodan, Pepto-Bismol, and Xanax. He instantly becomes depressed {{as soon as the}} cameras stop rolling; Marge states in [...] "The Sweetest Apu", that, [...] "off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man". Krusty appeared to have used cocaine, one time emerging from a restaurant bathroom with white powder under his nose, but he explained that he was simply researching a part for a film, in which he played himself. In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Krusty as [...] "the wizened veteran, the total pro" [...] who lives the celebrity life. He is miserable but he needs his celebrity status. In [...] "Bart the Fink", Bart inadvertently reported Krusty for tax fraud to the Internal Revenue Service and as a result Krusty lost most of his money. Bart soon discovered that Krusty had faked his death and was living as Rory B. Bellows on a boat. Krusty declared that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> with the life of a celebrity and was unconvinced when Bart reminded him of his fans and his entourage. Finally, Bart told Krusty that leaving show business would mean losing his celebrity status, which convinced Krusty to return.

500|$|West Indies' loss of form {{continued}} in late 1997 when they lost every international match during their tour of Pakistan. Ambrose played in {{two out of}} West Indies' three matches in an ODI tournament, taking one wicket, but his performance in taking one wicket in the two Test matches he played—he missed the third match with injury—prompted Fazeer Mohammed, writing in Wisden, to describe Ambrose as [...] "a shadow of his former self". Any danger that Ambrose might have retired after this series was forestalled when Brian Lara was appointed West Indies captain and immediately spoke to Ambrose and Walsh {{to ask them to}} continue in the team. When England toured the West Indies between January and April 1998, he took 30 wickets at 14.26 to top the bowling averages for the series. Many of the pitches during the tour were poor for batting, but Ambrose was very effective, particularly in the second, third and fourth Tests. In addition, he dismissed Mike Atherton, the England captain, six times in the series. Scyld Berry wrote in Wisden that Ambrose was [...] "back to something near his peak form... defied every prediction that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>finished</b> after his tour of Pakistan." [...] In the second Test, Ambrose took eight wickets; he conceded only 23 runs from 26 overs in the first innings and bowled a spell of five wickets for 16 runs from 47 deliveries in the second to complete figures of five for 52. Having won the second match, West Indies lost the third, but according to Matthew Engel, [...] "Ambrose's abiding power was the most constant feature of a fluctuating match". His eight wickets in the game, including five for 25 in the first innings, took him past fifty Test wickets in Trinidad. He followed up with six wickets in West Indies victory in the fourth Test, taking four for 38 in the final innings. Tony Cozier wrote that Ambrose [...] "thundered in, arms and knees pumping like pistons, to generate all of his old pace." [...] Following the Test series, which West Indies won 3–1, Ambrose played in the first three matches of the ODI series, and took three wickets.|$|E
