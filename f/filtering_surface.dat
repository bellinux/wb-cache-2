50|$|The {{flamingos}} feed {{from the}} bottom layer of the lake for small particles, mainly diatoms. They have a deep-keeled bill; the upper mandible is narrower than the lower, creating a gape on the dorsal surface of the bill. The bill morphology facilitates feeding of diatoms through inertial impaction. This mechanism entails that food particles denser than water, such as diatoms, would impact the <b>filtering</b> <b>surface</b> in the bill causing water to flow out of the mouth and leaving diatoms in the flamingo's bill. The flamingos forage in shallow salty waters for resources. They exhibit the most flexible foraging pattern {{compared to that of}} the Chilean and James's flamingos.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an optical system for {{measuring}} the amount of dust deposition on commercial bag filters is presented. Dust laden gas is blown onto the filter, the dust remains {{on the surface and}} forms a compact layer called filter cake. For academic simulations as well as practical filter design it is desirable to know the thickness of this cake over the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> during operation, when the cake is building up and after automatic cleaning of the bag. It is shown that the principle of calibrated shape from stereo with pattern projection gives a robust 3 D reconstruction of the <b>filter</b> <b>surface,</b> even under industrial conditions. Rigid registration of surface patches using landmark points, combined with an Iterative Closest Point Algorithm as a refinement procedure gives a continuous 3 D model of the entire visible <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> Cake thickness is calculated by taking the height difference of the two surface models, acquired before and after dust deposition. The challenging problem is {{to take care of the}} nonrigid deformation of the filter cloth. A global deformation model is presented using Thin Plate Spline Interpolation based on landmark points on the <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, {{the product}} range was {{extended}} by backwash filters {{to protect the}} heat exchangers and condensers from macro fouling, like stones, pieces of wood, fibres, plastic sheeting, and mussels. Foreign matter will first settle on the <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> As fouling builds up, differential pressure between filter inlet and outlet increases and the filter has to be cleaned by backwashing. For this purpose an electrically driven rotor covers the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> which is connected with a pipe leading outside. Installed in this pipe is a valve that is opened during the backwash process. The accumulated fouling is drawn off and discharged via the pipe which, downstream of the condenser, leads to the main cooling water pipe or a debris container. This technology was spread in power stations and industrial plants the world over. Depending on the flow rates to be filtered, the filters are produced in nominal diameters from 150 mm to DN 3200 mm.

40|$|A stereo {{computer}} vision system as a thickness measurement device is introduced. The challenging task is to measure the thickness of dust deposits {{over the surface of}} a flexible cloth filter with a target resolution of 0. 5 mm 2 per measurement in the filter plane and a depth resolution of up to 50 µm. The total area to be measured is 100 mm × 2500 mm. There is practically no texture present on the dusty <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> Analyzing dust deposition over the whole filter length during operation has not been possible so far and promises to give insight to air flow in the filter chamber, behaviour of different filter materials and design flaws of filter chambers. Our approach is to first create dense 3 D-reconstructions of surface patches. This is done using a calibrated stereo setup and a standard slide projector that provides texture by projecting a random pattern onto the <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> The thus obtained surface patches are registered against each other using an ICP algorithm to get a complete 3 D model of the <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> This step is done twice, for the clean <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> and for the surface including dust deposits. We finally retrieve the actual depth information by registering the clean and dusty models using markers applied to the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> and calculating the difference.

50|$|Cartridge filter {{technology}} {{was invented in}} the mid-1960s, cartridge filters have a large surface areas enabling them to operate for long periods. Cartridge filter systems also permit better water flow - thus, placing less strain on the filter pump. These types of filters are also easiest to clean by using a flow of high-pressure water from a hose. The filters are made of polyester or other material that can provide a superfine <b>filtering</b> <b>surface.</b> The pleats {{are the key to}} the filter's operation. The tight pleats, or folds, allow for a large amount of material to be used in a small container. The more material used, the larger the surface area available to capture dirt or debris from the water. The fabric catches and holds the impurities until the filter can be cleaned or replaced. There 3 parts to a cartridge filter construction,end caps (made of plastic) core structure to provide strength (most often PVC) and the pleated media (most often polyester with a continuously graded fixed pore structure, these cartridges provide pre- and final filtration within the same cartridge resulting in lower overall filtration and disposal cost.|$|E
40|$|Hyperglycemia and {{development}} of glomerular pathology: Diabetes compared with galactosemia. Dogs {{were randomly assigned to}} experimental galactosemia or diabetes, or to a normal untreated group, and diabetic animals were then randomly assigned to either poor or good glycemic control. At five years duration, kidneys from the animals were compared by quantitative stereology. Glomerulopathy appeared in the poor control diabetes group, and the thickness of glomerular capillary basement membrane, the glomerular tuft volume, and the fraction of glomerulus occupied by mesangium were each significantly greater than normal. The capillary <b>filtering</b> <b>surface</b> area per glomerulus was supra-normal also, but nonetheless was subnormal relative to glomerular volume. The development of glomerulopathy was significantly inhibited in dogs assigned to good glycemic control. In galactosemic animals, the basement membrane thickness was greater than normal, but the glomerular volume, fractional and absolute volumes of mesangium, and capillary <b>filtering</b> <b>surface</b> area remained normal. The polyol concentration in renal cortex seemed elevated by galactosemia no less than by diabetes, and was highest in galactosemia. The galactosemic animals are known to have developed a retinopathy morphologically comparable to that of diabetic patients and diabetic dogs. Thus, sequelae of hyperglycemia sufficient to produce glomerular basement membrane thickening and retinopathy proved not necessarily sufficient to produce the mesangial expansion and glomerular hypertrophy typical of diabetes...|$|E

The modification procedure did not significantly change the porous structure in the filters, as was demonstrated by SEM and porometry. Using 14 C-labeled poly(ethyleneimine) it was shown that nearly a complete coverage (0. 1 mg/m 2) was achieved that did not desorb from the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> during contact with blood plasma. When the filtration was carried out with purified leukocytes in the absence of red cells, platelets, and blood plasma, the number of cells removed by modified filters (> 95 %) was significantly higher as compared to the removal with unmodified filters (80 %). However, {{no significant differences between the}} filters were found when the filtration was performed with whole blood. This finding was unexpected, because it was shown before that immobilization of poly(ethyleimine) on solid polyurethane film, surfaces promoted the adhesion of leukocytes from whole blood.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{established}} {{that in a}} variety of human glomerulopathies the reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is due to a marked lowering of the ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf). To identify the factors which lower Kf, we measured the <b>filtering</b> <b>surface</b> area per glomerulus, filtration slit frequency, basement membrane thickness, and GFR and its determinants in patients with minimal change and membraneous nephropathies and in age-matched healthy controls. Overall values of Kf for the two kidneys were calculated from GFR, renal plasma flow rate, systemic colloid osmotic pressure, and three assumed values for the transcapillary pressure difference. "Experimental" values of the glomerular hydraulic permeability (kexp) were then calculated from Kf, glomerular <b>filtering</b> <b>surface</b> area, and estimates {{of the total number of}} nephrons of the two kidneys. Independent estimates of the glomerular hydraulic permeability (kmodel) were obtained using a recent mathematical model that is based on analyses of viscous flow through the various structural components of the glomerular capillary wall. Individual values of basement membrane thickness and filtration slit frequency were used as inputs in this model. The results indicate that the reductions of Kf in both nephropathies can be attributed entirely to reduced glomerular hydraulic permeability. The mean values of kexp and kmodel were very similar in both disorders and much smaller in the nephrotic groups than in healthy controls. There was good agreement between kexp and kmodel for any given group of subjects. It was shown that, in both groups of nephrotics, filtration slit frequency was a more important determinant of the water flow resistance than was basement membrane thickness. The decrease in filtration slit frequency observed in both disorders caused the average path length for the filtrate to increase, thereby explaining the decreased hydraulic permeability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} (SEM) method of fibre sizing assumes that all fibres lie flat on filters. This appears to be true for samples deposited from aqueous suspension, but in some airborne samples only about 60 % of fibres lie flat on the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> {{and many of the}} rest are balanced at high angles to the <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> These inclined fibres will appear foreshortened when the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> is viewed in conventional orientation during SEM analysis.

The results of a preliminary investigation of the effects of variable fibre inclination in fibre counts and size data for two fibre types suggest that the SEM data do give an underestimate of the number, length and therefore volume of longer fibres in some samples.

40|$|Rotating {{cylindrical}} filtration displays {{significantly reduced}} plugging of filter pores and build-up of a cake layer, {{but the number}} and range of parameters that can be adjusted complicates the design of these devices. Twelve individual parameters were investigated experimentally by measuring the build-up of particles on the rotating cylindrical filter after a fixed time of operation. The build-up of particles on the filter depends on the rotational speed, the radial filtrate flow, the particle size and the gap width. Other parameters, such as suspension concentration and total flow rate are less important. Of the four mechanisms present in rotating filters to reduce pore plugging and cake build-up, axial shear, rotational shear, centrifugal sedimentation and vortical motion, the evidence suggests rotational shear is the dominant mechanism, although the other mechanisms still play minor roles.

In this article flow past an irregular rough surface is investigated, based on a scan of a rough graphite surface that serves as a typical example for an irregular rough surface found in engineering applications. The scanned map of surface height versus lateral coordinates is filtered in Fourier space to remove features on very small scales and to create a smoothly varying periodic representation of the surface. The surface is used as a no-slip boundary in direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow. For the resolution of the irregular boundary an iterative embedded boundary method is employed. The effects of the <b>surface</b> <b>filtering</b> on the turbulent flow are investigated by studying a series of surfaces with decreasing level of filtering. Mean flow, Reynolds stress and dispersive stress profiles show good agreement once a sufficiently large number of Fourier modes are retained.
