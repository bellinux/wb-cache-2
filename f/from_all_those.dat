5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E

The family took a shorter route through Switzerland, arriving in Geneva on 20 August, where the children gave two concerts, and were received by the distinguished composer André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry. Many years later Grétry wrote of this encounter: [...] "I wrote for him [...] an Allegro in E flat, difficult but without pretension; he played it, and everyone, except myself, {{thought it was a}} miracle.

"What Is Life" [...] was {{included}} on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison as well as 2009's [...] The song has also been featured {{in a number of}} popular movies: Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), during the [...] "May 11, 1980" [...] sequence; Tom Shadyac's Patch Adams (1998); and, more recently, Sam Mendes' Away We Go (2009). In late 2012, [...] "What Is Life" [...] was used in advance promotion for the film This Is 40, directed by Judd Apatow, although it was omitted from the accompanying soundtrack album. According to Rolling Stone: [...] "Today, many people know it merely as a song <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> soundtracks: it's in This Is 40, Patch Adams, Goodfellas and many more. It's almost as ubiquitous as 'Let My Love Open the Door' or 'Solsbury Hill.'" [...] In Scorsese's 2011 documentary , [...] "What Is Life" [...] plays over a sequence of 1969 photos of Harrison – with, variously, Preston, Jackie Lomax, the Plastic Ono Band, Clapton and Ravi Shankar – immediately before which, archive footage shows him discussing the restrictions he felt within the Beatles and how the band [...] "had to implode".|$|E
500|$|The band {{performed}} nearly 90 {{shows in}} the following year, touring as a five-piece. The band also purchased 432 acres of land in Juliette, Georgia for $160,000 and nicknamed it [...] "the Farm"; it soon became a group hangout and fulfilled bassist Oakley's communal dreams. Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from {{the death of his}} friend: he excessively drank and consumed drugs, and was losing weight quickly. According to friends and family, he appeared to have lost [...] "all hope, his heart, his drive, his ambition, [...] his direction" [...] following Duane’s death. [...] "Everything Berry had envisioned for everybody—including the crew, the women and children—was shattered on the day Duane died, and he didn’t care after that," [...] said roadie Kim Payne. Oakley repeatedly wished to [...] "get high, be high, and stay high," [...] causing quiet concern <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> around him. On November 11, 1972, slightly inebriated and overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed. He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull. Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon.|$|E

[...] Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the song four stars, explaining that [...] "Only Brit can make a flute sound sexy. Seriously, few pop stars can pull off a flute and Brit does it with ease." [...] Aaron-Spencer Charles of Metro said that [...] "the verses, chorus and bridge all work perfectly for Ms. Spears, showing that she still has it <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> years ago." [...] Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly called it her best vocal performance of the album, and added that [...] "it has a spark and a mischievous sass to it – and these days anytime Britney shows even just a bit of her old liveliness and independence, we like it." [...] Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic commented the song [...] "isn't exactly the progressive stylings of a Janelle Monáe , but damn if it’s not catchy and interesting." [...] The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski claimed that the album [...] "s not all dance-floor narcotics", adding that [...] "Inside Out", [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] and [...] "Criminal" [...] "add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said the production of Femme Fatale is [...] "polished, intriguing and – best of all – fun", exemplifying [...] "Inside Out", the piano breakdown in [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] and the flute in [...] "Criminal".|$|E
500|$|At 4:30 p.m., Marj Saint and Pete Fleming's wife, Olive, {{were waiting}} for the call from Saint.

The Commander in Chief of the Caribbean Command, Lieutenant General William K. Harrison, was contacted, and Quito-based radio station HCJB released a news bulletin saying that five men were missing in Huaorani territory. Soon, aircraft from the United States Air Rescue Service in Panama were flying over the jungle, and a ground search party consisting of missionaries and military personnel was organized. The first two of the bodies were found on Wednesday, January 11, and on Thursday, Ed McCully's body was identified by a group of Quechuas. They took his watch as evidence of the finding but did not move his body from its location {{on the bank of the}} Curaray; it later washed away. [...] Two more bodies were found on January 12. The searchers hoped that one of the unidentified bodies would be McCully, thinking that perhaps one of the men had escaped. However, on January 13, all four of the bodies found were positively identified by watches and wedding rings, and McCully's body was not among them, confirming that all five were dead. In the midst of a tropical storm, they were buried in a common grave at Palm Beach on January 14 by members of the ground search party.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{spotted by}} Geoff Cook, Durham's coach, Onions made his second XI debut {{for the club}} {{at the age of}} 18. He was offered a {{contract}} with the club and opted to become a professional cricketer rather than take a sports science choice at university, which was his other option. Onions started in the team as the fourth bowler. Looking back on his early career, he felt that he tried too hard early on. On one occasion he recalled how [...] "I remember being thrown the ball at an important stage of a game at Scarborough, and Phil Jaques hit me for four successive fours. I was thinking 'I'm not sure I can do this.' But Dale Benkenstein was a huge influence as captain, and you have to learn <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> experiences. Otherwise I could not have done what I did in my first season of Test cricket. I often went for 15 to 20 runs in my first three overs, but always came back strongly." [...] In 2006, Onions regularly opened the bowling for Durham with Ottis Gibson.|$|E
2500|$|In this situation, {{several groups}} {{belonging}} to four different circles (the royal court, the antifascist parties, the fascism {{and the general}} Staff) started {{to look for a}} way out. Aristocrats such as Crown Princess Maria José, members of the upper classes and politicians belonging to the pre-Fascist elites, independently started plots aiming at establishing contacts with the Allies. Unfortunately, none of them understood that the war had become ideological with the declaration of Casablanca stating that the Allies would only accept unconditional surrender. [...] Moreover, despite the Crown Princess' involvement, the Anglo-Americans expected a move from higher-placed personalities, like the King, and disregarded contacts with these groups. The antifascist parties, weakened by 20 years of dictatorship, were still in an embryonic state. Moreover, all except the communists and the republicans of the Partito d’Azione waited for a signal from Victor Emmanuel, but in vain: the King's character, realist and skeptical at the same time, his fears, his constitutional scruples, {{and the fact that the}} monarchy was almost certainly finished regardless of how the war turned out contributed to his inaction. The King had considerable contempt towards the old pre-Fascist politicians, whom he ironically called [...] "revenants" [...] ("ghosts" [...] in French) and didn't entirely trust those who claimed that the Anglo-Americans would not seek to exact revenge upon Italy. Last but not least, Victor Emmanuel retained his trust in Mussolini, and he hoped that the Duce could save the situation once again. Consequently, the King kept his own counsel and isolated himself <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> who tried to learn his intentions. Among them was the new Chief of the General Staff, General Vittorio Ambrosio, a Piemontese, [...] "not of high intelligence", but devoted to the King and hostile to the Germans. Ambrosio was persuaded that the war was lost for Italy, but he never thought to take a personal initiative to change the situation without first consulting with Victor Emmanuel. On the other side Ambrosio, helped by his right-hand man, Giuseppe Castellano, and by Giacomo Carboni (both of whom would play key roles in the happenings which would lead to the armistice of 8 September 1943), slowly proceeded to occupy several key positions in the armed forces with officials devoted to the king. Moreover, he tried to bring back to Italy as many forces as possible among those which were abroad, but it was difficult to do that without raising the suspicions of the Germans.|$|E
