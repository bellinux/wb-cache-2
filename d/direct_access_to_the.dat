The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were built with the improvements listed above.|$|E
5|$|Elephant & Castle {{is located}} in the Elephant and Castle area of Newington in the London Borough of Southwark in central London. The station is in both Travelcard Zones 1 and 2 and is on the Bank branch of the Northern line between Kennington and Borough stations, and is the {{southern}} terminus of the Bakerloo line, the next station being Lambeth North. The station has two surface buildings, separated by a large traffic intersection. The northern building provides the most <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bakerloo line, while the southern one is linked more directly to the Northern line.|$|E

However, {{merchant}} ships and ferries dock at Kwun Tong Pier and Lei Yue Mun Pier, which are both within 15 minutes' walk from Lam Tin, and provide surface transport for Lam Tin residents. Another reason for Lam Tin's absence of an outlet to the Harbour {{is the presence of}} an Eastern Harbour Crossing entrance inside the district, whose buses and MTR overtook ferries for cross-harbour transport.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special cell that compensated for the different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{proposed}} by the North London Railway (NLR).

5|$|In March 1942, the Military Board was {{abolished}} and General Sir Thomas Blamey {{was appointed}} Commander in Chief. Blamey decided {{that after the}} hectic events of the previous months, Sturdee needed a rest and appointed him as Head of the Australian Military Mission to Washington, D.C., where the war's strategy was now being decided. Sturdee accepted on condition that after a year's duty in Washington he would be appointed to an important command. In Washington, Sturdee represented Australia before the Combined Chiefs of Staff and managed to obtain the right of <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall. For his services as Chief of the General Staff, Sturdee was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture {{the look of the}} celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|In the 850s, {{the most}} {{persistent}} {{threats to the}} Empire were the emirate of Melitene (Malatya) under Umar al-Aqta, the emirate of Tarsus under Ali ibn Yahya ("Ali the Armenian"), the emirate of Qaliqala (Theodosiopolis, modern Erzurum) and the Paulicians of Tephrike under their leader Karbeas. Melitene, in particular, was {{a major threat to}} Byzantium as its location on the western side of the Anti-Taurus range allowed <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Anatolian plateau. An indication of the threat posed by these states came in 860, when their combined actions turned the year into a veritable annus horribilis for the Byzantines: Umar and Karbeas raided deep into Asia Minor and returned with much plunder; they were followed shortly after by another raid by the forces of Tarsus under Ali, while a naval attack from Syria sacked the major Byzantine naval base at Attaleia.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} what {{proportion}} of the corps commanders had risen from the ranks, but {{it is likely to}} have been small as most rankers would be nearing retirement age {{by the time they were}} given command of a regiment and would be promoted no further. In contrast, directly commissioned protectores and tribuni dominated the higher echelons, as they were usually young men when they started. For such men, promotion to corps command could be swift e.g. the future emperor Theodosius I was a dux at age 28. It was also possible for rungs on the rank-ladder to be skipped. Commanders of scholae, who enjoyed <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> emperor, often reached the highest rank of magister militum: e.g. the barbarian-born officer Agilo was promoted direct to magister militum from tribunus of a schola in 360, skipping the dux stage.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 2006, the Turnpike Authority {{released}} its proposals regarding Interchange 8. The old Interchange 8 {{was to be}} demolished and replaced with a new interchange. The new Exit 8 would end at the intersection with Route 33, Milford Road, and the 133 bypass (on {{the east side of}} the expressway, instead of the west). This new Exit 8 would grant <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bypass (without going through any traffic lights), as well as to 33, using grade-separated interchanges. The new toll gate was to feature a total of 10 lanes at the new facility. The new interchange opened in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|The highway briefly {{parallels}} Fall Creek; however, it soon splits to {{the southeast}} at a junction with CR103 (Groton City Road). From here, NY222 continues on a generally southeasterly alignment along {{the base of a}} rural valley to the Tompkins–Cortland county line. Now in the town of Cortlandville, the route loses the Cortland Road name as it curves eastward to match similar turns {{in the course of the}} valley. The highway follows a winding course until the surrounding gully empties into the much wider Tioughnioga River valley, where the route straightens out and intersects with CR119 (Sears Road). East of this point, NY222 begins to run northeastward past homes as it approaches Cortland County–Chase Field Airport. The route provides <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport and subsequently meets NY281 (West Road) at the northeastern tip of the airport property.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of design and performance evaluation of a Smart Metering or AMI network, using the Network Simulator- 2. The communication network proposed combines technologies such as, PLC and HSPDA, using data concentrators (DCs) and application and transport protocols such as DLMS/COSEM and TCP/IP. The performance evaluation results shown that introducing data concentrator inside a communication network provides a superior performance compared with others that not use it. Finally, the employment of DCs on the design also extended communication coverage and reduce <b>direct</b> <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> network...|$|R
5|$|The royal court {{consisted}} of leading nobles, office holders, ambassadors and supplicants who surrounded the king or queen. At its centre was the monarch {{and members of}} the Privy Chamber. Gentleman of the chamber were usually leading nobles or individuals with kinship links to the leading noble families. They had <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monarch, with the implication of being to exert influence, and were usually resident at the court. Although increasingly based at the royal palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh, the monarch and the court were often itinerant, spending time at one of the royal palaces, such as Linlithgow, Sterling and Falkland, or undertaking a royal progress to a part of the kingdom to ensure that the rule of law, royal authority or smooth government was maintained.|$|E

In the meantime, most nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to the indefinite on-site dry cask storage of waste in steel and concrete casks.|$|E
5|$|Although the Silk Road from China to the West was {{initially}} formulated {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu (141–87) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.|$|E
