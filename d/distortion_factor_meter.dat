This article examines propagation in cables from the fundamental principles of modern electromagnetic theory. The aim is to attempt to identify mechanisms that form a rational basis for a more objective understanding of claimed sonic anomalies in interconnects.

Lens distortions that arise from the nonlinearity of a lens are the main cause for mismatches in stitching images. We estimate the <b>distortion</b> <b>factors</b> for each image using the Division Model and linearize the projected relationships between matching distorted feature points. Because our method works at the RANSAC stage, the estimated <b>distortion</b> <b>factors</b> are further refined during the bundle adjustment phase and thus accurate <b>distortion</b> <b>factors</b> are obtained.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{harmonic}} mitigation solutions in a Romanian traction substation which supplies a railway electric transportation line. The power line measurements were made using an ABB Power+ recorder and analyzer during a whole day. The quantities recorded have been the frequency, the total rms values of the voltage and current, the current and voltage harmonic <b>distortion</b> <b>factors</b> and the first fifteen current and voltage harmonics. The analysis of data shows that the harmonic <b>distortion</b> <b>factor</b> of the voltage is always less than IEEE 519 recommended limit thanks of high power of the transformer comparatively with the power of the load. In order to keep the current distortion within allowed limits, the proposed filter installation must lead to a significant diminution of 3 rd and 5 th harmonics and a less significant diminution of the superior order harmonics. In this concrete application, the proposed solution for harmonics mitigation is based on passive power filtering. The simulations carried out under Matlab Simulink environment show that the installation of two single tuned filters for third and fifth harmonics plus a high-pass filter for higher order harmonics would reduce harmonics levels and harmonic <b>distortion</b> <b>factor</b> to within acceptable limits even in the most unfavourable situations...|$|R

The unstable reading of the analogue based power <b>factor</b> <b>meter</b> especially in the disturbance situations emerged the development of digital based power <b>factor</b> <b>meter</b> (PFM) to replace the conventional electro-dynamic types. The major advantage of using the digital based PFM is the data read by the meter can be stored easily for other applications or studies.

Generally, the digital power <b>factor</b> <b>meter</b> consists of four main parts which are power supply, inputs circuit, signal processing, and the display part.

Both signals are processed through various operational amplifier based circuits such as averager, zero detector, and differentiator.
