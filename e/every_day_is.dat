Subsequent follow-ups such as The Force Behind the Power (1991), Take Me Higher (1995), and <b>Every</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Is</b> a New Day (1999) produced similarly disappointing sales.

25|$|As per the {{instructions}} in Akilam, the Swamithope pathi conducts daily festival (i.e.) <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> considered as a festival day. So the ritual practices conducted during festival days are conducted here throughout the year, though not in a grand scale as during the other festivals. The daily Panividai starts {{very early in the}} morning. Everyday, around 3:00 A.M the Payyans and the people staying at the temple go to Muthirikkinaru and take a holy bath. Then, they return to the Pathi and start the panividai. The Payyan chant Ukappatippu, and the devotees repeat it. Then, they open the door of sanctum sanctorum. It is considered sanctifying to witness this scene with the sounding of a dozen temple bells and conch. Then, there is the Vahana pavani.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} was originally {{given to the}} hip hop group D12, but was passed on to 50 Cent because the group {{did not know how}} to approach the song.

I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 13, 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{announced}} that Ripken {{had been named}} Special Sports Envoy for the US State Department {{and that he would}} be going to China in October: [...] "...we're just delighted that somebody of Cal Ripken's stature is going to be someone who will go out and represent America so well and represent what we consider to be American values, but universal values; that hard work and diligence and the willingness to really put it all on the line <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> something that kids need to learn", said Rice. [...] "A Shortstop in China" [...] premiered on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network on May 8, 2009, chronicling Ripken's trip to China to share the game of baseball with youth and coaches while nurturing American-Chinese diplomacy. The documentary included footage from the 11 clinics Cal and former Oriole B.J. Surhoff held from Beijing to Guangzhou. The documentary also showed Ripken accepting his appointment from Rice and featured a variety of interviews, from Ripken's wife Kelly to former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Karen Hughes.|$|E
500|$|In 1945, Tracy {{returned}} to {{the stage for the}} first time in 15 years. He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a stay in hospital—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, [...] "I'm coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act." [...] The play was The Rugged Path by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: [...] "In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction". Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: [...] "I couldn't say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night... At least <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> a new day for me in films... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the music}} on Eat a Peach that was {{recorded}} after Duane's death directly dealt with the tragedy. [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More" [...] was written by Gregg Allman for his brother, Duane, immediately following his death. The song was composed on an 110-year-old Steinway piano in Studio D of Criteria. [...] "Ain't Wastin'" [...] was composed when Duane was still alive, but the lyrics deal with his passing, as well as veterans coming home from the Vietnam War. The song relates to the theme that [...] "death is an inescapable inevitability — that <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> precious." [...] "Les Brers in A Minor" [...] is an instrumental penned by Dickey Betts, and its title is [...] "bad French" [...] for [...] "less brothers." [...] When writing the song, all in the band felt something was familiar about the song; {{it turned out to}} be a solo of Betts's from live renditions of [...] "Whipping Post." [...] It resurfaced many years later on a bootleg recording. [...] "Les Brers" [...] began recording in the newly constructed Studio C of the recording complex at Criteria, but the band disliked the sound captured in the room and moved to Studio A. As a result, the recording contains a slight pitch variation due to the difficulty of matching the original speed of the instruments when the intro was spliced onto the master tape.|$|E
