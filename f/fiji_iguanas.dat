50|$|Modriki {{is one of}} the {{few places}} on which the {{endangered}} <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguana,</b> or Brachylophus vitiensis, live. These iguanas feed on a wide range of plants and insects, and spend most of their time camouflaged in the branches of trees. Only a few thousand <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguanas</b> live on the three tiny islands of western Fiji: Yadua Tabu, Macuata and Modriki.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguanas</b> are {{predominantly}} herbivorous feeding on the leaves, fruits, shoots, and flowers from trees and shrubs. These iguanas eat both the new leaves {{and the large}} flowers from trees and shrubs. Hence, it is restricted and limited to tropical dry forests and similar habitats on islands in western Fiji. Furthermore, the <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguanas</b> particularly have a preference for sweet hibiscus flowers of the Vau tree (Hibiscus tiliaceus). The vau tree {{is one of the}} species of trees where they {{spend most of their time}} residing. <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguanas</b> do not display any major or significant seasonal shifts, sex differences, or age-class differences in their diet patterns. Moreover, scientists have observed captive hatchlings even eating insects; nonetheless, adults will not.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguana,</b> {{similar to}} all other iguanas, reproduces by laying eggs.The {{breeding}} season takes place between March and April, with courtship and mating commencing in January. <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguanas</b> lay large white eggs, which have a leathery texture.The <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguana</b> is oviparous and {{has one of the}} longest incubation periods of any reptile, which can last from 189 days to nine months. [...] Female iguanas are usually found defending the eggs and guard the nest of four to six eggs. Females dig holes on the forest floor, where three to five eggs are laid and they then fill the hole or burrow. The eggs are white and leathery, with the average number of eggs in a clutch being four ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus fasciatus) is an {{arboreal}} {{species of}} lizard endemic {{to some of}} the southeastern Fijian islands. It is found in Tonga, where it was probably introduced by humans.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguana</b> is {{endemic to}} the Fiji Islands and is {{found on the}} islands of Wakaya, Moturiki, Beqa, Vatulele, Ono, Dravuni, Taveuni, Nggamea, Vanua, Balavu, Avea (Fiji), Vatu Vara, Lakeba, Aiwa, Oneata, Vanua Levu, Totoya, Kabara, and Fulaga. [...] It was {{introduced}} to the Tonga Islands, New Hebrides, and Wallis and Futuna 300 years ago. [...] It has been introduced to Vanuatu as a feral animal in the 1960s. The current wild population is less than 10,000 individuals in 29 distinct subpopulations. [...] <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguanas</b> inhabit most of the undisturbed habitats on these islands, from high cloud forests to low-lying coastal swamps.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguana</b> {{is a large}} stocky lizard {{distinguished}} from the <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguana</b> {{by the presence of}} three narrow, cream to white colored bands on males, rather than the broader bluish bands of the latter species. [...] These whitish bands often have chevrons of black scales close to them. Brachylophus vitiensis is distinguished by its larger size growing to 75 cm in length and weighing as much as 300 g. [...] It is further distinguished by the presence of a taller spiny [...] "crest" [...] on its back with spines as long as 1.5 cm running from the nape of the neck to the base of its tail.|$|R
50|$|When <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguanas</b> first hatch {{from their}} eggs they are dark green, but {{after several hours}} their skin becomes bright emerald green and narrow white bands can be seen along their body. Their eyes are reddish orange or pinkish gold in color.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the removal}} of the goats, forest area was {{increased}} by 10%-20% since 1980, which means more resources for the iguanas and a larger environment. There are many other recommended actions that should be taken {{in order for them to}} survive. The highest threat against the <b>Fiji</b> Crested <b>Iguana</b> today is predation by other animals such as the feral cat, rats, and mongoose. Physical measures should be taken to protect the iguanas from cats and mongoose, which should include removing them from the area similar to {{the removal of}} the goats. Also, the only island being monitored is Yadua Taba Island. Other islands that inhabit <b>Fiji</b> Crested <b>iguanas</b> such as Macuata, Monu, and Monuriki should also be monitored. Another action that should be taken is reforestation. The iguanas need more resources in order to repopulate, which means there should be more food trees that should be planted on the island for them to feed off of.|$|R
5000|$|B. vitiensis {{is found}} on the islands of Fiji, in the South Pacific. The species is {{restricted}} to tropical dry forests, specifically to the rain shadow forests located on certain islands in Fiji. [...] These forests {{are one of the}} most threatened vegetation types in the Pacific. A small population of the <b>Fiji</b> Crested <b>Iguana</b> - less than 80 individuals - can be {{found on the}} small island of Macuata. The majority of this species - less than 4000 individuals - is most commonly found on the island of Yadua Taba. The island is a National Trust of Fiji reserve, and is thus the only legally protected population of the <b>Fiji</b> Crested <b>Iguana.</b> The island is now also free of forest burning and the presence of goats, which was a major factor in the initial decline of the species. [...] There are six other Fijian islands where evidence of the species has been recorded: Deviulau, Waya, Mouriki, Monu, Qalito, and Malolo Levu.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} closely related to the <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguana</b> and B. bulabula. Brachylophus is thought to be descended from ancestral iguanas that rafted 9000 km west across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, where their closest {{relatives}} are found. Alternatively, it has been suggested they are the descendants of a more widespread lineage of (now extinct) Old World iguanids that diverged from their New World relatives in the Paleogene.|$|R
5000|$|Green iguanas are not {{suitable}} lizards for beginners. A pet iguana habituates to humans {{to such a}} degree that humans no longer cause a [...] "fight or flight" [...] reaction. Iguanas achieve this after they have acclimated to their new habitat, as well as brief but constant interaction with their owner. <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguanas</b> are a better iguanid option for less-experienced pet owners because they are smaller and less aggressive; however, they still need specialist care.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 Tom {{was charged}} with {{illegally}} importing reptiles. The charge {{had little effect on}} business as that same year he imported sixteen Gaboon vipers and fourteen Burmese pythons via the Montgomery Zoo. Later, in 1995, Tom was convicted a second time, of illegally smuggling <b>Fiji</b> Banded <b>Iguanas</b> into the United States. The case was tried in district court after complaints that the prosecutor's dissection of Penny Crutchfield's, Tom's wife, sexual behavior was irrelevant in a case about illegally importing iguanas.|$|R
5000|$|The eggs take roughly 8-9 months (October-November) {{to hatch}} and this {{occurs at the}} {{beginning}} of the wet season. A few of weeks prior to hatching, a brown oval mark arises on the surface of the egg. This oval mark identifies the spot where the baby iguana's head will pop out of the egg. Sometimes, a full day can pass before the <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguana</b> hatches from the egg. [...] After hatching, the baby iguanas obtain moisture by licking wet leaves.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of Brachylophus vitiensis began when Dr. John Gibbons of the University of the South Pacific {{was invited to}} the screening of the movie The Blue Lagoon. [...] The director filmed part of the movie on a remote island and included shots of the native wildlife to enhance {{the feel of the}} movie, including a large colorful iguanid. [...] Gibbons, who had been studying the <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguana</b> at the time, travelled to the island and identified it as a distinct species.|$|R
5000|$|Yadua Tabu (pronounced [...] ) is a {{volcanic}} islet in Fiji, an outlier {{to the northern}} island of Vanua Levu, and immediately south of the larger island Yadua. Yadua Tabu covers an area of 0.7 square kilometres and has a maximum altitude of 100 meters. Yadua Tabu is a protected sanctuary for the <b>Fiji</b> Crested <b>Iguana,</b> Brachylophus vitiensis, and also contains a strand of dry littoral forestry, almost completely lost {{in the rest of}} Fiji.

[...] Females guard the nest of three to six eggs, which is unusual for iguanids. [...] Hatchlings emerge from their eggs in the rainy season and obtain moisture by licking wet leaves.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} shot in Jamaica and Nanuya Levu, a privately owned island in Fiji. The flora and fauna {{featured}} in the film includes an array of animals from multiple continents. As it turned out, the <b>iguanas</b> filmed on <b>Fiji</b> were a species hitherto unknown to biologists; this was noted by the herpetologist John Gibbons when he watched the film, and after traveling to the island where the iguanas were filmed, he described the <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus vitiensis) in 1981. The blue lagoon scenes were shot in Comino Island, Malta and Champagne Bay, Vanuatu.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} closely related to the <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguana</b> and B. bulabula. The genus Brachylophus is thought to be descended from {{ancestors}} that rafted 9000 km west across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, where their closest relatives are found. It has also been suggested that they descended from a more widespread lineage of (now extinct) Old World iguanids that diverged from their New World relatives in the Paleogene. However, no other members of the putative lineage, living or fossil, have been found outside Fiji and Tonga.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus fasciatus) is an {{arboreal}} {{species of}} lizard endemic {{to some of}} the southeastern Fijian islands. It is found in Tonga, where it was probably introduced by humans. It {{is one of the few}} species of iguanas found outside of the New World and one of the most geographically isolated members of the family Iguanidae. [...] Populations of these iguanas have been declining over the past century due to habitat destruction, and more significantly, the introduction of mongoose and house cats to the islands.|$|R
5000|$|Sexually dimorphic, {{males have}} two or three white or pale-blue bands 2 cm wide {{crossing}} their emerald green background with a pattern of spots and stripes on the nuchal region. [...] Females, on the other hand, are solid green with occasional spotting or partial bands. [...] Both sexes have a yellow underside. [...] <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguanas</b> reach 60 cm in length when measured from snout to tail tip and bodyweights of up to 200 g. The crests of these iguanas are very short reaching a length of 0.5 cm.|$|R
50|$|American Tom Crutchfield was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} largest reptile smugglers to the United States by the Department of Justice. Crutchfield had previously served in jail after being convicted of smuggling <b>Fiji</b> Island <b>Iguanas</b> in 1995. Crutchfield had smuggled reptiles from Madagascar to the United States with help of several accomplices and an investigation into him was opened by the FWS. When he was notified of this in 1997 he fled to Belize. The Belizean authorities arrested him and expelled him to the United States. Crutchfield was sentenced to 30 months of prison after being convicted of reptile smuggling. His story featured on Locked up Abroad, season 8, episode 2.|$|R
5000|$|Nearly {{all plants}} and animals {{indigenous}} to Fiji are found on Taveuni, which has suffered less devastation from land clearance than other areas of Fiji. The absence of the mongoose, a major predator, has also {{played a part in}} the survival on Taveuni of land crabs, the unique Fiji fruit bat, the Taveuni silk bat, and some unique species of palm. The island is the second largest in the Pacific Ocean to be free from the mongoose. [...] Other species found on the island include the <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguana</b> and both Platymantis vitiensis and P. vitianus frog species. The critically endangered Fijian monkey-faced bat is found only on Taveuni. It was discovered by scientists in 1977. [...] The flowering plant Balaka seemannii, which is endemic to Fiji, is found on the island.|$|R
5000|$|The {{biggest threat}} this iguana faces is habitat loss due to fires, storms, {{agricultural}} development, and competition from feral goats. [...] Goats {{were introduced to}} Yadua Taba in 1972 and numbered over 200 by the late 1970s. The vegetation on the island during this time was severely depleted {{by a combination of}} grazing and fires used to drive goats for ease of capture. [...] After the discovery of the <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguana,</b> the island was declared a sanctuary and all but a few goats were removed and fires banned. As a result, the dry forest on the island has recovered to a great extent and is the best remaining example of Pacific dry forest. Invasive Leucaena trees threaten the regeneration of native food trees for the iguanas, but the government of Fiji has taken steps to eradicate the trees.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Fiji</b> crested <b>iguana</b> is a diurnal {{creature}} {{that tends to}} live {{under the shade of}} trees and will seek sunlight/heat on days with cool temperature. It has the ability to rapidly change colour from green to black when aroused.It uses this ability when threatened by any potential predator in its surroundings. These colours will vary depending on the severity of the situation, bright green is standard, dark green would be slightly dangerous, and black would be an extreme. If its white bands or its sudden change in colour has not intimidated its predator, it will ultimately resort to an expansion of its neck, a bobbing of its head, and it will pounce itself towards the potential threat. In order to move from tree to tree where it usually resides, it uses the overlapping branches in order to move effectively through their environments. Their long toes and tails help them keep balance while they move through the trees.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its {{tropical}} forests, Vanuatu has {{a limited}} number of plant and animal species. It has an indigenous flying fox, Pteropus anetianus. Flying foxes are important rainforest and timber regenerators. They pollinate and seed disperse a wide variety of native trees. Their diet is nectar, pollen and fruit and they are commonly called [...] "fruit bats". They are in decline across their South Pacific range. However, governments are increasingly aware of the economic and ecological value of flying foxes and there are calls to increase their protection. There are no indigenous large mammals. The nineteen species of native reptiles include the flowerpot snake, found only on Efate. The <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus fasciatus) was introduced as a feral animal in the 1960s. There are eleven species of bats (three unique to Vanuatu) and sixty-one species of land and water birds. While the small Polynesian rat is thought to be indigenous, the large species arrived with Europeans, as did domesticated hogs, dogs, and cattle. The ant species of some of the islands of Vanuatu were catalogued by E. O. Wilson.|$|R
5000|$|The Brachylophus vitiensis {{was first}} {{featured}} in a film when Dr. John Gibbons, of the University of the South Pacific, was invited to the screening of the movie Blue Lagoon.

Gibbons, who had been studying the <b>Fiji</b> banded <b>iguana</b> at the time, travelled to Modriki and identified it as a distinct species. The species only lives in dry forest habitats, which {{are one of the most}} threatened vegetation types in the Pacific. [...] The species was once known to live on 14 islands in the western part of Fiji; however, recent surveys between 2002 and 2004 have only confirmed the species to be living on three islands: Yadua Tabu, Modriki, and Macuata. Yadua Tabu holds the highest proportion of the species, containing approximately 98% of all individuals, an estimated 6,000 animals. The Yadua Tabu iguanas are the only legally protected population, as Yadua Tabu is a National Trust of Fiji reserve and lacks the feral goats which have destroyed the lizard's habitat on other islands. Monuriki is also a breeding ground for some sea turtles.|$|R
