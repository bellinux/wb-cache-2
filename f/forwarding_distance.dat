40|$|The cost of {{forwarding}} {{corresponds to}} about one {{tenth of the}} forestry industries raw material cost. This gives a motive to do good follow-ups {{to get a good}} overview of the <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> and, thus, enable improvements. Follow-ups are also justified by the possibility to make more accurate calculations of the harvesting costs, if better estimations of <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> are achieved. Today (2009) Stora Enso has GPS and vehicle-computers in most of their forwarders. These are used mainly for the forwarder to follow the tracks of the harvester and for the planning leader to see how the forwarder has been driving within the stand. However, the techniques have also other possible uses. The objective of this Master thesis was to evaluate the planned <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> against the actual <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> in thinned stands and {{to come up with a}} method for calculating the actual <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> in GIS-environment. The data collected was planned <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> (plus the written instructions to the machine operators), odometer <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> and the tracks created by the GPS during the forwarders work. The tracks were then worked up in ArcGIS 9. 3 to get a more correct <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance.</b> The planned <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> was evaluated against actually recorded <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> based on odometric and on ArcGIS calculations. The results show that the planned <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> is substantially underestimated and should be increased by a higher winding coefficient than today (1, 15). The results also indicate that the follow-ups by odometer could be replaced by follow-ups made by the <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> calculated in ArcGIS. However, a condition to make it possible to do the follow-ups in ArcGIS with a reasonable work effort is that there must be precise restrictions on how and when GPS recordings should be done during the forwarding work...|$|E

The aim was to study the productivity of Vimek 608 BioCombi in forest fuel thinning of Lodgepole pine and to calculate {{the economy of the}} harvesting and estimate the thinning quality. The time study was performed in Åmarken in the county of Västerbotten. The study area had 4724 trees/ha with an average tree volume of 26. 6 dm 3 (on bark). On average, 15. 3 ODt/ha and 1614 trees/ha was harvested. The thinning intensity of the initial basal area was 34 %, and 12 % of the remaining trees had stem damages. At 100 m <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> the hourly effective work time (E 0 -hour) consumption per ha was 17. 6 giving a productivity of 0. 88 ODt/E 0 -hour.

The field study area where located near Arvån, about 15 kilometres south –east from the city of Lycksele. The field studies were taken place in three different stands. All tree stands had the same tree age, but the tree species combination and the density varied. The harwarder in the study was a Valmet 801 combi modified for whole tree harvesting. Ten study units were created in the tree stands, each study unit was 1250 m 2. The average density before thinning was 3809 trees/ha, the average stem size was 0. 031 m 3. In average were 2135 trees/ha harvested, corresponding to 26. 2 oven dry tons (ODt) /ha. After thinning was the average stand density 1647 trees/ha. Twenty percent of the total surface of the stand were strip roads, and the average width of the strip road was 4. 3 m.

30|$|It is {{striking}} {{to observe the}} significant amounts of distance that packets traveled during waiting {{in relation to the}} <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance.</b> An immediate question is how much this result influences the validity of the model. The answer is that the impact is in fact not significant--whereas some nodes move closer to the destination of a packet waiting to be forwarded, other nodes will move away from the destination. Assuming directional uniformity of the movements, they cancel each other's effect in the infinite case. In the finite case, the distance to a static destination will somewhat increase (on average) during a waiting phase. However, this increase is typically small enough to be negligible.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this case}} study was to clarify the {{productivity}} and cost of a system based on bun- dling logging residues at the roadside landing with the forwarder-mounted logging residue bundler. In order to find the bundling productivity, a set of time studies was carried out, in which several working techniques were tested and evaluated. The cost-efficiency of the roadside bundling system was compared with the conventional bundling system, wherein the logging of residue logs is made directly in the terrain and, after bundling, the logging residue logs are forwarded to the roadside landing with a forwarder. The harvesting cost (bundling and forwarding) of the extracted wood biomass to the roadside landing was calculated for bundling systems using time study data obtained from this study and productivity models and cost parameters acquired from the literature. The productivity of roadside bundling ranged from 48 to 53 logging residue logs per effective working hour (E 0 h), depending on the working technique used, and the mean time required to produce one logging residue log ranged from 83. 6 to 92. 3 seconds (E 0 h). The harvesting costs of the logging residue logs (€/m 3) at the roadside landing were 11. 5 – 13. 7 €/m 3 for the system based on bundling in terrain and 10. 8 – 17. 7 €/m 3 for the system based on bundling at the roadside landing, when the <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> was in the range 100 – 600 m {{and the removal of}} logging residues was in the range 30 – 90 m³/ha (m 3 = solid cubic metre).

40|$|Summary. Forest fires pose a {{great risk}} to nearby {{communities}} and dwellings. Many forest managers {{work to reduce}} such risks by managing fuels. Efforts are underway to understand the economics and the logistics required to extract harvested forest biomass for utilization instead of the conventional disposal method of piling and burning on-site.

Trials in the Superior National Forest examined the feasibility of using conventional equipment to extract and utilize forest biomass compared with disposal of biomass with pile and burn techniques. Factors that increase the costs of biomass utilization include: machinery down-time, distance to end users, low biomass price, size of the harvest unit, <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance,</b> the number of machines hauled to sites to complete small sized operations, the modest amount of biomass removed per acre and applying prescriptions that were not designed for extraction logistics.

Methods: This was a longitudinal study, a convenience sample with 99 children of both genders, in preschool (5 - 6 years old) and school (8 - 11 years old) phases. The postural alignment of the head, cervical spine and shoulders was evaluated through computerized photogrammetry and analyzed by SAPo software. Results: Differences were found between preschool and school phases, but only the variables of shoulder angle (SA) and <b>forward</b> head <b>distance</b> (FHD) were significantly different (SA = 32. 79 [30. 49 - 35. 09] and 35. 84 [33. 53 - 38. 15] p = 0. 026, respectively; FHD = 8. 40 [8. 07 - 8. 73] and 11. 23 [10. 94 - 11. 52] p < 0. 001, respectively).

40|$|Abstract—In the {{reported}} metrics {{of the existing}} literature, the realistic wireless channel situation is generally ignored in selecting the appropriate next-hop relay node during packet forwarding in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we propose a new energy-efficient local metric, which is called the efficient advance-ment metric (EAM), for sensor networks. EAM considers both the maximum <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> and the packet’s successful trans-mission probability by {{taking into account the}} wireless channel condition. This will enable the forwarding node to choose the most energy-efficient relay node in the geographic-informed rout-ing protocol. Theoretically, we show the existence of the unique optimal relay node to maximize EAM over a typical Nakagami-m channel of a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) -based WSN. Furthermore, based on the proposed metric EAM, we present a cross-layer packet-forwarding protocol channel-aware geographic-informed forwarding (CAGIF) by optimally selecting the relay nodes. CAGIF only requires that nodes have the knowledge of their own location information and the location information of the source and destination nodes. Numerical examples are presented to show the characteristics of EAM and the optimal distance. Com-pared with the previous geographic packet-forwarding schemes in WSNs, CAGIF consumes much lower energy and generates a significantly decreased signal overhead.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a distributed algorithm called L-REMiT for enhancing {{the lifetime of}} a source-based multicast tree in wireless ad hoc networks (WANET). The lifetime of a multicast tree is the duration from {{the formation of the}} tree to the time when the first node fails due to battery energy exhaustion. L-REMiT assumes that the energy consumed to forward a packet is proportional to the <b>forwarding</b> <b>distance</b> and channel characteristics, and that WANET nodes can dynamically adjust their transmission power. The task of extending the lifetime of a multicast tree is formulated as the task of extending the lifetime of bottleneck nodes in the tree. The number of multicast packets that a bottleneck node can forward, as determined by its residual battery energy and the distance of its farthest child node, is the minimum over all the nodes in the multicast tree. The lifetime of a bottleneck node is improved by reassigning its farthest children to other nodes in the tree with the goal of improving the lifetime of the multicast tree. Nodes only require information from their neighbors for refining the tree in a distributed manner. Simulation results show that L-REMiT has low overhead and performs better than the BIP/MIP and EWMA algorithms...|$|E
