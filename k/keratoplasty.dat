25|$|Corneal {{transplant}} surgery {{may be difficult}} due to the peripheral thinning of the cornea, even with large and off-center grafts. Therefore, surgery is usually reserved for patients that do not tolerate contact lenses. Several different surgical approaches may be taken, and no one approach is currently established as the standard. Examples of surgical procedures used for PMD include: wedge resection, lamellar crescentic resection, penetrating <b>keratoplasty,</b> lamellar <b>keratoplasty,</b> epikeratoplasty and intracorneal segments. Transplantation of the entire thickness of the cornea (penetrating <b>keratoplasty)</b> may be performed if there is enough normal tissue present. However, {{if there is not}} enough normal tissue present, then attaching the graft is difficult.|$|E
25|$|Rarely, a nonpenetrating <b>keratoplasty</b> {{known as}} an epikeratophakia (or epikeratoplasty) may be {{performed}} in cases of keratoconus. The corneal epithelium is removed and a lenticule of donor cornea is grafted on top of it. The procedure requires a greater level of skill {{on the part of}} the surgeon, and is less frequently performed than a penetrating <b>keratoplasty,</b> as the outcome is generally less favorable. However, it may be seen as an option in a number of cases, particularly for young people.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{reducing}} the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior lamellar <b>keratoplasty</b> (DALK). In a DALK graft, only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea, the stroma, are replaced; the person's rearmost endothelium layer and the Descemet's membrane are left, giving some additional structural integrity to the postgraft cornea. Furthermore, it is possible to transplant freeze-dried donor tissue. The freeze-drying process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance of rejection. Research from two trials in Iran provide low to moderate evidence that graft rejection is more likely to occur in penetrating <b>keratoplasty</b> than in DALK, though the likelihood for graft failure were similar with both procedures.|$|E
30|$|In {{the entire}} case series, 23 of the 63 eyes (37  %) {{required}} surgical intervention. Twenty eyes (20 / 63, 32  %) underwent therapeutic PKP as initial surgical therapy. Nine <b>keratoplasties</b> were performed for persistence of keratitis after medical therapy, five were indicated because of impending or frank corneal perforation, five were repeat <b>keratoplasties</b> for failed prior PKPs due to fungal keratitis, {{and one was}} for recurrent fungal keratitis. Two eyes were enucleated (2 / 63, 3.2  %), and one was eviscerated (1 / 63, 1.6  %) in the acute stage for overwhelming infection.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the long-term outcome of keratolimbal allograft (KLAL) {{for the treatment}} of severe ocular surface disorders. Design: Retrospective, noncomparative case series. Participants: Twenty patients (23 eyes) with severe ocular surface disorders. Intervention: Thirty-three KLAL procedures were performed. Ten patients (10 eyes) underwent KLAL in combination with other surgical procedures. Oral or topical cyclosporine or both were used after surgery in 15 patients to prevent allograft rejection. Main Outcome Measures: Reconstruction of the ocular surface with restoration of phenotypic corneal epithelium, reduction of corneal vascularization and conjunctivalization, decreased pain, and visual improvement. Results: The mean follow-up was 60 months (range, 15 – 96 months). Eight eyes (24. 2 %) never reepithelial-ized and were considered primary failures. The remaining 25 grafts initially restored a phenotypic corneal epithelium, but at last follow-up only 7 (21. 2 %) were stable. Graft survival rate was 54. 4 % at 1 year, 33. 3 % at 2 years, and 27. 3 % at 3 years. Visual acuity improved or was unchanged in 19 eyes (82. 6 %) and decreased in 4 eyes (17. 4 %). Seventeen corneal transplantations (3 lamellar <b>keratoplasties</b> and 14 penetrating <b>keratoplasties)</b> were performed either in combination with or after a KLAL. All three lamellar <b>keratoplasties</b> were successful...|$|R
25|$|Between 11% and 27% {{of cases}} of {{keratoconus}} will progress {{to a point where}} vision correction is no longer possible, thinning of the cornea becomes excessive, or scarring as a result of contact lens wear causes problems of its own, and a corneal transplantation or penetrating <b>keratoplasty</b> becomes required. Keratoconus is the most common grounds for conducting a penetrating <b>keratoplasty,</b> generally accounting for around a quarter of such procedures. The corneal transplant surgeon trephines a lenticule of corneal tissue and then grafts the donor cornea to the existing eye tissue, usually using a combination of running and individual sutures. The cornea does not have a direct blood supply, so the donor tissue is not required to be blood type matched. Eye banks check the donor corneas for any disease or cellular irregularities.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{recovery}} period can take {{four to six}} weeks, and full postoperative vision stabilization often takes a year or more, but most transplants are very stable in the long term. The National Keratoconus Foundation reports that penetrating <b>keratoplasty</b> has the most successful outcome of all transplant procedures, and when performed for keratoconus in an otherwise healthy eye, its success rate can be 95% or greater. The sutures used usually dissolve {{over a period of}} three to five years, but individual sutures can be removed during the healing process if they are causing irritation to the person.|$|E

Grafting in cases associated with Down's syndrome had a higher incidence of complications. 93 % of grafts remained clear and 81 % achieved a final corrected visual acuity of 6 / 12 or better. 21 % of eyes developed a homograft reaction, with 50 % of rejection episodes occurring in the first year after operation. Factors associated with higher incidence of rejection included loose sutures, traumatic wound dehiscence, and grafts larger than 8. 5 mm.

Thus, the development of effective delivery systems depends upon the {{understanding of how the}} ocular barriers affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs. In Part 1, investigation of the barriers to transscleral drug delivery was performed in a rabbit model, and the model demonstrated that the conjunctival lymphatic and blood vessels may be a predominant barrier to the delivery of triamcinolone acetonide to the vitreous.
