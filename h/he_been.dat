5|$|Endecott's warrant was {{followed}} by an order issued by King Charles in March and received by Endecott in May 1661 containing a direct order to apprehend the two fugitives and ship them back to England. Endecott dutifully obeyed, but he appointed two recently arrived Royalists to track them down. Somewhat predictably, their search came up empty, and Whalley and Goffe thus escaped. Biographer Lawrence Mayo suggests Endecott would have appointed different men for the search had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> serious about catching them.|$|E
5|$|Hirst's leg injury {{kept him}} out of the England side for the first two Test matches against Australia, {{although}} {{he would have been a}} certain selection had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> fit. He was chosen in the squad for the second match but was left out on fitness grounds. However, Hirst was not particularly successful in the three Tests he played that season, hitting a highest score of 40 not out; as a bowler he never took more than three wickets in an innings. In the series he scored 105 runs at an average of 35.00 and took 6 wickets at 35.33. England won the series 2–0, mainly due to the all-round efforts of Hirst's Yorkshire teammate Stanley Jackson, who headed the batting and bowling averages for the series.|$|E

5|$|Historian Martin Samuels has {{questioned}} {{whether it was}} in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was in striking contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> in command. Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. He suggests that at the Battle of Zama Hannibal was quoted saying that he had fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes {{that it is impossible to}} be sure who was in command on the day.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, Balotelli {{became the}} {{youngest}} Inter player (at 18 years and 85 days) to score in the Champions League when he scored a goal in a 3–3 draw against Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta, beating the previous record set by Obafemi Martins (at 18 years and 145 days). In an April 2009 match with Juventus where he scored Inter's only goal in a 1–1 draw, Balotelli was racially abused by Juventus fans throughout the game. This led Inter owner Massimo Moratti {{to say that he}} would have pulled the team off the pitch had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> present. The racist chants were also condemned by Juventus chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli and Juventus were given a one-game home-fan ban because of the incident. Inter won Serie A for the fourth time in a row.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> elected, he would have become the first {{president}} who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen of the United States. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.|$|E

5|$|One of Celtic's most {{important}} players, striker Joe McBride was {{to miss the}} match. He had suffered a long-term knee injury and his last match of the season was on 24 December 1966.

5|$|The papacy {{refused to}} {{recognise}} Stigand's elevation, as Robert {{was still alive}} and had not been deprived of office by a pope. Robert of Jumièges appealed to Leo IX, who summoned Stigand to Rome. When Stigand did not appear, he was excommunicated. Historian Nicholas Brooks holds the view that Stigand was not excommunicated at this time, but rather was ordered to refrain from any archiepiscopal functions, such as the consecration of bishops. He argues that in 1062 papal legates sat in council with Stigand, something {{they would not have}} done had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> excommunicated. The legates did nothing to alter Stigand's position either, although one of the legates later helped depose Stigand in 1070. However Pope Leo IX and his successors, Victor II and Stephen IX, continued to regard Stigand as uncanonically elected.|$|E

The fact that the registration law didn't pass until 1997, after the illicit sexual relationship ended, would not have exempted him from registration. Oregon case law has determined that the registration of offenders whose acts were committed prior to the passage of the law does not violate either Oregon’s Constitution or the United States Constitution’s prohibition on ex post facto laws.|$|E

5|$|While still a three-year-old, he was {{exported}} to England {{where he was}} registered in the General Stud Book. He was imported by Richard Croker, {{at a cost of}} about 8000 guineas. Americus' importation to England occurred before the imposition of the Jersey Act, which allowed him and his offspring to be registered in the General Stud Book, something that would not have happened had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> imported into England after 1913, due to the Jersey Act's prohibition on registering horses tracing to Lexington in the General Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was while}} Edward was in York that he ordered the {{rehabilitation}} of Henry Percy to his family Earldom on 27 March 1470. On the same day John was elevated to the Marquessate of Montagu, and now outranked his brother- an Earl- in the English peerage. Historians have since questioned, however, whether his new title had the gravitas that his previous Earldom had had, and have even suggested that the king was 'walking a tightrope' as to whether Montagu would actually accept it or not. To compensate him {{for the loss of}} the Percy estates Montagu was granted the lands of the dead Earl of Devon, and Montagu's son, George was created Duke of Bedford. These were substantial estates, providing an income of at least £600 per annum. Montagu was to be the new regional magnate- as <b>he</b> <b>been</b> in the north- to fill an existing power vacuum.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer {{became a}} chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an {{accomplished}} player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch {{and a fine}} treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 {{he was invited to}} sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. He may have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|On Napoleon's orders, Ordener {{entered into}} the most {{controversial}} action of his career, leading a raid into the sovereign Grand Duchy of Baden to arrest Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, in 1803. Napoleon's orders were specific: Ordener and Armand Augustin Caulaincourt were to take 300 dragoons into the duchy, surround the village of Ettenheim, where the Duke lived, arrest the Duke and Charles Francois Dumouriez, who Napoleon believed was present, and bring both of the men back to France. Ordener and Caulaincourt were instructed also to take their own provisions and to inflict neither harm nor damage {{on any of the}} duchy's inhabitants or their property. In the night of 14–15 March, the dragoons crossed the Rhine and surrounded the Duke's lodgings. Dumouriez was not there, nor had <b>he</b> <b>been,</b> but they kidnapped the Duke and took him away to France. Within a few days, the Duke was spirited into the Chateau de Vincennes, on the outskirts of Paris. There he was tried for treason and executed immediately after the verdict. This action, which involved the invasion of a sovereign state, the kidnapping of a duke and a sham trial for treason followed by the man's immediate execution, had political and diplomatic repercussions throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} {{this created}} were counterbalanced {{to some extent}} by his successes, particularly in the Balkans; Manuel extended the frontiers of his Empire in the Balkan region, ensuring security {{for the whole of}} Greece and Bulgaria. Had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> more successful in all his ventures, he would have controlled not only the most productive farmland around the Eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, but also the entire trading facilities of the area. Even if he did not achieve his ambitious goals, his wars against Hungary brought him control of the Dalmatian coast, the rich agricultural region of Sirmium, and the Danube trade route from Hungary to the Black Sea. His Balkan expeditions are said to have taken great booty in slaves and livestock; Kinnamos was impressed by the amount of arms taken from the Hungarian dead after the battle of 1167. And even if Manuel's wars against the Turks probably realised a net loss, his commanders took livestock and captives on at least two occasions.|$|E
5|$|While Germanicus enjoyed {{some success}} in his campaigns against Arminius and his allies, Tiberius decided not to attempt to conquer the Germans and {{recalled}} Germanicus to Rome. The effort {{it would have taken}} to conquer Germania Magna was deemed too great when compared with the low potential for profit from acquiring the new territory. Rome regarded Germany as a wild territory of forests and swamps, with little wealth compared to territories Rome already had. However, the campaign significantly healed the Roman psychological trauma from the Varus disaster, and greatly recovered Roman prestige. In addition to the recovery of two of the three lost eagles, Germanicus had fought Arminius, the leader who destroyed the three Roman legions in 9 AD, and defeated him in numerous battles. In leading his troops across the Rhine without recourse to Tiberius, he contradicted the advice of Augustus to keep that river as the boundary of the empire, and opened himself to potential doubts from Tiberius about his motives in taking such independent action. This error in political judgement gave Tiberius reason to controversially recall his nephew. Tacitus attributed the recall to Tiberius' jealousy of the glory Germanicus had acquired, and, with some bitterness, claims that Germanicus could have completed the conquest of Germania had <b>he</b> <b>been</b> given full independence of action.|$|E
