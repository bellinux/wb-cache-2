2500|$|Eno is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} one of popular music's most influential artists. Critic Jason Ankeny at AllMusic argues that Eno [...] "forever altered {{the ways in which}} music is approached, composed, performed, and perceived, and everything from punk to techno to new age bears his unmistakable influence." [...] Eno has spread his techniques and theories primarily through his production; his distinctive style affected a number of projects in which he has been involved, including Bowie's [...] "Berlin Trilogy" [...] (helping to popularise minimalism) and the albums he produced for Talking Heads (incorporating, on Eno's advice, African music and polyrhythms), Devo, and other groups. Eno's first collaboration with David Byrne, 1981's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, pioneered sampling techniques that would prove to be influential in hip-hop, and broke ground by incorporating world music into popular Western music forms. Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies have been used by many bands, and Eno's production style has proven influential in several general respects: [...] "his recording techniques have helped change the way that modern musicians– particularly electronic musicians– view the studio. No longer <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> passive medium through which they communicate their ideas but itself a new instrument with seemingly endless possibilities." ...|$|E

50|$|In his 1950 {{painting}} The Empire of Light, René Magritte (1898-1967), {{explores the}} illusion of night and day, and the paradox of time and light. On {{the top half of}} his canvas Magritte paints a clear blue sky and white clouds that radiate bright daytime; while on the bottom half of his canvas below the sky, he paints a street, sidewalk, trees and houses all steeped in the darkness of night. The darkened trees and darkened houses appear to be in nighttime shadows, {{in the middle of the}} night; and the sidewalk streetlight is on to guide the way. Some of the questions implied by these pictures include is it night-time? is it daytime? or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> painting? The Empire of Light is one of a series of paintings that René Magritte painted between 1950 and 1954 that explores his surrealist insight into illusion and reality, using night and day as his subject.|$|E

[...] Districts and schools are brainstorming ways to reallocate time more effectively. Current staff development opportunities are focusing on time on task, a term associated with the amount of time students actually spend in engaged learning activities. Parents and communities members are partnering with local districts and schools to provide educational opportunities that engage students by individualizing instruction, yet still focus on the state and local curriculum. More focused curricular goals, such as the Common Core State Standards, have been implemented to help focus learning activities.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{announcement}} of his appointment in March 1983, Johns told Gallaudet students that: [...] "The future strength of this college lies in continuing and expanding its research and teaching work not only nationally but internationally {{through the use of}} new communications technology," [...] and he had plans to expand course offerings in computing technology. Johns also had plans to focus on using the science of economics as head administrator of Gallaudet, as it pertained to the issues of financial efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Johns told a reporter in 1984: [...] "A college and university is not just an academic institution nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> business. It's both... In this day and age, any college or university president who does not run that enterprise as a business is not going to last long. ...By the same token, I don't think you can be so cost-effective that the only criterion is the dollar." [...] Johns also had a philosophy of upholding high academic standards: [...] "We should make education as accessible as possible to all who can benefit by it, but we have to maintain standards to make it respectable. Accessible higher education does not mean watering down the standards so that anyone who wants a degree can walk away with one..." [...] Johns was a progressive educator who followed principles of shared governance and democratic accountability, having sought the participation of the National Association of the Deaf and Gallaudet's alumni.|$|E
