The goal is the development and validation functions of the flow regulator, providing more uniform process of establishment of mineral particles, respectively. reduction of sedimentation of organic components. The actual design precedes the mathematical description through the HEC-RAS, the results are applied in the design of a laboratory model. Work processes theoretically the standardized sand traps, focuses on the comparison of the required residence time of wastewater in the sedimentation area of establishment with the sedimentation time of sand grain on the selected diameter of 0. 8 mm. In laboratory conditions were carried out build sand trap model itself, as well as developed a regulatory element. After resolving structural measurements were taken and compared the results with the ideal state. For putting the controller into practice, when an application is planned at the constructed wetlands in Dražovice village, it will have to the most accurate setting of the regulator...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe report wind-tunnel {{measurements}} on aeolian sand transport aiming at characterizing {{the distribution of}} the length and height of trajectories of the saltating particles. We employ a simple <b>horizontal</b> <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> device to assess the distribution of saltation length while the distribution of saltation height is inferred from the measurements of the particle lift-off velocity by means of particle velocimetry tracking techniques. Our measurements reveal that the saltation length and height present a continuum distribution which decreases monotonously and exhibits a long tail that can be well described by a lognormal law. Interestingly, these distributions are found almost invariant with the flow strength. As a consequence, the mean saltation length (View the MathML source) and height (View the MathML source) are independent of the flow strength confirming previous indirect measurements. The influence of the flow strength is only seen through the tail of the saltation length distribution: the higher the Shields number, the flatter the distribution tail. Finally, experiments carried out with sand of different sizes show that the mean saltation length and height are not related to the sand grain size through a simple manner but depend instead linearly with the height zf of the Bagnold focus point: View the MathML source and View the MathML source. This last result emphasizes that the focus height is an important characteristic length scale of the saltation transport...|$|E

40|$|Fairway Maintenance of {{the river}} Ijssel The inland trade is a very {{important}} economical activity in The Netherland. Therefore to maintain and improve waterways is a common activity. The main problems that threaten the safety in the shipping are the erosion and sedimentation on the banks, especially in the bend banks. So some studies are necessary to know the best method to avoid the sedimentation and erosion in these places. This study is focused in the effect of a <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> in the River IJssel over the sedimentation and to try to answer questions about its effectiveness and if it is possible to find a better layout for the <b>sand</b> <b>trap.</b> To carry out this research is necessary to set-up a mathematical model which can reproduce the behaviors {{of the river}} and the <b>sand</b> <b>trap.</b> So a mathematical model has been built using the Delft 3 D software. So, the effectiveness of the original <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> has been studied and three possible alternatives have been studied too. The alternatives are: - Two different <b>sand</b> <b>traps</b> with same volume of the original one, but shallower, longer than the original one and nearest to the sedimentation zone (alternatives A. 1 and A. 2). - <b>Sand</b> <b>trap</b> with more volume than the original one and nearest to the sedimentation zone (alternative B). The results of this study show that the effect of the <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> over the sedimentation in a bend located 2 km downstream of the <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> is non-existent. Also the results show that the alternatives A. 1, A. 2 and A. 3 are more efficient, it means that they catches more sediments, but they dont produce any effect over the sedimentation zone. To study the effect of a bigger <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> and nearer to the sedimentation zone is necessary. Also it is recommended to improve the data about sediment transport, bed levels and discharges in the lower stretch of IJssel. These data will be necessary to carry out a better mathematical model.

40|$|The Hartley <b>Sand</b> <b>Trap</b> {{could mean}} the end to the curse of sand {{blocking}} up filters and irrigation pipes. This simple invention developed and patented by Tim Hartley is worth the while for any farmer or farmers group involved in irrigation. It removes sand from the borehole, at the well-point or the river, while under online pressure. Here is how it works. Sandy water enters {{the bottom of the}} Trap equipment under pressure up to 10 bar and clean water comes out {{from the top of the}} <b>Sand</b> <b>Trap</b> under the same pressure. The rising speed of the water is slower than the settling speed of the sand which can therefore never reach the Trap s outlet only the clean water can. The accumulated sand can periodically be flushed through from the Trap by opening the flush valve. The maximum flow rate of the trap is 4, 000 litres/ hour. For higher flow rates, two or more <b>sand</b> <b>traps</b> would have to be installed in parallel. The device costs ZAR 980 South African Rand (t 142), excluding transport.
