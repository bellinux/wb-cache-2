Lipid, dipeptides and CoQ 10 appeared correlated to glycolytic and oxidative metabolic pathways. We can conclude that all studied parameters were influenced by the rearing system used, and that differences were particularly evident in the O system, which produced leaner meat with higher oxidative stability.

However, many in vitro studies are based on porcine chondrocytes derived from abundantly available premature hybrid pigs. It remains unclear whether pig line-dependent differences exist which could limit the comparability between in vitro and in vivo results using either hybrid or miniature pig articular chon-drocytes. Porcine knee joint femoral cartilage was isolated from 3 - to 5 -month-old hybrid pigs and Göttingen minipigs. Cartilage from both pig lines was analysed for thickness, zonality, cell content, size and proteoglycan deposition. Cultured articular chon-drocytes from both pig lines were investigated for gene and/or protein expression of cartilage-specific proteins such as type II collagen, aggrecan, the chondrogenic transcription factor Sox 9, non-specific type I collagen and the cell-matrix receptor b 1 -integrin. Cartilage was significantly thinner in the miniature pig compared to the <b>hybrid</b> <b>pig,</b> but {{the differences between the}} medial and lateral femur condyles did not reach a significant level.

In the field test three ultrasonic back fat measurements are taken from boars and gilts between 80 and 110 kg at {{the middle of the}} spinal chord (shoulder, mid-back, loin). Average back fat thickness is calculated as the average of these three measurements. Heritability of average back fat depth was estimated using the REML method. The estimates varied between 0. 12 - 0. 51 depending on the genotype. The existence of genetic ties between the herds of the various pig populations was measured through the use of boars across the herds. Concerning the Belgian Landrace breed and the E-line of the Ka-Hyb <b>hybrid</b> <b>pig</b> no genetic ties were found, which means that the boars of these populations were only used within the herds. On the other hand week connections (5 - 14 %) were found for the other genotypes. Boars having been used in two or more herds showed more reliable breeding values (lower prediction error variance) than those animals, which had progeny in one herd only.

In addition to the three known envelope subgroups of infectious gamma retroviruses (PERV-A, -B, and -C), classed together here as PERV group γ 1, four novel groups of gamma retrovirus (γ 2 to γ 5) and four novel groups of beta retrovirus (β 1 to β 4) genomes were detected in pig DNA using generic and specific PCR primers. PCR quantification indicated that the retroviral genome copy number in the Landrace × Duroc F 1 <b>hybrid</b> <b>pig</b> ranged from 2 (β 2 and γ 5) to approximately 50 (γ 1). The γ 1, γ 2, and β 4 genomes were transcribed into RNA in adult kidney tissue. Apart from γ 1, the retroviral genomes are not known to be infectious, and sequencing of a small number of amplified genome fragments revealed stop codons in putative open reading frames in several cases. Analysis of DNA from wild boar and other species of Old World pigs (Suidae) and New World peccaries (Tayassuidae) showed that one retrovirus group, β 2, was common to all species tested, while the others were present among all Old World species but absent from New World species. The PERV-C subgroup of γ 1 genomes segregated among domestic pigs and were absent from two African species (red river hog and warthog).

These influences with an impact on reproductive characters were monitored: order of litter, number of piglets in a litter, birth weight of piglets, influences of sex and litter order on birth weight of piglets. An average number of all born piglets per sow and litter it was 13. 25 piglets. From this an average number of live born piglets it was 12. 48 piglets per sow and litter and from each litter there was 11. 40 of weaned piglets. The highest number of live born piglets was reached in sows on the fourth litter – 14. 50 piglets. On eighth and nineth litter fertility decreased to 11. 60 and 11. 00 piglets. Statistical conclusive difference (P ≤ 0. 05) was found between fourth (14. 50) and nineth (11. 00) litter. Among birth weight in both sexes a statistical conclusive difference (P ≤ 0. 05) was found. Higher birth weight (1. 46 kg) was found in boars in comparison with gilts (1. 40 kg).

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} {{domestication}} increases {{the variety of}} phenotypes expressed in animals. Zooarchaeologists have attempted to study these changes osteologically {{in their search for}} the geographic and temporal origins of initial animal domestication during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Traditional biometric approaches have explored broad changes in body size over time, but this approach provides poor resolution. Here we investigate whether geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses of cranial shape can be used to provide better resolution between wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), since shape is less affected by environmental factors than size. GMM combined with traditional multivariate statistics were applied to the crania of 42 modern domestic pigs (representing 6 breeds), 10 wild × domestic first generation <b>hybrid</b> <b>pigs</b> and 55 adult wild boar. Further analyses were carried out on morphologically discrete portions of the crania to simulate the fragmented nature of archaeological mammal remains. We found highly significant discrimination between wild and domestic pigs, both on the whole crania, and subsets including the parietal, the basicranium, the angle of the nasal and the zygomatic. We also demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} discriminate different domestic breeds on the basis of cranial morphology, and that 1 st generation <b>hybrid</b> wild × domestic <b>pig</b> morphology more closely resembles wild pigs than domestic, suggesting that a wild phenotype (here represented by morphology) is dominant over a recessive domestic one.

Our data indicated, that carcass grading was improved by dietary FC. Diet with the high level of fermentable carbohydrates decreased fatness of the carcass and the organ fraction. It can be concluded that the fattening performance (FI, ADG, FCR) was not affected adversely by the high FC intake, but carcass quality in pigs could be improved. Feedstuffs high in fermentable carbohydrates can be valuable ingredients for pig diets, once their energy content has been properly estimated...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{castration}} of male pigs is {{a practice}} that will probably be abandoned in Europe in the future because of general protest against pain in animals and a growing concern on (farm) animal welfare. Rearing entire males will therefore inevitably be integrated in the pig sector. In the present study, possible differences in behavior, production results and meat quality between entire males and gilts, both housed in single-sex groups but with visual contact to other groups, were investigated. The influence of {{the location of the}} pen (next to a group of the same sex or next to a group of the opposite sex) was also looked at. A total of 141 <b>hybrid</b> <b>pigs</b> – 70 entire males and 71 gilts – heterozygous for the halothane gene, were observed from 18 to 24 weeks of age. During this period, boars were more active than gilts and displayed more aggression and mounting behavior. Housing boars next to a pen with gilts increased explorative and drinking behavior. Gilts housed next to a boar pen tended to show less inactivity. Considering production results, boars tended to have a higher growth during the final phase but gilts showed better carcass traits. High skin lesion scores were more frequent in boars. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|With the {{objective}} of evaluating available phosphorus (aP) levels in diets for barrows selected for lean meat deposition, eighty commercial <b>hybrid</b> <b>pigs</b> with initial weight of 94. 05 ± 1. 05 kg were used in this experiment. Pigs were allotted in a completely randomized block design, with five treatments (0. 092, 0. 156, 0. 220, 0, 284, and 0. 348 % of aP), eight replicates and two pigs per experimental unit. The average daily weight gain of pigs increased and the feed conversion improved quadratically with increasing aP in the diets up to the estimated levels of 0. 21 and 0. 20 %, respectively. There was no effect of the dietary aP on average daily feed intake. However, aP intake, bone strength and concentration of phosphorus in the bones increased linearly with increasing aP in the diets. The levels of aP did not affect carcass traits; however, the alkaline phosphatase activity was improved and the values of serum inorganic phosphorus increased quadratically up to the estimated levels of 0. 26 and 0. 27 % of aP, respectively. The available phosphorus levels of 0. 21, 0. 27, and 0. 35 %, corresponding to daily aP intakes of 6. 34, 8. 13, and 10. 44 g result, respectively, in greatest performance, blood and bone parameters of 95 to 120 kg barrows selected for lean gain...|$|R
40|$|With the {{objective}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of dietary available phosphorus levels (aP) on the performance, blood and bone parameters of castrated male and female pigs, genetically selected for meat deposition, 60 commercial <b>hybrids</b> <b>pigs</b> with initial weight of 15. 54 ± 0. 68 kg were allotted in a completely randomized block design, with six treatments (0. 103, 0. 210, 0. 317, 0. 424, 0. 531, and 0. 638 % aP), five replicates, and two animals per experimental unit. Pigs were fed ad libitum and water was provided {{until the end of}} the experimental period (21 days), when animals reached 31. 31 ± 2. 94 kg. Daily weight gain and daily feed intake increased, while the feed conversion improved quadratically up to 0. 534, 0. 487, and 0. 574 % aP maximum responses, respectively. The aP intake and the values of inorganic phosphorus in serum increased linearly with increasing the levels of aP in the diets. Alkaline phosphatase activity increased quadratically up to 0. 558 % maximum response. Bone breaking strength and calcium, phosphorus, and ash contents in the bones increased linearly with increasing aP concentration in the diets. The available phosphorus requirement of castrated male and female pigs genetically selected for meat deposition from 15 to 30 kg for best results of performance is 0. 574 %, corresponding to a daily intake of 8. 26 g of available phosphorus...|$|R
