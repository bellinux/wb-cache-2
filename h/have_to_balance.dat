This balancing act [...] "between investigating to discover the truth and gathering evidence to support a court case" [...] has been compared to the perceived stance of the FBI during the series' tenure. The bureau had at this time seen itself as a law enforcement agency responsible for amassing evidence to prosecute criminal cases. There is a disparity between this approach and public perception of the FBI's role as an organization investigating an objective and apolitical truth; this led to public frustration [...] "because [...] incorrectly believe that a courtroom is designed to discover the truth".|$|E

Between about 1985 and 1995, Catholic Charities of Boston, which accepted state funds {{in support of}} its adoption services program, placed 13 children with gay couples out of 720 adoptions. Catholic Charities President Rev. J. Bryan Hehir explained the practice: [...] "If we could design the system ourselves, we would not participate in adoptions to gay couples, but we can't. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> various goods." [...] In December 2005, the lay-dominated board of Catholic Charities of Boston voted unanimously to continue gay adoptions. On March 10, 2006, after unsuccessfully seeking help from Governor Mitt Romney in obtaining an exemption from the state's anti-discrimination statute, O'Malley and leaders of Catholic Charities announced that the agency would terminate its adoption work effective June 30, rather than continue to place children under the guardianship of homosexual couples. Hehir said [...] "This is a difficult and sad day for Catholic Charities. We have been doing adoptions for more than 100 years." ...|$|E

6000|$|At a first glance, it {{may seem}} that there was {{compensation}} for the triumph of sentiment over reason, and that if France was ruined by the dreams in which Rousseau encouraged the nation to exult, she was saved by the fervour and resoluteness of the aspirations with which he filled the most generous of her children. No wide movement, we may be sure, is thoroughly understood until we have mastered both its material and its ideal sides. Materially, Rousseau's work was inevitably fraught with confusion because in this sphere not to be scientific, not to be careful in tracing effects to their true causes, is to be without any security that the causes with which we try to deal {{will lead to the}} effects that we desire. A Roman statesman who had gone to the Sermon on the Mount for a method of staying the economic ruin of the empire, its thinning population, its decreasing capital, would obviously have found nothing of what he sought. But the moral nature of man is redeemed by teaching that may have no bearing on economics, or even a bearing purely mischievous, and which has to be corrected by teaching that probably goes equally far in the contrary direction of moral mischief. In the ideal sphere, the processes are very complex. In measuring a man's influence within it we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance.</b> Rousseau's action was undoubtedly excellent in leading men and women to desire simple lives, and a more harmonious social order. Was this eminent benefit more than counterbalanced by the eminent disadvantage of giving a reactionary intellectual direction? By commending irrational retrogression from active use of the understanding back to dreamy contemplation? ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{must be kept}} in {{mind that}} Political Economy deals only with the [...] {{phenomena}} of material wealth; it does not supply ethical or [...] political grounds of action. It is quite conceivable that a [...] legislator, in coming to a decision, may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> economic [...] gains against moral or political losses, and may choose to give up [...] the former to prevent the latter. But the economic truth remains [...] unchanged. Political economy, for instance, to the question, Is [...] there any gain in international trade? answers, unequivocally, [...] yes. Would it be a loss of wealth to the community to have the [...] goods formerly bought abroad now produced at home? The answer is, [...] certainly it would. But here it has been ably urged by intelligent [...] writers that a state has other ends to gain than the accumulation [...] of mere riches; that it must aim to secure the greatest moral, [...] social, and elevating influences possible for the working-classes; [...] and that while free exchange of goods may add to wealth, it may [...] injure the social and political well-being of a nation. So far as [...] these are social and political questions they do not belong to [...] Political Economy. But the commonest form of argument is that, [...] under free exchange, the United States would become purely an [...] “agricultural” country, its social horizon would become narrowed, [...] and a lower standard of industrial activity would then ensue; [...] instead of which, it is said, we should, by protection, keep in [...] existence diversified industries by which the national mind may be [...] better stimulated, and greater enterprise may be encouraged in all [...] branches of industry. This argument for “diversity of industries,” [...] however, is not merely a sociological question; it can only be [...] fully discussed from an economic stand-point, and deserves even [...] more than the brief attention we can give it here.|$|E

6000|$|Whatever enemies the Church of England {{may have}} to {{struggle}} with now and hereafter, {{it is clear that}} at this juncture she is specially called to take the measure of her strength as opposed to the Church of Rome--that is her most pressing enemy. The Church of England, as to the point of private judgment, standing between the two extremes of Papacy and Dissent, is entitled to heartfelt reverence; and among thinking men, whose affections are not utterly vitiated, never fails to receive it. Papacy will tolerate no private judgment, and Dissent is impatient of anything else. The blessing of Providence has thus far preserved the Church of England between the shocks to which she has been exposed from those opposite errors; and notwithstanding objections may lie against some parts of her Liturgy, particularly the Athanasian Creed, and however some of her articles may be disputed about, her doctrines are exclusively scriptural, and her practice is accommodated to the exigencies of our weak nature. If this be so, what has she to fear? Look at Ireland, might be a sufficient answer. Look at the disproportion between her Catholic and Protestant population. Look at the distempered heads of the Roman Catholic Church insisting upon terms which in France, and even in Austria, dare not be proposed, and which the Pope himself would probably relinquish for a season. Look at the revenues of the Protestant Church; her cathedrals, her churches, that once belonged to the Romanists, and where, in imagination, their worship has never ceased to be celebrated. Can it be doubted that when the yet existing restrictions are removed, that the disproportion in the population and the wealth of the Protestant Church will become more conspicuous objects for discontent to point at; and that plans, however covert, will be instantly set on foot, with the aid of new powers, for effecting an overthrow, and, if possible, a transfer? But all this is too obvious; I would rather argue with those who think that by excluding the Romanists from political power we make them more attached to their religion, and cause them to unite more strongly in support of it. Were this true to the extent maintained, we should still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>balance</b> between the unorganised power which they derive from a sense of injustice, real or supposed, and the legitimate organised power which concession would confer upon surviving discontent; for no one, I imagine, is weak enough to suppose that discontent would disappear. But it is a deception, and a most dangerous one, to conclude that if a free passage were given to the torrent, it would lose, by diffusion, its ability to do injury. The checks, as your Lordship well knows, which are after a time necessary to provoke other sects to activity, are not wanted here. The Roman Church stands independent of them through its constitution, so exquisitely contrived, and through its doctrine and discipline, which give a peculiar and monstrous power to its priesthood. In proof of this, take the injunction of celibacy, alone separating the priesthood from the body of the community, and the practice of confession, making them masters of the conscience, while the doctrines give them an absolute power over the will. To submit to such thraldom men must be bigoted in its favour; and that we see is the case of Spain, in Portugal, in Austria, in Italy, in Flanders, in Ireland, and in all countries where you have Papacy in full blow. And does not history prove, that however other sects may have languished under the relaxing influence of good fortune, Papacy has ever been most fiery and rampant when most prosperous? ...|$|E
