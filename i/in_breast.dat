5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventative nutrition.

5|$|Women with {{a family}} history of endometrial cancer are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer.

5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorines exhibit biopersistence {{due to the}} {{strength}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), which are sparingly water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted persistent organic pollutants; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are most often researched. PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> milk and the blood of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA. In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans. High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels.|$|E
40|$|PRIMARY {{malignant}} {{disease of the}} <b>breast</b> <b>in</b> this country accounts for about 20 % of all deaths from {{malignant disease}} in women (Registrar General, 1963). The vast majority of malignant tumours <b>in</b> the <b>breast</b> are primary growths but secondary dzposits may occur.

Trevithick (1903) described a case of reticulosis in a 13 year old girl who had deposits <b>in</b> both <b>breasts.</b> Haram (1937), Anderson and Roberts (1954), Sandison (1959), Stringer (1959) and other authors have described cases with deposits of reticulosarcoma, lymphosarcoma and lymphatic and monocytic leukaemia <b>in</b> the <b>breast</b> tissue. The breast may also be involved by metastases from a primary lesion <b>in</b> the opposite <b>breast.</b> Kilgore (1932), Leo (1930) and Geschickter (1945) found that about 7. 5 % of women with cancer of the breast developed a cancer <b>in</b> the opposite <b>breast.</b> <b>In</b> these cases the growth <b>in</b> the second <b>breast</b> may have been either a new primary growth or a metastatic deposit from the other breast.
