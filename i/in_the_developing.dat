Deliberate self-harm is common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> world. Research into self-harm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> world is however still very limited although an important {{case study is}} that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting {{a high incidence of}} suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E

However, when capital is mobile, <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> country hosts more and more capital at the expense of <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> country as <b>the</b> perception of varieties produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> country improves and the surplus of consumers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> country can decrease...|$|R

5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that there were two}} billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children and those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.|$|E

The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> world have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E
