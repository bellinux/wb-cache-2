5|$|Abi and Babe {{discover}} that Ben's half sister Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) {{has been using}} Phil's credit card, so they force her to return everything she has bought. Babe asks Abi for a favour, but Abi realises that Babe has already assumed that she would say yes, so calls Babe a user. As revenge, Babe sends Ben a letter, telling him of the fake pregnancy. Louise finds the letter and blackmails Abi, telling her to move away with Ben. Abi tries to persuade Ben into moving but he refuses, saying {{he needs to be}} there for alcoholic Phil, and Abi tells Louise that Ben will always believe his girlfriend over his sister. Abi tells Babe that she is worried that Ben will find out, so Babe suggests that Abi tells Ben the truth. However, Abi allows Louise to continue using Phil's credit card. Later, Abi catches Ben and Louise arguing and assumes it is over the letter, and she inadvertently reveals she was never pregnant, but Ben was referring to Phil's credit card. In The Vic, Ben gets drunk and kisses Abi in the toilets and starts to undress her, but then drags her into the pub in her underwear and reveals via the karaoke microphone that she made up her pregnancy. Abi is humiliated and is taken to Dot Branning's (June Brown) house by her uncle Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), however, an enraged Phil takes her away in his car, but is stopped by Jay, who insists that enough people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt.</b> When Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) confesses to killing Lucy, Max is released, but refuses to see Abi or Lauren.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers in {{countries}} with {{easy access to the}} web <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by the decline of many traditional advertisers. Department stores and supermarkets could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements, but due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now. Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including Craigslist, employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, Apple {{has seen}} a {{significant}} boost in sales of Macs. This has been attributed, in part, {{to the success of}} the iPod and the iPhone, a halo effect whereby satisfied iPod or iPhone owners purchase more Apple products, and Apple has since capitalized on that with the iCloud cloud service that allows users to seamlessly sync data between these devices and Macs. Nonetheless, like other personal computer manufacturers, the Macintosh lines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by consumer trend towards smartphones and tablet computers (particularly Apple's own iPhone and iPad, respectively) as the computing devices of choice among consumers.|$|E
25|$|Associated Press {{reported}} that {{in response to the}} costs that the legislation places on banks, some banks have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking. Small banks have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations. The size of regulatory compliance teams has grown. The Heritage Foundation, calling attention to the new ability of borrowers to sue lenders for misjudging their ability to repay a loan, predicted that smaller lenders would be forced to exit the mortgage market due to increased risk. One study has shown that smaller banks <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by the regulations of the Dodd–Frank Act. Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best but highly likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994. These experts believe that regulatory barriers fall most heavily on small banks, even though legislators intended to target large financial institutions.|$|E

500|$|Another {{consideration}} is loss of sensation, [...] which puts {{people at risk}} for wounds such as pressure sores and injuries that could become worse before being noticed. Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin, so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas that could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt,</b> particularly the buttocks and genital area. People who already have pressure sores must {{take care not to}} make the wounds worse. Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections, which get worse if they go unnoticed. Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available personal lubricant to decrease friction.|$|E
500|$|Great Captain Island {{is one of}} the state's 26 [...] "important bird areas" [...] {{that provide}} an {{essential}} habitat for one or more bird species, according to the Connecticut Audubon Society. Great blue herons have been on the island since the 1990s. Great egrets, snowy egrets, and black-crowned night herons also live on the island. [...] The island was once known as the state's largest heron and egret rookery, but in the early 2000s their populations shrunk dramatically, with summer counts down from a total of 364 in 1998 to 98 in 2004. Patrick Comins, director of bird conservation for Audubon Connecticut, thinks that the bird populations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by human disturbances and possibly by competition from cormorants and a great horned owl that lives on the island and has fed on the birds. Comins also said that overall pollution in Long Island Sound waters might also have an effect.|$|E

On November 5, the film surpassed Gladiator ($187.7 million) to become Scott's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office.|$|E

[...] Worse, {{there would be no}} one to save Asher so he would have shared Julianna's fate of death. Also in the series, and in French, Asher tells Jean-Claude that he chose Julianna as a human servant to secure Jean-Claude's love and companionship. Asher's servant was chosen to appeal to and keep Jean-Claude in Asher's life. Jean-Claude begged the High Council to save Asher in exchange for 100 years of servitude. Jean-Claude would rather Asher live and hate him than die. As Julianna burned, she screamed not for Asher, but for Jean-Claude to save her, up to the very last she believed he would rescue her.|$|E
