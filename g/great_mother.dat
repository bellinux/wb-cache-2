25|$|The {{most sacred}} relics from the Roman {{religion}} were transferred from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium, including the <b>Great</b> <b>Mother,</b> {{the fire of}} Vesta, the Shields of the Salii and the Palladium. Ancient history records lurid tales of human sacrifice taking place inside the temple, involving children which were collected all over Italy from the richest and noblest families. The religious excesses of Elagabalus' reign eventually contributed to his demise. On March 11, 222, Elagabalus was killed {{by members of the}} Praetorian Guard, and replaced by his cousin Severus Alexander. Elagabalus' religious edicts were reversed, and the statues which had been moved to the Elagabalium were restored to their original shrines.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} the import of the ritus cereris, patrician {{senators}} imported cult to the Greek goddess Cybele and established her as Magna Mater (The <b>Great</b> <b>Mother)</b> within Rome's sacred boundary, facing the Aventine Hill. Like Ceres, Cybele {{was a form of}} Graeco-Roman earth goddess. Unlike her, she had mythological ties to Troy, and thus to the Trojan prince Aeneas, mythological ancestor of Rome's founding father and first patrician Romulus. The establishment of official Roman cult to Magna Mater coincided with {{the start of a new}} saeculum (cycle of years). It was followed by Hannibal's defeat, the end of the Punic War and an exceptionally good harvest. Roman victory and recovery could therefore be credited to Magna Mater and patrician piety: so the patricians dined her and each other at her festival banquets. In similar fashion, the plebeian nobility underlined their claims to Ceres. Up to a point, the two cults reflected a social and political divide, but when certain prodigies were interpreted as evidence of Ceres' displeasure, the senate appeased her with a new festival, the ieiunium Cereris ("fast of Ceres").|$|E
500|$|The general {{consensus}} among scholars of Hinduism traces {{the origins of}} Shashthi, like Skanda, back to ancient folk traditions. Over {{the course of the}} early centuries BCE, the Vedic fertility goddess of the new moon, Sinivali-Kuhu, and Shri-Lakshmi, the Vedic antecedent of Lakshmi, were gradually fused with the folk-deity Shashthi. This merger created a [...] "new" [...] Shashthi that was associated in various ways with Skanda (also known as Kartikeya or Murugan). From her origins as a folk goddess, Shashthi was gradually assimilated into the Brahmanical Hindu pantheon, and ultimately, came to be known in Hinduism as the Primordial Being and <b>Great</b> <b>Mother</b> of all. The fifth century text Vayu Purana includes Shashthi in a list of 49 goddesses, while a Puranic text calls her [...] "the worthiest of worship among mother goddesses." [...] However, the long-standing universality of her worship has led scholar David Gordon White to challenge the classification of Shashthi as a folk goddess, observing that Shashthi has been worshipped on the sixth day after childbirth by [...] "all Hindus: rural as well as urban people, since the Kushan era." ...|$|E

500|$|Thelema draws its {{principal}} gods and goddesses from Ancient Egyptian religion. The highest deity in the cosmology of Thelema is the goddess Nuit. She {{is the night}} sky arched over the Earth symbolized {{in the form of}} a naked woman. She is conceived as the <b>Great</b> <b>Mother,</b> the ultimate source of all things. [...] The second principal deity of Thelema is the god Hadit, conceived as the infinitely small point, complement and consort of Nuit. [...] Hadit symbolizes manifestation, motion, and time. He is also described in Liber AL vel Legis as [...] "the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star". [...] The third deity in the cosmology of Thelema is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a manifestation of Horus. He is symbolized as a throned man with the head of a hawk who carries a wand. He is associated with the Sun and the active energies of Thelemic magick. [...] Other deities within the cosmology of Thelema are Hoor-paar-kraat (or Harpocrates), god of silence and inner strength, the brother of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Babalon, the goddess of all pleasure, known as the Virgin Whore, and Therion, the beast that Babalon rides, who represents the wild animal within man, a force of nature.|$|E

[...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her. [...] In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her.
