5|$|During 1936 and 1937, {{in order}} to {{maintain}} as low a profile as possible between the Fourth and Fifth symphonies, Shostakovich mainly composed film music, a genre favored by Stalin and lacking <b>in</b> <b>dangerous</b> personal expression.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of genetics, robotics, engineering, physics and applied chemistry. The Goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting <b>in</b> <b>dangerous</b> mood-swings and hallucinations.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Grainger was the {{engineer}} for {{the line and}} James Bray the contractor. Two sighting towers were erected and 20 shafts sunk along the tunnel's line. Men excavated rock from the shaft faces until the shafts were connected and the tunnel was completed in 1848. Thousands of navvies lived locally in temporary bothies with their families, and worked <b>in</b> <b>dangerous</b> and wet conditions to facilitate the grand opening in 1849.|$|E
5|$|Due to its sharp {{turns with}} {{restricted}} headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane {{of the western}} tunnel, {{so it was not}} possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase <b>in</b> <b>dangerous</b> motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican–American War, Beauregard {{served as}} an {{engineer}} under General Winfield Scott. He was appointed brevet captain for the battles of Contreras and Churubusco and major for Chapultepec, where he {{was wounded in the}} shoulder and thigh. He was noted for his eloquent performance in a meeting with Scott in which he convinced the assembled general officers to change their plan for attacking the fortress of Chapultepec. He {{was one of the first}} officers to enter Mexico City. Beauregard considered his contributions <b>in</b> <b>dangerous</b> reconnaissance missions and devising strategy for his superiors to be more significant than those of his engineer colleague, Captain Robert E. Lee, so he was disappointed when Lee and other officers received more brevets than he did.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, studies {{indicated}} that active treatment {{would be the}} most suitable remedy for abandoned mine drainage in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, with hydrated lime being proposed as one possible treatment method. However, some small scale passive treatment has been attempted in the watershed. A 2008 paper estimated that the Nanticoke Creek Assessment and Restoration Project would cost $5,000,000. An active treatment project by the Earth Conservancy began in 2012, with the intent to repair damage caused by the Askam Borehole. The Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek during earth-moving activities involving filling <b>in</b> <b>dangerous</b> strip pits.|$|E
5|$|The right against exploitation, {{given in}} Articles 23 and 24, {{provides}} for two provisions, namely {{the abolition of}} {{trafficking in human beings}} and Begar (forced labour), and abolition of employment of children below the age of 14 years <b>in</b> <b>dangerous</b> jobs like factories, mines, etc. Child labour is considered a gross violation of the spirit and provisions of the constitution. Begar, practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime and is punishable by law. Trafficking in humans for the purpose of slave trade or prostitution is also prohibited by law. An exception is made in employment without payment for compulsory services for public purposes. Compulsory military conscription is covered by this provision.|$|E
5|$|Violence peaked {{the next}} evening, {{the night of}} September 10–11. Businesses were better prepared. Some had boarded up and others stayed open all night with armed guards visible to {{discourage}} thieves {{taking advantage of the}} strike. Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags snatched. But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted <b>in</b> <b>dangerous</b> attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston left two dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center of amusement halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making trouble because they were in sympathy with the strikers is unknown. The death total ultimately reached nine.|$|E
