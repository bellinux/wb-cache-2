The efficiency and the recombination dynamics were evaluated by photoluminescence measurements (both integrated and time-resolved), while the properties of the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>material</b> were studied by Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) and Rutherford Backscattering (RBS) channeling measurements.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Nucleation {{and growth}} {{kinetics}} of oxygen precipitates and bulk defects in epitaxial silicon wafers were investigated. Low temperature nucleation heat treatments {{were applied to}} the well characterized epitaxial silicon wafers {{before and after the}} epitaxial deposition processing. Subsequently the wafers were heat treated at a high temperature.

Observation of heavy hole Stark ladder formation at low field strengths is also reported. Further, good agreement between measured and calculated absorption spectra of GaAs based SC 3 QW sample, confirmed these effects. Kramers-Kronig transformation was applied to measured absorption spectra and an improvement in electrorefraction for TE polarisation was predicted for all the samples. A waveguide type Fabry-Perot interferometer was used for direct measurement of electrorefraction. Two observations were made from the analysis of experimental and estimated electrorefraction values. First, strongly coupled three quantum wells and superlattices show enhanced electrorefraction due to Wannier-Stark localisation. Second, superlattices have advantage over strongly coupled three quantum wells for phase modulator applications, when operated at large detuned energy relative to the lowest energy exciton peak.
