5000|$|Some {{government}} jurisdictions in the United States recommend {{or require}} the use of a reinforced fence, sometimes called a [...] "super" [...] silt fence or an enhanced silt fence, on some construction sites. This design uses <b>filter</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforced by a wire mesh or chain link fence. The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence. However, an improper installation of a super silt fence can create an inadvertent sediment basin when the <b>filter</b> <b>fabric</b> becomes clogged. This typically causes flooding and increased downstream pollution. Most super silt fence specifications are out-dated, requiring the trenching installation method, which {{has been shown to be}} highly susceptible to [...] "washing out" [...] under the fabric due to improper back-filling and inadequate compaction.|$|E

40|$|Weave and {{construction}} parameters of high density woven <b>filter</b> <b>fabrics</b> influence the pore morphology, which directly affects the functional properties such as permeability and retention. It is {{established that the}} morphology of multifilament woven <b>filter</b> <b>fabrics</b> comprises of meso and micro pores and, furthermore, their permeability can be tailored within suitable limits by adjusting the weaving machine, weave pattern and yarn type. It is known that the pore morphology will change due to mechanical loads, which occur during use, for instance. First, the change in morphology of the meso and micro structure {{is due to the}} transversal contraction of the yarns. Second, it changes since the overall textile structure deforms. This leads to a change of permeability and retention properties. In this work, we present a comparative experimental and numerical study to reveal the change of permeability and barrier properties of <b>filter</b> <b>fabrics</b> under tensile stress. Fabrics with different densities were used to gather data about how mechanical strain affects the pore morphology. The mechanical stresses occurring in the fabric during use and their effect on the change in pore morphology were tested and evaluated in the laboratory using a Zwick brand tensile testing machine. The analysis of pore morphology encompassed physical (flow porometer) and optical methods (microtome sections and image analysis). The pore size distribution was analyzed using a flow porometer PSM 165 (Topas GmbH, Germany) before uniaxial and biaxial, cyclic mechanical stress loads. The evaluated physical and geometrical parameters of the pore morphology serve as input for the numerical modeling and simulation of change of pore morphology under load, and for the modeling and simulation of multi-phase hydrodynamic properties (permeability and particle retention) of <b>filter</b> <b>fabrics.</b> We used the modules WeaveGeo, FeelMath and FilterDict of the simulation software GeoDict to perform the micro structure generation, the simulation of the tensile stress deformation and the computation of the filtration properties of undeformed and deformed filter media, respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work {{was to develop a}} textile finish based on the radical UV-curing of chitosan on textiles to confer antimicrobial properties. Chitosan is a biopolymer with unique properties such as biodegradability, non-toxicity, antimicrobial activity. In this work cotton or silk <b>fabrics</b> and synthetic <b>filter</b> <b>fabrics</b> were impregnated with an acid solution of chitosan added of the photoinitiator in the proper amount and cured at room temperature by exposure to UV lamp. Process conditions such as percentage add-on, dilution, chitosan-fabric contact time, irradiation time and power, were optimized. The antimicrobial activity of finished fabrics was tested according to ASTM E 2149 - 01 standard test performed with Escherichia Coli ATCC 8739. Moreover dyeing test with Turquoise Telon dye were carried out to evaluate the treatment homogeneity while the amino group content was determined by ninhydrin assay. Moreover on cotton and silk fabrics the treatment fastness to domestic laundering was tested, according to UNI EN ISO 105 -C 01. Obtained results showed a strong antimicrobial activity conferred by the treatment, homogeneous on fabric surface.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} fouling of {{conventional}} <b>filter</b> <b>fabrics</b> and membranes was studied. In {{the beginning of}} the thesis fouling and how it can be measured and predicted is reviewed. Information on different methods on how fouling canbe decreased or cleaned away is also given. The experimental part is divided into two sections; fabric filtration and membrane filtration. Fouling of the <b>filter</b> <b>fabrics</b> was studied with silica or cupper slurries and fouling of the membranes was studied with pulp and paper mill waters. The fouled filter materials were characterised according to many different methods. The most useful way to observe fouling is to measure the changes in the permeate flux. Fouling can also be seen visually e. g. with scanning electron microscopy. Consequently, also the reason for the fouling in question might be found. Different filtration characteristics affect fouling e. g. as the filtration pressure was increased it did not have much influence on the permeate flux, but the pressure caused the membrane to get fouled faster. Also, an increase of shear rate on the membrane surface decreased fouling. Different pretreatment methods for the effluent were tested in membrane filtration to decrease fouling. The tested methods; biological treatment, ozonation, enzymatic treatment and flocculation, did not have a clear influence on the fouling of the membrane, but e. g. a biological treatment combined with ultrafiltration made the tested groundwood mill circulation water purer than ultrafiltration alone...|$|R
50|$|While an {{external}} French drain can operate {{for ten years}} or more {{without the need for}} maintenance, it is prone to clogging without any warning and can eventually lead to a flooded basement. When there is no filter fiber, sediments can make their way through the stone as years pass and clog the drain, and when the <b>filter</b> <b>fabric</b> is present, that can instead clog with sediments. It may be wise to provide cleanouts, much as is done with sanitary sewers, to provide access for inspection with a camera snake. Also, a French drain that is not installed with a sump pump counts on gravity alone to drain foundation water, and if the house is not located on a hill or near a steep incline, finding this slope can be problematic. Additionally, maintenance on {{an external}} French drain involves expensive exterior excavation, which includes removal of walkways, shrubberies, porches, gardens, and anything else along the perimeter.|$|E

The stakes are installed on the downhill side of the fence, and the bottom edge of the fabric can be trenched into the soil and backfilled on the uphill side, although it is quite difficult to move the trenched [...] "spoil" [...] from the downside to the upside of the trench. The design/placement of the silt fence should create a pooling of runoff, which then allows sedimentation to occur.

A few hours after a storm event, the fabric can be [...] "disturbed" [...] in order to dislodge the fines, and allow clean water to flow through. Depending on the protected watershed and erosion, larger soil particles will settle out, ultimately filling the silt fence {{to the top of the}} structure; requiring another silt fence above or below it (creating a new ponding area), or for the silt fence to be removed, the sediment removed or spread out, and a new fence installed.
