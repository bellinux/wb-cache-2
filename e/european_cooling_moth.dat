40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. Reductions in Arctic sea ice may promote the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO-). It has been argued that NAO-related variability can be used an as analogue to predict the effects of Arctic sea ice loss on mid-latitude weather. Since NAO- events are associated with colder winters over Northern Europe, a negatively-shifted NAO has been proposed as a dynamical pathway for Arctic sea ice loss to cause Northern <b>European</b> <b>cooling.</b> This study uses large-ensemble atmospheric simulations with prescribed ocean surface conditions to examine how seasonal-scale NAO- events are affected by Arctic sea ice loss. Despite an intensification of NAO- events, reflected by more prevalent easterly flow, sea ice loss doesn’t lead to Northern <b>European</b> winter <b>cooling,</b> and daily cold extremes actually decrease. The dynamical cooling from the changed NAO is “missing” because it is offset (or exceeded) by a thermodynamical effect owing to advection of warmer air masses. J. A.

40|$|Paleorecords {{from distant}} {{locations}} {{on the globe}} show rapid and large amplitude climate variations during the last glacial period. Here we study the global climatic response to different states of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as a potential explanation for these climate variations and their possible connections. We analyse three glacial simulations obtained with an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model and characterised by different AMOC strengths (18, 15 and 2 Sv) resulting from successive ~ 0. 1 Sv freshwater perturbations in the North Atlantic. These AMOC states suggest {{the existence of a}} freshwater threshold for which the AMOC collapses. A weak (18 to 15 Sv) AMOC decrease results in a North Atlantic and <b>European</b> <b>cooling.</b> This cooling is not homogeneous, with even a slight warming over the Norwegian Sea. Convection in this area is active in both experiments, but surprisingly stronger in the 15 Sv simulation, which appears to be related to interactions with the atmospheric circulation and sea-ice cover. Far from the North Atlantic, the climatic response is not significant. The climate differences for an AMOC collapse (15 to 2 Sv) are much larger and of global extent. The timing of the climate response to this AMOC collapse suggests teleconnection mechanisms. Our analyses focus on the North Atlantic and surrounding regions, the tropical Atlantic and the Indian monsoon region. The North Atlantic cooling associated with the AMOC collapse induces a cyclonic atmospheric circulation anomaly centred over this region, which modulates the eastward advection of cold air over the Eurasian continent. This can explain why the cooling is not as strong over western Europe as over the North Atlantic. In the Tropics, the southward shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone appears to be strongest over the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific and results from an adjustment of the atmospheric and oceanic heat transports. Finally, the Indian monsoon weakening appears to be connected to the North Atlantic cooling via that of the troposphere over Eurasia. Such an understanding of these teleconnections and their timing could be useful for paleodata interpretation...|$|R

40|$|Climate reconstructions {{reveal a}} strong winter {{amplification}} of the cooling over central and northern continental Europe during the Little Ice Age period (LIA, here defined as c. 16 th- 18 th centuries) via persistent, blocked atmospheric conditions. Although various potential drivers {{have been suggested}} to explain the LIA cooling, no coherent mechanism has yet been proposed for this seasonal contrast. Here we demonstrate that such exceptional wintertime conditions arose from sea ice expansion and reduced ocean heat losses in the Nordic and Barents seas, driven by a multicentennial reduction in the northward heat transport by the subpolar gyre (SPG). However, these anomalous oceanic conditions were largely decoupled from the European atmospheric variability in summer. Our novel dynamical explanation is derived from analysis of an ensemble of last millennium climate simulations, and is supported by reconstructions of European temperatures and atmospheric circulation variability and North Atlantic/Arctic paleoceanographic conditions. We conclude that SPG-related internal climate feedbacks {{were responsible for the}} winter amplification of the <b>European</b> LIA <b>cooling.</b> Thus, characterization of SPG dynamics is essential for understanding multicentennial variations of the seasonal cycle in the European/North Atlantic sector...|$|R

The work focuses on the coupling among the neutronic, the thermal-elastic and the fluid-dynamic phenomena in the considered reactor channel, benefiting from a finite-element scheme of analysis that is implemented in the same simulation environment (COMSOL Multiphysics®), and within a computational domain featured by a moving mesh. A purpose-made six-group neutron diffusion model is developed, which allows {{to take into account}} the local dependency of the neutron macroscopic cross sections on the temperature and density fields.

40|$|Numerous {{records from}} the North Atlantic and the {{surrounding}} continents have shown rapid and large amplitude climate variability during the last glacial period. This variability has often been associated {{to changes in the}} Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Rapid climate change on the same time scales has also been reconstructed for sites far away from the North Atlantic, such as the tropical Atlantic, the East Pacific and Asia. The mechanisms explaining these climatic responses to the state of the AMOC are far from being completely understood, especially in a glacial context. Here we study three glacial simulations characterised by different AMOC strengths: 18, 15 and 2 Sv. With these simulations, we analyse the global climate sensitivity to a weak (18 to 15 Sv) and a strong (15 to 2 Sv) decrease in the AMOC strength. A weak decrease in the AMOC is associated, in our model simulations, to the classical North Atlantic and <b>European</b> <b>cooling,</b> but this cooling is not homogeneous over this region. We investigate the reasons for a lesser cooling (or even slight warming in some cases) over the Norwegian Sea and Northwestern Europe. It appears that the convection site in this area is active in both simulations, but that convection is unexpectedly stronger in the 15 Sv simulation. Due to the large variability of the atmosphere, it is difficult to definitely establish what is the origin of this climatic difference, but it appears that the atmospheric circulation anomaly helps sustaining the activity of this convection sites. Far from the North Atlantic, the climatic response is of small amplitude, the only significant change appearing in summer over the tropical Atlantic, where the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts southward. The climate differences between the 15 Sv and 2 Sv simulations are much larger and our analyses focus on three areas: the North Atlantic and surrounding regions, the Tropics and the Indian monsoon region. We study the timing of appearance of these responses to the AMOC shutdown, which gives some clues about the mechanisms for these teleconnections. We show that the North Atlantic cooling associated {{with the collapse of the}} AMOC induces a cyclonic atmospheric circulation anomaly centered over the North Atlantic, which modulates the eastward advection of the cold anomaly over the Eurasian continent. It can explain that the cooling is not as strong over Western Europe as over the North Atlantic and the rest of the Eurasian continent. Another modification in the northern extratropical stationary waves occurs over the Eastern Pacific, explaining a warming over Northwestern America. In the Tropics, the ITCZ southward shift in this simulation appears to be strongest over the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific and results from an ajustment of the atmospheric and oceanic transports. Finally, the Indian monsoon weakening also appears to be connected to the tropospheric cooling over Eurasia...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel on-line tritium monitor is presented. It {{is made with}} a single crystal diamond {{detector}} (SCD) covered with {{a thin layer of}} LiF 95 % enriched in 6 Li. Thermal neutrons impinging on the LiF layer produce α and T ions which are detected by the active diamond. The pulse height spectrum shows two separated peaks due to α and T ions respectively. By a proper calibration in a reference thermal flux the number of 6 Li atoms and thus the absolute n+ 6 Li→α+T reaction rate per unitary flux can be established. Once calibrated the detector can be used to measure the tritium production. Due to the many outstanding properties of diamond this detector could operate in the harsh working conditions of a fusion breeding blanket.

40|$|The {{major part}} of the {{magnetohydrodynamic}} pressure drop in the <b>European</b> water <b>cooled</b> concept for a fusion blanket arises in the circular pipes which distribute the liquid metal breeder among the poloidal containers. These channels are surrounded by a very massive structure of electrically conducting ferromagnetic material. The present work highlights the key problems which concern pressure drop and flow distribution in circular pipes with thick conducting walls. The point which has not been investigated in the past is the influence of ferromagnetic wall material. The wall acts like a magnetic shielding for moderate external magnetic fields. The field inside the pipe is strongly reduced and as a result also the magnetohydrodynamic pressure drop. For conditions relevant for applications in fusion blankets the magnetic shielding is not as perfect since the wall material reaches magnetic saturation at the very strong external fields required for the magnetic confinement of the fusion plasma. Therefore the reduction of pressure drop is small for magnetic fields which are much larger than the saturation field of the wall material. The most interesting regime exists near the magnetic saturation where curvilinear field lines inside the pipe are observed. They result in velocity profiles which differ from the well known classical solutions. (orig.)

40|$|Ventilative cooling as passive {{technique}} {{can limit}} overheating and decrease cooling energy consumption. The national energy performance regulations (EPBD) determine whether, how and under which requirements ventilative cooling can assist to reduce cooling demand and overheating. Therefore, those regulations {{are a key}} factor in the market uptake of ventilative cooling. Without a realistic and achievable approach, ventilative cooling will marginally be applied in buildings. In this study a kind of sensitivity analysis is performed {{to assess the impact of}} parameter variation on the ventilative cooling effect. One reference dwelling is selected and introduced into the EP software of Belgium, France and The Netherlands. In that way, differences in buildings characteristics between countries on the output are ignored. In the three countries ventilative cooling by means of openable windows can be taken into account, in Belgium and France as a percentage of openable windows, in The Netherlands as present or not. The ability of taking into account the properties of ventilative cooling devices is rare, although they have a significant impact on the effective operating time. As can be expected, ventilative cooling always decreases the cooling demand (28 to 74 % in Belgium, 29 to 35 % in The Netherlands for the studied case), especially in combination with mobile solar shading. Similar to the cooling demand, the risk on overheating in Belgium decreases by applying ventilative cooling. In France, summer indoor temperature can be strongly reduced by using openable windows, although the fraction openable windows has no effect. In The Netherlands, the risk on overheating cannot be assessed. The overall primary energy consumption of the reference dwelling is lower when ventilative cooling is applied (up to 9 % in Belgium and up to 3 % in The Netherlands) except for France where openable windows remarkably increase the heating demand (up to 29 %).

50|$|The car {{proved to}} be competitive, but {{somewhat}} unsuccessful even {{in the hands of}} two time world champion Nelson Piquet.

The testing was completed in hot conditions which suited the Pirellis as it allowed them to quickly get up to working temperature which masked their major flaw- in cooler temperatures, the Pirelli tyres just could not get up to working temperature as quickly as the Goodyear tyres.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Given {{the general}} shift {{in recent decades}} towards a lower heating and higher cooling demand for {{buildings}} in many <b>European</b> countries, passive <b>cooling</b> by night-time ventilation {{has come to be}} seen as a promising option, particularly in the moderate or cold climates of Central, Eastern and Northern Europe. The basic concept involves cooling the building structure overnight in order to provide a heat sink that is available during the occupancy period. In this study, the potential for the passive cooling of buildings by night-time ventilation is evaluated by analysing climatic data, irrespective of any building-specific parameters. An approach for calculating degree-hours based on a variable building temperature ― within a standardized range of thermal comfort ― is presented and applied to climatic data from 259 stations throughout Europe. The results show a very high potential for night-time ventilative cooling over the whole of Northern Europe and a still significant potential in Central, Eastern and even some regions of Southern Europe. However, given the inherent stochastic properties of weather patterns, series of warmer nights can occur at some locations, where passive cooling by night-time ventilation alone might not suffice to guarantee thermal comfort. It should also be remembered that climatic cooling potential is likely to have fallen appreciably by the end of the 21 st century due to climate warming...|$|R
40|$|With {{respect to}} {{nitrides}} being considered as potential fast reactor fuels, research is {{conducted on the}} out-of-pile thermophysical properties, sintering and fabrication processes, gas migration mechanisms, self-diffusion and point defect behaviour of actinide nitrides, their surrogate materials, and the inert matrix material ZrN. The experimental research, {{carried out in the}} framework of qualifying fuel for the <b>European</b> Lead <b>Cooled</b> Training Reactor (ELECTRA), shows that sintered ZrN and (Dy,Zr) N pellet densities are influenced by the oxygen concentration in the material. The effect is confirmed in sintered (Pu,Zr) N pellets. Oxygen concentration also plays a role in the thermophysical properties of inert matrix nitride fuels, but does not {{have an impact on the}} electrical properties of these materials. With the fuel fabrication methods applied here, clean nitride powders can be synthesized. However, the subsequent fabrication phases, including milling and solid solution formation, increases the impurity levels significantly. Research of equal importance is performed on materials free of fabrication-induced impurities, whose properties are studied by employing first-principles methods. ZrN, UN and (U,Zr) N are studied, whereas the results from ZrN are expected to be applicable for actinide nitrides as a first approximation. The migration of noble gases in ZrN, on the atomic scale, confirms the experimentally observed tendency for noble gases with higher atomic number to be retained in the fuel matrix, while the majority of He is released to the fuel pin. Materials modelling implies that self-diffusion of nitrogen and metal atoms in inert matrix nitride fuels is accelerated under irradiation, since noble gas retention reduces migration barriers which govern self-diffusion. Unlike Kr and Xe, He has the capacity to be released into the fuel matrix, after having been trapped in a vacancy. The results are expected to aid in providing an explanation to the macroscopic diffusion phenomena in nitride fuels, as the diffusion behaviour of noble gases is sparsely studied. In addition, a study on the miscibility of ZrN and UN in a narrow composition range suggests solubility, based on the negative mixing energies. The results obtained from research on inert matrix nitride fuel underline several beneficial properties which are desirable in a fast reactor fuel. The relevance of these results is analyzed and contextualized in the thesis, from the perspective of current research and development in the field. QC 20130611 </p...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the Earth's orbit lead {{to changes}} in the {{seasonal}} and meridional distribution of insolation. We quantify the influence of orbitally induced changes on the seasonal temperature cycle in a transient simulation of the last 6000 years – from the mid-Holocene to today – using a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM) including a land surface model (JSBACH). The seasonal temperature cycle responds directly to the insolation changes almost everywhere. In the Northern Hemisphere, its amplitude decreases according to an increase in winter insolation and a decrease in summer insolation. In the Southern Hemisphere, the opposite is true. Over the Arctic Ocean, however, decreasing summer insolation leads to an increase of sea-ice cover. The insulating effect of sea ice between the ocean and the atmosphere favors more continental conditions over the Arctic Ocean in winter, resulting in strongly decreasing temperatures. Consequently, there are two competing effects: the direct response to insolation changes and a sea-ice dynamics feedback. The sea-ice feedback is stronger, and thus an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle over the Arctic Ocean occurs. This increase is strongest over the Barents Shelf and influences the temperature response over northern Europe. We compare our modelled seasonal temperatures over Europe to paleo reconstructions. We find better agreements in winter temperatures than in summer temperatures and better agreements in northern Europe than in southern Europe, since the model does not reproduce the southern <b>European</b> Holocene summer <b>cooling</b> inferred from the paleo data. The temperature reconstructions for northern Europe support the notion of the influence of the sea-ice effect on the evolution of the seasonal temperature cycle...|$|R
