40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Clinical trials assessing typical <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> require authorisation from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Older {{adults in}} care homes have {{increasingly}} complex health care needs, and care provision should be evidence-based whenever possible. However, recruitment of frail, older people to research {{is a complex}} process and often results in care home residents being excluded from research participation. This paper draws {{on the experience of}} setting up a randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of probiotics on antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in care home residents [Probiotics for Antibiotic Associated Diarrhoea in Care Homes (PAAD) Study] in Wales. Findings: Significant challenges were encountered setting up a clinical trial in care homes. There were a number of barriers and facilitative factors encountered that were unique to this research setting. The classification of the study intervention (a widely available food supplement with a low risk safety profile) as an <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product,</b> with the associated requirements including obtaining statutory approvals and research governance, had a major impact. Conclusion: The process for setting up a clinical trial of an <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> in care homes has been more complex and time consuming than the process for setting up an observational study in the same setting, and clinical trials in other health care settings. We recommend regulatory changes to ensure approvals processes are more proportionate to risk and context, to ensure that care home residents have the opportunity to participate in research and are able to help generate much needed evidence to underpin care.

40|$|Background Some {{level of}} {{monitoring}} is usually required during {{a clinical trial}} {{to protect the rights}} and safety of trial participants and to safeguard the quality and reliability of trial results. Although there is increasing support for the use of risk-proportionate approaches to achieve these aims, the variety of methods and lack of an empirical evidence base can present challenges for clinical trial practitioners. Methods This paper describes the monitoring methods and procedures that are utilised by a noncommercial clinical trials unit which coordinates a range of clinical trials across a variety of clinical areas with different associated risks. Results Monitoring activities and approaches should be selected to be proportionate to the risks identified within a trial. A risk-proportionate approach to monitoring is described giving details of methods that may be considered by clinical trial practitioners during the development of a trial monitoring plan.

40|$|Background: Research {{in public}} health {{emergencies}} requires trials {{to be set up}} in readiness for activation at short notice and in anticipation of limited timelines for patient recruitment. We conducted a simulated activation of a hibernating pandemic influenza clinical trial in order to test trial processes and to determine the value of such simulation in maintaining trial readiness. Methods: The simulation involved the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, one participating hospital, one manufacturing unit and the <b>Investigational</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Product</b> (IMP) supplier. During the exercise, from 15 September 2015 to 2 December 2015, clinical staff at the participating site completed the trial training package, a volunteer acting as a patient was recruited to the study, ‘dummy’ IMP was prescribed and follow-up completed. Results: Successful activation of the hibernating trial with patient recruitment within 4 weeks of ‘arousal’ as planned was demonstrated. A need for greater resilience in anticipation of staff absenteeism was identified, particularly in relation to key trial procedures where the potential for delay is high. A specific issue relating to the IMP Stock Control System was highlighted as a potential source of error that could compromise the randomisation sequence.

40|$|Background: EULAR {{recommendations}} {{for the management of}} systemic glucocorticoid (GC) therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) state that a reduction and even a discontinuation should be attempted once remission or low disease activity (LDA) has been reached 1; however, a GC reduction schedule has not yet been standardized. This study was set-up to evaluate a predefined GC dose reduction schedule in tocilizumab (TCZ) treated RA patients with LDA (DAS 28 [disease activity score] ≤ 3. 2). Objectives: The primary objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the proportion of RA patients with LDA able to discontinue oral GC within 20 weeks, with confirmation of the GC-free status and maintained LDA 4 weeks later. Methods: The ACT-Alone study was an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase IV study consisting of 2 parts. First, a non interventional, observational phase of up to 6 months, during which adult RA patients were treated according to routine practice with oral GC and TCZ (8 mg/kg IV perfusion every 4 weeks), with or without DMARDs, with the aim of achieving LDA. Once LDA was achieved, patients took part in a 28 -week interventional phase, during which they were treated with oral methylprednisolone (MP, the <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product,</b> at a dose of ≥ 1 mg to ≤ 20 mg/day) and TCZ, with or without DMARDs. This part consisted of a 4 week GC run-in phase to confirm LDA under MP treatment, followed by a phase of up to 20 weeks where patients followed a fixed GC dose reduction schedule. GC-free status with maintained LDA was confirmed 4 weeks after discontinuation of MP. Results: 43 patients were analysed in the GC reduction phase of the study (ITT population). 58. 1 % of patients discontinued GC within 20 weeks with confirmation of LDA 4 weeks later, and 93. 3 % of study completers were able to reduce GC by ≥ 50 % after 24 weeks. In general, disease activity and levels of pain and disability remained at a low level throughout the interventional phase of the study, despite reduction and discontinuation of oral MP. Mean DAS 28 values remained < 2. 6 throughout the GC reduction phase and mean CDAI values remained < 10. No major safety issues were observed during the study. During the GC reduction phase, 60. 5 % reported at least one AE and one SAE was reported by one patient (2. 3 %). AEs were considered as related to MP for 6 patients (14. 0 %) and as severe in intensity for 4 patients (9. 3 %). Conclusions: The ACT-Alone study shows that GC treatment can be safely reduced and often discontinued in patients reaching LDA with TCZ backbone therapy. Just over half (58. 1 %) of the patients following the fixed GC reduction schedule were able to discontinue GC within 20 weeks, with confirmation of GC-free status and maintained LDA 4 weeks later. Disease activity, pain and disability remained at low levels throughout the GC dose reduction phase and no safety issues were observed. Reduction of the cumulative GC dose is likely to decrease the long-term risk of infectious and metabolic adverse effects and as such could improve patients' quality of life. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background The gold {{standard}} of trial design is the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. Intravenous medication, which needs reconstitution by the attending clinician {{in an emergency}} situation, can be challenging to incorporate into a suitably blinded study. Discussion We have developed a method of blindly reconstituting and administering fibrinogen concentrate (presented as a lyophilized powder), where the placebo is normal saline. Fibrinogen concentrate is increasingly being used early {{in the treatment of}} major hemorrhage. Our methodology was designed for a multicenter study investigating the role of fibrinogen concentrate in the treatment of the coagulopathy associated with major obstetric hemorrhage.

30|$|The European Parliament and the European Commission now {{recently}} have issued a legal act that regulates {{the requirements for}} clinical trials within the European Union (EU regulation No 536 / 2014). The overall purpose of this regulation was to facilitate and harmonise clinical research in the member states and therefore the regulation has very clearly exempted the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals from the requirements of GMP (Decristoforo et al. 2014) if it “is carried out in hospitals, health centres or clinics, by pharmacists or other persons legally authorised in the Member State concerned to carry out such process, and if the <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> are intended to be used exclusively in hospitals, health centres or clinics {{taking part in the}} same clinical trial in the same Member State”, thereby specifying the framework in which it should be applied, not being intended for radiopharmaceuticals manufactured industrially and being distributed. In a similar way a number of European member states have set up a regulatory framework in which radiopharmaceuticals for routine use (i.e. not for clinical trials) can be prepared on site without the requirements of a marketing authorisation.

40|$|Introduction. Due to the {{necessity}} to obtain the reliable results of a clinical trial and to distribute it {{to the general population}} of patients the problem of recruiting the adequate number of individuals {{to participate in the study}} as objects of observation in the group receiving the <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> or as a member of the control group should to be solved. Aim of study. The aim of our study was to research and to justify practically the methodological approaches to determining financial compensation for participation of volunteers in the clinical trials and the appropriate methods of its calculation. Material and methods. For the purpose of determining the baseline factors for calculating the hourly compensation the survey of healthy volunteers and of expert professionals as well as the analysis of its results have been done. Questioning healthy volunteers regarding their attitudes towards inconvenience and discomfort during participation in clinical trials was held at the Ukrainian clinical research centers. Survey participants number was 99, they were healthy volunteers who took part in the first phase clinical trial or bioequivalence studies. The expert survey included questioning of the 193 professionals from Ukrainian clinical research centers, CRO, pharmaceutical manufacturers – research sponsors and collaborators State Expert Center Ministry of Health of Ukraine, who were involved in the planning, organization, implementation and evaluation of clinical trials as well as their regulatory control. Results of study. Using the method of pairwise comparisons and iterative refinement procedures the collective estimate of experts questionnaire results has been performed, by the results of which the nine indicators have been identified and the importance of each of them as units of discomfort have been established. Motivational factors of voluntary participation in clinical trials have been studied. Motivation system for participation in clinical trials by patients and healthy volunteers has been rationalized, whereas methods of calculating monetary compensation for such participation have been suggested. The two methods of calculating of the financial compensation were proposed: first - hourly compensation for the time which was spent on clinical trials, the second - hourly-bonus compensation for the possible discomfort and inconvenience of participation in clinical trials in accordance with the ethical rules for research involving people as objects of observation. Conclusion. Achievement of the organizational and financial constituent ensuring participation of volunteers in a clinical trial on the one hand should assure the appropriate experimental foundation for reliable research conducting and on other hand should focus attention on the fulfillment of mental and ethical rules for investigations involving human as a studied object. Basing on the results of an analysis and the survey performed which involved qualified experts regarding aspects affecting volunteers enrollment in a clinical trial, the scientifically substantiated system of the volunteers discomfort and inconvenience assessment in a clinical trial has been proposed, which includes criteria: study duration, adverse events/adverse reactions possibility, blood sampling during study, discomfort caused by study design, inconvenience to participate in a clinical trial. Two techniques for calculation of the financial compensation for healthy volunteers participation in a clinical trial have been proposed: the first one is the payment by the hour spent for participation in a study, and the second one is the hourly pay with bonus for possible discomfort caused by involvement in a clinical trial. In the further study authors plan to research the aspects of risk assessment associated with volunteers participation in a clinical trial and its considering as an additional constituent in the process of the calculation of financial incentives to participate in a clinical trial. ...|$|E
40|$|To date, the tracer most {{used for}} {{molecular}} imaging in oncology is [18 F]FDG. Despite its clinical {{use for the}} visualisation of various types of cancers, [18 F]FDG displays several shortcomings including uptake in brown fat or inflamed tissues, high urinary clearance or brain uptake, and low uptake in poorly differentiated tumours. This rationalizes the drive to develop new tracers {{that are based on}} other metabolic pathways like protein synthesis, tumour cell proliferation, or fatty acid synthesis. In this respect, [18 F]FCho is a promising alternative because its uptake in tumour cell is correlated to up regulated and elevated levels of choline kinase and choline transporters. Due to the affinity for the kinase enzyme, choline is metabolically trapped in tumour cells with superior imaging properties as result. To further elaborate the potential of [18 F]FCho as radiotracer, a semi-automated Scintomics synthesis module was modified for its production. However, using the prescribed synthesis procedures, we observed high levels of residual DMAE in the [18 F]FCho solution thus obtained. Remarkably, few {{attention has been paid to}} this defect, especially since in previously published reports it was noted that [11 C]Cho uptake was altered by the presence of residual DMAE. As a consequence, we attempted to produce [18 F]FCho with higher purity (i. e., lower DMAE levels) and, in line with this, to elucidate the role of residual DMAE on [18 F]FCho uptake using F 98 glioma cell lines and xenograft mouse models (Chapter 3). Having a [18 F]FCho preparation method available, an <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> dossier was compiled for 2 clinical trials to be conducted using this tracer: 1) for the early detection of glioma recurrence after treatment of the primary tumour and 2) for differentiation between cirrhotic changes and malignant lesions in well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). These trials required the implementation of a fully validated quality system for the production and quality control of the final [18 F]FCho solution. To assure long-term stability of this procedure, a retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the quality of the produced tracer and the validated synthesis procedure. Moreover, the compliance of the synthesis procedures and quality controls with the forthcoming PIC/s regulations for hospital pharmacies was evaluated (Chapter 4). Considering the need for quantification of the radiotracer uptake to evaluate biological processes, we assumed it was appropriate to determine a proper kinetic model for [18 F]FCho. The selected kinetic model was verified against the corresponding, but simplified graphical analysis to obtain a robust and reliable method that allows absolute quantification of the tracer uptake in tissues (Chapter 5). [18 F]FCho is currently used for the visualisation of various tumours, but oxidative metabolisation to the corresponding betaine compromises sensitivity. The development of analogues, which are less susceptible to this oxidation, seems a feasible strategy to induce tracer uptake in the tumours with improved sensitivity. For this reason, dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) and homocholine were labelled with [18 F]fluoride and evaluated in vivo as potential biomarkers for the aberrant phospholipids metabolism. Indeed, preliminary in vitro tests indicated that [14 C]- and [11 C]-labelled DMAE are better tracers to visualize the tumours phospholipids metabolism, because their uptake in various tumour cells was 2 to 7 -fold higher than for [14 C]- and [11 C]-labelled choline. Considering the better radiophysical properties of [18 F]fluorinated compounds, synthesis was attempted of [18 F]-labelled DMAE as a new tracer for tumour imaging (Chapter 6). On the other hand, it was published that homocholine shows reduced affinity for the choline dehydrogenase enzyme. Accordingly, evaluation of radiolabelled homocholine and its analogues as potential biomarkers for the aberrant phospholipids metabolism was aimed at (Chapter 7) ...|$|E

Diagnostics and e.) Drug Design and Target Validation. The Department of Cell Engineering consists of the Cell Engineering GLP Unit and the Cell Engineering GMP Unit. Preclinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) - studies for cell-based medicinal products in small and large animal models are the main focus of the Cell Engineering GLP Unit. The Cell Engineering GMP Unit operates with more than 60 employees two state of the art clean room facilities for aseptic manufacturing according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The facilities are designed for manufacturing and quality control of autologous or allogeneic cell-based therapeutics so-called Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products - ATMP's (e. g. tissue engineering products, somatic cell therapeutics, gene therapeutics) for clinical trials. A comprehensive quality assurance system covering the nine chapters of the EU Guidelines to Good Manufacturing Practice is the framework for all manufacturing and quality control activities. It consists of more than 750 documents and to date has been successfully inspected eight times by the Germany pharmaceutical authorities. The Cell Engineering GMP unit offers the following services to clients: a.) contract manufacturing and quality control; b.) support in set-up and validation of GMP-compliant manufacturing processes and quality control assays (process development); c.) application for product specific manufacturing authorizations according to section 13 German Drug Act; d.) application for tissue procurement permissions according to section 20 b German Drug Act; e.) application for import permissions from countries outside of the European Union (e. g. for human derived materials used for manufacturing); f.) support in regard to <b>Investigational</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Product</b> Dossier (IMPD) writing and g.) regulatory consultancy. The clients that perform their clinical trials together with Fraunhofer IZI's Cell Engineering GMP Unit are mainly biotechnology companies from all over the world, e. g. from USA or Australia. Manufactured products range from Dendritic Cell based immunotherapies up to stem cell based products. A wide variety of clinical trials up to phase III pivotal studies are within the current project spectrum. The annual revenue of the Cell Engineering GMP Unit in 2013 was 2, 850, 000 Euro. This was sufficient to cover all running costs and to generate a slight positive cash flow that is used as a backup if required. In addition to the given information in regard to infrastructure, services, clients and budget this presentation will provide specific information about methods to recruit talented human resources and to reach and maintain a sustainable business model in the cell therapy manufacturing area...|$|E

In order to have powerful studies, attain unquestionable results and make significant discoveries, the number of patients enrolled must be high. Therefore, multinational, randomised clinical trials are necessary. The multicentre, multinational recruitment of subjects in investigator-initiated clinical trials (IICTs) increases their logistical burden, justifying the need for specific infrastructures to ease implementation. Herein, we provide for the first time an overview of the facts and figures concerning IICTs, existing infrastructures' capacity for interventional clinical research, and scientific performance of investigators in a European country, Portugal. We aim to highlight the relevance and need for investing in European infrastructures such as the European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network (ECRIN) for multinational IICTs. A public, non-profit organisation, ECRIN facilitates the conduct of multinational clinical trials in Europe by coordinating scientific partners and their networks, and providing advice, management services and tools to enhance collaboration. Currently in Portugal, few multinational randomised IICTs are coordinated by national investigators. This is most likely {{due to the lack of}} human resources dedicated to clinical trials in clinical research centres (CRCs) as well as the scarcity of professional academic clinical trial units (CTUs) providing logistics and management services at non-profit rates. With the data shown, we expect to trigger the development of similar studies in other European countries and stress the impact of government support for IICTs...|$|R
40|$|Patients who {{search for}} a better treatment, an {{increased}} quality of life, or even a chance to preserve life itself may claim to {{have an interest in}} accessing <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (IMPs), particularly where no validated treatment for their disease or condition exists. For many, awaiting the uncertain and time-consuming process of converting an IMP into an approved drug may not appear a realistic option, as prognoses may be grim and a dramatic outcome may seem hard to avert. Gaining access to an IMP, however, often proves to be a difficult enterprise with a highly uncertain outcome. In addition, the process of seeking access to IMPs is surrounded by various ethical issues, that will be explored in this article. In this paper, we explore the ethical concerns in two potential tracks of seeking access to IMPs for minors: on individual basis, or collectively, as a patient organization. In our discourse, we identify several unique ethical and regulatory concerns related to the direct negotiation of access to IMPs for minor patients, with a focus on product safety, the recruitment of research subjects, the unnoticed entry of market mechanisms in the recruitment of research subjects, and the sidelining of third parties in the recruitment process. We conclude our paper with a concise reflection on the way forward. The quest for access to investigational drugs is particularly relevant to pediatric practice, where a significant share of the drugs prescribed has never been tested in children or labeled for use in the pediatric population. status: publishe...|$|R

The final published version is available at [URL] DOI: 10. 1016 /S 1470 - 2045 (08) 70184 - 0 The European Clinical Trials Directive 2001 / 20 /EC aimed to harmonise standards for clinical trials throughout the European Union, and was implemented in UK law by the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004. As a result, all trials of <b>investigational</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> must comply with the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice issued by the European Medicines Agency, and undertaking a trial now requires a range of approvals from different agencies. These approvals are generally sought in parallel. Clinical trial authorisation from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA; London, UK) is required, but before applying to the MHRA, {{the approval of the}} trial sponsor must be obtained, and the trial must be registered with the European Clinical Trials Database. Research governance approval from the UK National Health Service (NHS) organisations in which the trial is to be done must be given. An important requirement is a favourable opinion from a Research Ethics Committee (REC). A REC application involves completion of a form and submission of supporting documentation, which is then considered at a REC meeting to which applicants will be invited to attend. Details of success rates of applications to RECs specifically to undertake cancer trials are unknown, but numbers from the National Research Ethics Service (NRES), which coordinates the REC system, suggest that only 17 % of all applications receive a favourable opinion at first review by a REC in the UK. 1 Most (66 %) of opinions are provisional and require further response and modification before a final decision is rendered, whereas 8 % of all submissions receive an unfavourable opinion (the remainder are withdrawn or otherwise deferred) ...|$|R
