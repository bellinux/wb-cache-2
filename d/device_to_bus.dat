40|$|Abstract—This paper {{demonstrates}} the bus location {{system for the}} route bus through the experiment in the real environment. A bus location system {{is a system that}} provides information such as the bus delay and positions. This system uses actual services and positions data of buses, and those information should match data on the database. The system has two possible problems. One, the system could cost high in preparing <b>devices</b> <b>to</b> get <b>bus</b> positions. Two, it could be difficult to match services data of buses. To avoid these problems, we have developed this system at low cost and short time by using the smart phone with GPS and the bus route system. This system realizes the path planning considering bus delay and displaying position of buses on the map. The bus location system was demonstrated on route buses with smart phones for two months.

40|$|Abstract — AC motors play a {{vital role}} in {{industrial}} and domestic applications. Due to different tasks of application, most of the industries need to have variable speeds of operation of AC motors using Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs). The operation of VFDs is controlled by control signals from reference signal generator. Here, it has to be noted that transfer of analog control signal to the electric drive, from reference signal generator (located at the control room) will takes place through control bus. Long distance control bus routing and bad operating environment leads to possible failure of signal transfer on control <b>bus.</b> Due <b>to</b> such failures, the drive ends up losing the control from operator. Present paper describes a protective <b>device</b> <b>to</b> control <b>bus.</b> The Signal Loss Recovery System for AC Drive is intended to feed the control signal to the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) in case of failure in control signal transfer to VFD. The System contains „Analog to Digital and Digital to Analog Converters ‟ and Fractional Signal selector switches with system Status Indicators. For the effective control of the whole system, a microcontroller is included. This paper describes the Fabrication and Development of one such Signal Loss Recovery System. The operation principles, control algorithm employed in this context and the interesting results obtained are presented in this paper...|$|R
