5|$|Offshore <b>helicopter</b> {{operations}} commenced out of Brønnøysund Airport in 1981, when Helikopter Service was contracted for fly to exploration {{field on}} Trænabanken. A combined fixed-wing and <b>helicopter</b> hangar {{was completed in}} 1983. The contract changed to Lufttransport from 1984. Operations remained limited and in 1989 the airport only saw 34 <b>helicopter</b> flights. The exploration resulted in a positive find on the Norne field, which started production in 1997. Norsk Helikopter, later renamed Bristow Norway, established a <b>helicopter</b> base at Brønnøysund Airport n 2002 and took over flights to the Skarv Oil Field.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Air Ambulance {{operates}} both a <b>helicopter</b> and fixed-wing {{air ambulance}} service out of Brønnøysund Airport. Aircraft operations are subcontracted to Lufttransport, which operates an AgustaWestland AW139 <b>helicopter</b> and a Beech King Air fixed-wing aircraft. Both are manned by medical personnel from Helgeland Hospital Trust. In 2011, the <b>helicopter</b> flew 465 missions and the fixed-wing aircraft 1022 missions.|$|E
5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the <b>helicopter</b> scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen {{got the idea for}} the remote-controlled <b>helicopter</b> after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a <b>helicopter</b> through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the <b>helicopter</b> was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized <b>helicopter</b> model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying <b>helicopter,</b> while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E

The S-76 <b>helicopters</b> were previously owned and operated by Canadian <b>Helicopters,</b> but are now owned by Ornge and operated by Canadian <b>Helicopters.</b> The S-76 <b>helicopters</b> will be serviced by Canadian <b>Helicopters</b> until April 2012.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the mission}} plan, the first <b>helicopter</b> would hover over the compound's yard while its full team of SEALs fast-roped to the ground. At the same time, the second <b>helicopter</b> would fly to the {{northeast}} corner of the compound and deploy the interpreter, the dog and handler, and four SEALs to secure the perimeter. The team in the courtyard was to enter the house from the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Aided by Whitman—who {{has managed}} to {{negotiate}} some degree of freedom with the Solarii—Lara returns to the palace to rescue Sam as Roth commandeers a <b>helicopter</b> to get them out. Lara succeeds, but persuades Sam to escape by land when she sees another storm gathering as the <b>helicopter</b> approaches. As Lara tries to force the <b>helicopter</b> pilot to land, they are brought down, with Lara nearly dying. Roth revives Lara, then takes a fatal blow from Mathias meant for her.|$|E
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first <b>helicopter</b> {{experienced}} a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the <b>helicopter</b> rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the <b>helicopter</b> were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other <b>helicopter</b> landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E

5|$|At around 09:30, {{the four}} CH-46 {{helicopters}} arrived in Ngok Tavak, {{and they were}} able to unload Makowski and about 45 soldiers of the 12th MSF Company. However, the VC demonstrated their domination of the landing zone when the first <b>helicopter</b> was hit with anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to land on the ground, intact, though with damages to the fuel line. Moments later, the third <b>helicopter</b> was struck by a rocket propelled grenade as it turned around to rescue the crews of the first downed <b>helicopter,</b> and it was destroyed immediately. Now, with two downed helicopters blocking the landing zone, the remaining helicopters were prevented from landing on the ground, so the wounded men had to be evacuated while the helicopters were still hovering. As the last <b>helicopter</b> took off, two Nungs and one stranded U.S. soldier grabbed the <b>helicopter</b> skids to get out of Ngok Tavak, but they all fell to their deaths. Shortly after his arrival, Makowski placed the 12th MSF Company under the command of his Australian counterpart, as the situation continued to worsen.|$|E
5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in Vietnam was winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat {{as well as the}} political climate regarding military acquisition programs had caused the Army to amend the service's attack <b>helicopter</b> requirements in favor of a twin-engine conventional <b>helicopter,</b> viewed as less technical and more survivable. The Army announced a new program for an Advanced Attack <b>Helicopter</b> (AAH) on 17 August 1972, which {{led to the development of}} the AH-64 Apache.|$|E

Mikalsen also contacted the Bodø rescue team, which was equipped with a Sea King <b>helicopter,</b> but they told him that the <b>helicopter</b> had left to transport a sick child.

5|$|During 1982, the U.S. Army {{initiated}} the Light <b>Helicopter</b> Experimental (LHX) {{program with the}} aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance <b>helicopter.</b> During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name had been changed from LHX to simply Light <b>Helicopter</b> (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase. It was in that same month that the <b>helicopter</b> received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state <b>helicopter</b> from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the <b>helicopter</b> to crash in Shelby County.

The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the <b>helicopter.</b>|$|E
