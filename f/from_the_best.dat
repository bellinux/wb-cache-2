The Investor Relations Society published best practice Web site guidelines in December 2006 to guide companies seeking {{to improve the quality}} of their on-line communication with investors via their corporate Web sites. Guidelines were given for presentation (the way in which information is communicated) and content (the information that is communicated). This study focused only on content. A 20 -point checklist was developed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> prescribed <b>best</b> practice. <b>The</b> checklist focused on the six categories of best practice that entail company information, annual reports of the current year and archive, relevant news, shareholder information, bondholder information, corporate governance and corporate responsibility. Seventy-eight companies in Africa (40 from South Africa and 38 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>'rest</b> of Africa', that is Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and Tunisia) were evaluated against this checklist. Companies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>'rest</b> of Africa' rated lower than South African companies in all categories on the checklist. Although South African companies received ratings above 90 % for all categories, besides bondholder information, many of these companies do not supply shareholder, corporate governance and corporate responsibility information via dedicated sections on their corporate Web sites. The results for companies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>'rest</b> of Africa' were disappointing, especially with regard to communication of annual reports, shareholder information, bondholder information and corporate responsibility. Although possible reasons for these disappointing results are discussed in this study, further research should be conducted to determine the reason(s) why important elements of information are not communicated via corporate Web sites...|$|R

5|$|The three episodes {{were tied}} {{together}} by {{the story of a}} murdered Haitian domestic worker employed by wealthy philanthropist Felix Wilson, played by Jones. Protagonists Frank Pembleton and Al Giardello initially refuse to properly investigate the Wilson family out of respect for their success and contributions to the African American community of Baltimore, which leads to tensions and accusations of discrimination within the police department. The storyline serves as a rumination and commentary on racism and classism, even when they come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of intentions.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Tangled, Frozen {{employed}} a unique artistic style by blending together features of both computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional hand-drawn animation.

Buck, Lasseter, and Giaimo were all old friends who had first met at the California Institute of the Arts, and Giaimo had previously served as the art director for Disney's Pocahontas (1995), which Buck had worked on as a supervising animator.|$|E

Various studio overdubs were made to the live recordings during early 1978 in Paris; exactly how much of the album is overdubbed has been a contentious topic since its release. The album reached No.2 in the UK album charts, ultimately selling over half a million copies. It has continued to attract critical acclaim and it has appeared in several lists of the greatest live albums of all time.|$|E
