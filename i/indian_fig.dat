5|$|The plant {{now known}} as Opuntia ficus-indica, or the <b>Indian</b> <b>fig</b> cactus, {{has long been an}} {{important}} source of food. The original species is thought to have come from central Mexico, although this is now obscure because the indigenous people of southern North America developed and distributed a range of horticultural varieties (cultivars), including forms of the species and hybrids with other opuntias. Both the fruit and pads are eaten, the former often under the Spanish name tuna, the latter under the name nopal. Cultivated forms are often significantly less spiny or even spineless. The nopal industry in Mexico was said to be worth US$150million in 2007. The <b>Indian</b> <b>fig</b> cactus was probably already present in the Caribbean when the Spanish arrived, and was soon after brought to Europe. It spread rapidly in the Mediterranean area, both naturally and by being introduced—so much so, early botanists assumed it was native to the area. Outside the Americas, the <b>Indian</b> <b>fig</b> cactus is an important commercial crop in Sicily, Algeria and other North African countries. Fruits of other opuntias are also eaten, generally under the same name, tuna. Flower buds, particularly of Cylindropuntia species, are also consumed.|$|E

60|$|The {{spirits of}} the party, however, which had been elated on first varying their journeying from land to water, had now lost some of their buoyancy. Everything ahead was wrapped in uncertainty. They knew nothing of the river on which they were floating. It had never been navigated by a white man, nor could they meet with an Indian to give them any {{information}} concerning it. It kept on its course through a vast wilderness of silent and apparently uninhabited mountains, without a savage wigwam upon its banks, or bark upon its waters. The difficulties and perils they had already passed made them apprehend others before them, that might effectually bar their progress. As they glided onward, however, they regained heart and hope. The current continued to be strong; but it was steady, and though they met with frequent rapids, {{none of them were}} bad. Mountains were constantly to be seen in different directions, but sometimes the swift river glided through prairies, and was bordered by small cotton-wood trees and willows. These prairies at certain seasons are ranged by migratory herds of the wide-wandering buffalo, the tracks of which, though not of recent date, were frequently to be seen. Here, too, were to be found the prickly pear or <b>Indian</b> <b>fig,</b> a plant which loves a more southern climate. On the land were large flights of magpies and American robins; whole fleets of ducks and geese navigated the river, or flew off in long streaming files at the approach of the canoes; while the frequent establishments of the painstaking and quiet-loving beaver showed that the solitude of these waters was rarely disturbed, even by the all-pervading savage.|$|E

40|$|Thomas et al. (1960) have {{emphasized}} that the blood factor is of greater importance than the atherosclerotic plaque (local factor) in thrombus formation. The nature of the postulated haemato-logical factor is not yet known {{and the relationship of}} findings of several workers (Merskey, Gordon, and Lachner, 1960; Poole, 1962; Gupta and Rai, 1963) regarding coagulation, to the significantly different incidence of thrombosis in various geo-graphic areas, is still uncertain. There are big differences in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease between South Indians and North Indians (Padmavati, 1962; Malhotra, 1967 a). Among railway employees in the trade of sweeper the disease is 15 times more common in men from South India as compared with those from North India (Malhotra, 1967 b). We therefore considered it profitable to look for any significant differences in the haematological factors of the cir-culating blood between these two population groups.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} our approaches {{towards the}} construction of a new taxol analogue, beginning with brevifoliol 1 or taxchinin A 2 both isolated, here in Leicester, from an <b>Indian</b> Yew resin. (<b>Fig.</b> 8728 A).;Attempts to selectively protect either OH(5) or OH(13), or construct the oxetane ring across positions C- 4 /C- 5, directly on brevifoliol 1, were unsuccessful. Hence, we hydrolysed all three ester groups, affording compound 3 for further investigations. On treating this derivative with di-tert-butylsilyl ditriflate, then triethylsilyl chloride, we achieved the successful formation of compounds 4 and 5. Conformational analysis of derivatives 3, 4, and 5, using 2 -D, NOESY and 29 Si-iH NMR spectroscopy, allowed us to determine the twist-boat/chair conformation of both these compounds. Assignment of these conformations, containing the unusual hydroxysilyl ether groups, strengthened our knowledge of 11 (15 - 1) abeo-taxanes, allowing us to continue work towards oxetane ring construction. (Fig. 8728 B).;In addition, hydrolysis of taxchinin A 2, furnished compound 6. Variable temperature NMR analysis showed this derivative exists, in solution, in conformational equilibrium. Treatment with di-tert-butylsilyl ditriflate then triethylsilyl chloride, gave compounds 7 and 8 in the twist-boat/chair and twist-chair/boat conformations respectively. This was again confirmed using 2 -D and NOESY NMR spectroscopy. (Fig. 8728 C).;We have shown, that in carrying out work on these rearranged taxanes, conformational behaviour is crucial to the outcome of the reaction and, as such, must be taken into account when constructing a new taxol analogue...|$|R

5000|$|A {{sensitive}} flame is a {{gas flame}} which under suitable adjustment of pressure resonates readily with sounds or air vibrations in the vicinity. Noticed {{by both the}} American scientist John LeConte and the English physicist William Fletcher Barrett, they recorded the effect that a shrill note had upon a gas flame issuing from a tapering jet. The phenomenon {{caught the attention of}} the Irish physicist John Tyndall who gave a lecture on the process to the Royal Institution in January 1867. In 1857 Prof. John LeConte discovered that an ordinary naked gas-flame, from a fish-tail or bat-wing burner, becomes an indicator of sound by vibrating in unison with an external source, provided the pressure be such that the flame is just ready to flare. This can be easily shown by blowing a shrill whistle or bowing a tuning-fork of high pitch in the immediate neighborhood of the flame, which at once becomes forked (Fig. 3) into several long, vibrating tongues. The effect soon ceases if the pressure be gradually diminished. This result is due to the disturbance produced by sound-waves on the outflowing jet of gas at the nozzle. The high temperature of flame is therefore not necessary for the production of such co-vibration, but serves to make it more easily manifest. Nine years elapsed after Dr. Le Conte's discovery before the subject was taken up again and independently by Mr. W. F. Barrett, in London, who used small cylindrical jets, which were found to flare under similar conditions, and could be rendered far more sensitive. A [...] "pin-hole lava-tip" [...] may be fitted into the end of a metal tube and connected by means of India-rubber tubing to a cylinder of compressed illuminating gas. In connection with this, also, there should be a water manometer gauge for regulating the pressure of the outflowing gas. If the pin-hole is very smoothly cylindrical, the flame mounts up to the height of nearly eighteen inches (Fig. 4, x), with an apparent thickness scarcely more than that of the little finger, and burning quietly. When the pressure approaches ten inches, as indicated by the water-gauge, the flame flares, becoming much shorter and broader, like a little <b>Indian</b> club (<b>Fig.</b> 4, y), and producing a low roaring sound, due to the escape of unburned gas. Let the pressure now be diminished until this flaring barely ceases. The flame is now in its most sensitive condition. Sounds of low or even medium pitch have no effect upon it; but on blowing a shrill whistle, or rattling a bunch of keys anywhere within thirty or forty feet, it flares. Perhaps the most beautiful illustration of its sensitiveness is given by placing an open watch near the nozzle but not touching it; every tick causes a momentary sinking and spreading of the flame, so that the effect may be seen across an audience-room. If the audience applauds with clapping of hands, the flame shrinks in acknowledgment. [...] "Popular Science Monthly/Volume 36/November 1889" ...|$|R
40|$|Sometime in late May 1882, several {{thousand}} bison {{appeared on the}} Great Sioux reservation about 100 {{miles west of the}} Standing Rock <b>Indian</b> agency (see <b>Fig.</b> O. According to James McLaughlin, the Standing Rock agent, the Indians knew 2 ̆ 2 instinctively 2 ̆ 2 that the buffalo had arrived, even though 2 ̆ 2 it had been many years since the buffalo had sought the hunting-grounds of that part of the reservation. 2 ̆ 2 With this 2 ̆ 2 rich store of succulent meat in sight, 2 ̆ 2 McLaughlin continued, 2 ̆ 2 it was not possible that the Indians could be held in check. 2 ̆ 2 On 10 June, over 600 Standing Rock Lakota and Yanktonais left the agency. Days later, they located the herd and killed 5, 000 bison. 1 McLaughlin 2 ̆ 7 s contention that the Indians knew 2 ̆ 2 instinctively 2 ̆ 2 that the bison had arrived revealed the common tendency of European Americans to represent Indians as primitives, so close to nature as to be almost animal-like. (The Standing Rock Sioux themselves probably attributed their knowledge of the bison 2 ̆ 7 s presence to a combination of religious and empirical sources.) With its tone of light-hearted nostalgia, McLaughlin 2 ̆ 7 s and other similar accounts of the 2 ̆ 2 last buffalo hunt 2 ̆ 2 also reflected the standard trope of the 2 ̆ 2 vanishing Indian. 2 ̆ 2 Like most Americans of the time, McLaughlin saw history as the outworking of inevitable laws of 2 ̆ 2 progress. 2 ̆ 2 These laws decreed that the buffalo must disappear and that, when they did, Plains Indians would either die off or be assimilated by a supposedly superior 2 ̆ 2 civilization. 2 ̆ 2 In this narrative, the last buffalo hunt decisively marked the end of a way of life. There was little room for continuity between the past and the future. 2 This moment, captured in books with titles like The Last Days of the Sioux Nation and The Long Death, continues to inform our understanding of the early reservation period. While many scholars have stressed the persistence of cultural identity, they have given less attention to the continuities in Plains Indians 2 ̆ 7 economic practices during the early reservation period. 3 Plains Indians certainly experienced profound and often wrenching changes as Americans forced them onto reservations and began implementing colonial policies. As I argue here, however, there were important and surprising-continuities in their economic strategies. To understand these strategies it is helpful to remind ourselves that Indians viewed their own circumstances in the early reservation period very differently from non-Indians. Plains Indians did not think the hardships they were suffering were part of an inevitable historical process that necessarily decreed they would have to experience physical or cultural death. Although they were subject to brutal oppression and often experienced demoralization and despair, they thought it was possible to retain their familial, community, and tribal identities and develop new ways to live well under reservation conditions. For Plains Indians, the future was contingent on human action and the willingness of the spiritual powers of the universe to take pity on them. At one level, their economic strategies were practical responses to pressing needs, but they were also informed by the hope that they could 2 ̆ 2 walk the good red road, 2 ̆ 2 in the words of Oglala Lakota holy man Black Elk. ...|$|R
