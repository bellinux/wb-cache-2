In a 2011 study, Fehr and Leibbrandt {{examined the relationship between}} contributions in public goods games to participation in public goods in the community of shrimpers in Brazil. These shrimpers cut a hole in the bottom of their fishing bucket in order to allow immature shrimp to escape, thereby investing in the public good of the shared shrimp population. The size of the hole {{can be seen as the}} degree to which participants cooperate, as larger holes allow more shrimp to escape. Controlling for a number of other possible influences, Fehr and Leibbrandt demonstrated a positive relationship between <b>hole</b> <b>size</b> and contributions in the public goods game experiment.|$|E
25|$|Thread forming is {{performed}} using a , or , which closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need}} to periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap and that an accurate <b>hole</b> <b>size</b> is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the impact of the rivet <b>hole</b> <b>sizing</b> process on the fatigue life based on the example of the {{structural}} connections characteristic for riveted joints used in aviation industry. Test specimens reflected the structural connection consisting in a riveted lap joint of an airplane plating stiffened with a T-bar. Connected plates and the T-bar are made of D 16 CzATW aluminum alloy. 3 mm diameter round head solid rivets for aviation-related purposes were made of PA 24 aluminum. During fatigue tests, individual specimens with non-sized <b>holes</b> and with <b>sized</b> <b>holes</b> were subjected to uniaxial, one-sided, fixed-amplitude loading (R = 0). It can be concluded from the fatigue life comparison that introduction of an additional operation in the riveting process, i. e. the <b>hole</b> <b>sizing,</b> results in significant, about two-fold increase of the fatigue life of the riveted structural connection, even at slight sizing degree. The difference of the specimen damage nature was observed between specimens with <b>sized</b> and non-sized <b>holes...</b>|$|R

The free-volume <b>hole</b> <b>sizes</b> {{for the present}} polymers were quantified from the long-lived ortho-positronium (o-Ps) lifetimes. In contrast {{to the case of}} the nonpolar hexene, introduction of the polar hexenol into PP decreased the o-Ps lifetimes, signifying the reduction of the free-volume <b>hole</b> <b>sizes.</b> This indicates that the interchain interaction due to the hydrogen bonds in the amorphous region is much stronger than the enhancement of the segmental motion due to the butyl long branch.
