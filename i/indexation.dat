Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to <b>indexation</b> of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed, and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} of the Cruzado Plan was to eliminate inflation with a dramatic blow. Between 1980 and 1985, {{the rise in the}} CPI had escalated from 86.3% to 248.5% annually. Early in 1986, the situation became desperate, prodding the implementation of the plan.

The authors systematically investigated whether PPI indexed as percentage or difference score is dependent on the magnitude of baseline startle reactivity in healthy human volunteers and in C 57 BL/ 6 mice.

30|$|The {{structural}} {{starting point}} of the economic transformation was an oversized state-owned industry characterized by low competition and weak interaction with the world market. Despite still being the majority owner, the state intervention had been limited to periodic wage <b>indexations</b> only for state institutions to diminish the increasing gap caused by more rapid wage increases in some industries because of the negotiations of collective and individual contracts. The wage setting, supplemented by price liberalization and privatization {{and a lack of}} (the enforcement of) laws had an effect on labor market participation (Earle and Sapatoru 1993), occupational attainment and, nonetheless, on people’s opinion about their opportunities and their place on the labor market. On the 2000 Gender Barometer, about half of the interviewees answered that real equality of rights between men and women does not exist. 3 The majority (75 - 88 %) considered gender not to be important in some occupations with respect to whom should be employed (e.g., media, nongovernmental organizations, public administration, health, agriculture and banking) but that men should be employed in mining and metallurgy and construction, and women should be employed in the textile industry.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Today, the {{petroleum}} industry demonstrates a greater concern toward ecology. Actions are undertaken {{in order to}} reduce the CO 2 emissions in particular. Storing the CO 2 in depleted petroleum reservoirs represents one of the ways of controlling the CO 2 emissions. However, a prior modeling of the reservoirs has to be done for a secure storage. This geological modeling task follows series of complex workflows (business processes) of data processing services. These workflows are built without any methodological rule. It is difficult for geologists to execute workflows or even services that they have not designed. Moreover, it is not possible to build new workflows without having a precise knowledge on the compounding services and sub-workflows. We claim that in order to solve the two stated problems, explicit semantics has to be applied to describe the workflows and the services that compose them. In this article, we first explain how geologists operate today. Then, we show how we enrich geological model-ing workflows, the services that compose them and the data they manipulate with semantic <b>indexations</b> through ontology-based characterizations (Geological Data and Services Ontologies). Finally, we explain how our ap-proach supports reuse of existing workflows and build new ones. ...|$|R

25|$|The plan's {{immediate}} {{results were}} spectacular: the monthly {{rate of inflation}} fell close to zero, economic growth surged upward, and the foreign accounts remained under control. However, {{by the end of}} 1986 the plan was in trouble. The wage adjustments were too large, increasing aggregate demand excessively and creating inflationary pressures. Moreover, the price freeze was maintained for too long, creating distortions and leading to shortages {{of a growing number of}} products. Inflation accelerated again and there was a return of <b>indexation.</b> The country imposed a moratorium on its foreign debt service on February 20, 1987.|$|E

These measures were expected not only to swiftly reduce inflation but also to lower inflationary expectations.|$|E
30|$|At its origin, bibliometry was {{concentrated}} on the studies of the more quantitative aspects of the scientific production and its diffusion (Tague-Sutcliffe 1992). With the availability of online services, there were many developments in <b>indexations</b> that made the search for scientific Information easier to do. Little by little, bibliometry encompassed concepts and techniques like scientometry and infometrics, causing an overlapping of areas, as identified by Hood and Wilson (2001). Scientometry allowed bibliometry to work with models related to production and divulgation of the technologic and scientific knowledge (De Bellis 2009). On its turn, infometrics led bibliometry to evaluate the quantitative aspects of information in a social group, not necessarily formed by scientists (De Bellis 2009). Currently, bibliometric studies comprise a quantitative analysis of the scientific production and its evolution, {{they also have a}} more flexible and comprising perspective (Gorraiz and Gumpenberger 2015). Recent studies supply elements to analyze the performance of scientists and publications (Abramo and D’Angelo 2015; Blagus et al. 2015; Ellegaard and Wallin 2015), to prospect the emerging themes of research (Dong and Chen 2015), to analyze the invisible colleges and collaboration nets (Dong and Chen 2015; Holden et al. 2012; Vogel 2012), to identify the more prominent researchers and the strategies to promote research (Heidler and Hallonsten 2015).|$|R
40|$|I {{read with}} {{interest}} Issue No. 89 of the Oxford Energy Forum about ‘Natural Gas Demand and Supply’ published in August. The articles are topical and contain very useful information about inter alia European markets, price <b>indexations,</b> producers’ market power and the global impact of shale gas. However, I believe, {{that none of the}} authors addresses the importance of underground gas storage for European gas supplies sufficiently. Gas storage is the key to balancing this continuous gas import and seasonal/ fluctuating demand of the markets and – more and more importantly – to realising the daily/weekly price spreads within the regional market and beyond. Europe is facing a rising need for storage capacities as the gas demand will be growing and supplies come from increasingly remote locations. In addition, there are technical as well as economic and political risks in the transit countries, which are a concern for Western and Central Europe in winter times on a regular basis, underlining the essence of security of supply for the European economy. Energy storage (gas, air, hydrogen) can also manage excess electricity supplies and thus help accommodate to renewable energies, which act as a game changer because they are extremely fluctuating and their share is growing. </p...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{economic}} crisis has profoundly changed the industry of asset manage-ment by putting risk {{management at the}} heart of most investment processes. This new risk-based investment style does not rely on return forecasts and is therefore assumed to be more robust. 2011 was marked by several great successes in transforming the practice of asset management with several large institutional investors moving their portfolios to minimum variance, ERC or risk parity strategies. These portfolio con-structions are special cases of a more general class of allocation models, known as the risk budgeting approach. In a risk budgeting portfolio, the risk contribution from each component is equal to the budget of risk defined by the portfolio manager. Unfor-tunately, even if risk budgeting techniques are widely used by market practitioners, there are few results about the behavior of such portfolios in the academic literature. In this paper, we derive the theoretical properties of the risk budgeting portfolio and show that its volatility is located between those of the minimum variance and weight budgeting portfolios. We also discuss the existence, uniqueness and optimality of such a portfolio. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we propose several applications of risk budgeting techniques for risk-based allocation, like risk parity funds and strategic asset allocation, and equity and bond alternative <b>indexations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Management of IT {{services}} {{in general and}} Web Services (WS) in particular currently relies on syntactic descriptions of service interfaces using languages such as WSDL (Web Service Description Language), BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) or XPDL (XML Process Definition Language). As a consequence, complex management tasks such as WS discovery, interoperability or adaptability can not be performed {{with the level of}} precision expected by users. As a solution, ontologies have been used in several approaches to provide a semantic description of WS. However, most of these approaches do not distinguish syntactic descriptions of WS, useful for their storage and execution, from their semantic description, useful for their discovery and composition. Moreover, these approaches do not provide a hierarchical classification of WS according to the semantic functions they perform. To solve these problems, we propose a semantic description of WS based on the definition of ontologies of services and semantic <b>indexations.</b> This approach consists in enriching WS with an abstraction level that will leverage the management capabilities of WS without overloading their descriptions {{on the one hand and}} provide a hierarchical relationship between the semantic descriptions of the services on the other hand. Our proposition relies on an ontology based database for the representation and persistence of WS and their semantic characterizations represented by the created ontologies of services.

25|$|Although the 1970s in Italy {{was marked}} by violence, {{it was also a}} time of great social and {{economic}} progress. Following the civil disturbances of the 1960s, Christian Democracy and its allies in government (including the PSI) introduced a wide range of political, social, and economic reforms. Regional governments were introduced in the spring of 1970, with elected councils provided with the authority to legislate in areas like public works, town planning, social welfare, and health. Spending on the relatively poor South was significantly increased, while new laws relating to index-linked pay, public housing, and pension provision were also passed. In 1975, a law was passed entitling redundant workers to receive at least 80% of their previous salary for up to a year from a state insurance fund. Living standards also continued to rise, with wages going up by an average of about 25% a year from the early 1970s onwards, and between 1969 and 1978, average real wages rose by 72%. Various fringe benefits were raised {{to the extent that they}} amounted to an additional 50% to 60% on wages, the highest in any country in the Western world. In addition, working hours were reduced so that by the end of the decade they were lower than any other country apart from Belgium. Some categories of workers who were laid off received generous unemployment compensation which represented only a little less than full wages, often years beyond eligibility. Initially, these benefits were primarily enjoyed by industrial workers in northern Italy where the “Hot Autumn” had its greatest impact, but these benefits soon spread to other categories of workers in other areas. In 1975, the escalator clause was strengthened in wage contracts, providing a high proportion of workers with nearly 100% <b>indexation,</b> with quarterly revisions, thereby increasing wages nearly as fast as prices.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the criticisms {{levelled}} against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting {{a wide range of}} social reforms during its time in office. Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, Neville Wran, John Dawkins, Bill Hayden and Paul Keating made a number of speeches throughout the 1980s arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist government, drawing attention to Hawke's achievements as Prime Minister during his first five years in office. As well as the reintroduction of Medibank, under the new name Medicare, these included the doubling of the number of childcare places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised homecare services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension, {{the development of a new}} youth support program, the reintroduction of six-monthly <b>indexation</b> of single-person unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions. As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government. In 1989, the Hawke Labor Government gradually re-introducing fees for university study. It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS), which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University, Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins (see Dawkins Revolution). Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a threshold level. As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means. The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today, though with a number of changes.|$|E
