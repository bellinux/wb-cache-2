Consideration is also given to {{some of the}} various environments such as artic, desert, offshore, etc. Several reference tables and charts are included such as NEMA and ISO NR standards, addition of sound pressure levels, and comparison of sound pressure levels to common environmental sounds. There is also other reference information such as a list of fundamental definition frequently encountered. Consideration is given to the fact that most people are not ?acousticians? and for this reason theoretical concepts are not discussed. The basic intent of the paper is to familiarize the reader with gas turbine air filtration and sound control systems...|$|R

40|$|Global {{demand for}} inexpensive, {{reliable}} power is increasing every year. In Asia, generators powered by stationary <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> {{are becoming increasingly}} popular in areas where methane <b>gas</b> is available. <b>Engine</b> populations are expected to grow as gas distribution infrastructure is built. Although <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> may resemble other engine types in their appearance and lubricant specifications, they generally benefit {{from the use of}} lubricants developed specifically for them. This is because <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> stress crankcase oils in areas that may not be adequately addressed by oils developed for other applications. <b>For</b> instance, <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> can expose the oil to severe nitration and oxidation conditions, and can be very sensitive to ash content and composition. Oils not designed properly for this application can shorten head rebuild cycles, accelerate sludge build-up, and shorten oil and filter life. In this paper, we provide background on <b>gas</b> <b>engine</b> types and their applications, discuss the formulation requirements <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engine</b> oils (GEOs), and provide examples of their performance...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20 th century, <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> {{fueled by}} natural gas, known as “clean energy, ” have {{attracted}} attention as outstanding power generation systems in addressing global environmental issues. They are increasingly in demand because they emit less carbon dioxide (CO 2), which causes global warming, sulfur oxides (SOx), which are responsible for acid rain, and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which lead to environmental problems. With this background, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) has developed a commercial highly efficient 1 MW class (280 – 1000 kW) <b>gas</b> <b>engine,</b> which is friendly to the global environment. 1. Efficiency improvement of <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> 1. 1 Features of <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> The main fuels <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> are natural <b>gas</b> and city gas (13 A). They generate less carbon dioxide (CO 2), which causes global warming, because the main component methane (CH 4) contains four times more hydrogen atoms (H) than carbon atoms (C), which is over twice the ratio of petroleum fuels. Hydrogen becomes water when combusted. They also do not emit sulfur oxides (SOx), which cause acid rain, because the fuel does not contain sulfur atoms...|$|R
