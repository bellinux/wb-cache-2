5000|$|There was {{discussion}} in whether the trailer featured actually in-game footage. [...] Several {{scenes from the}} trailer included a <b>full</b> <b>HUD,</b> suggesting that the footage was of real-time gameplay. Patrick Klepek from 1UP.com referred to the footage as having [...] "almost too much polish" [...] compared to other games that were shown. Alex Navarro from GameSpot also questioned the footage-"Certain sequences included a <b>full</b> <b>HUD,</b> but even then, is it {{too good to be}} true?". Mike Jackson from CVG UK considered the footage to be [...] "blatantly pretend in-game CGI".|$|E
40|$|Previous {{study has}} shown that the anti-Hu {{antibody}} titre of serum samples from patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis/paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy (PEM/PSN) was significantly higher than that from patients with small cell lung cancer without neurological disturbances (non-PEM/PSN). The aims of this study were (1) to identify the fine epitopes on HuD recognised by the anti-Hu antibody, (2) to determine if the pattern of epitopic reactivity differed between antibodies from patients with and without PEM/PSN, and (3) to determine if the pattern of epitopic reactivity correlated with the clinical features. Recombinant <b>full</b> length <b>HuD</b> and nine deletion fragments were constructed and immunoreacted by western blot analysis with 14 anti-Hu serum samples from eight patients with PEM/PSN and six without PEM/PSN. All anti-Hu serum samples reacted with the deletion fragments containing amino acids (aa) 90 - 101 or aa 171 - 206. Some anti-Hu samples reacted with the deletion fragments containing aa 223 - 234, aa 235 - 252, or aa 354 - 373. There was no difference in the pattern of epitopic reactivity between patients with and without PEM/PSN. There was no correlation between the pattern of epitopic reactivity and the clinical features. The anti-Hu antibody titre from patients with PEM/PSN was significantly higher than from patients without PEM/PSN, but there was overlap of their titre concentrations. In conclusion, aa 90 - 101 and aa 171 - 206 are the major epitopes with which all anti-Hu serum samples react, and aa 223 - 234, aa 235 - 252, and aa 354 - 373 are the minor epitopes with which only some anti-Hu serum samples react. The analyses suggested that the pattern of epitopic reactivity of the anti-Hu antibody on HuD was not a critical factor for the development or clinical features of PEM/PSN. ...|$|R
