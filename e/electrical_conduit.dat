The tower framework features original components, including: 140mm x 100mm timber stud work; circular girts made from beech; a combination of diagonal timber bracing and steel spiral strapping; timber floor joists on each level supported on a circular steel angle; and floors lined with wide tongue and groove boards. A small number of timber components were replaced after the 1999 move when the tower was damaged, and some steel bracket work was installed. The steel, angled bottom plate and tie-down brackets bolting the structure to the slab also date from , with some original brackets remaining as examples.

2500|$|Pioneer11 {{encountered}} the Jupiter system nearly {{one year later}} on December 2, 1974, approaching to within [...] of Io. Pioneer11 provided the first spacecraft image of Io, a [...] per pixel frame (D7) over Io's north polar region taken {{from a distance of}} [...] This low-resolution image revealed dark patches on Io's surface akin to those hinted at in maps by Audouin Dollfus. Observations by both Pioneers revealed that Jupiter and Io were connected by an <b>electrical</b> <b>conduit</b> known as the Io flux tube, which consists of magnetic field lines trending from the Jupiter's poles to the satellite. Pioneer11s closer encounter with Jupiter allowed the spacecraft to discover Jupiter's intense radiation belts similar to Earth's Van Allen Belts. One of the peaks in charged particle flux was found near the orbit of Io. Radio tracking during the encounters of both Pioneers with Io provided an improved estimate of the moon's mass. This was accomplished by analyzing slight changes in trajectory of the two probes due to the influence of Io's gravity and calculating the mass necessary to produce the deviations. When this estimate was combined with the best available information on Io's size, Io was found to have the highest density of the four Galilean satellites and that the densities of the four Galilean satellites trended downward with increasing distance from Jupiter. The high density of Io (3.5g/cm3) indicated that it was composed primarily of silicate rock rather than water ice.|$|E

50|$|Fish {{tapes are}} usually stored coiled on a plastic reel. Because of this, {{they have a}} natural {{curvature}} {{and it is this}} curvature that allows them to be guided. By manipulating the reel, the end of the tape can be directed slightly. The tape is rigid enough that it can then be pushed in the direction in which it is pointing. In this way it can be easily guided through an empty wall cavity. Thermal insulation, firestops, pipes, HVAC ducts, <b>electrical</b> <b>conduits,</b> and other obstructions make use of a fish tape more challenging.|$|R
40|$|The heat {{requirement}} {{of a building}} can {{turn out to be}} greater than was calculated at the design stage. The reason for this may be that heat transport though the building envelope is greater than expected. This in turn can be due to the structure not fulfilling the design requirements in respect of windtightness and airtightness. In addition, there may be defects in the quality of the workmanship of the insulation that significantly reduce the thermal resistance of the external wall. The objective of this investigation has been to ascertain how normal variations in the insulation can affect heat transport through a well insulated wooden frame external wall under the influences of incident wind or wind flow through the wall. These 'normal variations' have been taken to be the presence of <b>electrical</b> <b>conduits,</b> breaks in the insulation, airgaps and nogging pieces, either singly or in combination. For incident wind, measurements in a hotbox and theoretical simulations have shown that the presence of <b>electrical</b> <b>conduits,</b> breaks in the insulation, airgaps or nogging pieces in a well insulated wooden frame external wall, whether singly or in combination, have negligible effect on thermal transport when subjected to incident wind. Heat transport is affected, however, by the presence of a break in the insulation: the combination of <b>electrical</b> <b>conduits,</b> airgaps, a nogging piece and a 16 mm gap in the insulation increased the U value of the wall by 0. 028 W/(m²·K) at the most. Measuring the effects of a flow of air through the insulation involved simulating a break in the air seal. A pressure difference of between 10 Pa and 20 Pa was established, causing air to flow from the cold side to the warm side. Measurements and calculations have shown that normal variations in the insulation have a negligible effect on the transmission losses on the cold side, due to the heat exchange effect of the insulation, which raises the temperature of the air flowing through it. This has meant that as the air flow increases, the transmission losses on the cold side have decreased while those on the warm side have increased. Air flow through a wall {{does not necessarily mean that}} the heat demand of the building will increase...|$|R
