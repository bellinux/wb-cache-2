5000|$|In Louisiana, Civil Code article 1493 {{dictates}} that [...] "Forced heirs are {{descendants of the}} first degree who, {{at the time of}} the death of the decedent, are twenty-three years of age or younger or descendants of the first degree of any age who, because of mental incapacity or physical infirmity, are permanently incapable of taking care of their persons or administering their estates {{at the time of the}} death of the decedent". If they are not disinherited (LCC art. 1494) they qualify as forced heirs. The disinherison must be made expressly and for one of eight just causes; otherwise, it is null (LCC art. 1621). The legitime is equal to 25% of the patrimony (if one forced heir); or 50% (if more than one); and each <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> will receive the lesser of an equal proportion of the legitime or what they would have received through intestacy (LCC art. 1495, Succession of Greenlaw). If a person who would have otherwise qualified as a <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> dies before the parent, rights to that share may pass to that person's children, although how that share is distributed among them if one or more is an interdict remains unsettled law. Forced heirs may demand collation, whereby certain gifts received by any successor in the three years before the death of the parent may be subtracted from their share. Louisiana does not have a forced heirship provision for spouses, however at death the spouse's interest in any community property is converted to his or her separate property; and a usufruct is granted over the remaining community (with the forced heirs as naked owners of their respective shares). That usufruct terminates at death or remarriage.|$|E
5000|$|Intestacy has {{a limited}} {{application}} in those jurisdictions that follow civil law or Roman law because {{the concept of}} a will is itself less important; the doctrine of forced heirship automatically gives a deceased person's next-of-kin title to a large part (forced estate) of the estate's property by operation of law, beyond the power of the deceased person to defeat or exceed by testamentary gift. A forced share (or legitime) can often only be decreased on account of some very specific misconduct by the <b>forced</b> <b>heir.</b> In matters of cross-border inheritance, the [...] "laws of succession" [...] is the commonplace term covering testate and intestate estates in common law jurisdictions together with forced heirship rules typically applying in civil law and Sharia law jurisdictions.After the Statute of Wills 1540, Englishmen (and unmarried or widowed women) could dispose of their lands and real property by a will. Their personal property could formerly be disposed of by a testament, hence the hallowed legal merism last will and testament.|$|E
40|$|Protection of <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> and {{disinheritance}} The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to describe the current legislation concerning protection of <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> and disinheritance and to highlight the recent and most important changes. The protection of <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> shows intergenerational solidarity in law of succession opposed to another basic principle of law of succession - decedents autonomy of will. The institute of <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> grants right to inherit a forced share to descendent's children in case the descendent forgets to include them in his disposition mortis causa. Disinheritance is the only legal option to break the protection of <b>forced</b> <b>heir.</b> The descendent might, only {{in compliance with the}} conditions set by the civil code, deprive the <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> of his right to inherit the forced share completely or partially. The thesis is composed of five chapters. Chapter One introduces the basic terms, such as protection of <b>forced</b> <b>heir,</b> disinheritance and the institute of incapacity to inherit as {{one of the reasons for}} disinheritance. Chapter Two is subdivided into five parts and provides the historical background and development of the institutes of <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> and disinheritance. Each part concentrates on different period, starting at legislation in ancient Rome and Common Civil Code through Czech Civil Code [...] ...|$|E
50|$|In Louisiana, {{the common}} law concept of estates in land never existed.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we examine the}} {{necessary}} succession rules whose main feature is the particularly high protection of the forced heirs’ rights. In other legal systems also exist some forms of protection of the reserved portion, but not as intense as in our legal system. One of the clearest example {{of the level of}} protection of <b>forced</b> <b>heirs</b> rights is given by the fact that if the testamentary dispositions or donations exceed the portion which the testator can legally dispose of (the reserved portion), then the <b>forced</b> <b>heirs</b> have at their disposal a specific legal action “azione di riduzione” that permits them to restore the reserved portion. The intangibility of the reserved portion and the in rem quality of the legal action aimed at restoring the reserved portion, produces important consequences on the market transaction, since it’s capable of hindering the validity of payment contracts concluded even many years before. All these aspects have lead many scholars to question this kind of legal rules pledging for a reform of them. Another question that we have analysed is the so called “family pact”, which is a contract through which an entrepreneur transfer a productive good to a family member. These kinds of transactions are excluded from the applicability of the necessary succession discipline in order to guarantee the intergeneration transfers of the enterprise. The law has actually set up a double channel in the necessary succession area: from one side, in the case of productive goods, all the potential <b>forced</b> <b>heirs</b> can sign an agreement which upsets the general rule that all <b>forced</b> <b>heirs</b> have to receive goods belonging to the testator’s asset, and they can receive instead a sum on money corresponding to the value of the goods of the asset, they should have received. When a family pact is signed both the sum of money and the goods are in principle excluded from the legal action aimed at restoring the reserved portion. As a way of conclusion we could say that frequently the different solutions adopted in commercial law have opened new paths and new interpretations, leading to law reforms, that’s why we can say that the complex system of rules of the necessary succession could be modified, taking as an example the specific solutions adopted for the “family pact”...|$|R

40|$|A topical {{issue in}} the context of the general debate about the need to retain or abolish forced share in Spain is the {{question}} of whether to broaden the range of grounds for excluding a <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> from his or her share of the estate. There is particular debate surrounding the appropriateness of adding estrangement or the lack of a family relationship to the list of grounds, with the aim of increasing testamentary, freedom. Some countries have a tendency to allow ties of affection to prevail over purely family or kinship ties in this matter, but sometimes at the cost of legal certainty, and - since such a vague ground is not necessarily more respectful with freedom of testation - despite the risk that the courts may not always achieve the justice sought by a testator who wishes to disinherit a <b>forced</b> <b>heir</b> that shows no affection for her. This paper considers the different approaches to this topic between different legal systems. The Catalan and the German ones just represent extreme examples of radical different tendencies.

The paper gives {{an overview of the}} persons that are eligible for forced heirship, conditions for being recognized as <b>forced</b> <b>heir,</b> size of the forced share, as well as influence {{of the size of the}} legal shares on the position of forced heirs. Special attention is given to the analysis of the influence of possible changes in the size of legal shares of inheritance on the size of shares belonging to forced heirs. In this context it is concluded that legal status of forced heirs in most countries which belong to this group, is up to a certain extent specific compared to the one in most other contemporary European legal systems, primarily because of its volatile character. Simultaneously, it is observed that, regardless of a common legal background and inherited similarities dating from the former joint state, there are significant differences between the analyzed legal systems concerning the legal status of forced heirs. Through this comparative review, the author strives to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the legal provisions existing in legislation of these countries. In this aspect, the author expresses the opinion whether there is a need for modification in national legislation regarding the analyzed aspects of the regulated status of forced heirs...|$|E

50|$|Forced {{heirship}} {{is a form}} of testate partible inheritance {{whereby the}} estate of a deceased (de cujus) is separated into (1) an indefeasible portion, the forced estate (Germ Pflichtteil, Fr réserve, It, legittima, Sp legítima), passing to the deceased's next-of-kin (conjunctissimi), and (2) a discretionary portion, or free estate (Germ frei verfügbare Quote, Fr quotité disponible, It quota disponible, Sp tercio de libre disposición), to be freely disposed of by will. Forced heirship is generally a feature of civil-law legal systems which do not recognize total freedom of testation. Normally, the deceased's estate is in-gathered and wound up without discharging liabilities, which means accepting inheritance includes accepting the liabilities attached to inherited property. The forced estate is divided into shares which include the share of issue (legitime or child's share) and the spousal share. This provides a minimum protection that cannot be defeated by will. The free estate, on the other hand, is at the discretion of a testator to be distributed by will on death to whomever he or she chooses. Takers in the forced estate are known as <b>forced</b> <b>heirs</b> (Germ Pflichtteilserben, Noterben, Fr réservataires, It legittimari, Sp herederos forzosos).|$|R

Two witnesses are required, unless the witness is a notary or a clerk of court (court registrar), any of whom will suffice. The formalities may be relaxed in certain cases, such as imminent death, a state of siege, a prevailing epidemic, etc. Freedom of testation is constrained by the rules of forced heirship: descendants, ascendants, and the spouse are all entitled to forced shares (aka legal right shares). <b>Forced</b> <b>heirs</b> may only be disinherited for certain specified kinds of misconduct. Will contracts are invalid; however, a pactum successorium (aka contract concerning succession) made inter vivos is valid in certain cases and will operate on the death of the deceased.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the past decade, several European legislatures have {{introduced}} devices into their legal systems that are functionally similar to trusts, including the Czech Republic, which has introduced a new set of provisions into its new Civil Code. Such developments are sometimes accompanied by fears that trusts might be misused or abused. Some of the concerns commonly raised about trusts are that trustees could misappropriate trust property to the detriment of beneficiaries, or that trusts could be used to shield assets from creditors, spouses or <b>forced</b> <b>heirs</b> of the settlor. Other fears are that trusts can be used for money-laundering purposes or to hide assets from tax authorities, and that third parties dealing with trustees may be unaware of the trust’s existence. This article discusses Italy’s experience with trusts, where they have become a popular instrument used in a variety of contexts, often to make up for shortcomings of domestic laws. Its aim is to provide a brief overview of the nature of the trusts employed in Italy, and their purposes, and to discuss whether and to what extent some of the concerns mentioned above have materialised in legal practice, and how they have been addressed. The Italian experience demonstrates that not all concerns that are generally voiced against trusts necessarily arise in practice. It further shows that where issues have arisen concerning, for instance, creditor protection, the legal system is well equipped to tackle or mediate risks of misusing and abusing trusts. Italian courts have reacted effectively even though there is no national legislation providing Italian courts with special powers.
