40|$|INTRODUCTION : The study {{compared}} {{modification of}} canal curvature and {{the incidence of}} canal aberrations after glide path preparation using four different instrumentation techniques. METHODS : One hundred and twenty S-shaped Endo- Training-Blocks were selected, the canals coloured with ink and digital images acquired. Glide paths were prepared by a single operator with stainless steel K-files by hand (Group 1), stainless steel K-files in a reciprocating hand piece (Group 2), PathFile (Group 3) and X-Plorer files (Group 4). Pre-instrumentation and post-instrumentation images were superimposed to evaluate the parameters investigated. The images were also examined by three blinded operators {{for the presence of}} aberrations. Differences in canal curvature modification were analysed with respect to logarithmic transformed change from baseline using ANCOVA (p< 0. 001) with logarithmic transformed pre-instrumentation values as covariate. The incidence of canal aberrations was analyzed using Fisher’s exact test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS : There was no difference between PathFiles and X-Plorer files (p< 0. 001) and both systems demonstrated significantly less modification of curvature compared with <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> in a reciprocating hand-piece (p< 0. 001). The Groups differed significantly regarding the number of aberrations (p= 0. 005). <b>Hand</b> <b>files</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> in the reciprocating hand piece did not differ statistically (p= 0. 254; 20 % and 6. 67 %). However, <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> in reciprocating <b>hand</b> piece also did not differ significantly from PathFiles and X-Plorer files (p= 0. 326). There were no aberrations detected in the rotary NiTi Groups. CONCLUSION : The stainless steel K-files in the reciprocating hand-piece performed better than their use by hand only. Overall, PathFiles and X-Plorer files equally demonstrated the least modification to original canal geometry. Further research utilising the different techniques in extracted teeth is warranted.

5000|$|Although {{most people}} cannot {{determine}} if steel has undergone the {{hardening and tempering}} process by simply looking at it, there is a reliable and simple test. When examining a piece of steel, obtain a <b>hand</b> <b>file</b> and file an edge of the selected metal.

50|$|Metalworking taps {{and dies}} were often made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for {{hardening}} and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own taps and dies. During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying taps and dies from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of taps and dies, starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a tap's flutes with a <b>hand</b> <b>file</b> became a thing of the past.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{case series}} report {{was to assess the}} frequency in which the Reciproc R 25 instrument (VDW, Munich, Germany) is able to scout and reach the full working length (WL) in second mesiobuccal (MB 2) canals from maxillary molars. Conventional <b>hand</b> <b>file</b> negotiation was used as the reference technique for comparison. Maxillary molars (270 first molars and 71 second molars) were included in this study. After local anesthesia, the tooth was isolated with a rubber dam, and traditional straight-line access was made. After locating both first mesiobuccal and MB 2 canals, patients were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the experimental groups (conventional hand filing preparation or R 25 Reciproc preparation). All cases in which the hand files (G 1) and R 25 instrument (G 2) were able to reach the fully electronically determined WL were classified as "reaching full WL" (RFWL). All cases in which the hand files (G 1) and R 25 instrument (G 2) were unable to negotiate the full-length canal were classified as "not reaching full WL" (NRFWL). The number of root canals classified as RFWL and NRFWL from both groups were recorded and tabulated on an Excel data sheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). The frequency distributions (%) of root canals classified as RFWL and NRFWL were compared with overall-treated canals and for each treatment approach (<b>hand</b> <b>file</b> and R 25 instrument) using a Pearson chi-square test. In group 1, the <b>hand</b> <b>file</b> approach reached the full WL in 57. 48 % of cases, whereas in group 2 the R 25 instrument reached the full WL in 85. 63 % of cases. Three file separations occurred in each group while negotiating the MB 2 canal. According to this study, the R 25 instrument was 32 % more effective when compared with hand files in scouting and negotiating MB 2 canals in maxillary first and second molars.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of post space {{preparation}} with Gates Glidden drills or <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> on the sealing ability of gutta-percha or Resilon obturation materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred and four single-rooted human teeth were instrumented and divided into four experimental groups (n= 21 each) and two groups of positive and negative control (n= 10). Forty-two roots of experimental groups were obturated with gutta-percha and Dorifill sealer; and 42 roots with Resilon/Epiphany self-etch using lateral compaction technique. Each gutta-percha or Resilon group was divided into two subgroups (n= 21) and post-space prepared with either Gates Glidden drills or <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and chloroform. After post space preparation, 5 mm of apical gutta-percha or Resilon was left intact. The whole system was sterilized with gamma-rays. Saliva leakage was tested using a split-chamber model. Specimens were monitored every 24 hours for 30 days. The data were analyzed using log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the sealing ability of gutta-percha and Resilon. Furthermore, no significant difference was found between two different methods of post space preparation (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: Calcium {{hydroxide}} is {{the most}} widely used intracanal medicament in en-dodontics, which should be removed prior to permanent root canal filling to minimize its intervention with the bonding of endodontic sealers.

40|$|The {{widening}} {{performance gap}} between the magnetic disk, the CPU, and the memory subsystem has been well documented. Current technological advances show a continuation in this trend.

Materials and Methods: A total of 44 extracted human single-rooted mandibular premolars were used. The root canal systems of all teeth were cleaned and shaped, then filled with Ca(OH) 2 paste. The teeth were divided into two groups: Ca(OH) 2 was removed using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) with hand filing and irrigation (Group 1) or the EndoActivator system (Group 2). Each tooth was split into two halves and examined under a scanning electron microscope. Results: Ca(OH) 2 particles were completely removed at the coronal level in both experimental groups. More Ca(OH) 2 particles were present in the apical third than in the middle-third in both groups. No significant interaction was observed between the two experimental groups or among the three examined levels (P > 0. 05).

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare GPX {{instruments}} and <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> for gutta-percha removal. Study design. Fifty maxillary central incisors with a single straight canal were instrumented and filled. The teeth were divided into 5 groups of 10 specimens each, according to the gutta-percha removal techniques: group 1 : GPX (21 -mm-long teeth); group 2 : GPX and xylol as solvent (21 -mm-long teeth); group 3 : GPX (25 -mm-long teeth); group 4 : GPX and xylol as solvent (25 -mm-long teeth); and group 5 : <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and xylol as solvent. The amount of time for gutta-percha removal and the number of fractured instruments were evaluated. Radiographs were taken, and the teeth were grooved longitudinally and split. The area of residual debris was measured using Sigma Scan software. Results. The time for filling material removal was significantly shorter when GPX was used (P <. 05).

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{incidence}} of apical root cracks and dentinal detachments after canal preparation with <b>hand</b> and rotary <b>files</b> at different instrumentation lengths. Methods Two hundred forty mandibular incisors were mounted in resin blocks with simulated periodontal ligaments, and the apex was exposed. The root canals were instrumented with rotary and <b>hand</b> <b>files,</b> namely K 3, ProTaper, and nickel-titanium Flex K files to the major apical foramen (AF), short AF, or beyond AF. Digital images of the apical surface of every tooth were taken during the apical enlargement at each file change. Development of dentinal defects was determined by comparing these images with the baseline image. Multinomial logistic regression test was performed to identify influencing factors. Results Apical crack developed in 1 of 80 teeth (1. 3 %) with <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and 31 of 160 teeth (19. 4 %) with rotary files. Apical dentinal detachment developed in 2 of 80 teeth (2. 5 %) with <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and 35 of 160 teeth (21. 9 %) with rotary files. Instrumentation with rotary files terminated 2 mm short of AF and did not cause any cracks. Significantly less cracks and detachments occurred when instrumentation with rotary files was terminated short of AF, as compared with that terminated at or beyond AF (P <. 05). The AF deviated from the anatomic apex in 128 of 240 teeth (53 %). Significantly more apical dentinal detachments appeared in teeth with a deviated AF (P =. 033).

Twenty maxillary central incisors were subjected to biomechanical preparation (# 80 <b>hand</b> <b>file)</b> and sectioned transversally 2 mm short of the apex and 4 mm coronally to this point. The root cylinders were embedded in acrylic resin and positioned at 45 &# 176; to the horizontal plane for preparation of root-end cavities with a diamond ultrasonic retrotip. Two groups (n= 10) were formed according to the root-end filling material: MTA and Super EBA. A gutta-percha cone (# 80) was tug-backed at the limit between the canal and the root-end cavity. The cavity was filled and the gutta-percha cone was removed after complete setting of the sealer. The specimens were placed in an Instron machine with the root-end filling turned downwards. The push-out shaft was inserted in the space previously occupied by the gutta-percha cone and run at a crosshead speed of 1. 0 mm/min for pushing out the root-end filling material.

40|$|Abstract: Treatment of non-vital {{immature}} {{teeth with}} apical periodontitis {{has always been}} a challenge in Endodontics. Regenerative endodontic treatment (RET) has been successfully used for the management of these cases. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a case of RET used for the retreatment of a previously endodontically treated permanent tooth with an open apex. A 14 -year-old boy with a poor endodontic treatment done on his maxillary right central incisor developed symptomatic apical periodontitis. Radiographically, incomplete root development with thin dentinal walls and an open apex were evident. After accessing and removing previous filling materials, the canal was copiously irrigated with 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite. A triple antibiotic paste was placed inside the canal and left for 15 days. After removal of the antibiotic mixture, bleeding was induced into the canal by passing a <b>hand</b> <b>file</b> out of the apex. A collagen membrane barrier was placed over the blood clot, followed by sealing with mineral trioxide aggregate. Access was sealed with permanent filling materials. Clinical examination at 12, 24 and 36 months revealed no symptoms. Radiographic examination showed resolution of the periapical lesion and apical closure. Sensitivity tests with cold and an electric pulp test elicited a negative response at all recall periods. On the basis of long-term results, RET may be an effective option for the retreatment of an immature permanent tooth with a failed previous treatment and periapical periodontitis...|$|E

Materials and Methods The study consisted of 120 extracted mandibular premolars. One millimeter from the apex of each tooth was ground perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth, and the apical surface was polished. Twenty teeth served as the negative control group. One hundred teeth were prepared, obturated, and then divided into 5 retreatment groups. The retreatment procedures were performed using the following files: PTR, Mtwo-R, PTN, TFA, and <b>hand</b> <b>files.</b> After filling material removal, apical enlargement was done using apical size 0. 50 mm ProTaper Universal (PTU), Mtwo, PTN, TFA, and <b>hand</b> <b>files.</b> Digital images of the apical root surfaces were recorded before preparation, after preparation, after obturation, after filling removal, and after apical enlargement using a stereomicroscope.

Materials and Methods: A total of 40 mandibular premolars with straight single canals were divided into two groups with 20 each. The root canals were shaped by <b>hand</b> <b>file</b> and Revo-S rotary files to size (25, 0. 06) at the end point, then they filled by Gutta-percha cone and meta-seal sealer. In group A, a single matched cone technique was used to fill the root canals. In group B, a hot lateral condensation using system B instrument at 101 °C was performed. Result: The result of this study showed no significant difference in density of Gutta-percha fill in apical and coronal two-third when comparing matched cone root canal filling and hot lateral technique (P > 0. 05). The only significant difference (P < 0. 05) was in matched cone between buccolingual and mesiodistal view in the coronal two-third. Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, single matched cone technique has a good density in the apical one-third as that of the hot lateral technique so it may be used for filling narrow canals.

Rotary ProTaper files caused lesser transportation and remained better centered in the canal than <b>hand</b> ProTaper <b>files.</b> Conclusion: The canal preparation in natural teeth with rotary Protaper files showed lesser transportation and better centering ration than <b>hand</b> ProTaper <b>files...</b>|$|R
40|$|From a {{fracture}} mechanics viewpoint, structural defects, cracks or canal irregularities {{are likely to}} play a major role in fracture susceptibility of the roots, because stresses can be exponentially amplified at these sites. By incorporating defects into a smooth round canal using rotary NiTi, theoretically the roots could be strengthened. The aims of the study were to determine whether rotary NiTi canal preparation strengthens roots, and whether the fracture pattern can be predicted by finite element analysis (FEA) models. 25 teeth were prepared using <b>hand</b> <b>file</b> and another 25 using rotary NiTi. After obturation, all teeth were subject to loading until fracture; load and patterns were recorded. Four FEA models were created from fractured roots. No significant difference of fracture load between the two techniques was found. Mesio-distal fracture occurred more often in the rotary NiTi group. Stress patterns in three of the four FEA models correlated well with the observed fracture patterns. The aim of the subsequent study was to determine the extent to which canal size, radius of curvature and proximal root concavity influence fracture susceptibility and pattern. A standardized cross-section of the mid-root region of a mandibular incisor was created by averaging the dimensions of ten extracted teeth, and the basic FEA model was created. By varying canal diameter, shape and proximal concavity, these factors could be examined for roles in fracture susceptibility and pattern. The factors all interact in influencing fracture susceptibility and pattern, with dentine thickness not the ii only determining factor. The removal of dentine does not always result in increased fracture susceptibility. iii Declaration This is to certify that the thesis comprises only my original work except where indicated in the preface; due acknowledgement has been made in the text to all other material used; the thesis is 12, 858 words in length, inclusive of footnotes, but exclusive of tables, maps, appendices and bibliography...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) NiTi rotary {{instruments}} have shape memory and are highly flexible and super-elastic. These {{properties of the}} metal alloy allows for ease of root canal preparation to ultimately result in a root canal preparation that has a continuous taper, while canal shape and curvature is maintained. It {{must be noted that}} the NiTi rotary instrumentation may have an effect on root canal dentine, which may manifest as dentine damage. Different NiTi rotary systems on the market vary with regards to their design features and kinematics, which may influence dentine damage. The purpose of this in-vitro study was to compare the effect of four different NiTi rotary systems, as well as stainless steel files on root canal dentine. One hundred and eighty permanent human mandibular molar mesial roots were used for the study. The total samples were randomly divided into six groups, where one group (n= 30) was left unprepared to serve as the control group. The remaining five groups were randomly assigned to a nickel-titanium rotary instrumentation system and one stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>file</b> group. Group 1 : Control group; Group 2 : Stainless steel files group; Group 3 : Wave One (Dentsply Maillefer) rotary group; Group 4 : ProTaper NEXT (Dentsply Maillefer) rotary group; Group 5 : iRaCe (FKG Dentaire) rotary group; Group 6 : BT-Race (FKG Dentaire) rotary group. The root canal preparations were carried out according to the manufacturers' recommendations, after decoronation of the tooth crowns. Sodium hypochlorite (5, 25 %) and 17 % EDTA was used as a root canal irrigant and a chelating agent during canal preparation. Each root segment was sectioned at 3 mm, 6 mm and 9 mm from the apex. The root segments were observed under a stereomicroscope at 12 x magnification and digital camera at 40 x magnification for the appearance of dentine damage. The images were observed by the author and an impartial second observer. Root segments were observed for the appearance of dentine damage (microcracks, craze lines or fractures), and samples were described as having 'dentine defect' or 'no dentine defect'. Data for the different groups were collected and results were calculated and the total incidence of dentine damage was as follows: Control group = 0 % Stainless steel hand files group = 0 % Wave One group = 56, 67 % ProTaper NEXT group = 60 % iRaCe group = 60 % BT-Race group = 56, 67 % There are {{no significant differences between the}} groups: WaveOne, ProTaper NEXT, iRACE and BT-Race. However, there is a significant difference between the four groups and the stainless steel group (p< 0. 0001) ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Modern nickel-titanium {{instruments}} have various tapers {{and have}} been marketed to have superior flexibility from previous generations. Current ISO standards require force measurements at a static point along the file. Unfortunately, root canal anatomy varies and produces multiple forces {{along the length of}} the file. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of taper on the flexibility of various nickel-titanium files. Materials and Methods: The flexibility of stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> and nickel-titanium rotary files of various tapers was measured. The sample size was 10 for each type, taper and size. The files were measured at 3, 5 and 7 mm from the tip using a digital caliper and marked with a rubber stopper and a distance of 20 mm from the tip was used as the deflection point. Each file was securely fastened on a load-sensing cell and bending was accomplished using a universal testing machine to a maximum deflection of 4. 5 mm at a rate of 2 mm/minute under room temperature conditions (22 OC ± 1 OC). Data was collected electronically via Merlin Software and transferred to Microsoft Excel. Statistical analysis was completed with IBM SPSS Statistics software and a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used as well as a Post-hoc Tukey test. Results: The force and bending moments of EndoSequence. 06 taper files was significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) than EndoSequence. 04 and stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> at all lengths. No significant difference was noted between EndoSequence. 04 and stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> from 0. 25 mm to 3. 0 mm. From 3. 5 mm to 4. 5 mm, the force and bending moments for stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> was significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) than EndoSequence. 04 files. Within each file group, the force and bending moments were significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) as the grasp length increased (7 mm 3 ̆e 5 mm 3 ̆e 3 mm). Conclusions: With a vast array of root canal instruments currently available clinicians should consider the properties of instruments before cleaning and shaping. Nickel-titanium files with tapers greater than 0. 04 should not be used for apical enlargement of curved canals because these files are significantly stiffer resulting in an increased chance of canal transportation...|$|R

Efficacy of two Ni-Ti {{systems and}} <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> for {{removing}} gutta-percha from root canals. International Endodontic Journal, 45, 1 – 6, 2012. Aim To compare {{the effectiveness of}} two Ni-Ti systems and <b>hand</b> <b>files</b> for removing gutta-percha and sealer from root canals. Methodology The root canals of 60 single-rooted human teeth were prepared, filled with gutta-percha and sealer (Pulp Canal Sealer; SybronEndo, Orange, CA, USA). Specimens were then divided into three groups (n = 20), and root filling material was removed using MTwo Retreatment Files (group 1); R-Endo (group 2); K-files and Gates-Glidden drills (group 3). After retreatment, the efficacy of each technique was assessed using radiographs that were later digitized and the images analysed using AutoCAD 2004. The percentage of residual gutta-percha was calculated for the whole canal {{as well as for}} the coronal, middle and apical thirds. Time required, apically extruded debris and the number of fractured instruments were also recorded. Data were statistically analysed using Kruskal– Wallis and Mann–Whitney U-tests. Results All instrumentation techniques left guttapercha and sealer remnants inside the root canals. Ni-Ti systems were significantly faster (P < 0. 05) than the manual technique and significantly more effective (P < 0. 05) in removing gutta-percha particularly from the middle and apical thirds of the root canal. R-Endo instrumentation was significantly more effective (P < 0. 05) than MTwo retreatment files in removing gutta-percha from the middle and apical thirds. R-Endo instruments were associated with the least number of cases of apical extrusion. One MTwo instrument fractured. Conclusions The Ni-Ti systems were more effective and faster than <b>hand</b> <b>files,</b> although all techniques left gutta-percha and sealer remnants on the root canals...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeTraumatic injury usually {{results in}} pulp {{necrosis}} of immature permanent incisors in children aged 7 – 10 years. Calcium hydroxide apexification {{is the most}} common treatment for necrotic, immature permanent teeth. This study compared the duration for apical barrier formation in necrotic immature permanent incisors treated with calcium hydroxide apexification using ultrasonic or <b>hand</b> <b>filing.</b> MethodsThirty-two trauma-induced necrotic immature permanent incisors with or without a periapical lesion (PL) were selected from children aged 7 – 10 years. They were evenly divided into four groups. Teeth in groups 1 (with PL) and 2 (without PL) were treated with ultrasonic filing, and teeth in groups 3 (with PL) and 4 (without PL) were treated with <b>hand</b> <b>filing.</b> The canals were cleaned with 0. 2 % chlorhexidine solution during treatment and then compactly filled with calcium hydroxide. The patients were followed up once every 1 – 3 weeks to change the intracanal medication and to detect when the apical barrier formed. ResultsThe mean duration for apical barrier formation was 11. 1 ± 1. 1 weeks, 11. 8 ± 1. 0 weeks, 13. 3 ± 0. 9 weeks and 13. 4 ± 0. 7 weeks for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Student's t test showed significant differences in the mean duration for apical barrier formation between groups 1 + 2 and 3 + 4 (p = 0. 000), groups 1 and 3 (p = 0. 000), and groups 2 and 4 (p = 0. 002). These results indicated that teeth treated with ultrasonic filing required a shorter mean duration for apical barrier formation than teeth treated with <b>hand</b> <b>filing</b> regardless of the presence of PL or not. ConclusionUltrasonic filing with 0. 2 % chlorhexidine as an irrigant is effective for disinfection of the root canal and can shorten the duration for apical barrier formation in necrotic permanent incisors treated with calcium hydroxide apexification...|$|R
