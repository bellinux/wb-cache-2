5|$|After signing to <b>Doghouse,</b> {{the band}} drove to Chicago {{to record their}} debut {{full-length}} album with producer Bob Weston of Shellac. The album was recorded in only two days, with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got {{out of school and}} finishing {{in the early hours of}} Sunday morning. Two months after recording the album, the band embarked on their first national tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan's high school graduation.|$|E
5|$|Evergreen is {{the seventh}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. It is their first album since {{reforming}} after they disbanded in 1993. Vocalist Ian McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant had previously worked together as Electrafixion {{before they were}} rejoined by bassist Les Pattinson under the name Echo & the Bunnymen in early 1997. The album was recorded at <b>Doghouse</b> Studios in Henley-on-Thames and was produced by McCulloch and the band's manager Paul Toogood but was credited to the whole band.|$|E
5|$|Bolander (Ned Beatty) and Munch (Richard Belzer) {{investigate}} a double shooting {{in which a}} drug dealer was killed and another man was badly injured. During the investigation they find a high-class prostitute hiding in a nearby <b>doghouse.</b> After making unsuccessful advances on Bolander, she admits the drug dealer was killed by his own bodyguard, Newton Stuart (Richard Pelzman). After arresting him, Stuart says the other shooting victim used the drug dealer as a human shield. In a misguided attempt to follow his employer's orders to kill anyone who threatens him, Stuart said he shot through the drug dealer to ensure the man threatening him would also be shot.|$|E
50|$|Humans often build {{houses for}} {{domestic}} or wild animals, often resembling smaller versions of human domiciles. Familiar animal houses built by humans include birdhouses, henhouses and <b>doghouses,</b> while housed agricultural animals more often live in barns and stables.|$|R
25|$|PETA runs several {{programs}} {{though its}} Community Animal Project for {{cats and dogs}} in poorer areas of Virginia, near its headquarters. In 2014 the group sterilized 10,950 cats and dogs, including 851 pit bulls and 584 feral cats, at a discounted rate or free of charge. PETA also shelters neglected dogs and cats who are ill and injured, pursues cruelty cases, and sets up <b>doghouses</b> with straw bedding for dogs chained outside all winter. It supplied 340 <b>doghouses,</b> 1,000 bales of straw, and 2,500 dog toys in 2013. The group urges population control through neutering and adoption from shelters and campaigns against {{organizations such as the}} American Kennel Club that promote the selection of purebred breeds.|$|R
50|$|Injection molding {{has been}} one of the most popular ways for {{fabricating}} plastic parts for a very long time. They are used in automotive interior parts, electronic housings, housewares, medical equipment, compact discs, and even <b>doghouses.</b> Below are certain rule based standard guidelines which can be referred to while designing parts for injection molding considering manufacturability in mind.|$|R
5|$|When Echo & the Bunnymen {{entered the}} studio to record What Are You Going to Do with Your Life?, bassist Les Pattinson {{received}} news {{that his mother was}} unwell. That, coupled with Pattinson's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way, led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band. McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined to continue as Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at <b>Doghouse</b> Studios in Henley-on-Thames, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Olympic Studios, Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, James Dewees {{recorded}} his first solo album under the pseudonym Reggie and the Full Effect. While Dewees wrote the songs himself, he asked Matt Pryor and Rob Pope to help record {{some of the}} instrumentals. The resulting album, Greatest Hits 1984-1987 leaned heavily {{on the use of}} synthesizer keyboards for its sound. Their work together on the Reggie and the Full Effect album led Pryor to invite Dewees to collaborate with The Get Up Kids on Red Letter Day, a five-track EP produced by Ed Rose to fulfill their two-record deal with <b>Doghouse.</b> The cleaner, more focused sound of the EP provided the chance to experiment with the inclusion of keyboards and acts as a sonic bridge between the raw sound of Four Minute Mile and the more dynamic, produced style of their next studio album.|$|E
5|$|The Get Up Kids toured relentlessly {{for almost}} three years in {{promotion}} of the record. As well as touring Europe, Japan, and Australia, they shared bills with acts such as Green Day, The Anniversary, Koufax, Hot Rod Circuit, Jebediah, Weezer and Ozma. Their 2000 tour with The Anniversary and Koufax was sponsored by Napster. Their fanbase kept expanding through word of mouth. Venues booked months in advance could no longer hold the demand {{by the time the}} band arrived in town and fans were forced to stand outside to see them perform. To capitalize on anticipation for the band's next album, Vagrant Records released a rarities compilation Eudora in 2001. Eudora consisted of alternate takes, covers, and B-sides since the band's formation. Likewise, <b>Doghouse</b> released a re-mastered edition of Four Minute Mile and a compilation entitled The EPs: Woodson and Red Letter Day, combining the two Doghouse-owned EPs on one compact disc.|$|E
5000|$|Furniture {{designed}} for use by animals became a popular trend in the early 21st century. [...] Typical pieces include pet beds, <b>doghouses,</b> hammocks, dog coolers, cat trees and extravagant play equipment. [...] In 2008, James Stephenson and Jason R. Rich cited high-end furniture for cats and dogs {{as one of the}} best categories of products to buy and sell for big profits. [...] Home-crafted furniture for pets has also become popular.|$|R
50|$|Kraten is a {{mixed media}} artist, using found objects such as {{refrigerator}} doors and discarded windows to dismantled <b>doghouses</b> and old street signs as well as using nontraditional paint media such as correction fluid. He prefers to use his hands to work directly with the paint, giving a textured quality to the work; it is intriguing to note that brushes are never used in any of his pieces. Aaron is a self-taught artist.|$|R
5000|$|Cookie soon readies {{herself for}} a date with Buddy, whom she calls when she has {{adequately}} prepared. Buddy happily tries to start his vehicle {{so that he might}} pick up Cookie, but the car begins moving in reverse. The car proceeds to smash through <b>doghouses,</b> clothes lines, and a greenhouse, and, because of the latter, arrives at Cookie's house with a decorative arrangement of flowers. Cookie is well pleased with the flowers.|$|R
5|$|Bushnell {{felt the}} best way to compete against imitators was to create better products, leading Atari to produce sequels in the years followings the original's release: Pong Doubles, Super Pong, Ultra Pong, Quadrapong, and Pin-Pong. The sequels feature similar graphics, but include new {{gameplay}} elements; for example, Pong Doubles allows four players to compete in pairs, while Quadrapong—also released by Kee Games as Elimination—has them compete against each other in a four way field. Bushnell also conceptualized a free-to-play version of Pong to entertain children in a Doctor's office. He initially titled it Snoopy Pong and fashioned the cabinet after Snoopy's <b>doghouse</b> with the character on top, but retitled it to Puppy Pong and altered Snoopy to a generic dog to avoid legal action. Bushnell later used the game in his chain of Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. In 1976, Atari released Breakout, a single-player variation of Pong where the object of the game is to remove bricks from a wall by hitting them with a ball. Like Pong, Breakout was followed by numerous clones that copied the gameplay, such as Arkanoid, Alleyway, and Break 'Em All.|$|E
5|$|Roberts' detectives witness Frank Lucas' {{cousin and}} driver shoot {{a woman and}} then use {{the threat of a}} long {{sentence}} to get him to wear a wire. The gathered information allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen. With this evidence they obtain a warrant to follow the drugs into Newark's projects and Lucas' heroin processing facility. In the ensuing shootout, Steve Lucas, Frank Lucas' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas' crime family, is killed. Meanwhile, Trupo, whose prized Shelby Mustang Lucas had destroyed, and his men break into Lucas' mansion to steal his emergency cash supply hidden under the <b>doghouse,</b> killing the dog. As Lucas gets ready to go after Trupo, his mother dissuades him from killing a cop, warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does. Lucas is arrested after Roberts' team conducts a raid on the shops run by his brothers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} tatpuruṣas; in a tatpuruṣa the first {{component}} is {{in a case}} relationship with another. For example, a <b>doghouse</b> is a dative compound, a house for a dog; other examples include instrumental relationships ("thunderstruck") and locative relationships ("towndwelling").|$|E
50|$|Horace, a ginger piebald (white {{with brown}} markings) stray, was {{wandering}} the site's boundary {{when he caught}} Brisbin’s attention. Brisbin, who had seen many rural dogs chained {{to the back of}} porches and <b>doghouses,</b> assumed this was just a normal stray. Many of these dogs roamed the woods and would turn up in humane traps, and Brisbin began to wonder how many more of these were in the wild. On a hunch, he went to the pound and was surprised by the resemblance the dog had to dingos.|$|R
5000|$|The series {{focuses on}} a boy named Ryder who leads a pack of rescue dogs known as the PAW Patrol. They work {{together}} on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has {{a specific set of}} skills based on a real-life profession. For example, Marshall has the abilities of a firefighter and Chase's responsibilities {{are similar to those of}} a police officer. They all reside in <b>doghouses</b> that can transform into customized vehicles when necessary. They are also equipped with backpacks called [...] "pup packs" [...] that contain tools.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} the band signed onto Vagrant Records, the label was still {{primarily}} a much smaller independent label. Before the album went into production, the label's co-owner John Cohen had to borrow money from his parents, who mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. At least one of the songs were inspired by the band's tumultuous split with <b>Doghouse</b> Records.|$|E
25|$|Meg & Dia (also {{then known}} as The Meg & Dia Band) {{released}} its first album, Our Home is Gone, in 2005. At the time, the band consisted of just the two Frampton sisters, and the album's tracks were mostly acoustic songs. Meg played guitar and provided back-up vocals while Dia sang. A year later, they released their second album, Something Real, their first album released under <b>Doghouse</b> Records.|$|E
50|$|As new subdivisions {{started to}} spring up around cities {{beginning}} in the 1950s and after, Kenner Toys reflected the trend in their Build-A-Home Building sets. The Build-A-Home sets enabled children to construct modern suburban homes, with simulated brickwork or white clapboard siding. New diagonal beams called joists were introduced to permit a low angle pitched roof to be built, and covered with vacuformed plastic roof plates. Styles varied between brick or white vinyl siding. Patios, swimming pools, TV antennas, steeples, chimneys, barbecues, and <b>doghouses</b> were all added as accessories to decorate the home. Molded green polystyrene foam trees along with vacuformed shrubs and vines also provided some crude landscaping.|$|R
50|$|Earlier models did {{not have}} {{interiors}}. Later models added plastic windows without interiors while even later ones were as detailed and as exact as Politoys or Mebetoys which were Mercury's main competition, {{at least in the}} Italian market (Ralston 2009, 65). Often, all doors, hoods, and trunks would open and other moving features ensured the cars would not last long in the hands of younger children. In fact, during 1964 Mercury introduced a Fiat 2300S and a Maserati 2500GT where all features opened. This {{appears to have been a}} first in the industry (Ralston 2009, 62-63). Models like the Alfa Romeo Giulia Canguro Bertone had entire <b>doghouses</b> and engine compartments that opened in the appropriate directions.|$|R
50|$|People built <b>doghouses</b> for him {{and some}} tried to adopt him into their homes, but no such attempt succeeded: the dog always came back, looking for his master, nor would he stay in the shelters; all he would take from the people was food. In the snow and rain, in any weather and time of year, he was always in his spot. In any weather he always waited and always ran up to all passing vehicles. Everyone who {{traveled}} that road from the old city to the new always saw Kostya running along the roadside or resting quietly on the grass. The citizens became very fond of Kostya and turned his story into a living legend. Stories about the dog were published throughout Russia.|$|R
25|$|Earle {{presented}} {{excerpts of}} his poetry and fiction {{writing at the}} 2000 New Yorker Festival. His {{collection of short stories}} called <b>Doghouse</b> Roses was published in June 2011 and his novel, I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive was published in the spring of 2011. Earle wrote and produced an off-Broadway play about the death of Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman executed since the death penalty was reinstated in Texas.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors {{renamed the}} Sonoma County Airport, located {{a few miles}} {{northwest}} of Santa Rosa, California, the Charles M. Schulz Airport in his honor. The airport's logo features Snoopy as the World War I Flying Ace (goggles/scarf), taking to the skies {{on top of his}} red <b>doghouse</b> (the Sopwith Camel). A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa.|$|E
25|$|Gow entered Parliament as {{the member}} for Eastbourne {{in the general}} {{election}} of February 1974. For a home in his constituency, Gow acquired a 16th-century manor house known as The <b>Doghouse</b> in the village of Hankham. Eastbourne was then a safe Conservative seat, and Gow always had a majority share of the vote during his time as the constituency's MP. In the general election of October 1974, he secured a 10% swing from Liberal to Conservative, doubling his majority.|$|E

First, Lisa looks down and corrects the subtitles, “No no no, I said you hadn't changed a bit! We {{have a lot of}} trouble here with subtitles.”, and they change. Mother's Japanese chauffeur asks “I begga pardon - I bringa bags inna house?” that elicits a gong sound and Japanese subtitles. This is followed by Mother’s great Dane barking with the subtitles “I've seen better <b>doghouses</b> than this” with Lisa responding “We're not interested in what the dog says”, and the subtitles disappear. Later, the subtitles ask farmhand Eb if they will be needing any more subtitles for the episode.|$|R
50|$|L. Edward McGovney only {{held on to}} the {{farmland}} {{for three}} years, as fellow heirs Fred and Carrie Yunker claimed ownership in 1924. The Yunkers added a few improvements in the 1940s and 1950s, including a hog house, cattle shed, corn crib, and open-wire corn bins. Two <b>doghouses,</b> a garage/workshop, and a tool shed were added in the 1960s followed by a metal shed in the 1970s. Edwin Yunker, the son of the original Yunker owners, worked to ensure that the farm would used to educate local children about the history of Mokena. Edwin Yunker formed the Mokena Community Park District in 1958 and sold his property to the new entity in the 1990's. The farmstead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historical district on May 31, 2006.|$|R
50|$|An entire {{species of}} aliens fleeing from a doomed planet sends an agent {{ahead to the}} planet Earth to prepare {{the way for the}} arrival of their minds, the only part of {{themselves}} {{they have been able to}} preserve. Since killing another sentient species is against their moral code, their agent decides that the most common and widely beloved non-sentient species on the planet, dogs, are to serve as the new vessels for his fellow aliens' minds. This he arranges for them by designing and selling a small solar power plant—disguised as a doghouse—that produces enough energy to serve the needs of an entire household with plenty to spare. This product is wildly successful, and soon there are more than enough <b>doghouses</b> with dogs in them to accommodate his people.|$|R
25|$|The band {{continued}} to tour small venues around their hometown, and after their second billed gig at The <b>Doghouse,</b> they were signed to local independent Dundee record label Two Thumbs, and released the self-titled The View EP in early 2006. Alongside the EP, the band recorded a complete demo album at T-Pot studios in Perthshire {{and this was}} made available for download from the band's Two Thumbs management website. Videos were also made available to accompany some of the recordings.|$|E

The article also included quotes from Matt Pryor, who said that Vagrant Records will be re-releasing the album in a special 10th-anniversary edition, including a DVD and photo book. In February 2009, <b>Doghouse</b> Records re-issued the album on vinyl.|$|E
25|$|Like most Germanic languages, Dutch forms noun compounds, {{where the}} first noun modifies the {{category}} given by the second (hondenhok = <b>doghouse).</b> Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces, Dutch (like the other Germanic languages) either uses the closed form without spaces (boomhut = tree house) or inserts a hyphen (VVD-coryfee = outstanding member of the VVD, a political party). Like German, Dutch allows arbitrarily long compounds, but the longer they get, the less frequent they tend to be.|$|E
5000|$|One of Kaiser's {{most notable}} {{legislative}} accomplishments was {{a bill to}} reform the state's humane officers. [...] At one hearing, Kaiser held his own badge, handcuffs, and Pennsylvania Humane Society ticket book above his head to dramatize the lax requirements within the system {{and the need to}} keep unqualified officers like himself off farms and out of people's <b>doghouses.</b> [...] He explained that in order to become a humane officer himself, he had [...] "filed two forms with the Department of State, spent 10 minutes and $100," [...] and only needed to be sworn in by a judge in order to become a humane officer, endowed with the authority to wear a uniform, carry a gun, and write tickets costing pet owners as much as $600 in fines, all without any training, supervision, or real knowledge of animals. he said that [...] "I never even owned a dog," [...] he said. [...] "And the closest I've ever come was to pet one owned by someone else." ...|$|R
25|$|The final daily {{original}} Peanuts {{comic strip}} was published on Monday, January 3, 2000. The strip contained {{a note to}} the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his <b>doghouse</b> deep in thought. Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected {{to pick it up}} (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that were to run past January 3, he had drawn five extra Sunday strips and these had yet to run. The first of these strips appeared six days after the last daily on January 9.|$|E
25|$|Porkchop (Fred Newman): Doug's {{anthropomorphic}} pet {{dog that}} is one of Doug's sidekicks and accompanies him nearly everywhere he goes. He sometimes assists Doug in making decisions and acts as his conscience. He is also very talented in many things such as acting. He lives in an igloo-shaped <b>doghouse</b> in the Nickelodeon series, and a tipi in the Disney series. During a Christmas special it is shown that Doug got Porkchop as a Christmas gift and that Porkchop once saved Beebe Bluff's life when she was about to fall through some thin ice. Porkchop, along with Doug, originally first appeared in ID spots for the USA children's block, USA Cartoon Express.|$|E
