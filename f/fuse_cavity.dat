5000|$|... "Daisy cutter" [...] fuses, when known {{under that}} exact name, were first {{used by the}} United States during the Vietnam War. The concept for the fuse is {{attributed}} to an Air America employee who grasped the idea during a night of drinking. Shortly thereafter, his drinking buddy, a Royal Lao Air Force airman at Louang Phrabang, gathered the needed materials for the prototype and started welding used aircraft gun barrels directly into the nose <b>fuse</b> <b>cavity</b> of bombs. After the concept proved itself useful it was made famous by being used for the largest conventional bomb in the U.S. military's arsenal at the time, the BLU-82. When used gun barrels were in short supply, water pipes were requisitioned for the task. The welded pipe versions had several adverse effects, such as vibration, pipe weld separation or breakage while in flight, and wind drag, due to impossibility of aligning the pipes correctly with {{the nose of the}} weapon, so that phase of development eventually gave way to threaded steel water pipes screwed into the nose cavity of the bombs, leaving only the tail fuse for detonation. After the war more precise fuses were created for this purpose. These weapons were used in the [...] "shock and awe" [...] phase of the Iraq War.|$|E
5000|$|The {{body of the}} MRUD is {{waterproof}} and {{the mine}} {{can be used in}} temperatures from -30˚ to + 50˚ C. The mine body contains 900 grams of TNT-based explosive and 650 5.5-millimeter steel balls. When fired the fragmentation has a lethal arc of 60 degrees and a lethal range of 40-50 meters. The MRUD kit comes packed with a manual inductor, circuit test device and an EK-40-69 electric detonator. The mine can be command detonated from up to 30 meters away using a manual inductor or another electrical power source. The <b>fuse</b> <b>cavities</b> also accept any Serbian booby trap fuse with an M10 x 1 mm including the UMP-1 and UMP-2 pull and the UMNOP-1 multi-function fuse.|$|R
40|$|The semi-conductor fuses in this {{research}} are fabricated on a submicron process. A voltage potential is applied across the fuse, {{in order to achieve}} a blow. This current peaks with a short pulse in the order of tens of milliamps which has a long decrease to zero current flow, resulting in a blown fuse. A fuse blows due to the pinching together of electrically insulating material which initially surrounds the conducting pathway. The pinch cuts across the conductor, and so halts the current flow. In small-geometry <b>fuses</b> a <b>cavity</b> also forms during the blowing process. The company wishes to understand the fuse blow process mathematically in order to develop a model that can accurately simulate the blowing of the fuses. This report records the thermal, electrical, solid and fluid mechanics of the blowing process that was discussed at the Study Group, with remarks on possible future research for modelling the process...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} laser energy on {{formation}} of a plasma inside a cavity was investigated. The temperature and electron number density of laser-induced plasmas in a <b>fused</b> silica <b>cavity</b> were determined using spectroscopic methods, and compared with laser ablation on a flat surface. Plasma temperature and electron number density during laser ablation in a cavity with aspect ratio of 4 increased faster with irradiance after the laser irradiance reached a threshold of 5 GW/cm{sup 2 }. The threshold irradiance of particulate ejection was lower for laser ablation in a cavity compared with on a flat surface; the greater the cavity aspect ratio, the lower the threshold irradiance. The ionization of silicon becomes saturated and the crater depths were increased approximately by {{an order of magnitude}} after the irradiance reached the threshold. Phase explosion was discussed to explain the large change of both plasma characteristics and mass removal when irradiance increased beyond a threshold value. Self-focusing of the laser beam was discussed to be responsible for the decrease of the threshold in cavities...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{truncated}} <b>fused</b> silica elliptical <b>cavity</b> {{is proposed}} {{to enhance the}} output performance of solar-pumped solid-state lasers. The imaging property of the truncated elliptical cavity ensures an enhanced absorption distribution within an Nd:YAG rod. Optimum pumping parameters are found through ZEMAX nonsequential ray-tracing and LASCAD laser cavity analyses. Compared with the output laser performance of a 3 D-compound parabolic concentrator- 2 D-compound parabolic concentrator (3 D-CPC- 2 D-CPC) cavity, the truncated cavity provides 11 % more multimode and 72. 7 % more TEM 00 laser powers. A laser beam of high beam quality can be produced efficiently. The standard tracking error for multimode laser power is also reduced to only 4. 0 % by the truncated cavity...|$|R
40|$|Fast {{fusion of}} {{multiple}} registered out-of-focus images {{is of great}} interest in medical imaging; for example, the thoracic cavity is always too bumpy {{to be focused on}} all parts at one shot even when we can omit the unavoidable hardware vibrations. Previous proposed methods in this field cannot fulfill the real-time requirement in our multiple camera medical imaging setting. In this paper, we propose a multi-resolution Bayesian risk minimization based method to <b>fuse</b> these chest <b>cavity</b> images. The validity and efficiency of our method are verified by our experiments on both out-of-focus medical images and regional motion blurred images. By choosing special kernel functions for the Pixon map and adopting uniform distribution as the prior probability, our method {{can be applied to the}} real-time medical imaging situations such as surgical operation monitoring...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGrowth and Differentiation Factor 1 (GDF- 1) {{has been}} implicated in left–right {{patterning}} of the mouse embryo but has no other known function. Here, we demonstrate a genetic interaction between Gdf 1 and Nodal during anterior axis development. Gdf 1 −/−;Nodal+/− mutants displayed several abnormalities that were not present in either Gdf 1 −/− or Nodal+/− single mutants, including absence of notochord and prechordal plate, and malformation of the foregut; organizing centers implicated {{in the development of}} the anterior head and branchial arches, respectively. Consistent with these deficits, Gdf 1 −/−;Nodal+/− mutant embryos displayed a number of axial midline abnormalities, including holoprosencephaly, anterior head truncation, cleft lip, <b>fused</b> nasal <b>cavity,</b> and lack of jaws and tongue. The absence of these defects in single mutants indicated a synergistic interaction between Nodal and GDF- 1 in the node, from which the axial mesendoderm that gives rise to the notochord, prechordal plate, and foregut endoderm originates, and where the two factors are co-expressed. This notion was supported by a severe downregulation of FoxA 2 and goosecoid in the anterior primitive streak of double mutant embryos. Unlike that in the lateral plate mesoderm, Nodal expression in the node was independent of GDF- 1, indicating that both factors act in parallel to control the development of mesendodermal precursors. Receptor reconstitution experiments indicated that GDF- 1, like Nodal, can signal through the type I receptors ALK 4 and ALK 7. However, analysis of compound mutants indicated that ALK 4, but not ALK 7, was responsible for the effects of GDF- 1 and Nodal during anterior axis development. These results indicate that GDF- 1 and Nodal converge on ALK 4 in the anterior primitive streak to control the formation of organizing centers that are necessary for normal forebrain and branchial arch development...|$|R
40|$|Tammar wallaby {{spermatozoa}} undergo maturation during transit {{through the}} epididymis. This maturation {{differs from that}} seen in eutherian mammals because in addition to biochemical and functional maturation there are also major changes in morphology, in particular formation of the condensed acrosome and reorientation of the sperm head and tail. Of spermatozoa released from the testes, 83 % had a large immature acrosome. By the time spermatozoa reached the proximal cauda epididymis 100 % of sperm had condensed acrosomes. Similarly 86 % of testicular spermatozoa had immature thumb tack or T shape head-tail orientation while only 2 % retained this immature morphology in the corpus epididymis. This maturation {{is very similar to}} that reported for the common brush tail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula. However, morphological maturation occurred earlier in epididymal transit in the tammar wallaby. By the time spermatozoa had reached the proximal cauda epididymis no spermatozoa had an immature acrosome and thumbtack orientation. Associated with acrosomal maturation was an increase in acrosomal thiols and the formation of disulphides which presumably account for the unusual stability of the wallaby sperm acrosome. The development of motility and progressive motility of tammar wallaby spermatozoa {{is similar to that of}} other marsupials and eutherian mammals. Spermatozoa are immotile in the testes and the percentage of motile spermatozoa and the strength of their motility increases during epididymal transit. During passage through the caput and corpus epididymis, spermatozoa first became weakly motile in the proximal caput and then increasingly progressively motile through the corpus epididymis. Tammar wallaby spermatozoa collected from the proximal cauda epididymis had motility not different from ejaculated spermatozoa. Ultrastructural studies indicated that acrosomal condensation involved a complex infolding of the immature acrosome. At spermiation the acrosome of tammar wallaby spermatozoa was a relatively large flat or concave disc which projected laterally and anteriorly beyond the limits of the nucleus. During transit of the epididymal caput and proximal corpus the lateral projections folded inwards to form a cup like structure the sides of which eventually met and <b>fused.</b> The <b>cavity</b> produced by this fusion was lost as the acrosome condensed to its mature form as a small button-like structure contained within the depression on the anterior end of the nucleus. During this process the dorsal surface of the immature acrosome and its outer acrosomal membrane and overlying plasma membrane were engulfed into the acrosomal matrix. This means that the dorsal surface of the acrosomal region of the testicular tammar wallaby sperm head is a transient structure. The dorsal acrosomal surface of the mature spermatozoon appears ultrastructurally to be the relocated ventral surface of the acrosomal projections which previously extended out beyond the acrosomal depression on the dorsal surface of the nucleus of the immature spermatozoon...|$|R
