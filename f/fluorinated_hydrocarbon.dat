The lesion, involving about half of mTALs, appears first in mTALs removed from vascular bundles and near the inner medulla, areas most likely to be anoxic. Hypoxic perfusion (O 2 content 0. 12 vol/ 100 ml) exaggerates the lesion, wiping out gradations of damage and extending it to all mTALs. O 2 -enriched perfusions using rat erythrocytes (O 2 content 7. 1 vol/ 100 ml) completely eliminates the lesion (unless gassed with carbon monoxide).

Nanotubes of two different outer diameters (50 nm and 130 nm) were studied and their wetting behavior analyzed in liquids belonging to different solvent classes to infer the nature of the wetting states. We show that the wetting behavior of perfluorinated monolayer-functionalized TNAs in polar liquids is explained by fakir or Cassie-states whilst the wetting behavior of bare nanotubes in every liquid is explained by Wenzel-type states. On the other hand, a transition between the Cassie and Wenzel states due to closed pores in the TNA architecture dictates the wetting behavior of functionalized TNAs in apolar liquids. The wetting behavior of functionalized TNAs is understood considering the synergistic effect of geometric and chemical surface modification. PFDPA-functionalized TNAs were found to be resilient to 24 hours of exposure to water and ethylene glycol at a static fluid pressure of 0. 105 MPa, and are one step closer towards the realization of a mechanically robust omniphobic surface.

Via linear transit (LT) and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations, three reaction mechanisms for the CF bond activation, leading to the An–F+ formation, were revealed; the first one, i. e. ‘harpoon’ mechanism which was observed in the case of Pu+, Am+, while the second called ‘insertion-elimination’ mechanism concerned the case of Th+, Pa+, U+ and Np+. DFT computations highlight the particular case of the Ac+ system which presents two different mechanisms according to its spin state: a mechanism qualified as ‘harpoon-like’ for the triplet state and an ‘insertion-elimination’ mechanism for the singlet state.
