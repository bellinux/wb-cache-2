40|$|Sources {{of lead in}} wine were {{inferred}} from systematic assay of grapes must and wine, during winemaking. Two Australian wineries were monitored during the 1994 vintage with respect to vinification of Riesling and Shiraz. Juice and wine samples were collected at several process stages from crushing through to bottling, and were analysed for their total lead concentration by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Selected samples were subsequently analysed for lead isotope ratio (fingerprinting method) to infer possible sources of lead in samples. Lead concentration in fermenting must was found to vary during vinification. In particular, lead concentration increased significantly in open-top vessels, in <b>holding</b> <b>bins</b> and during pressing. Juice and wine stored in concrete or waxed wood also had a significantly higher concentration of lead compared to juice or wine stored in stainless steel. Moreover, fining with bentonite or filtering with diatomaceous earth contributed further to final lead concentration, while fermentation, both primary and secondary, removed lead. Overall, wines processed via these different systems still contained only traces of lead, and generally less than 30 μg/L (30 micrograms per litre). These trace levels are of no concern to human health when such wines are consumed in moderation. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{extend the}} lower bound of Adler et al. (1998)  [1] and Berenbrink et al. (1999)  [2] for {{parallel}} randomized load balancing algorithms. The setting in these asynchronous and distributed algorithms is of n balls and n bins. The algorithms begin by each ball choosing d bins independently and uniformly at random. The balls and bins communicate {{to determine the}} assignment of each ball to a bin. The goal is to minimize the maximum load, i. e., the number of balls that are assigned to the same bin. In Adler et al. (1998) [1] and Berenbrink et al. (1999)  [2], a lower bound of Ω(logn/loglognr) is proved if the communication is limited to r rounds. Three assumptions appear in the proofs in Adler et al. (1998) [1] and Berenbrink et al. (1999)  [2]: the topological assumption, random choices of confused balls, and symmetry. The topological assumption states that each ball’s decision is based only on collisions between choices of balls. The confused ball assumption states that if a ball obtains the same topological information from all its chosen bins, then the ball commits {{to one of the}} chosen bins by flipping a fair coin. The symmetry assumption states that all the balls run identical algorithms, the same assumption <b>holds</b> for the <b>bins.</b> We extend the proof of the lower bound so that it holds without these three assumptions. This lower bound applies to every parallel randomized load balancing algorithm we are aware of (Adler et al., 1998 [1]; Berenbrink et al., 1999 [2]; Stemann, 1996 [3]; Even and Medina, 2009 [4]) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:—This paper {{explores the}} use of linear {{equations}} as histogram specification for CBIR system based on bins approach. This specification modifies the histogram of R, G and B planes of image. It actually pushes the intensities to little higher level which gives enhanced image where in the image details can be seen clearly. This modified image contents are utilized effectively to form the feature vectors of the image. This system is producing good results as compared to results obtained using the contents from the original histogram. To extract these image features each image plane modified using the histogram specification goes through the following few steps. Modified image planes are partitioned into two parts by computing the center of gravity. Each partition will get an id assigned to it, {{which leads to the}} bins formation process. This CG based partitioning of three planes generates the 23 = 8 bin addresses. Each of these addresses is indicating the region of specific range of intensities from R, G and B planes. Image contents are extracted to these eight bins and computed in different formats. These eight <b>bins</b> <b>holding</b> the image contents in various formats are representing the image feature vectors of dimension eight. Three similarity measures Euclidean distance, Absolute distance and Cosine Correlation distance are used to compare the query and database image feature vectors.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{proposed}} a novel technique to retrieve the images from large image databases based on the spatial contents of the image to extract the low level features from it for CBIR. In this work image is separated into 3 planes and for each plane we have calculated the histogram which is partitioned into three equal parts to obtain the 27 bins. These <b>bins</b> are <b>holding</b> the spatial-color information of the image in various forms which is generating {{the different types of}} the feature vector databases. Three different set of bins are designed to be used as feature vectors containing the total R,G, and B intensities, in R, G and B bins respectively, second form is containing the mean of R,G and B and third is holding standard deviation of R, G and B values in R, G, B bins respectively. This leads to generation of three feature vector databases where size of each feature vector in all databases is 27. Experimentation includes comparison of 100 query images with 1000 database images (Augmented Wang database) using two similarity measures named Euclidean distance and Absolute distance. Results obtained for three feature databases are compared based on the similarity measures reflecting the performance variations of different approaches used. These results are then analyzed and refined using three criteria in this work named Criterion 1 : Strong, Criterion 2 : Average and Criterion 3 : Weak.

40|$|Accurate massing {{of mixed}} juice is {{critical}} to the South African industry for cane payment purposes, as well as for controlling performance in a factory. The batch weighing system usually employed in the South African sugar industry consists of load cells, <b>holding</b> tanks, weighing <b>bins,</b> processors, valves and actuators. Due {{to the nature of the}} mechanism used, the system can be subject to frequent downtime because of mechanical and electronic malfunctions. Any errors or interruptions within the weighing system could result in mixed juice weighing being suspended or the mill stopping until the problem is rectified. During these periods, the unweighed mixed juice has to be estimated as accurately as possible. The Cane Testing Service (CTS) has developed a number of methods for estimating the mass of mixed juice in such an event (Brokensha, 1997). These methods usually involve the use of an assumed pol factor, the value of which may differ according to the amount of cane already crushed in the week. Due to the indirect nature of such a correction, and the need for decision making at laboratory manager level, the correction of the mixed juice mass can be lengthy and disputes as to its validity can arise. With a view to the eventual standardising on a direct method that could be applied automatically in all situations, the determination of mixed juice tonnage by flow meter was investigated at the Umzimkulu mill. The daily tonnages of mixed juice derived via the use of a flow meter already existing at the mill were compared against the routine massing of mixed juice and were recorded over the 2003 crushing season. After correcting the volumetric flow meter values for temperature, brix and specific gravity, the data showed a very good correlation to the tonnage obtained by the conventional massing of mixed juice.

40|$|The bin packing {{problem has}} been the corner stone of {{approximation}} algorithms and has been extensively studied starting from the early seventies. In the classical bin packing problem, we are given a list of real numbers in the range (0, 1], {{the goal is to}} place them in a minimum number of bins so that no <b>bin</b> <b>holds</b> numbers summing to more than 1. In this thesis we study approximation algorithms for three generalizations of bin packing: geometric bin packing, vector bin packing and weighted bipartite edge coloring. In two-dimensional (2 -D) geometric bin packing, we are given a collection of rectangular items to be packed into a minimum number of unit size square bins. Geometric packing has vast applications in cutting stock, vehicle loading, pallet packing, memory allocation and several other logistics and robotics related problems. We consider the widely studied orthogonal packing case, where the items must be placed in the bin such that their sides are parallel to the sides of the bin. Here two variants are usually studied, (i) where the items cannot be rotated, and (ii) they can be rotated by 90 degrees. We give a polynomial time algorithm with an asymptotic approximation ratio of (1. 5) + 1 ≈ 1. 405 for the versions with and without rotations. We have also shown the limitations of rounding based algorithms, ubiquitous in bin packing algorithms. We have shown that any algorithm that rounds at least one side of each large item to some number in a constant size collection values chosen independent of the problem instance, cannot achieve an asymptotic approximation ratio better than 3 / 2. In d-dimensional vector bin packing (VBP), each item is a d-dimensional vector that needs to be packed into unit vector bins. The problem is of great significance in resource constrained scheduling and also appears in recent virtual machine placement in cloud computing. Even in two dimensions, it has novel applications in layout design, logistics, loading and scheduling problems. We obtain a polynomial time algorithm with an asymptotic approximation ratio of (1. 5) + 1 ≈ 1. 405 for 2 -D VBP. We also obtain a polynomial time algorithm with almost tight (absolute) approximation ratio of 1 +(1. 5) for 2 -D VBP. For d dimensions, we give a polynomial time algorithm with an asymptotic approximation ratio of (d/ 2) + 1. 5 ≈ d+ 0. 81. We also consider vector bin packing under resource augmentation. We give a polynomial time algorithm that packs vectors into (1 +ϵ) Opt bins when we allow augmentation in (d - 1) dimensions and Opt is the minimum number of bins needed to pack the vectors into (1, 1) bins. In weighted bipartite edge coloring problem, we are given an edge-weighted bipartite graph G=(V,E) with weights w: E → [0, 1]. The task is to find a proper weighted coloring of the edges with as few colors as possible. An edge coloring of the weighted graph is called a proper weighted coloring if the sum of the weights of the edges incident to a vertex of any color is at most one. This problem is motivated by rearrangeability of 3 -stage Clos networks which is very useful in various applications in interconnected networks and routing. We show a polynomial time approximation algorithm that returns a proper weighted coloring with at most 2. 2223 m colors where m is the minimum number of unit sized bins needed to pack the weight of all edges incident at any vertex. We also show that if all edge weights are > 1 / 4 then 2. 2 m colors are sufficient. Ph. D...|$|R
