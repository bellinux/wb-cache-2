6000|$|... "This chain, {{said your}} reverence?" [...] {{answered}} Sir Piercie; [...] "surely it {{is but a}} toy, a trifle, a slight thing which shows but poorly with this doublet--marry, when I wear that of the murrey-coloured double-piled <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet,</b> puffed out with ciprus, the gems, being relieved and set off by the darker and more grave ground of the stuff, show like stars giving a lustre through dark clouds." ...|$|E
6000|$|As he donned {{his clothes}} {{of the richest}} <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet,</b> the {{astonished}} boy could not at first account for his difficulty in putting them on. [...] "Marry," [...] said he, [...] "these breeches that my blessed mother" [...] (tears filled his fine eyes as he thought of her)--"that my blessed mother had made long on purpose, are now ten inches too short for me. Whir-r-r! my coat cracks i' the back, as in vain I try to buckle it round me; and the sleeves reach no farther than my elbows! What is this mystery? Am I grown fat and tall in a single night? Ah! ah! ah! ah! I have it." ...|$|E
60|$|Every {{article of}} the {{furniture}} merits your attention. Here is a Venetian chair; {236} {{it is one of}} a set of twenty-six, with a sofa, brought from the Gradenigo Palace, and is carved and gilt all over,—the back, and seat, and cushions for the arms, being <b>Genoa</b> red <b>velvet.</b> [Picture: Venetian chair] Fourteen of these chairs, with the sofa, are in this room; the other twelve were purchased by the Earl of Lonsdale.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nice place, isn't it?' said Ponto. 'Quiet and unpretending. I like {{everything}} quiet. You've not brought your valet with you? Stripes will arrange your dressing things;' and that functionary, entering {{at the same}} time, proceeded to gut my portmanteau, and {{to lay out the}} black kerseymeres, 'the rich cut <b>velvet</b> <b>Genoa</b> waistcoat,' the white choker, and other polite articles of evening costume, with great gravity and despatch. 'A great dinner-party,' thinks I to myself, seeing these preparations (and not, perhaps, displeased at the idea that some of the best people in the neighbourhood were coming to see me). 'Hark, theres the first bell ringing! 'said Ponto, moving away; and, in fact, a clamorous harbinger of victuals began clanging from the stable turret, and announced the agreeable fact that dinner would appear in half-an-hour. 'If the dinner is as grand as the dinner-bell,' thought I, 'faith, I'm in good quarters!' and had leisure, during the half-hour's interval, not only to advance my own person to the utmost polish of elegance which it is capable of receiving, to admire the pedigree of the Pontos hanging over the chimney, and the Ponto crest and arms emblazoned on the wash-hand basin and jug, but to make a thousand reflections on the happiness of a country life--upon the innocent friendliness and cordiality of rustic intercourse; and to sigh for an opportunity of retiring, like Ponto, to my own fields, to my own vine and fig-tree, with a placens uxor in my domus, and a half-score of sweet young pledges of affection sporting round my paternal knee.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} her quite distinctly at this time. The light that slanted through the oriel of St. Dives choir was wont to fall very tenderly on her beautiful head with its stacked masses of deerskin-colored hair, {{on the low}} black arches of her brows, and to deepen the pretty fringes that shaded her eyes of <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet.</b> Very pleasant it was to watch the opening and shutting of that small straight mouth, with its quick revelation of little white teeth, {{and to see the}} foolish blood faintly deepen her satin cheek as you watched. For Mrs. Tretherick was very sweetly conscious of admiration, and, like most pretty women, gathered herself under your eye like a racer under the spur.|$|E
60|$|To do Miss Morgiana justice, {{it must be}} said, {{that she}} did not {{encourage}} one more than another; but as far as accepting eau-de-Cologne and hair-combs from the perfumer--some opera tickets, a treat to Greenwich, and a piece of real <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet</b> for a bonnet (it had originally been intended for a waistcoat), from the admiring tailor, she had been equally kind to each, and in return had made each a present of a lock of her beautiful glossy hair. It was all she had to give, poor girl! and what could she do but gratify her admirers by this cheap and artless testimony of her regard? A pretty scene and quarrel took place between the rivals on the day when they discovered that each was in possession of one of Morgiana's ringlets.|$|E
60|$|Are {{you willing}} to forsake the {{thoughtful}} soberness of antique oak-panelling for the tinsel of Venetian gold and the richness of <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet,</b> Florentine tapestry, and Persian arras? If so, we will ascend to the drawing-rooms and gallery. But stay a moment and permit this lady and oddly-dressed gentleman to pass us on their exit from the gallery, {{where they have been}} rehearsing some charming entertainment for the evening, or getting up some piece of fanciful mummery to amuse the idle guests who have congregated around the garden fountain. [Picture: Couple exiting from gallery] The light is not favourable for seeing all the pictures that deserve inspection on the staircase—you had better ascend; and now, having reached the head of the semi-staircase, our course is along this lobby to the opposite door-way, which is that of the drawing-room.|$|E
60|$|The {{merchant}} {{was dressed}} in very different attire to that {{in which he had}} travelled. He wore a doublet of brown satin, and hose of the same material and colour; on his shoulders was a robe of <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet</b> with a collar, and trimming down the front of brown fur, such as the boys had never before seen. Over his neck was a heavy gold chain, which they judged to be a sign of office. The landing was large and square, with richly carved oak panelling, and, like the stairs, it was carpeted with a thick Eastern rug. Taking their hands, he led them through an open door into a large withdrawing-room. Its walls were panelled in a similar manner to those of the landing, but the carpet was deeper and richer. Several splendid armoires or cabinets similarly carved stood against the walls, and in these were gold and silver cups exquisitely chased, salt-cellars, and other silver ware.|$|E
60|$|Galeotti Martivalle was a tall, bulky, yet stately man, {{considerably}} {{past his}} prime, and whose youthful habits of exercise, though still occasionally resumed, {{had not been}} able to contend with his natural tendency to corpulence, increased by sedentary study, and indulgence in the pleasures of the table. His features, though rather overgrown, were dignified and noble, and a Santon might have envied the dark and downward sweep of his long descending beard. His dress was a chamber robe of the richest <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet,</b> with ample sleeves, clasped with frogs of gold, and lined with sables. It was fastened round his middle by a broad belt of virgin parchment, round which were represented, in crimson characters, the signs of the Zodiac. He rose and bowed to the King, yet with the air of one to whom such exalted society was familiar, and who was not at all likely, even in the royal presence, to compromise the dignity then especially affected by the pursuers of science.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rem acu, once again," [...] said Sir Piercie; and {{not without}} good cause, since my neck, if I remained, {{might have been}} brought within the {{circumstances}} of a halter--and so speedy was my journey northward, that I had but time to exchange my peach-coloured doublet of <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet,</b> thickly laid over with goldsmith's work, for this cuirass, which was made by Bonamico of Milan, and travelled northward with all speed, judging that I might do well to visit my Right Honourable Cousin of Northumberland, {{at one of his}} numerous castles. But as I posted towards Alnwick, even with the speed of a star, which, darting from its native sphere, shoots wildly downwards, I was met at Northallerton by one Henry Vaughan, a servant of my right honourable kinsman, who showed me, that as then I might not with safety come to his presence, seeing that, in obedience to orders from his court, he was obliged to issue out letters for my incarceration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On Thursday night, the 3rd inst. [February, 1820], {{the body}} being wrapped in an {{exterior}} fold of white satin, {{was placed in}} the inside coffin, which was composed of mahogany, pillowed and ornamented in the customary manner with white satin.... This was enclosed in a leaden coffin, again enclosed in another mahogany coffin, and the whole finally placed in the state coffin of Spanish mahogany, covered with the richest <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet</b> of royal purple, a few shades deeper in tint than Garter blue. The lid was divided into three compartments by double rows of silver-gilt nails, and in the compartment at the head, over a rich star of the Order of the Garter was placed the Royal Arms of England, beautifully executed in dead Gold.... In the lower compartment at the feet was the British Lion Rampant, regardant, supporting a shield with the letters G. R. surrounded with the garter and motto of the same order in dead gold.... The handles were of silver, richly gilt of a massive modern pattern, and the most exquisite workmanship."--Ibid., p. 126.] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{time was}} in Genoa, it seems, {{as the time}} is now with us, when a great many people {{did not know what to}} do with their money. There were sumptuary laws which forbade their {{spending}} it, either they or their wives or daughters, in dress; apparently they could not even wear <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet,</b> which had to be sold abroad for the corruption of the outside world; and this is said to be the reason why there were so many palaces built in Genoa in the days of the republic. People who did not wish to figure in that hall of fame put their surplus into the immense and often ugly edifices which we still see ministering to their pride in the wide and narrow streets of the city. Now and then a devout family built or rebuilt a church and gave it to the public; but by far the greater number put up palaces, where, after the house-warming, they dwelt in a cold and economical seclusion. Some of their palaces are now devoted to public uses; they are galleries of pictures and statues most worthy to be seen, or they are municipal offices, or museums, or schools of art or science; but part are still in the keeping of the families that contributed them to the splendor of their city. The streets in which they stand are loud with transit and traffic, but the palaces hold aloof from the turmoil and lift their lofty heads to the level of the gardens behind them. Huge, heavy they are, according to the local ideal, and always wanting the delicacy of Venetian architecture, where something in the native genius tempered to gentleness the cold severity of Palladio, and where Sansovino knew how to bridge the gulf between the Gothic and the Renascent art that would have been Greek but halted at being Roman.|$|E
6000|$|A {{considerable}} number of persons are still employed {{in the manufacture of}} objects of taste and ornament; and in the Ruga Vecchia at Rialto they yet make the famous Venetian gold chain, which few visitors to the city can have failed to notice hanging in strands and wound upon spools, in the shop windows of the Old Procuratie and the Bridge of Rialto. It is wrought of all degrees of fineness, and is always so flexile that it may be folded and wound in any shape. It is now no longer made in great quantity, and is chiefly worn by contadine (as a safe investment of their ready money), [Footnote: Certain foreigners living in Venice were one day astonished to find their maid-servant in possession of a mass of this chain, and thought it their business to reprove her extravagance. [...] "Signori," [...] she explained paradoxically, [...] "if I keep my money, I spend it; if I buy this chain, it is always money (è sempre soldi)."] and old-fashioned people of the city, who display the finer sort in skeins or strands. At Chioggia, I remember to have seen a babe at its christening in church literally manacled and shackled with Venetian chain; and the little girl who came to us one day, to show us the splendors in which she had appeared at a disputa (examination of children in doctrine), was loaded with it. Formerly, in the luxurious days of the Republic, it is said the chain was made as fine as sewing-silk, and worn embroidered on <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet</b> by the patrician dames. It had then a cruel interest from the fact that its manufacture, after a time, cost the artisans their eyesight, so nice and subtle was the work. I could not help noticing that the workmen at the shops in the Ruga Vecchia still suffer in their eyes, even though the work is much coarser. I do not hope to describe the chain, except by saying that the links are horseshoe and oval shaped, and are connected by twos,-- an oval being welded crosswise into a horseshoe, and so on, each two being linked loosely into the next.|$|E
5000|$|The Green State Bedroom: Is 32 by 20 ft, the {{fireplace}} is of white marble including two Caryatids {{at the corners}} and a carved plaque in the centre backed by yellow marble with black veins. The ceiling has shallow plasterwork beams outlining a circle in the centre with two semicircles from the side walls touching it, there are large rosettes in each corner and paired above {{the fireplace}} and opposite {{in front of the}} middle window. The four doorways on the side walls have entablatures. The dado, ceiling and door surrounds are white highlighted in gilt. The central chandelier is of gilded bronze and hangs from a plaster pendant. The walls are covered by the tapestries of the four continents, Europe, America & Africa are Brussels tapestries all signed A. Auwercx. Asia is a Mortlake tapestry in the same style, either side of the central window are two small Mortlake tapestries of Sleep & Vigilance, all woven by Paul Saunders and George Smith Bradshaw in 1757. The canopied bed, seat furniture and curtains, have retained their original multicoloured <b>Genoa</b> <b>velvet</b> upholstery and was designed by William Kent. There are two small pier-tables with marble tops between the windows.|$|E
