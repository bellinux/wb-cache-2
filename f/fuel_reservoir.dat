2500|$|Max Gerner's GIIR sport, touring and {{training}} biplane was a development of his one-off G I. [...] The two types had low cost, easily repaired structures built from proprietary steel tubing and [...] unswept, constant chord wings with two truss braced spars; both had lattice girder fuselages and were largely fabric covered. Both also had open, tandem cockpits, fixed undercarriages {{and a single}} engine. However, the GIIR was larger, heavier and had a choice of engines which typically doubled the power. The fuselage was lengthened, mostly by increased cockpit separation, strengthened with diagonal cross members between the longerons, which placed the rear cockpit behind, rather than over, the trailing edge. [...] These changes raised the weight by 25% and so wing area was increased by extending the span by 20%. The GIIR retained the N-form interplane and cabane struts of the G I, though the former no longer leaned outwards and the upper wing was somewhat higher over the fuselage. It had two extra inter-spar trusses (six rather than four) in its lower wing, which alone carried ailerons. A newly patented method cramped, rather than welded, trusses and spars together. The [...] GIIR was easier to transport as it wings could be folded parallel to its fuselage despite the move of the <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoir</b> from behind the engine firewall {{to the top of}} the upper wings, for it now consisted of two side-by-side tanks, one on each wing.|$|E

50|$|From 1938, {{the state}} Atelier de Rueil, in {{cooperation}} with the Chaubeyre factory, constructed a single prototype from one of the original series of fifty, that was finished on 5 December 1939. From the vehicle, the turret had been removed and in the fighting compartment a large <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoir</b> was built of two thousand litres, protruding slightly above the hull roof, and containing a mixture of benzol and light oil. Beneath it a fuel pump was installed, able to pump 1800 litres per minute through a nozzle fitted {{in the front of the}} hull. The range was about fifty metres. During tests, the results were quite impressive and on 28 March 1940 fifty conversion sets were ordered. These were to be of a different model with a smaller nine hundred-litre <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoir</b> and using the original turret to place the nozzle in. On 23 April, the order was given to rebuild all fifty vehicles of the first series, in batches of fifteen, but in fact these were, as said, already being rebuilt in an uparming programme.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedClimate {{change in the}} Arctic is affecting the ice melt more rapidly than previously anticipated and the Arctic is now forecast to be ice-free by 2013. International borders, fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and new sea routes for navigation {{are just a few}} of the issues at stake due to the receding ice cover. Contrary to those who perceive U. S. -Russian conflict arising out of the region and advocate a military response, this thesis argues that the Arctic, precisely because of its rich hydrocarbon resources, may prove to be amenable to a capitalist peace. Research suggests that nations linked by economic interdependence are less apt to engage in conflict with each other. Nations seeking foreign direct investment will be less likely to initiate conflict, as this would diminish the potential for attracting foreign capital. Russia's economy is dependent on oil and natural gas exports and these industries have created enormous wealth for the nation. Yet Russia's existing fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are nearing exhaustion. Tapping into Arctic reserves is a strategic imperative for Russia, however, it lacks the technological capacity to do so. The energy industry in the West is farther along in developing such extractive technology.

50|$|If {{the engine}} must be {{operated}} in any orientation (for example {{a chain saw}} or a model airplane), a float chamber is not suitable. Instead, a diaphragm chamber is used. A flexible diaphragm forms {{one side of the}} fuel chamber and is arranged so that as fuel is drawn out into the engine, the diaphragm is forced inward by ambient air pressure. The diaphragm is connected to the needle valve and as it moves inward it opens the needle valve to admit more fuel, thus replenishing the fuel as it is consumed. As fuel is replenished the diaphragm moves out due to fuel pressure and a small spring, closing the needle valve. A balanced state is reached which creates a steady <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoir</b> level, which remains constant in any orientation.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, when the insulin {{concentration}} in the blood is high, and that of glucagon is low (i.e. after meals), the acetyl-CoA produced by glycolysis condenses as normal with oxaloacetate to form citrate in the mitochondrion. However, instead of continuing through the citric acid cycle to be converted to carbon dioxide and water, the citrate {{is removed from the}} mitochondrion into the cytoplasm. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is returned to the mitochondrion as malate (and then converted back into oxaloacetate to transfer more acetyl-CoA out of the mitochondrion). This cytosolic acetyl-CoA can then be used to synthesize fatty acids through carboxylation by acetyl-CoA carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acids. This conversion occurs primarily in the liver, adipose tissue and lactating mammary glands, where the fatty acids are combined with glycerol to form triglycerides, the major <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoir</b> of most animals. Fatty acids are also components of the phospholipids that make up the bulk of the lipid bilayers of all cellular membranes.|$|E

50|$|The SRB, {{also using}} leaf springs, was a {{somewhat}} larger vehicle, six metres long, 228 centimetres high and 2.5 metres wide. It was nevertheless lighter at 18.5 tonnes, {{a result of}} having a smaller 47 mm gun—it thus was the antitank version. Using the same engine, its speed was accordingly slightly higher at 18 km/h. More limited <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoirs</b> holding 370 litres decreased the range to 125 kilometres. It used an advanced hydraulic suspension system and the hydraulic Naeder-transmission from the Chaize company combined with a Fieux clutch and Schneider gear box. It used modified FT 17 tracks.

50|$|E1Designated as Experiment 1 in {{the fall}} of 1940, the initial model {{consisting}} of four main components: fuel storage system, compressed gas storage system, igniter, and flame gun. The E1 had a single fuel tank vertical cylinder with two compartments, an upper and lower compartment. The upper compartment contained pressurized nitrogen that pushed the five gallons of fuel oil in the lower compartment through the barrel and into the flame gun. The fuel system for the E1 consisted of either diesel oil, fuel oil, or blends of gasoline and oil. An igniter, consisting of a compressed hydrogen cylinder and battery, was attached to the flame gun. The flame gun had two triggers, dispense fuel and ignition of fuel as it exited the metal barrel.Weighing in at 70 pounds when filled, the E1 was capable of ranges from fourteen to twenty-one yards. Issues - engineer board tests identified that the fuel-compressed gas reservoir was impractical, prone position firing was difficult, and as the E1 was firing, gas pressure decreased in the upper compartment tank lowering gas pressure to push the fuel in the lower compartment through the flame gun, thereby reducing weapon range. Additional issues were identified with the dependability, weight, and maneuverability of the E1 flame thrower system. E1R1The E1 was redesigned by the Chemical Warfare Service and labeled Experiment 1 Revision 1 and was ready for testing in March 1941. The compressed nitrogen was separated away from the <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoir,</b> a feature carried forward in all subsequent models. Additional improvements included the flame gun, valves, and ignition system. The E1R1's filled weight was reduced to 57 pounds and was capable of sustaining 15 to 20 yards for 15 to 20 seconds; the E1R1 weighed 28 pounds when empty. Issues - Weight, easily damaged parts, and access to the control valves were identified during testing as being problematic. M1Test board results {{led to the development of}} the M1 production model, consisting of a heavier weight, the M1 was more rugged and had a longer range as standardized for production in March 1942. The M1 system made it to the South Pacific theater by the end of the year. M1A1The invention of napalm led to its evaluation as a flamethrowing agent. Gasoline and oil mixtures sprayed as it left the barrel of the flame gun, whereas napalm thickened fuel left the barrel in a compact stream capable of ricocheting off of and into openings and subsequently sticking to flat surfaces. Initial tests showed that the current M1 platform was incapable of providing the ideal range with napalm. The Chemical Warfare Service was asked to adapt the napalm fuel system to the M1 platform to avoid procurement issues, thus facilitating the development of the M1A1 platform. Modifications included the fuel system, pressure regulator, valves, and the flame gun to facilitate the higher pressures required to achieve ideal ranges with the napalm. The M1A1 was capable of reliably firing to distances fifty yards away versus the M1's ideal firing range of twenty yards.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} characterization of an air-breathing microfluidic fuel cell with a stationary <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoir</b> above the anode replacing the continuous fuel stream. Unlike other air-breathing microfluidic designs, the fuel is not {{in direct contact with}} electrolyte stream allowing the use of high fuel concentration. In addition, Ohmic losses are minimal because of the low anode-to-cathode spacing. Since the fuel passes through the catalyst layer of the anode, the conventional depletion boundary layer does not form. Improved mass transport compared to previous microfluidic designs is obtained because of a supply of a uniform fuel concentration over the anode and efficient bubble removal from the anode active sites. For practical applications, the <b>fuel</b> <b>reservoir</b> can be replaced by a pressurized fuel cartridge. The pressure is optimized according to the fuel concentration and the power density.
