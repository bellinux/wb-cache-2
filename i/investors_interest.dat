5000|$|In 1982, {{at the end}} of the {{presidency}} of José López Portillo (December 1976 - December 1982) the government found itself unable to meet demands for United States dollars and devaluated the peso from a value of 26 to 47 pesos per dollar. A consequence was an extremely high default debt. The López Portillo administration then decided to nationalize the banking system on September 1 of the same year, paying 3 trillion pesos (approximately 63 billion dollars at 47 pesos/dollar exchange rate) to acquire public and private credit institutions who had an accumulated debt of 25 billion dollars. The following year, in the middle of an economic crisis, president Miguel de la Madrid (December 1982 - December 1988) created the FICORCA (Fideicomiso de Cobertura de Riesgo Cambiario or [...] "Exchange risk coverage fund") financed by a loan that would also finance the fiscal deficit, the external debt and the economic activity of the country. This fund saved twenty of the largest companies of the country from bankruptcy; these companies owed 12 billion dollars through notes with the Banco de México. On November 10, 1986 the FONAPRE (Fondo de Apoyo Preventivo a las Institiciones de Banca Múltiple or [...] "Fund of preventive support to banking institutions") was founded to preserve the financial stability of banks, with the government having banks as trustees. By 1987, a parallel finance industry had been created with brokering firms, investment societies etc. To continue attracting <b>investors,</b> <b>interest</b> rates increased at the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, and with the crash in the New York Stock Exchange, the national banking system was deeply affected and another devaluation came as a result.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the quality of}} financial statements reported by private equity (PE) backed companies in the years around the initial PE investment. We study both pre- and postinvestment earnings characteristics of a unique hand-collected sample of 556 Belgian unlisted companies, receiving PE financing between 1985 & 1999, and a matched non-PE backed sample. We find strong evidence of upward earnings management in the PE backed sample prior to the investment year, consistent with the hypothesis that entrepreneurs which apply for PE manage earnings upward to catch PE <b>investors</b> <b>interest.</b> Further, PE backed companies show a significantly higher extent of earnings conservatism compared to matched companies from the investment year on, indicating a governance impact of PE investors on the financial reporting discipline. Finally, we find a marginally higher degree of earnings conservatism for companies receiving PE from non-government related investors compared to companies backed by government-related PE investors. We interpret this stricter financial reporting discipline as being the reflection of a more slack governance by government-related PE investors compared to non-government-related investors. Our results have implications for PE investors {{as well as for}} all other stakeholders of PE backed firms...|$|E

Nonetheless, most indicators were still at comfortable levels, and {{there is evidence of}} improvement in 2002, the last year in our sample. However, a number of firms still face problems servicing their debt obligations, posing a risk to lenders. In particular, the aggregate interest coverage of the corporate sector indicates that potential nonperforming loans of the corporate sector remain high. This underscores the need for close monitoring of the corporate sector in the future.

40|$|Today a {{major part}} of the energy {{produced}} steams from fossil fuels, finite resources, and a change towards an energy sector based on renewable energy is necessary. Sweden is one of the leading countries with regards to investments in renewable energy but most other countries have a long way to go. This makes it interesting in developing renewable energy projects in new markets in countries like Poland where still a lot of fossil fuel is used. Large infrastructure development projects are very costly and therefore external investors needs to be involved. The investors play an important role in changing the usage of fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources. This thesis includes a study of three investment companies, the European Investment Bank, the Nordic Investment Bank and Swedish Export Credit and their motives to finance district heating based on renewable energy. How do the investors value environmental and sustainability aspects in a project and how do the values differ? We made qualitative interviews and then we analyzed our material out of theoretical framework based on institutional theory. The material was also analyzed through an ecological economics perspective, which is the author's academic background. The result of the study shows that the <b>investors</b> <b>interest</b> in a project depend on political, economical and environmental aspects.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{increase in}} the level and volatility of Tanzania''s Treasury yields in recent years against an otherwise benign macroeconomic backdrop presented a puzzle for policymakers, while raising concerns about the fiscal burden of rising debt interest payments and diversion of bank credit away from the private sector. Using evidence from bid-level data and supported by theoretical models, this paper argues that oligopolistic bidding through 2005 may have been partly responsible for the rising level of yields; while the high volatility during 2006 - 07 could be traced to the emergence of a sharp segmentation of the T-bill market between sophisticated financial market players (foreign-controlled banks) and a lessexperienced group of investors (domestic pension funds and small banks). An important policy recommendation that emerges is that public debt managers should avoid micromanaging Treasury bill auctions by issuing amounts in excess of those offered or by dipping into oversubscribed segments of the yield curve, as such practices seriously disadvantage the less-sophisticated (but more competitive) investors vis-Ã -vis the more sophisticated players.

The legal basis, which in rudimentary outlines prescribes the procedure of the public insight/hearing, i. e. the presentation of the planning document, does not provide sufficient input, however, also does not prevent organization of more qualitative and productive communication with the interested individuals, not only at the very finalization of plan development, but also at the initial phases of the initiative for decision making or forming the conceptual solution. In order to better comprehend the real needs of the citizens, urban planners should much earlier than the public insight i. e. presentation of already formed solutions, get in touch with citizens, interview them, organize workshops, insights and meetings on specific topics, trying to explain the planning procedures, standards and norms, as well as to present all that which is required in order to raise {{the quality of life in}} the neighborhood and provide some level of public interest and good, and thus increase the value of real estate.

40|$|Public Investment Fund is an {{alternative}} means of investment in the capital market and absolutely prospective for the public. But, {{for the last three}} years its activity is more dominated by the rapid growth and development of the so-called open-end collective investment agreement than the closed-end Public Investment Funds taking the form of limited liability company, particularly among the Investment Manager as players in the capital market. On the other side, Public Investment Fund is also purported to be a collective investment means which is favouring domestic investors, particularly small and medium investors that need both certainty and protection of their investment. What is reflected is that there are some legal aspects in the Public Investment Funds activity, mostly on the side of the Investment Manager as a company providing management service for securities portfolio or investment of its customers. Therefore, it is important to conduct research on these legal aspects to reveal the reasons why [...] particularly among the Investment Manager [...] open-end Public Investment Funds is more developed than its closed-end counterpart. It is also necessary to conduct research on the institutional character and the activities of Public Investment Fund as a business construction, the control of the government over the activities of Public Investment Funds to ensure protection of the public <b>investors</b> <b>interest,</b> and the system of responsibility of the Investment Manager to the investors in Public Investment Fund. In order to identify and to understand the above mentioned problems, this descriptive-analytical research is performed through juridical-normative and sociological approach by focusing on secondary data which is supported by primary data. Data of this research is gathered from BAPEPAM, some Investment Managers, some Representatives of Investment Manager, APEI (Indonesian Association of Securities Companies), and PIPM Semarang. In gathering data, the techniques employed in this research are document analysis, questionaire, and interview. Next, qualitative analysis is applied to the data gathered. The facts of the field resarch reveal that the growth and development of Public Investment Funds in Indonesia is more influenced by the role and participation of the Investment Managers rather than by the degree of knowledge and understanding on the side of public investors, as may be seen from the fact that the development in the open-end Public Investment Funds which is not necessarily corelated to the preference of public investors to choose Public Investment Funds product. Legal obstacles that make closed-end Public Investment Fund is less-developed than open-end Public Investment Funds among the Investment Managers are in fact closely related to the legal procedure of establishment, flexibility in management, support from the government [...] particularly in term of taxation, and the marketability of the product of open-end Public Investment Funds. As a business stucture, the characteristic of the institution and activity of Public Investment Funds lies more on its purpose to protect the interest of public investors in investment portfolio than on the juridical structure of company organization. Public Investment Funds institution in the form of limited liability company is cathegories as 'PT Terbuka' with specialities in the capital structure, the system/structure in managing the company's assets and the rights of the share-holders. Public Investment Funds in the formof collective investment contrat basically falls within the cathegory of business entities which are established by a particular contract containing legal relationship of providing service in management and depository of collective investment assets for the interest of investors as a single unit. In term of activity, both kind of Public Investment Funds share the same goals in giving investment benefit (economical rights) coming from securities portfolio, [...] which is managed by the Investment Manager [...] , in a diversified way to the beneficiary, that is the share holders/participation unit holders in a particular form influenced by the purposes character of the formation of securities portfolio of the relevant Public Investment Funds. The control of BAPEPAM over the activities of Public Investment Funds to protect public investors is hampered by the purpose and interest on the government's part in stimulating the development of the quantity of Public Investment Funds industry. Consequently, the control is more focused on fostering Investment Manager as reflected from the whistleblowing nature of the legal sanctions, from the compliance request, and the from the refusal to approve the request of dismissing Public Investment Funds by Investment Manager on the ground that Investment Manager is expected to participate in developing trust in the Public Investment Funds. The reponsibility system of Investment Manager as the manager of Public Investment Funds to the investor can be cathegorized as fiduciary duties, based on either the law or the management contract. As a consequence of the representative nature of the duties given, the authority of the Investment Manager is restrictied by good-faith in the transaction of the fund and the securities as the investment portfolio of the Public Investment Funds. There is also a mechanism in settling the transaction of the securities which falls within the authority and responsibility of the Custodian Bank so that interest of the investors is more protected. Although there is a principle that Investment Manager should be responsible for any damage caused by his mistake or negligence, the customer bears the investment risk on the reason that the action is within the boundary of the good-faith principle in the Public Investment Funds. Any dispute emerging from investment loss tend to be settled out of the court, that is by the Investment Manager's explanation to the investors, by the Investment Manager's compliance with BAPEPAM's rule and by the acceptance of the administrative sanction delivered by BAPEPAM. ...|$|E
