25|$|Juan de la Cierva {{invented the}} modern {{autogyro}} (autogiro in Spanish) {{in the early}} 1920s. His first three designs (C.1, C.2, and C.3) were unstable because of aerodynamic and structural deficiencies in their rotors. His fourth design, the C.4, made the first documented flight of an autogyro on 17 January 1923, piloted by Alejandro Gomez Spencer at Cuatro Vientos airfield in Madrid, Spain (9 January according to Cierva). De la Cierva had fitted the rotor of the C.4 with flapping hinges to attach each rotor blade to the hub. The flapping hinges allowed each rotor blade to flap, or move up and down, to compensate for <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift,</b> the difference in lift produced between {{the right and left}} sides of the rotor as the autogyro moves forward. Three days later, the engine failed shortly after takeoff and the aircraft descended slowly and steeply to a safe landing, validating De la Cierva's efforts to produce an aircraft that could be flown safely at low airspeeds.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{asymmetry}} {{with respect to}} sliding direction has been recently proved {{to be important in}} the analysis of static contact interactions of some automotive mechanical structures. In the present paper, we consider a nonclassical friction law, based on a <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> friction in a given sliding direction. A simple analytical micro-model has been adopted to derive the macroscopic model via averaging. Not only does it allow the law macroscopic characteristics to be determined but it also theoretically proves the existence <b>of</b> such <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> friction. The thermodynamic admissibility of the law is then shown from the derivation of a generalized standard model including friction. To complete the analysis, the existence of asymmetric friction conditions is confirmed from an experimental point of view. We then compare theoretical computations resulting from the analytical model with experimental results...|$|R
50|$|Coaxial rotors {{solve the}} problem of main rotor torque by turning each set of rotors in {{opposite}} directions. The opposite torques from the rotors cancel each other out. Rotational maneuvering, yaw control, is accomplished by increasing the collective pitch of one rotor and decreasing the collective pitch on the other. This causes a controlled <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> torque.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> in {{rotorcraft}} aerodynamics {{refers to}} an uneven amount of lift {{on opposite sides of}} the rotor disc. It is a phenomenon that affects single-rotor helicopters and autogyros in forward flight.|$|E
50|$|Normally a {{helicopter}} or gyrocopter cannot fly {{forward at the}} same speed as or faster than its rotor tip speed. This is because the low airspeed of the retreating rotor blade would cause retreating blade stall, whilst the advancing rotor blade would be traveling at twice the speed of the aircraft, producing uncontrollable flight due to <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before {{this could}} be satisfactorily achieved, De la Cierva {{experienced}} several failures primarily associated with the unbalanced rolling movement generated when attempting take-off, due to <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> between the advancing and retreating blades. This major difficulty was resolved {{by the introduction of}} the flapping hinge. In 1923, De la Cierva's first successful autogyro was flown in Spain by Lt. Gomez Spencer.|$|E

5000|$|Retreating blade stall. As {{forward speed}} of the {{helicopter}} increases, the airflow over the retreating blade becomes relatively slower, while the airflow over the advancing blade is relatively faster, creating more lift. If not counteracted by flapping, this would cause <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> and eventually retreating blade stall, and blade stability suffers as the blade reaches its limits for flapping.|$|E
50|$|However, {{with the}} CarterCopter, the fixed wings provide the lift {{required}} to remain aloft. Since the rotor is unloaded, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} rotor are very minor. This means that a CarterCopter can theoretically fly much faster than the tip speed of the rotor. The rotors would still experience flapping as they rotate due to <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> {{between the two sides}} of the vehicle, but Carter Aviation claims this is manageable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> is an {{aerodynamic}} phenomenon {{caused by}} the rotation of a helicopter's rotors in forward flight. Rotor blades provide lift proportional {{to the amount of}} air flowing over them. When viewed from above, the rotor blades move in the direction of flight for half of the rotation (advancing half), and then move in the opposite direction {{for the remainder of the}} rotation (retreating half). A rotor blade produces more lift in the advancing half. As a blade moves toward the direction of flight, the forward motion of the aircraft increases the speed of the air flowing around the blade until it reaches a maximum when the blade is perpendicular to the relative wind. At the same time, a rotor blade in the retreating half produces less lift. As a blade moves away from the direction of flight, the speed of the airflow over the rotor blade is reduced by an amount equal to the forward speed of the aircraft, reaching its maximum effect when the rotor blade is again perpendicular to the relative wind. Coaxial rotors avoid the effects of <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> through the use of two rotors turning in opposite directions, causing blades to advance on either side at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The Cierva C.3 was an {{experimental}} autogyro built by Juan de la Cierva in Spain in 1921. It {{was based on}} the fuselage of a Sommer monoplane, and was actually completed and tested before that aircraft. The C.3 utilised a single, three-bladed rotor in place of the coaxial double rotor tested on the C.1. A few short hops were achieved in testing and Cierva noted a tendency for the machine to want to roll over, thus alerting him to the problem of <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> {{that he would have to}} overcome in order to build a successful rotary-wing aircraft. The C.3 was damaged and rebuilt four times before being abandoned without having flown, la Cierva returning to work on the C.2.|$|E

In 1925 he brought his C.6 to Britain and demonstrated it to the Air Ministry at Farnborough, Hampshire. This machine had a four blade rotor with flapping hinges but relied upon conventional airplane controls for pitch, roll and yaw. It was based upon an Avro 504K fuselage, initial rotation of the rotor was achieved by the rapid uncoiling of a rope passed around stops on the undersides of the blades.|$|E

5000|$|Because the {{advancing}} blade has higher airspeed than the retreating blade and generates a <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift,</b> rotor blades {{are designed to}} [...] "flap" [...] - lift and twist {{in such a way}} that {{the advancing}} blade flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack. Conversely, the retreating blade flaps down, develops a higher angle of attack, and generates more lift. At high speeds, the force on the rotors is such that they [...] "flap" [...] excessively, and the retreating blade can reach too high an angle and stall. For this reason, the maximum safe forward airspeed of a helicopter is given a design rating called VNE, velocity, never exceed. In addition, it is possible for the helicopter to fly at an airspeed where an excessive amount of the retreating blade stalls, which results in high vibration, pitch-up, and roll into the retreating blade.|$|E
50|$|Flap back or {{blowback}} is {{a phenomenon}} affecting the rotor of a helicopter as it overcomes <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> through flapping. In forward flight, rotor blades experience more lift as they rotate forward. This increased lift {{is a result of}} an increased relative speed causing the blade to flap up and decrease its angle of attack. As the blade continues to rotate, it achieves its maximum upflapping displacement over the nose of the aircraft and maximum downflapping displacement over the tail. This results in the rotor disk being tilted to the rear and is referred to as flap back, as if the rotor disk had flapped or tilted back, or {{as if it had been}} blown back by the relative wind. The effect is more pronounced at higher airspeeds but more easily recognized as the aircraft accelerates to translational lift airspeeds from a hover. Flap back results in a slowing of the aircraft and the pilot counters the effect by applying forward input to the cyclic control.|$|E

50|$|An aft CG {{condition}} can {{be recognized}} by the pilot when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a tail-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive forward displacement of cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. If there is a wind, the pilot needs even greater forward cyclic. If flight is continued in this condition, the pilot may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose-low attitude. In addition, with an extreme aft CG, gusty or rough air could accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced with full forward cyclic control. In this case, <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> and blade flapping could cause the rotor disc to tilt aft. With full forward cyclic control already applied, the rotor disc {{might not be able}} to be lowered, resulting in possible loss of control, or the rotor blades striking the tail boom.|$|E
50|$|The Cierva C.4 was an {{experimental}} autogyro built by Juan de la Cierva in Spain in 1922 which early {{the following year}} became the first autogyro to fly successfully. The failures of De la Cierva's previous designs, the C.2 and C.3, had led him to understand {{that he needed to}} overcome the problem of <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> in order to get an autogyro to fly without rolling over. He noted that the problems that he was experiencing with his full-size aircraft were not found in the models that he had successfully flown, and considered the difference between the full-size and small-scale rotors. De la Cierva noted that the rotors used on his model were made of bamboo, and were thus far more flexible than the ones on his full-size aircraft. While attending an opera he realized that the flexibility reduced the moments acting on the hub and eliminated instability. Trained as a civil engineer, Cierva was aware that an otherwise cantilever structure hinged to its attachment point also generated no moment, and he designed a rotor the blades of which were mounted to the hub through hinges to permit their vertical oscillation.|$|E
5000|$|Juan de la Cierva {{developed}} the fully articulating rotor for the autogyro. The {{basis of his}} design permitted successful helicopter development. In a fully articulated rotor system, each rotor blade {{is attached to the}} rotor hub through a series of hinges that let the blade move independently of the others. These rotor systems usually have three or more blades. The blades are allowed to flap, feather, and lead or lag independently of each other. The horizontal hinge, called the flapping hinge, allows the blade to move up and down. This movement is called flapping and is designed to compensate for <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift.</b> The flapping hinge may be located at varying distances from the rotor hub, and there may be more than one hinge. The vertical hinge, called the lead-lag hinge or drag hinge, allows the blade to move back and forth. This movement is called lead-lag, dragging, or hunting. Dampers are usually used to prevent excess back and forth movement around the drag hinge. The purpose of the drag hinge and dampers is to compensate for acceleration and deceleration caused by the Coriolis effect. Later models have switched from using traditional bearings to elastomeric bearings. Elastomeric bearings are naturally fail-safe and their wear is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this design. The third hinge in the fully articulated system is called the feathering hinge about the feathering axis. This hinge is responsible for the change in pitch of rotor blades excited via pilot input to the Collective or Cyclic.A variation of the fully articulated system is the [...] "soft-in-plane" [...] rotor system. This type of rotor can be found on several aircraft produced by Bell Helicopter, such as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. This system is similar to the fully articulated type in that each blade has the ability to lead/lag and hunt independent of the other blades. The difference between a fully articulated system and soft-in-plane system is that the soft-in-plane system utilizes a composite yoke. This yoke is attached to the mast and runs through the blade grips between the blades and the shear bearing inside the grip. This yoke does transfer some movement of one blade to another, usually opposing blades. While this is not fully articulated, the flight characteristics are very similar and maintenance time and cost are reduced.|$|E

50|$|Coaxial rotors are {{a pair of}} rotors mounted {{one above}} {{the other on the}} same shaft and turning in {{opposite}} directions. The advantage of the coaxial rotor is that, in forward flight, the lift provided by the advancing halves of each rotor compensates for the retreating half of the other, eliminating one of the key effects <b>of</b> <b>dissymmetry</b> <b>of</b> lift: retreating blade stall. However, other design considerations plague coaxial rotors. There is an increased mechanical complexity of the rotor system because it requires linkages and swashplates for two rotor systems. Also, because the rotors must rotate in opposite directions, the mast is more complex, and control linkages for pitch changes to the upper rotor system must pass through the lower rotor system.|$|R
