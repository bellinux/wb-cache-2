5|$|Athamas {{ruled in}} Boeotia {{and had a}} {{complicated}} family life, several details of which {{are known to have}} played part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> His first children were Phrixus and Helle, whose mother was Nephele. In what was the first episode of the Argonautic saga, she gave her children a ram with a golden fleece upon which they fled the intrigues of their stepmother Ino according to other sources. Athamas was driven mad by the gods, perhaps because he took the young Dionysus into his household, and slaughtered his and Ino's son Learchus; Ino herself jumped into the sea with their son Melicertes and became the sea-goddess Leucothea. At some point before his marriage to Ino, Athamas had sired Leucon and Schoeneus by Themisto, and Leucon's daughters Peisidice, Euippe and Hyperippe were given extended group treatment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue.</b>|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another possibility is that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E
5|$|By 1881, Stanley was {{employing}} 80 {{people and}} producing 3,000 technical items, as detailed in his catalogue. A few years later, in 1885, Stanley {{was given a}} {{gold medal at the}} International Inventors Exhibition at Wembley. The rapid growth of his business led to the opening of branches at Lincoln's Inn, at London Bridge and at South Norwood. His 1890 catalogue shows that the company were selling Magic Lanterns, with a variety of slides including such subjects as the Siege of Paris (1870–1871), the travels of Dr Livingstone and Dante's Inferno, as well as improving stories for children such as Mother's Last Words and The Drunkard's Children, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalogue</b> for 1891, Stanley refers to the company having 17 branches, with over 130 workmen.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Polish Football Association, in {{an attempt}} to fight racism among Polish {{football}} fans, prepared a blacklist of most common racist and fascist symbols to be banned from Polish football stadiums. The catalogue, co-authored by independent anti-fascist organization Never Again (Nigdy Więcej), listed the Mieczyk Chrobrego as one of the extreme right symbols that are often displayed at the Polish stadiums. The catalogue listed other racist and fascist symbols like the Nazi swastika, the Celtic cross, and the Confederate Flag. After a protest by MEP Sylwester Chruszcz of the League of Polish Families, additional consultations were held with historians, academic researchers and other experts and as a result the symbol is still listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalogue</b> of extreme-right symbols banned at Polish football stadiums. It was also banned by UEFA during Euro 2008 and 2012.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to find historically-based {{arguments}} to validate or rectify the earthquake parameters as existing now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalogues.</b> Systematic search for the original information collected from annals of time, reviews, notes on old religious writings, newspapers, etc. was carried out. <b>In</b> parallel, all <b>the</b> information available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalogues</b> of earthquakes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Carpathian region was considered. The historical data are critically analyzed and, on the basis of our investigation. Also, we tried to compensate for the uneven geographical distribution: clearly more systematic and rich documentation comes from Brasov (Transylvania) area as compared with other provinces, such as Wallachia and Moldova. Basically, only <b>the</b> events mentioned <b>in</b> at least two independent documentary sources were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> revised <b>catalogue.</b> A significant fraction of <b>the</b> total <b>catalogued</b> events was proved to be improperly parameterized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>catalogues.</b> Key words: historical earthquakes, Vrancea. 1...|$|R

5|$|After {{treating}} the Thessalian families of Peisidice and Canace, the poet {{turned to the}} intermingled Aetolian-Elian lines of Calyce and Perimede. Perimede had earlier in the book borne two sons to the river Achelous, {{one of whom was}} the grandfather of Oeneus, Hippodamas. To Aethlius Calyce bore Endymion, whose son Aetolus was the eponym of Aetolia and the great-grandfather of Demodice and Porthaon, through whom the later Aetolian and Elian genealogies were traced. Somewhere within these families, Eurytus and Cteatus were found in a form more fearsome {{than they were in the}} Iliad: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> they were fierce conjoined twins with two heads, four arms and an equal number of legs. Most significant for the epic tradition, however, was the marriage of Demodice's son Thestius and Porthaon's daughter Eurythemiste which produced the daughters Leda, Althaea and Hypermestra, who are introduced in a group Ehoiai at fr. 23a.3–5.|$|E
5|$|Europa's tale, {{well known}} in later {{classical}} literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> She caught Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in a meadow. The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, {{in the guise of}} which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, was surely present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.|$|E

5|$|Warlugulong {{was first}} {{exhibited}} at {{a show in}} Alice Springs, where it attracted crowds of interested viewers, but failed to sell. Realities Gallery in Melbourne then included the work in a major exhibition of Papunya Tula artworks. It was purchased for A$1,200 by the Commonwealth Bank, which hung it in a bank training centre cafeteria on the Mornington Peninsula. The bank sold it by auction in 1996. The auction house trading the work expected it to fetch around $5,000 and {{did not make a}} feature of it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalogue,</b> but dealers including Hank Ebes, the successful bidder, recognised the painting's significance and it sold for $36,000 plus commission. After hanging in Ebes's living room for eleven years, it was auctioned in Melbourne by Sotheby's on 24 July 2007. It sold for $2.4million, thoroughly eclipsing the previous record for an Indigenous Australian painting, set when Emily Kngwarreye's Earth's Creation was bought in May of the same year for just over $1million. Warlugulongs buyer was the National Gallery of Australia, which purchased the work as part of its 25th Anniversary Gifts Program. The Gallery considers the painting to be possibly the most important in its collection of Indigenous Australian art. As of 2016, the work is on display in the National Gallery.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} if three scientific articles concerning <b>the</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of alba amicorum written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980 ’s and early 1990 ’s had any influence on <b>the</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of alba amicorum. Another purpose is to investigate the similarities and differences between <b>the</b> <b>catalogues</b> from <b>the</b> late 1980 ’s and onward. The focus lies on the categories used when <b>cataloguing</b> <b>the</b> alba. Alba amicorum are catalogued on two levels: on a general level, i. e. the album as a whole is catalogued and <b>in</b> addition all <b>the</b> inscriptions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> album are cata-logued separately, <b>the</b> so-called leaf <b>cataloguing.</b> <b>The</b> study uses a comparative method. First the three scientific articles are compared with each other, then nine catalogues of alba amicorum from 1988 and onward, five printed and four online ones, are investigated regarding which categories are used respectively not used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different <b>catalogues.</b> Then <b>the</b> categories pro-posed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scientific articles are compared with <b>the</b> ones used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalogues.</b> One result of the study is that <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cataloguing</b> on <b>the</b> general level between <b>the</b> printed <b>catalogues</b> are small but that the variation is larger amongst the online ones. The same patterns cannot be seen regarding the leaf cataloguing; here the variation between <b>the</b> <b>catalogues</b> is generally somewhat larger but the most central categories can be found in all catalogues. Another result is that some of <b>the</b> categories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cata-logues reflect the printed or online form of <b>the</b> <b>catalogue.</b> <b>The</b> study shows that it is hard to define exactly which influence the scientific articles had on <b>the</b> <b>catalogues</b> but that it probably hasn’t been that large. Many of <b>the</b> categories occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalogues</b> have been used when cataloguing alba amicorum since the early 1900 ’s. Maybe one could say that the alba themselves are con-stituted in such a way that it is more or less natural which categories should be used when cataloguing them.
