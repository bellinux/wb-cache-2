These take the form of implicit or explicit government <b>guarantees</b> <b>and</b> <b>commitments.</b> The five major categories surveyed include support for housing, other loan guarantees, deposit insurance, actions taken by the Federal Reserve, and government trust funds. The total dollar value of notional off-balance-sheet commitments came to $ 70 trillion as of 2012, or 6 {{times the size of the}} reported on-balance-sheet debt. The paper reviews the potential costs and benefits of these off-balance-sheet commitments and their role in precipitating or mitigating the financial crisis of 2008...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedU. S. policy makers claim that {{nuclear weapons are}} needed to <b>guarantee</b> security <b>commitments</b> <b>and</b> discourage the international spread of nuclear weapons. This thesis evaluates the link between security <b>guarantees</b> <b>and</b> efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. It draws three conclusions based on case studies {{of the use of}} conventional security <b>commitments</b> <b>and</b> nuclear security <b>guarantees</b> to prevent nuclear weapons development in South Korea and Taiwan. First, nuclear security guarantees alone are not sufficient to prevent proliferation. Second, strong conventional commitments made credible by visible presence of forces are sufficient to prevent nuclear proliferation when the direct security threat is conventional. Third, when the security threat being faced includes nuclear weapons, nuclear proliferation prevention requires both a nuclear security <b>guarantee</b> <b>and</b> a physically evident conventional military guarantee. Two implications for security policy follow from these findings. First, nuclear weapons are necessary in the modem security environment. Second, nuclear security guarantees are not credible without the stationing of conventional forces[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{theories}} of the policy process typically assume that policy responses tend to go through long periods of stasis alternated with occasional bursts of intense activity. The concept of policy punctuations has been put forward to denote large-scale changes in public policies {{that take place in}} crisis moments. However, research on the dynamics of policy overreaction and underreaction is still in its infancy. It has mostly focused on either small-n cross-sectional analysis of government spending or case studies of single events. A comparative assessment of the extent of disproportionate responses in a crisis is still lacking. To fill this gap, in this paper we develop a framework to conceptualize, operationalize and ultimately assess disproportionate policy responses systematically from a cross-sectional perspective. We create a series of indexes to measure policy over- and underreactions among the EU member states that experienced the 2007 – 8 banking crisis. We found that a large majority of EU countries overreacted through public liability <b>guarantee</b> <b>and</b> budget <b>commitment.</b> On the other hand, regulatory responses are characterized by a greater variation...|$|R

Analysis of the scientific literature showed that brand experience has a positive impact on the results of customer-brand relationship. Which means that whenever a brand is correctly developing its brand experience, customer starts to trust the brand and attaches to it until becomes loyal. The empirical research in the case of “Audimas” brand, substantiates earlier researches and their results. Therefore, the results of correlation and regression analysis allow to state, that “Audimas” brand, while developing positive brand-experience creates customer relationship <b>and</b> <b>guarantees</b> the long duration of it.

Through a survey of customers of legal services providers in Malaysia, data were collected. Results from a standard analysis of data show that the four dimensions of ethical marketing norms contribute significantly and explain a significant amount of variance in RQ <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> The results further show that three dimensions of ethical norms namely price and distribution norm, information and contract norm, and general honesty and integrity norm are significantly associated with relationship quality <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> Product <b>and</b> promotion norm has no significant relationship with relationship quality <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> RQ plays a mediating role in the relationship between marketing norms <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> The study reveals that the same three dimensions of marketing norms predict both RQ <b>and</b> <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> are useful for effective legal services marketing.

According to traditional game theory, Prisoner’s dilemma, no or more than one Nash equilibrium games are situations {{that are difficult to}} find such a satisfactory solution. In human society, it often involves a trusted third party in the negotiation process among agents to ensure the cooperation <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> of agents. In this paper, we describe how the trusted third party can be involved in the negotiation of multi-agent coordination to deal with many difficult game situations. We introduce two communication actions into the traditional game-theoretical reasoning: asking <b>guarantee</b> <b>and</b> offering compensation for agents to use in negotiation. Asking <b>guarantee</b> from agents <b>and</b> depositing it at the trusted third party can ensure the agents to keep their commitments, while offering compensation can allow finding a fair and compromised solution for all agents. We show how the negotiation communication protocols can be proceeded using these two communication actions to reach a compromised and stable agreement in all different game situations...|$|R

The mail-in survey questionnaire included three measures, the Supervisory Behavior Description, the Teacher Job Satisfaction, <b>and</b> the Organizational <b>Commitment,</b> with a demographic form. This study found that the U. S. teachers had much higher levels of job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> than the Chinese teachers. U.

Positive relationships between the consideration leadership style and both job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> negative relationships between the initiating structure leadership style and both job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> were found in both countries. Further, these relationships were found to be stronger among the Chinese teachers than the U. S. teachers.
