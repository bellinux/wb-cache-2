The experiments {{were carried out}} in a tilting flume 250 mm wide and 12 · 5 m long with glass-sides of rectan-gular cross-section and artificial dune shaped floor that was made from Plexi-glass. Steady flow of clear as against sediment-laden water with different flow depths and velocities were studied in the experiments with a fine sand (d 50 = 0 · 5 mm). The {{results indicate that the}} transport of fine particles (d 50 = 0 · 5 mm) can decrease the friction factor by 22 % and 24 % respectively for smooth and rough beds. Increasing the bed-load size (d 50 = 2 · 84 mm) can decrease the friction factor by 32 % and 39 % respectively for smooth and rough beds. The decrease in <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> is due to filling up of the troughs of dunes.

5000|$|Cirrhosis is a late {{stage of}} serious liver disease marked by {{inflammation}} (swelling), fibrosis (cellular hardening) and damaged membranes preventing detoxification of {{chemicals in the}} body, ending in scarring and necrosis (cell death). Between 10% to 20% of heavy drinkers will develop cirrhosis of the liver (NIAAA, 1993). Acetaldehyde {{may be responsible for}} alcohol-induced fibrosis by stimulating collagen deposition by hepatic stellate cells. The production of oxidants derived from NADPH oxi- dase and/or cytochrome P-450 2E1 and the formation of acetaldehyde-protein adducts damage the cell membrane.Symptoms include jaundice (yellowing), liver enlargement, and pain and tenderness from the structural changes in damaged liver architecture. Without total abstinence from alcohol use, cirrhosis will eventually lead to liver failure. Late complications of cirrhosis or liver failure include portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the portal vein due to the <b>increased</b> <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> through the damaged liver), coagulation disorders (due to impaired production of coagulation factors), ascites (heavy abdominal swelling due to buildup of fluids in the tissues) and other complications, including hepatic encephalopathy and the hepatorenal syndrome.Cirrhosis can also result from other causes than alcohol abuse, such as viral hepatitis and heavy exposure to toxins other than alcohol. The late stages of cirrhosis may look similar medically, regardless of cause. This phenomenon is termed the [...] "final common pathway" [...] for the disease.Fatty change and alcoholic hepatitis with abstinence can be reversible. The later stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis tend to be irreversible, but can usually be contained with abstinence for long periods of time.|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the flow resistance and flow rate in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the surgical intensive care unit and their relation with autonomic nervous modulation. Methods: Postoperative patients of lung or esophageal cancer surgery without ARDS were included as the control group (n =  11). Patients who developed ARDS after lung or esophageal cancer surgery were included as the ARDS group (n =  21). The ARDS patients were further divided into survivor and nonsurvivor subgroups according to their outcomes. All patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Results: The flow rate was significantly decreased, while the flow resistance was significantly increased, in ARDS patients. The flow rate correlated significantly and negatively with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), while the flow resistance correlated significantly and positively with PEEP in ARDS patients. Furthermore, the flow rate correlated significantly and negatively with the tidal volume-corrected normalized high-frequency power but correlated significantly and positively with the tidal volume-corrected low-/high-frequency power ratio. In contrast, the flow resistance correlated significantly and negatively with normalized very low-frequency power and tidal volume-corrected low-/high-frequency power ratio, but correlated significantly and positively with tidal volume-corrected normalized high-frequency power. Conclusion: The flow rate is decreased and the flow resistance increased in patients with ARDS. PEEP is one of the causes of <b>increased</b> <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> and decreased flow rate in patients with ARDS. Another cause of decreased flow rate and <b>increased</b> <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> in ARDS patients is the increased vagal activity and decreased sympathetic activity.

30|$|Our results {{indicate}} an interaction of metal sulfide mineral layers mainly from H 2 S corrosion {{of the steel}} pipes and CaCO 3 nucleation and crystal growth. A conceptual model of scale-fragment development addresses the relevance of two key interfaces: 1) the corrosion layer between the steel substrate and calcite scale and 2) the scale surface versus thermal fluid flow. The corrosion products constitute an attractive crystallization substrate of brittle and mechanically weak consistency. A rough carbonate scale surface tends to induce (micro) turbulences and <b>increased</b> <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> (frictional forces). These factors promote partial exfoliation, scale-fragment mobilization, and rapid clogging.

To reduce the leakage flow and heat transfer on the tip, the blades of modern gas turbines typically have a recessed cavity at the tip and are called squealer tip blades.

40|$|Elevated {{systemic}} hematocrit (Hct) increases cardiovascular risk, such as {{stroke and}} myocardial infarction. One possible pathophysiological mechanism {{could be a}} disturbance of the blood - endothelium interface. It {{has been shown that}} blood interacts with the endothelial surface via a gel-like layer ('glycocalyx', or 'endothelial surface layer - ESL') that modulates various biological processes, including inflammation, permeability, and atherosclerosis. However, consequences of an elevated Hct on the functional properties of this interface are incompletely understood. In a transgenic mouse (tg 6) model exhibiting systemic Hct levels of about 0. 85 the glycocalyx/ESL was nearly abolished. The corresponding increase in vessel diameter had only minor effects on peripheral flow resistance. This suggests that the pathological effects of elevated Hct may relate stronger to the biological corollaries of a reduced ESL thickness and alterations of the blood-endothelium interface, than to an <b>increased</b> <b>flow</b> <b>resistance...</b>|$|E

30|$|Carbon dioxide {{flooding}} is {{an effective}} means of enhanced oil recovery for low permeability reservoirs. If fractures are present in the reservoir, CO 2 may flow along the fractures, resulting in low gas displacement efficiency. Reservoir pore pressure will fluctuate to some extent during a CO 2 flood, causing a change in effective confining pressure. The result is rock deformation and a reduction in permeability with the reduction in fracture permeability, causing <b>increased</b> <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> in the fracture space. Simultaneously, gas cross flowing along the fractures is partially restrained. In this work, the effect of stress changes on permeability was studied through a series of flow experiments. The change in the flowrate distribution in a matrix block and contained fracture with an increase in effective pressure were analyzed. The results lead to an implicit comparison which shows that permeability of fractured core decreases sharply with an increase in effective confining pressure. The fracture flowrate ratio declines and the matrix flowrate ratio increases. Fracture flow will partially divert to the matrix block with the increase in effective confining pressure, improving gas displacement efficiency.|$|E

Hypertension may then be a compensatory response to a defective uteroplacental perfusion. Similar mechanisms may operate in IUGR. AIM: To compare uterine artery Doppler blood flow measurements with placental bed histology. The hypothesis was that placental bed vessel pathology plays a role for a raised <b>flow</b> <b>resistance.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: After blood flow measurements, a placental bed biopsy was taken at CS in 26 complicated (study group) and 29 uncomplicated pregnancies (control group). RESULTS: The uterine artery PI was significantly more often abnormally high in the study group compared with the control group, and also in hypertensive pregnancies compared with normotensive IUGR pregnancies. Physiological vessel changes were found in all controls but were absent in 76 % of study cases. Physiological changes were significantly more often absent in SGA than in AGA newborns. Absence of physiological changes were significantly more often found in cases with an abnormally high PI. DISCUSSION: The results link together circulatory and structural pathophysiological changes of the uteroplacental unit. A defective physiological conversion of the spiral arteries was associated with an <b>increased</b> uterine <b>flow</b> <b>resistance.</b> CONCLUSION: This study gave further support for the existence of a triad of defective placental bed vessel maturation, <b>increased</b> uteroplacental <b>flow</b> <b>resistance,</b> and hypertension...|$|R

Physically, this layer is highly negatively charged [24], which interact with the moving plasma (treated as an electrolyte). Thus, {{the presence of the}} glycocalyx would possibly cause an <b>increase</b> in <b>flow</b> <b>resistance.</b> Pries and co-workers [39] reported that the glycocalyx layer is capable to impede plasma flow, which is probably due to high negative charge. However, Sugihara-Seki and Fu [40] suggested that the <b>increase</b> in <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> would be negligible if the glycocalyx is thin compared to the vessel diameter. Several electron microscopy studies [41] indicate the presence of the glycocalyx in the human blood vessel with a thickness of less than 100 nm, which is much thinner than the studied artery diameter (0.4 cm). The exact interaction [42] of magnetic particles with the endothelial lining is much more complicated than such a simple boundary condition does justice to. However, Haverkort and colleagues [2] showed that specific boundary conditions did not strongly influence the results. Therefore, in the present simulation, the particles were assumed to elastically collide with the arterial wall during the motion in the blood stream.|$|R
