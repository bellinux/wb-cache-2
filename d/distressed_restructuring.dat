The study finds that troubled banking corporations displayed evidence of both financial and operating problems simultaneously, so that financial distress appears to be linked to operating stress in the majority of instances observed. However, operating problems (as reflected, for example, in production inefficiencies and expense-control problems) tended to be of longer duration than corporate financial problems, suggesting that either financial stress tends to be easier to address or is subject to more rapid resolution than are corporate operating problems. Relief from corporate stress in the banking sector appears to be accompanied by accelerated growth in total assets, reduced debt financing costs, a strengthening of liquid asset positions, strengthening of customer loan performance, greater employment of junior-priority and shorter-term debt, and reduced dividends on common stock...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the ways in}} which financially distressed firms try to avoid bankruptcy through public and private debt restructurings, asset sales, mergers, and capital expenditure reductions. Their main finding is that a firm's debt structure affects the way financially <b>distressed</b> firms <b>restructure.</b> The combination of secured private debt and numerous public debt issues seems to impede out-of-court restructurings and increases the probability of a Chapter 11 filing.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the market impact of restructuring announcements made by distressed firms in China. We show that ownership structure {{is an important}} determinant {{of the strength of}} firms and their survival following distress. For example, mergers and acquisitions are value-enhancing only for competitive firms that are privately owned and when cash payment is involved. Mergers and acquisitions among state-owned enterprises by transferring the controlling ownership, either with or without payment, are not value-enhancing. Also, debt governance is not at work among state-owned enterprises and thus debt-related restructuring is not value-enhancing either. Asset sales are not perceived positively by the market either for competitive or for state-owned firms. This is due to the regulatory environment and lack of effective bankruptcy threat in China; avoiding bankruptcy costs does not add value when bankruptcy is not a powerful threat. The fundamental conclusion is that government ownership has an adverse impact on the distress-resolution process as it distorts resource allocation, management incentives and investment decisions in a liberalised and competitive environment.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{beneficial}} economic consequences and market and accounting based valuation effects of troubled debt restructurings (TDR) in financially distressed debtor firms. Relying on {{the implications of}} prior research and extant valuation theories, some empirical evidence on the beneficial outcomes and informativeness of TDR is first provided: significantly positive restructuring interval excess returns and higher excess returns to subsequently consummated restructurings and subsequent survivors. The market reaction to “full-settlement” and “modification of terms” types of TDR are also measured to evaluate {{the consistency of the}} FASB's binary classification and recognition criteria with the market participants' assessments. Finally, a valuation model conditional on book values and earnings is used to test the value relevance of the reported financial statement bottom lines and TDR related disclosure. The findings suggest that modifications are at least as beneficial and informative as full settlements. Hence, the recognition of the reduction in the liability and the related gain in the financial statements of firms that undertake modifications would be more congruent with the valuation effects assessed by market participants.

This is the first empirical study to examine the performance of Japanese firms that experienced out-of-court restructuring in Japan from January 1990, when the bubble economy burst, to March 2005, when the Koizumi Cabinet declared the bad debt problems of major firms to be resolved. Our results show that important biases permitted deeply unprofitable firms to survive in Japan. This finding is similar to research by Hotchkiss (1995), who analyzed post-restructuring performance in the United States. We also find that out-of-court restructurings of troubled firms in Japan were less effective in improving profitability than restructurings under Chapter 11 in the United States.

40|$|The {{literature}} on debt restructuring usually assumes that banks {{behave in a}} uniform way towards firms in distress. Using {{a recent survey of}} Italian banks, we show that banks follow different strategies when they decide whether {{to take part in the}} workout process, in that some of them do restructure their debt claims towards small and medium-sized enterprises in distress, while others do not. We explain this heterogeneity by considering the role of banksÂ’ internal organization and lending technologies, which the literature has shown to be strictly tied to the type of relationship developed with the borrower (transactional versus relationship lending). We find that the probability of debt restructuring is higher when the bank: i) is geographically closer to borrowing firms; ii) relies more on soft than hard information; and iii) adopts a decentralized structure with more power allocated to local managers. However there are important complementarities among organizational variables: the adoption of credit scoring increases the likelihood of restructuring if banks also use these techniques systematically in the monitoring process and if they adopt more decentralized structures. Bank size per se is not able to fully explain this heterogeneous behaviour, as organizational forms and lending technologies may also have important consequences on bank decisions. financial <b>distress,</b> debt <b>restructuring,</b> small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), bank heterogeneity, bank organization, lending technologies. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine two {{contrasting}} financially distressed companies in China and their restructuring strategies. Chinese firms are selected as providing a context where bankruptcy law is in its infancy and where the state is still heavily involved as a shareholder. As a result, the process of <b>distressed</b> company <b>restructuring</b> is likely to differ markedly from that observed in developed economies. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts a case study methodology to explore on an in-depth basis the features of the distress resolution process in the Chinese institutional context and to investigate how it differs from the process in more developed economies. The paper analyses the firms' accounting-based performance to understand the nature of their difficulties. It then examines the complex restructuring procedures initiated and uses an event study approach to evaluate the stock market's reaction to these strategies. Findings – The distinguishing features of the Chinese restructuring process are as follows. First, the assets of distressed firms are sometimes transferred without payment being made in return. Second, social considerations play a role, in particular the state's need to maintain employment levels or ensure the funding of redundancy payments. Finally, firms can remain in severe financial distress for extended periods of time; possible reasons for this are explored in the paper. Originality/value – The existing distress literature focuses on developed economies such as the USA and the UK. The paper provides an in-depth understanding of the special features of the Chinese situation, including the role of government and other more commercially driven shareholders; the subsequent importance of social policy issues; the protracted and complex nature of the restructurings; and the frequent use of mergers, share transfers, asset swaps and asset sales.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} one of the first studies to empirically examine the nature and source of {{financial}} distress, and the valuation effect of <b>distressed</b> companies' <b>restructuring</b> announcements, in an emerging market context. By describing and comparing the Chinese bankruptcy code with those of seven other countries, I find that the government's political interests and intervention, aggravated by the country's weak enforcement mechanism, result in the formal procedures rarely being used in practice. Consequently, the threat of bankruptcy is weakened and creditor protection is limited. These issues are confirmed by my empirical analysis. My empirical studies are separated into two distinct themes: China as a whole compared with what is documented in the literature; and within China state owned enterprises (SOE) versus non-SOE. Firstly, I analyse operating and financial performance and operating efficiency for 100 firms that became distressed between 1999 and 2003. I find that during the first year of distress, the main source of distress is economic, not financial. In addition, for a significant minority of firms, financial factor plays a greater role in causing cash flow shortfall prior to the onset of distress. For this reason, I believe that due to the lack of timely <b>restructuring</b> mechanism, financial <b>distress</b> leads to economic distress. My SOE versus non-SOE results suggest that "soft budget constraints" are widespread among SOEs. However, such lending bias towards SOEs does not save these SOEs from being distressed. The deliberate channeling of funds to inefficient uses results in the distortion of capital allocation. Secondly, I investigate the valuation effect of restructuring announcements made by 100 firms. Comparing to the literature, I find that asset restructuring including mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and asset sales are more frequently employed. It is the most popular strategy in my sample. In the light of difficulties in officially liquidating economically unviable firms in the Chinese context, mergers and asset sales are perhaps a market selfcorrection mechanism to ensure asset mobility, which is essential for the effective operation of an enterprise economy. Consistent with the general M&A literature, M&A creates value for the target firm shareholders. In addition, asset sales are not perceived positively by the market. A potential explanation is that the lack of bankruptcy threat in China minimises the potential benefit of avoiding bankruptcy costs which shareholders otherwise have to bear. In my SOE versus non-SOE study, M&A with payment strategy is effective only for the non-SOE firms. On the contrary, the government's attempt to revamp SOE performance by transferring the controlling ownership, either with or without payment, is not seen as effective by the market. My results also suggest that debt governance is not at work among SOEs and this affects the effectiveness of debt related restructuring. The fundamental conclusion is that government ownership has an adverse impact on the distress-resolution process as it distorts resource allocation, management incentives and investment decisions. An effective bankruptcy regime should be more independent from politically motivated government intervention...|$|R
40|$|In {{those living}} with chronic {{hepatitis}} C (CHC), co-morbid {{depression and anxiety}} are highly prevalent (el-Serag, Kunik, Richardson, & Rabeneck, 2002), leading to diminished quality of life (Häuser, Zimmer, Schiedermaier, & Grandt, 2004), exacerbated physical symptoms (Morasco et al., 2010), increased functional impairment (Dwight et al., 2000), and poorer anti-viral treatment outcomes (Zanini, Covolo, Donato, & Lanzini, 2010). However, there is a dearth of research exploring this co-morbidity {{and how best to}} assess and manage it. This body of work aimed to address this gap in the literature in conducting the four studies comprising this thesis. Study one assessed the acceptability of various mental health treatment options through a postal survey of South Australian CHC outpatients and an online survey of Australians living with CHC in the community. This study found that individual psychotherapy was the most acceptable treatment, followed by bibliotherapy, pharmacotherapy, online therapy, and group psychotherapy. The most important predictor of the acceptability of a treatment was past satisfaction with use of that treatment modality. Study two assessed the progression of depression and anxiety symptoms over a course of between two and five years. This was conducted in a sub-sample of CHC outpatients who responded to the survey used in study one and were also participants of a previous study assessing the prevalence and predictors of depression and anxiety (Stewart et al., 2012). This study reported a worsening of depression and anxiety over time. Baseline anxiety was the most prominent predictor of future depressive and anxious symptomatology. Study three examined changes in self-reported rates of mental health problems and service use in regular injecting drug users in the 2006 and 2012 Illicit Drug Reporting System surveys conducted by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, over half of whom reported also having CHC. This study found that while the rates of self-reported problems increased significantly, there was an accompanying decrease in service use (albeit with a proportional increase in the use of psychologists). Study four involved the development of a treatment protocol entitled “C-UP: A Unified Program for people with hepatitis C to manage depression and anxiety. ” A transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural therapy approach was chosen as it has the promise of treating co-morbid depression and anxiety simultaneously, a clinical presentation which is common in people with CHC (el-Serag et al., 2002; Navinés et al., 2012; Stewart et al., 2012). C-UP involves five components which cover psychoeducation, acceptance of <b>distressing</b> emotions, cognitive <b>restructuring,</b> behavioural activation and graded exposure, and relapse prevention. Informal feedback from clinical psychologists, CHC workers, and those living with CHC was overwhelmingly positive. However, a randomised controlled trial and qualitative research is needed to more rigorously assess the efficacy and acceptability, respectively, of C-UP. When considering the deleterious effects of co-morbid depression and anxiety, it is apparent that a comprehensive and targeted approach on a policy and practice level is needed. While this approach has been lacking to date, it is anticipated that this thesis will lead to an increased focus on the assessment and management of co-morbid depression and anxiety in research, policy, and clinical practice.
