5|$|Rough {{grassland}} {{with false}} oat-grass, Yorkshire fog, yarrow, cat's ear, with bracken {{at the south}} end. There is an uneven hedge of hawthorn and buckthorn. The sunny south-west aspect encourages butterflies including holly blue, <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> and small skipper.|$|E
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green hairstreak, brown argus and <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper.</b> Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E
500|$|The male Lulworth skipper has a {{wingspan}} of , and {{the female}} 25 to 28mm. This makes it one of Britain's smallest butterflies and, in Europe, the smallest member of the Thymelicus genus. Of Britain's five [...] "golden" [...] skippers—the others being the silver-spotted skipper (Hesperia comma), large skipper (Ochlodes sylvanus), small skipper (Thymelicus sylvestris) and <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus lineola)—the Lulworth is both the smallest and darkest. Beyond its small size, it is distinguished particularly by its dark, dun-coloured wings that appear with tinges of olive-brown; this darkening especially apparent in males.|$|E
5000|$|Ochlodes sylvanus has a {{wingspan}} of 28-32 mm. Although called [...] "large" [...] this {{is still}} a relatively small butterfly and not much larger than either the small or <b>Essex</b> <b>skippers.</b> The body is rather squat. The antennae are hooked at their tips. The upperside of the wings is orange-brown with a brown border and some lighter spots. The underside of the hindwings is greenish-yellow, marked with sparse yellow spots. The male has a broad scented androconial dark line {{across the top of the}} forewings. On the hindwings of the females there are brighter square marks. When the wings are opened, the forewings are obliquely folded, masking the hindwings.|$|R
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in strings on the stems of grasses where they remain over the winter. The <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper's</b> favoured foodplant is cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata), and it rarely uses the small skipper's favoured foodplant Yorkshire fog. Essex skippers' other foods include {{creeping}} soft grass (Holcus mollis), couch grass (Elymus repens), timothy-grass (Phleum pratense), meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum) and tor-grass (Brachypodium pinnatum). This skipper's caterpillars emerge {{in the spring and}} feed until June before forming shelters from leaves tied with silk {{at the base of the}} foodplant to pupate. Adults fly from July through August. Like most skippers, they are fairly strictly diurnal, though individuals are very rarely encountered during the night.|$|R
50|$|With a {{wingspan}} of 2.5 to 2.9 cm, it is {{very similar}} in appearance to the small skipper Thymelicus sylvestris. They can be told apart by the undersides of the tips of their antennae: the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper's</b> antennae are black, whereas those of the small skipper are orange. This butterfly occurs {{throughout much of the}} Palaearctic region. Its range is from southern Scandinavia through Europe to North Africa and east to Central Asia It was only identified in the UK in 1889, and its range is expanding both in England and in northern Europe. In North America, this butterfly was accidentally introduced in 1910 via London, Ontario and has spread across southern Canada and into several northern US states.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus lineola) is a {{butterfly}} in family Hesperiidae. In North America, {{it is known}} as the European skipper.|$|E
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} loosely inside grass sheaths of the {{caterpillars}} food plants from July to August. The newly hatched caterpillars eat their own eggshell before entering hibernation individually in a protective cocoon of a grass sheath sealed with silk. In the spring the caterpillar begins feeding. The favoured food plant is Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), although other recorded food plants include timothy (Phleum pratense), {{creeping soft grass}} (Holcus mollis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis) and cock's foot (Dactylis glomerata). The caterpillars pupate near {{the base of the}} food plant in June with the first adults on the wing at the end of June, a week or two before the first <b>Essex</b> <b>skippers.</b> They are strongly attracted to purple flowers such as thistles and knapweeds.|$|R
25|$|The AIF played {{many of its}} {{first-class}} {{matches in}} England over three days although the County Championship that year consisted (for the only time ever {{as it was a}} singularly unsuccessful venture) of two-day matches. AIF's first match against a county team started on 17 May at the County Ground, Leyton, against <b>Essex</b> and <b>skipper</b> Charlie Kelleway with 126 made the team's first century. Gregory with seven wickets in the match gave notice of his potential. AIF won inside two days by an innings and 114 runs against a team led by England captain Johnny Douglas who could only contribute 0 and 14.|$|R
50|$|Species seen include Water Vole, Water Shrew, Banded Demoiselle, Dragon fly, Common Blue, <b>Essex</b> <b>Skipper,</b> Purple Hairstreak, White Admiral, Emperor Moth, Rosy Footman, Elephant Hawk-moth.|$|E
50|$|Its seeds can be {{dispersed}} by {{wildlife and}} humans. The caterpillars of some Lepidoptera {{use it as}} a foodplant, e.g. the chequered skipper (Carterocephalus palaemon) and the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus lineola).|$|E
5000|$|The {{caterpillars}} of some Lepidoptera {{use it as}} a foodplant, e.g. the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus lineola). It is {{also one}} of the most important host grasses for Auchenorrhyncha in central Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} of some lepidopterans {{use it as}} a foodplant, e.g. the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus lineola). Additionally, male mosquitoes {{can often}} be found on this flower drinking the nectar out of it.|$|E
50|$|It has a rusty orange colour to the wings, {{upper body}} and {{the tips of the}} antennae. The body is silvery white below and it has a {{wingspan}} of 25-30 mm. This butterfly is very similar in appearance to the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus lineola). In the small skipper, the undersides of the tips of the antennae are yellow orange, whereas they are black in the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper.</b> The black area on the lower edge of the upper wings also differs. Like the other orange grass skippers the male has a distinctive black stripe made up of scent scales.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} of some Lepidoptera {{use it as}} a food plant, e.g. the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus lineola) and the {{marbled white}} (Melanargia galathea). It also grows in roadsides and abandoned fields but generally requires nutrient-rich soils.|$|E
5000|$|The club {{came into}} {{existence}} on December 8, 1955 {{at a meeting in}} the <b>Essex</b> <b>Skipper</b> pub in Harlow. Founder members included; Alexander J McCowan, Dr John Huntley, Ron Bracewell, Ron Strudwick, Ron Parkin, Derek Jennings and Eric Jones.|$|E

50|$|The foliage is an {{important}} forage grass for many grazing mammals. The seeds are eaten by several species of grassland birds, particularly buntings and finches. The caterpillars of some Lepidoptera {{use it as a}} foodplant, e.g. the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus lineola).|$|E
50|$|The marshes contain {{several species}} of insect with a {{restricted}} distribution in the London area such as the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> butterfly Thymelicus lineola, an uncommon Parasite fly Ligeria angusticornis, a pyralid moth Shoeribius micronellus and the sporadic breeding by the nationally endangered marsh warbler.|$|E
50|$|Holcus lanatus in {{its natural}} habitat is a food source for {{butterflies}} such as the speckled wood, the wall, and especially the small skipper. It is rarely utilized by the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper.</b> In its native range it may occur in plant associations such as the Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow habitat.|$|E
5000|$|Aldbury Nowers is a 19.7 hectare {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) north-east of Tring in Hertfordshire.

50|$|An insect {{survey found}} {{a wide variety}} of unusual insects, {{including}} rare solitary wasps. The site has a notable variety of grasshoppers and crickets. The most notable find was a rare species of chafer beetle last seen in Britain in the 1950s in Cheshire. Lesser stag beetles are common and volunteers are encouraging the Great stag beetle by building loggeries. Site volunteers leave logs in place to provide habitats for insects and fungi. A fine insect house has been built to provide winter homes for insects such as Ladybirds, Lacewings & Butterflies. There are also Bee nesting boxes. Butterflies include Peacock, Comma, Meadow brown, Small heath, Small skipper, <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper,</b> Green veined, Large and Small white, Small copper, Brimstone, Holly blue, Common blue, Speckled wood and Gatekeeper. Amongst moths Narrow-bordered Beehawk moth and Burnet moth have been recorded. An unwelcome recent arrival has been the Harlequin ladybird, which is a threat to native ladybird species. A spectacular new arrival {{in recent years has been}} the Wasp spider. Yellow meadow ants make distinctive mounds in the meadow.|$|E
40|$|One {{predicted}} {{impact of}} climate change is a poleward shift in the boundaries of species ranges. Existingmethods for identifying such a boundary shift based on changes in the observed pattern of occupancy within a grid of cells are sensitive {{to changes in the}} overall rate of sightings and their latitudinal distribution that are unconnected to a boundary shift. A formal test for a boundary shift is described that allows for such changes. The test is applied to detect northward shifts in the northern boundary of the <b>Essex</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus lineola) butterfly and the European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) in Great Britain. A shift is detected in the latter case but not in the former. Results from a simulation study are presented showing that the test performs well...|$|E
