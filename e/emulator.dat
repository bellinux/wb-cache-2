5000|$|A related {{conjecture}} by Michael Fellows, now solved, concerns planar <b>emulators,</b> a {{generalization of}} planar covers that maps graph neighborhoods surjectively rather than bijectively. The graphs with planar <b>emulators,</b> like those with planar covers, are closed under minors and Y-Î” transforms. In 1988, independently of Negami, Fellows conjectured that the graphs with planar <b>emulators</b> {{are exactly the}} graphs that can be embedded into the projective plane. The conjecture is true for regular <b>emulators,</b> coming from automomorphisms of the underlying covering graph, by a result analogous to the result of [...] for regular planar covers.However, several of the 32 connected forbidden minors for projective-planar graphs {{turn out to have}} planar <b>emulators.</b> Therefore, Fellows' conjecture is false. Finding a full set of forbidden minors for the existence of planar <b>emulators</b> remains an open problem.|$|R
5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer {{in a corner of}} the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse <b>emulator</b> in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E

Terry Myerson stated that this move would enable the production of Qualcomm Snapdragon-based Windows devices with cellular connectivity and improved power efficiency over Intel-compatible devices, and still capable of running the majority of existing Windows software (unlike the previous Windows RT, which was restricted to Windows Store apps). Microsoft is initially targeting this project towards laptops.|$|E

More modern recreations of the game for computers have been made as well. An emulated version of the original game, based on the original source code made publicly available by Martin Graetz and running in a JavaScript PDP-1 <b>emulator,</b> was made available to play on the internet in 2012.

5|$|On 17 February 1997, the W3C {{approved}} Yggdrasil {{to coordinate}} future development of Arena.

Yggdrasil licensed an X <b>emulator</b> from Pearl Software to port Arena to Windows, although these builds were never released. Yggdrasil didn't provide any official binaries at this time, because they didn't want to expand the community with alpha-quality software. Although users would be able to run Arena by compiling it from the published source code, volunteers created unofficial finished binaries. Yggdrasil had planned to implement browsing features that were already standard in competitive web browsers, which resulted in the new bookmarks feature in version 0.3.18 on 7 April 1997.|$|E

On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S, an edition of Windows 10 designed for low-end mobile devices targeting the education market (which have led critics to compare the product line to Chrome OS). Similarly to Windows RT, it restricts software installation to applications obtained via Windows Store, but it may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to remove these restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than trying}} to release the game {{in tandem with the}} movie, Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper made sure to give the {{developers}} as much time as they needed to finish the game. GoldenEye 007 was developed through two and a half years, the first year of which was spent developing the engine and producing art assets. The game was released on a 96Mb cartridge on 25 August 1997, nearly two years after the film. Additionally, every cartridge of the game contains a fully functional ZX Spectrum <b>emulator</b> with ten Rare developed games. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare staff and was deactivated in the final build of the game, but has since been unlocked through fan-made patches.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Cascade Games founded in 1983 by Guy Wilhelmy and Nigel Stevens. Wilhelmy had a pilot's license and had experience with aircraft control and responsiveness, while Stevens' father had been in British Royal Air Force. Wilhelmy explained {{that he wanted to}} create a fast-paced flying game with responsive graphics that other games of the time struggled with. Cascade hired programmer Ian Martin and graphics designer Damon Redmond to work on the project in 1985. The first version known as A.C.E.: Air Combat <b>Emulator</b> was released in 1985 for the Commodore 16 and VIC-20 home computers. Martin describes that an advertisement erroneously promising a Plus/4 version forced them to develop it under threat of action by Advertising Standards Agency.|$|E
40|$|Many model based {{scientific}} and engineering methodologies, such as system identification, sensitivity analysis, optimization and control, require {{a large number}} of model evaluations. In particular, model based real-time control of urban water infrastructures and online flood alarm systems require fast prediction of the network response at different actuation and/or parameter values. General purpose urban drainage simulators are too slow for this application. Fast surrogate models, so-called <b>emulators,</b> provide a solution to this efficiency demand. <b>Emulators</b> are attractive, because they sacrifice unneeded accuracy in favor of speed. However, they have to be fine-tuned to predict the system behavior satisfactorily. Also, some <b>emulators</b> fail to extrapolate the system behavior beyond the training set. Although, there are many strategies for developing <b>emulators,</b> up until now the selection of the emulation strategy remains subjective. In this paper, we therefore compare the performance of two families of <b>emulators</b> for open channel flows in the context of urban drainage simulators. We compare <b>emulators</b> that explicitly use knowledge of the simulator's equations, i. e. mechanistic <b>emulators</b> based on Gaussian Processes, with purely data-driven <b>emulators</b> using matrix factorization. Our results suggest that in many urban applications, naive data-driven emulation outperforms mechanistic emulation. Nevertheless, we discuss scenarios in which we think that mechanistic emulation might be favorable for i) extrapolation in time and ii) dealing with sparse and unevenly sampled data. We also provide many references to advances in the field of Machine Learning that have not yet permeated into the Bayesian environmental science community.
