5|$|Most park {{visitors}} stay {{just for}} the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a US$25-30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season. Traffic congestion in the valley <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> during peak season, in summer. A free shuttle bus system operates year-round in the valley, and park rangers encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.|$|E
5|$|Poaching <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> in the country, {{particularly}} of elephants for the profitable ivory industry {{and a threat}} to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds {{in and around the}} parks by organized poaching. The problem is worsened {{by the fact that the}} parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E

25|$|Abuse of {{benzodiazepine}} drugs <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> in North America. The {{most frequently}} abused of the benzodiazepines {{in both the}} United States and Canada are alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam and diazepam.|$|E
50|$|Although sand theft {{does not}} seem to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> at first, it <b>is</b> {{nonetheless}} <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> as the removal of sand facilitates soil salinisation. For example, in Cape Verde, the theft of sand has caused the soil to salinify to such a degree, {{that a large number of}} orchards were permanently destroyed in the process.|$|R

25|$|According to the World Bank's {{worldwide}} governance indicators, government corruption <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> Historically weak {{institutions and}} an often ineffective and politicized judicial system make rooting out corruption in any systemic fashion difficult.|$|E
25|$|Women's groups {{reported}} that prostitutes encountered discrimination when seeking free medical care. Trafficking of {{women for the}} purpose of prostitution <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem,</b> and it is known that international criminal groups and mafias are involved in this activity.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} {{overpopulation}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> and some question {{the fairness of}} what they feel amount to subsidies for having children, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (US), free K–12 education paid for by all taxpayers, family medical leave, and other such programs.|$|E

50|$|Software piracy <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem,</b> and Potter's {{royalties}} shrank. In 1982 Potter moved onto IBM PC development. He {{continued to}} develop Atari software as well, publishing under other labels.|$|R
25|$|Deforestation, {{with its}} devastating {{environmental}} consequences, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> Deforestation accelerates soil erosion, decreases {{the amount of}} recharge to aquifers by increasing surface runoff, damages barrier reefs and ecosystems, increases turbidity which affects mangroves, decreases agricultural production, and causes increased maintenance of water infrastructure. Decades of land abuse and environmental neglect exacerbated the devastation of Hurricane Mitch (1998), where deforestation played a major role.|$|E
25|$|TCA {{overdose}} is {{a significant}} cause of fatal drug poisoning. The severe morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs is well documented due to their cardiovascular and neurological toxicity. Additionally, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> in the pediatric population due to their inherent toxicity {{and the availability of}} these in the home when prescribed for bed-wetting and depression. In the event of a known or suspected overdose, medical assistance should be sought immediately.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} and its security forces, often considered to suffer from rampant corruption, {{have been responsible for}} torture, inhumane treatment, and extrajudicial executions. There are arbitrary arrests of citizens, especially in the south, as well as arbitrary searches of homes. Prolonged pretrial detention <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem,</b> and judicial corruption, inefficiency, and executive interference undermine due process. Freedom of speech, the press, and religion are all restricted. Journalists critical of the government are often harassed and threatened by the police. Homosexuality is illegal, punishable by death.|$|E
50|$|The area {{is one of}} Kenya's poorest {{with clean}} water lacking and poor infrastructure, {{including}} the roads. Since children work, a significant number never go to school. Infectious diseases <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|R

25|$|Lack {{of access}} to {{financial}} services <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> {{for the majority of}} the population, particularly in the densely populated rural areas: only 2% of the total population holds bank accounts, and fewer than 0.5% use bank lending services. Microfinance, however, plays a larger role, with 4% of Burundians being members of microfinance institutions – a larger share of the population than that reached by banking and postal services combined. 26 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer savings, deposits and short- to medium-term credit. Dependence of the sector on donor assistance is limited.|$|E
25|$|Deep or {{superficial}} wound infection has {{an approximate}} incidence of 2%. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> as superficial infection {{may lead to}} deep infection. This may cause infection of the healing bone and contamination of the implants. It is difficult to eliminate infection {{in the presence of}} metal foreign bodies such as implants. Bacteria inside the implants are inaccessible to the body's defence system and to antibiotics. The management is to attempt to suppress the infection with drainage and antibiotics until the bone is healed. Then the implant should be removed, following which the infection may clear up.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{violence}} in Argentina against women <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> Rape, including spousal rape, is a crime, but {{the need for}} proof, either {{in the form of}} clear physical injury or the testimony of a witness, often presented difficulties in prosecuting such crimes. In August 2008 Amnesty International reported that a woman died every two days as a result of domestic violence. According to press reports quoting the Buenos Aires Provincial Ministry of Security statistics, 52,351 complaints of domestic abuse were filed at the Women's Police Stations in Buenos Aires Province in the first 10 months of the year.|$|E

25|$|Long-term use and {{benzodiazepine}} dependence <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> {{in the elderly}}. Failure {{to treat}} benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can cause serious medical complications. The elderly have less cognitive reserve and are {{more sensitive to the}} short (e.g., in between dose withdrawal) and protracted withdrawal effects of benzodiazepines, as well as the side-effects both from short-term and long-term use. This can lead to excessive contact with their doctor. Research has found that withdrawing elderly people from benzodiazepines leads to a significant reduction in doctor visits per year, it is presumed, due to an elimination of drug side-effects and withdrawal effects.|$|E
25|$|Pollution {{problems}} in the borough stem from the urbanization of the area. Traffic congestion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> and parking space is severely lacking. Much of the pollution in the borough comes from fixed sources along Avenida Tláhuac. Canal and lake waters have moderate problems with pollution {{in the way of}} garbage and the infestation of non-native water lily plants. The borough generates 356 tons of trash per day, 3.12% of what is produced in the Federal District. There are thirty areas where there is illegal house building, mostly near the Sierra de Santa Catarina and around San Juan Ixtayopan and La Conchita.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{contamination}} of the groundwater in Bangladesh <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> Prior to the 1970s, Bangladesh {{had one of the}} highest infant mortality rates in the world. Ineffective water purification and sewage systems as well as periodic monsoons and flooding exacerbated these problems. As a solution, UNICEF and the World Bank advocated the use of wells to tap into deeper groundwater. Millions of wells were constructed as a result. Because of this action, infant mortality and diarrheal illness were reduced by fifty percent. However, with over 8 million wells constructed, approximately one in five of these wells is now contaminated with arsenic above the government's drinking water standard.|$|E
