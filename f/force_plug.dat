40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide ‘semi-quantitative’ or ‘rigorous’ definitions of the fluidity, lubricity and compactibility requirements of formulation for representative dosator and dosing disc capsule filling machines. To that end, model formulations were developed for those properties using Carr's compressibility index, ejection force, and plug breaking force at a specified compression force to gauge fluidity, lubricity, and compactibility, respectively. These formulations were each encapsulated on an Hofliger-Karg GKF- 400 dosing disc machine and a Zanasi LZ- 64 dosator machine. Each machine was instrumented to measure plug compression and ejection forces. The encapsulation process was evaluated for %CV of fill-weight, ejection <b>force,</b> <b>plug</b> breaking force and the dissolution of marker drugs incorporated in the formulations. The f 2 metric was used to compare dissolution profiles. The results suggest: (1) formulations should meet different flow criteria for successful encapsulation on the two machines, (2) a relatively lower level of lubricant may be sufficient for the dosing disc machine, (3) a higher degree of formulation compactibility is needed for the dosator machine, and (4) transferring formulations between these machine types (same class, different subclass per FDA's SUPAC-IR/MR Manufacturing Equipment Addendum) could be challenging. In certain cases dissolution profiles for the same formulation filled on the two machines with equivalent compression force were different based on f 2 < 50. Overall, the results of this study suggest a range of formulation characteristics appropriate for transferring formulations between these two types of machines...|$|E

40|$|Based {{on direct}} {{numerical}} simulations of the coupled {{motion of particles}} and fluid, this study analyzes the collective hydrodynamic and colloidal effects of flowing microparticles during the formation of different 3 D clogging patterns at a pore entrance. Simulations of flowing suspensions through a pore with various simulation conditions show that particle concentration and surface interactions {{play a major role}} on the occurrence of the bridging phenomenon (simultaneous adhesion of many particles). In the absence of DLVO repulsive <b>forces,</b> <b>plugging</b> is characterized by the temporal reduction of the bulk permeability when increasing the volume fraction of the flowing suspension up to 20 %. Under these conditions, different structures of particle aggregates (from cluster to cake plug) are formed at the pore entrance yielding different evolution of hydrodynamic resistance to the flow. Taking into account DLVO repulsive forces in simulations for a particle concentration equal to 10 %, we observe the transition from dendritic structures (for low repulsion) to dense aggregates (for high repulsion). At high DLVO repulsive forces, the scenario of pore clogging is controlled by the collective behavior of many interacting particles. It leads to the formation of a jamming phase (Wigner glass phase) with transient clusters of interacting particles at the pore entrance. The network of jammed particles collapses when the force chains among the particles is overcame by the flow stress. The build-up and the collapse of the jammed phase at the pore entrance induce temporal permeability fluctuations. According to the relative magnitude of particle-particle and particle wall interactions, when the jammed phase is disorganized by the flow, the residual force in the network can accelerate particles and lead to particle adhesion at the wall inducing a pore blockage and a rapid reduction of the bulk permeability...|$|R

An 8P8C crimp die-set usually looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug.

40|$|Unlike the inner-membrane, the outer-membrane of Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{cannot be}} energised by a proton gradient and the periplasmic space is absent of ATP. This poses {{a significant problem}} for active processes such as transport against concentration gradients. TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) are a class of outer-membrane proteins responsible for the scavenging and import of scarce metallo-organic complexes from the environment. They are structurally characterized by a 22 -stranded β-barrel with the lumen occluded by an N-terminal globular ‘plug’ domain which contains a conserved binding motif known as the Ton box. Upon substrate binding, the Ton box becomes exposed to the periplasmic space where it forms a non-covalent complex with the C-terminus of a cytoplasmic membrane protein, TonB. The transport process requires energy from a proton motive force coupled with an inner membrane complex TonB-ExbB-ExbD. Regardless of a wealth of structural information, current models of the TonB-dependent transport mechanism are speculative. Conversely, despite no current experimental evidence, it is generally accepted that the plug domain must undergo a large conformational change facilitated by mechanical force exerted onto the Ton box tether by TonB. In this thesis, force spectroscopy, protein engineering, molecular dynamics and bacterial growth assays are used to investigate the effects of force on TonB:TBDT complexes from E. coli. These experiments demonstrate that the channel of the vitamin B 12 transporter (BtuB), reconstituted into synthetic liposome, can be opened by the application of <b>force</b> onto the <b>plug</b> domain via the non-covalent binding partner, TonB.

Press-fit stability is an important factor for good survival of the transplanted plugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 36 plugs of three different lengths were transplanted in fresh-frozen human knees. On one condyle, 3 plugs were exactly matched to the depth of the recipient site ("bottomed" plugs) and on the opposite condyle 3 plugs were 5 mm shorter than the depth of the recipient site ("unbottomed" plugs). Plugs were left protruding and then pushed in until flush, and then to 2 mm below flush level, using a loading apparatus. RESULTS: Longer <b>plugs</b> needed higher <b>forces</b> to begin displacement. At flush level, bottomed plugs needed significantly higher <b>forces</b> than unbottomed <b>plugs</b> to become displaced below flush level (mean forces of 404 N and 131 N, respectively). Shorter bottomed <b>plugs</b> required higher <b>forces</b> than longer bottomed ones. INTERPRETATION: Bottomed plugs generally provide much more stability than unbottomed ones. Short bottomed plugs are more stable than long bottomed plugs. Thus, in clinical practice it is advisable to use short bottomed plugs. If, however, unbottomed plugs are still chosen, the longer the plug the higher the resulting stability will be because of higher frictional forces...|$|R

One of them, called an "express" analysis, allows a prompt choice between different design solutions. The "air" elements, which should fill gaps between assembled conducting parts in the electromagnetic FE models, are neglected in this approach.
