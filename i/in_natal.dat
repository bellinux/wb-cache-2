It saw action with the {{battalion}} {{within a few}} days of the outbreak of the Second Boer War, at the Battle of Talana Hill on 20 October, and again at the Battle of Ladysmith on the 30th. Boer forces surrounded Ladysmith after the battle, and began a four-month siege.|$|E
5|$|Britain annexed the Voortrekkers' {{short-lived}} Natalia Republic in 1843 as the Colony of Natal. Pretorius briefly led Boer {{resistance to}} this, but before long {{most of the}} Boers <b>in</b> <b>Natal</b> had trekked back north-west to {{the area around the}} Orange and Vaal Rivers. In 1845 Kruger was a member of Potgieter's expedition to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique to negotiate a frontier with Portugal; the Lebombo Mountains were settled upon as the border between Boer and Portuguese lands. After Maria and their first child died of fever in January 1846, Kruger married her cousin Gezina du Plessis, from the Colesberg area, in 1847. Their first child, Casper Jan Hendrik, was born on 22 December that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{when the}} British {{declared}} {{war against the}} Zulu Kingdom <b>in</b> <b>Natal,</b> Gandhi at age 36, sympathised with the Zulus, and encouraged the Indian volunteers to help as an ambulance unit. He argued that Indians should participate in the war efforts to change attitudes and perceptions of the British people against the coloured people. Gandhi, a group of 20 Indians and black people of South Africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers and {{the opposite side of}} the war: Zulu victims.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the war in the Cape Colony, the Boers {{surrounded}} and laid siege to the British garrisons in the towns of Kimberley and Mafeking and destroyed the railway bridge across the Orange River at Hopetown. Substantial British reinforcements (an army corps under General Redvers Buller) arrived in South Africa and were dispersed to three main fronts. While Buller himself advanced from the port of Durban <b>in</b> <b>Natal</b> to relieve the besieged town of Ladysmith and a smaller detachment under Lieutenant General Gatacre secured the Cape Midlands, the reinforced 1st Division under Lord Methuen advanced from the Orange River to relieve Kimberley.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} known from western North America, the species was reported growing on sandy soil <b>in</b> <b>Natal</b> Dunes State Park {{in the northeastern}} Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte in 2008. The fruit bodies {{were associated with the}} roots of the native tree species Eugenia brasiliensis. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this disjunct distribution: the species may have been present before the Americas separated; it may have been introduced to Brazil by human activity, and subsequently adapted to the environment there; or the North and South American populations may represent a cryptic species complex—appearing morphologically similar but genetically distinct. The Brazilian population has not been compared genetically with North American specimens.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} impelled the Krugers' {{return to}} the highveld, where they took part in Potgieter's campaign that compelled Mzilikazi to move his people north, across the Limpopo River, to what became Matabeleland. Kruger and his father thereupon settled {{at the foot of}} the Magaliesberg mountains in the Transvaal. <b>In</b> <b>Natal</b> Andries Pretorius defeated more than 10,000 of Dingane's Zulus at the Battle of Blood River on 16 December 1838, a date subsequently marked by the Boers as Dingaansdag ("Dingane's Day") or the Day of the Vow.|$|E

5|$|Calleia {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States in November 1941. During World War II, Calleia led the Malta War Relief organization in the U.S. The house {{where he was born}} was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of Malta by the Axis powers that continued for more than two years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at U.S. military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, particularly because the tentative itinerary included Malta. On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel <b>in</b> <b>Natal,</b> Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to Tunis before going to Malta, which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in Malta as part of the exchange program between U.S. and British entertainment units.|$|E
5|$|The Second Boer War {{was fought}} from 11 October 1899 to 31 May 1902, between the British Empire {{and the two}} {{independent}} Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic). After a set of failed negotiations over foreigner land rights in the territories, led by Joseph Chamberlain, both sides issued ultimatums. When the ultimatums were rejected, war was declared. The war had three distinct phases. First, the Boers mounted pre-emptive strikes into British-held territory <b>in</b> <b>Natal</b> and the Cape Colony, besieging the British garrisons of Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley. The Boers then won a series of tactical victories against a failed British counteroffensive to relieve the three sieges. The second phase began after British forces under Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts launched counteroffensives with increased troop numbers. After Natal and the Cape Colony were secure, the British were able to invade the Transvaal and the republic's capital, Pretoria, was captured in June 1900. The third phase began in March 1900, when the Boers engaged a protracted hard-fought guerrilla warfare against the British forces. In an effort to cut off supplies to the raiders, the British, now {{under the leadership of}} Lord Kitchener, responded with a scorched earth policy of destroying Boer farms and moving civilians into concentration camps.|$|E

25|$|The Second Boer War {{between the}} United Kingdom and the allied Boer Republics, the South African Republic and the Orange Free State, broke out on 11 October 1899.
