5|$|The third {{school of}} Vedanta called the Dvaita school {{was founded by}} Madhvacharya (1199–1278 CE). It is {{regarded}} as a strongly theistic philosophic <b>exposition</b> <b>of</b> Upanishads. Madhvacharya, much like Adi Shankara claims for Advaita, and Ramanuja claims for Vishishtadvaita, states that his theistic Dvaita Vedanta is grounded in the Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|Warm air : <b>Exposition</b> <b>of</b> {{seeds to}} warm air (50 to 70°C, {{depending}} duration) kills B. rufimanus developing into the seeds {{at the same}} time it lowers water content.

5|$|Arguably {{the first}} <b>exposition</b> <b>of</b> {{empirical}} materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E

5|$|Some {{observers}} consider Millennium Park {{to be the}} city's {{most important}} project since the World's Columbian <b>Exposition</b> <b>of</b> 1893. It far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150million. The final cost of $475million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed roughly half of the financial responsibility for the cost overruns. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and cronyism. Many critics have praised the completed park.|$|E

The final two chapters are devoted to a wider <b>exposition</b> <b>of</b> life and death in Iron Age Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Though {{much of the}} Tamil {{literature}} from this period came from Tamil speaking regions ruled by the feudatory Pandya who gave particular attention on the cultivation of Tamil literature, some poets were patronised by the Vijayanagara kings. Svarupananda Desikar wrote an anthology of 2824 verses, Sivaprakasap-perundirattu, on the Advaita philosophy. His pupil the ascetic, Tattuvarayar, wrote a shorter anthology, Kurundirattu, that contained about half the number of verses. Krishnadevaraya patronised the Tamil Vaishnava poet Haridasa whose Irusamaya Vilakkam was an <b>exposition</b> <b>of</b> the two Hindu systems, Vaishnava and Shaiva, with a preference for the former.|$|E

5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an <b>exposition</b> <b>of</b> New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller by the standards of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E
5|$|At the trial, Archibald Macdonald, {{representing}} the prosecution, argued that Paine's work served only to inflame the populace and distribute radical ideas to those without {{the experience to}} understand them in context. Erskine's reply opened with a defence {{of the freedom of}} lawyers to represent whichever clients came to them, and followed with an <b>exposition</b> <b>of</b> his views {{on the nature of the}} freedom of the press—arguing that the publication of radical tracts served only to improve the government by highlighting its weaknesses, and could not be seditious if published in good faith. Despite Erskine's speech later receiving a rapturous response, Paine was found guilty before Macdonald replied. The verdict was seen by the government as legitimising their repression of radicalism, and paved the way for the 1794 Treason Trials, in which Erskine played a prominent role.|$|E
5|$|By {{performing}} a blood compact, it preserves the bond of friendship between two tribes. This ceremony {{was the first}} treaty or bond of friendship between the natives, and the Spaniards. In honor of this ceremony, the former President of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino established the Order of Sikatuna, a presidential decoration conferred upon politicians. Juan Luna, a Filipino painter, depicted this event in his painting entitled The Blood Compact (Spanish: El Pacto de Sangre) in 1883. El Pacto de Sangre obtained the first prize in Paris in 1885 and at the Louisiana Purchase <b>Exposition</b> <b>of</b> St. Louis in 1904. At that period, {{it was an important}} part for tribes to perform the sandugo as part of the peace process. A monument was constructed in Tagbilaran City by the Philippine Historical Committee and the National Historical Institute.|$|E

5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An <b>Exposition</b> <b>of</b> the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|The Ten Commandments are {{a series}} of {{religious}} and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism. As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church—the official <b>exposition</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and {{serve as the basis for}} Catholic social justice. A review of the Commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the sacrament of Penance.|$|E
5|$|While at Landsberg, Hitler {{dictated}} most of {{the first}} volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and <b>exposition</b> <b>of</b> his ideology. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Some passages imply genocide. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.|$|E
