The calculations involved {{in the design of}} petroleum <b>fractionation</b> <b>columns</b> require in the usual practice the use of numerable charts, tables and complex empirical equations.

40|$|Traditionally the {{majority}} of <b>fractionation</b> <b>columns</b> in natural gas processing plants were equipped with trays. However an option to trayed columns is to use packing. Packed columns offer a larger surface area per unit volume for mass transfer and the continuous gas to liquid contact throughout the column rather than at specific levels (such as in tray columns). For process design purposes, {{it is essential to}} estimate the pressure drop for enabling the proper operation of packed columns. In this study, a simple generalized pressure drop correlation (GPDC) which is easier than existing approaches requiring more complicated and longer computations is developed for sizing randomly packed <b>fractionation</b> <b>columns</b> for pressure drops up to 150 mm water per meter of packing. This correlation can be used to estimate pressure drop for a given loading and column diameter. Alternatively, for a given pressure drop the diameter can be determined. The predictions from the proposed correlation have been compared with reported data and found good agreement with average absolute deviation hovering around 4. 9 %. The proposed predictive tool is superior owing to its accuracy and clear numerical background, wherein the relevant coefficients can be retuned quickly if new and more accurate data are available in the future. This proposed simple-to-use approach can be of immense practical value for the engineers and scientists to have a quick check on the pressure drop in packed columns for a given loading and column diameter. In particular, gas engineers would find the proposed approach can be used very friendly involving no complex expressions with transparent and easy-to-handle calculation steps...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{equilibrium}} stages can be engendered in foam fractionation, {{a process}} {{used for the}} enrichment of streams of proteins, by returning some of the foamate stream {{to the top of}} the column as external reflux liquor. However, it was recognised, 40 years ago that reflux could be autogenously created through the coalescence of bubbles in <b>fractionation</b> <b>columns.</b> By invoking the hydrodynamic theory of rising foam, we suggest a mechanism for the creation of internal reflux in foam fractionation.

When exposed to a magnetic field, gametocytes and magnetic microspheres are preferentially captured inside MFCs. After removal of the magnetizing field, the magnetically captured material can be eluted, placed on a microscope slide that is stained, and counted by using conventional methods. The limits of quantitation for P. falciparum gametocytes were determined from serial dilutions of blood samples with known gametocyte density. The upper limit was 1, 000 gametocytes/μL. Quantitative analysis above this threshold is difficult because of an over-abundance of gametocytes.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between DCCC {{and other types}} of countercurrent chromatography techniques {{is that there is no}} vigorous mixing of phases to enhance the mass transfer of compounds that allows them to distribute between the two phases. In 1951 Kies and Davis described an apparatus similar to the DCCC. They created a series of open tubes that were arranged in a cascade to either drip a more dense phase through an less dense stationary phase or, conversely, a less dense phase could be introduced into the bottom of the tube to dribble through the more dense phase. In 1954, a <b>fractionation</b> <b>column</b> was introduced by Kepes the resembled a CCC column divided into chambers with perforated plastic disks. Similar DCCC-type instruments have been created by A. E. Kostanyan and collaborators which employ vertical columns that are divided into partitions with porous disks. Once the columns are filled with stationary phase, the mobile phase is pumped through, not continuously but, in pulses. The solvent motion created by a pulsed pumping action creates the mixing and settling that is common to most all forms of countercurrent chromatography.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring intra-erythrocytic maturation, malaria parasites {{catabolize}} up to 80 % {{of cellular}} haemoglobin. Haem is liberated inside the parasite and converted to haemozoin, preventing haem iron {{from participating in}} cell-damaging reactions. Several experimental techniques exploit the relatively large paramagnetic susceptibility of malaria-infected cells {{as a means of}} sorting cells or investigating haemoglobin degradation, but the source of the dramatic increase in cellular magnetic susceptibility during parasite growth has not been unequivocally determined. Plasmodium falciparum cultures were enriched using high-gradient magnetic <b>fractionation</b> <b>columns</b> and the magnetic susceptibility of cell contents was directly measured. The forms of haem iron in the erythrocytes were quantified spectroscopically. In the 3 D 7 laboratory strain, the parasites converted approximately 60 % of host cell haemoglobin to haemozoin and this product was the primary source of the increase in cell magnetic susceptibility. Haemozoin iron was found to have a magnetic susceptibility of (11. 0 ± 0. 9) × 10 − 3  mL mol− 1. The calculated volumetric magnetic susceptibility (SI units) of the magnetically enriched cells was (1. 88 ± 0. 60) × 10 − 6 relative to water while that of uninfected cells was not significantly different from water.

A recent study {{in a rural}} clinical setting in Papua New Guinea has demonstrated that Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte detection is facilitated by magnetic deposition microscopy but no study has yet determined the relative sensitivity and limit of detection of a magnetic fractionation technique. The present study compares the detection limit and sensitivity of a technique based {{on the use of}} commercially available magnetic <b>fractionation</b> <b>columns</b> with those for thick blood film microscopy and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. Methods Gametocyte detection in six series of dilutions of cultured P. falciparum parasites with known gametocytaemia was conducted using magnetic fractionation, thick blood film, and RT-PCR techniques. Results The preparations obtained by the magnetic fractionation method were of thin film quality allowing easy gametocyte identification by light microscopy. Magnetic fractionation had a higher sensitivity and approximately two orders of magnitude better limit of detection than thick blood film microscopy. Gametocytes were also more readily detectable on the magnetically fractionated preparations. Magnetic fractionation had a similar limit of detection to that of RT-PCR. Conclusion Magnetic fractionation is a highly sensitive and convenient method for gametocyte detection in comparison with the standard thick blood film and RT-PCR methods, and could readily be adapted to field application. </p...|$|R
