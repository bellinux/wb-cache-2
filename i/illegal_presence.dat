The first three tribes bitterly opposed the migrants' use of the Bozeman Trail and the <b>illegal</b> <b>presence</b> of U.S Government forces along the trail. In Red Cloud's War, the Lakota and allies responded to these intrusions by repeatedly attacking the soldiers and civilians traversing the trail, and parties associated with the forts. In the Fetterman Fight on December 21, 1866, near Fort Kearney, the Lakota achieved a major victory, staging an ambush and killing Fetterman and all 80 soldiers under his command. It was the largest defeat of US forces by Native Americans until the Battle of the Little Bighorn.|$|E

While international law forbids to destroy or seize the enemy's property if not necessary for imperative operational military needs, the state argued that the expanded road was needed {{for the safety of the}} settlers; the state itself, however, was party to the <b>illegal</b> <b>presence</b> of the settlers. HaMoked blamed the Court for accepting, without a [...] "second guess", the state's and the army's assertion that the road was not meant to create Jewish territorial contiguity, but was based purely on security considerations and was meant to protect the lives of the worshippers using the road.|$|E

They intend to apprehend a dangerous fugitive allegedly {{responsible for the deaths}} of many Romulans. Sisko confronts the Romulans over their <b>illegal</b> <b>presence</b> in Federation space and is taken prisoner. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, now in command of the Galaxy-class USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D), is sent to the system to locate and recover the Defiant and her crew. After learning of the presence of warp inhibitors in the system, the Enterprise destroys them and Picard's team assaults a Romulan starbase in the area, saving the Defiant.|$|E

On December 16, 2005, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4437, which solely focused on US-Mexican border security and penalties for employers, smugglers, and those, such as churches and charity workers, providing assistance to illegal immigrants.

The United States Senate is considering bills (e.g. S. 2611) that will strike some of the provisions from H.R. 4437, such as the sections declaring <b>illegal</b> <b>presence</b> to be a felony (illegal entry is currently a misdemeanor) and criminalizing aid to illegal aliens. In addition, many cities and counties have taken formal positions opposing the bill.

Such analysis provides solid and timely evidence on the land grabbing currently taking place.

No concrete evidence linking premature puberty to growth hormones was found, in part because no samples of the suspect meals were available for analysis.

5000|$|Jessica M. Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at Center for Immigration Studies {{reported}} in March 2012 that the Obama administration {{is trying to}} move away from using detention centers that are currently housing thousands of illegal immigrants each day. These facilities are very costly. The 608-bed Karnes facility cost the private operator, GEO Group, $32 million to build. This works out to $52,632 per bed. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is expected to pay GEO Group about $15 million a year to run the center. [...] Some apprehended near the border especially native Mexicans, stay less than one day in detention while are under quick processing for departure. Their stay in detention is about 12 hours. ICE detention centers in the southwest border areas handle groups of 100 of these illegal entrants twice a day. These quick turn-backs numbered about 75,000 last year, or nearly 20 percent of ICE's total reported removals. Some of these who had to stay more than 12 hours are released under bonds until their court hearing because of lack of space in detention centers. As of 2010 715,000 of these failed to appear for their hearings in court or who have ignored orders to depart. The US spending on enforcement activities is already very high. Center of Immigration Studies reported that in 2007-2008 enforcement resources like spending on border and interior enforcement cost far more than the tax savings they generated from reduced <b>illegal</b> <b>presence</b> in the United States.|$|E

40|$|We use {{a version}} of the small-union Meade model to {{consider}} the effects of interdependent import tariffs in the <b>presence</b> <b>illegal</b> immigration. First, we analyze the condition under which illegal immigration is likely to increase (or decrease) in response to reciprocal trade liberalization between the source and host nations (of illegal immigration). Next we describe the Nash equilibrium in tariffs between these nations and discus how a liberalization of tariffs starting from this Nash equilibrium is likely to affect their utility. Finally, we consider the effect of the host nation's liberalization of the import tariff (imposed on its imports from a third nation). We show that strategic considerations regarding the effect of this tariff liberalization on the Nash equilibrium tariffs can modify the traditional (trade creating/diverting) gains from such liberalization.

30|$|The same {{legal status}} in the {{destination}} can also mean different things in different settings. For example, being undocumented in the US in the 1980 s was quite different from being so now. There was more mobility, less deportation. Most immigrants of the past did not face the complexities that the contemporary immigration system poses and presence in the country was generally enough to guarantee access to public benefits (Waters & Gerstein Pineau, 2016). However, the situation in South Africa remained static. Ethiopian migrants remain undocumented despite their long <b>illegal</b> <b>presence</b> in South Africa. This indicates {{that it is not}} just the status of irregularity or being undocumented, it is also about the policies surrounding that. Policies not only about access to services and jobs, and ongoing presence but also about enforcement, criminalisation, etc. These policy changes have contributed to the proliferation of legal statuses, with important consequences for immigrant integration (Waters & Gerstein Pineau, 2016, p. 93). De Genova (2002) also contends that âIllegalityâ is the product of immigration laws.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} highly skilled undocumented {{migrants}} {{are more likely to}} return home than migrants with low or no skills when illegality causes skill waste 9 Ì 4, i. e. when illegality reduces the rate of return of individual capabilities (i. e. skills and human capital) in both the labor and the financial markets of the country of destination. This proposition is first illustrated in a simple life-cycle framework, where illegality acts as a tax on skills, and then is tested on a sample of apprehended immigrants that crossed unlawfully the Italian borders in 2003. The estimation confirms that the intention to return to the home country is more likely for highly skilled than low-skill <b>illegal</b> immigrants.
