Originally {{a source of}} track for Whittle, Choo Choo Track & Toy Co is both a producer and online retailer of track, bridges, tables, and other accessories. Track is available as individual pieces or in complete sets. Noteworthy are the track adapters the company offers to connect wooden tracks to other systems with similar gauge, such as the blue plastic tracks from Tomy with the <b>dove</b> <b>tail</b> connectors and the tan tracks from Trackmaster.|$|E
50|$|The statues leave {{people in}} awe with their fiery eye of Re and jaw {{structure}} of the goddess Sekhmet. The statue is a zoomorphic form of a lioness. Egyptian artists were great at putting human and animal forms together in equal power and truth. The head of the statues have a sun disk and Uraeus on the top which is connected by a <b>dove</b> <b>tail</b> groove. The sun disk would've been placed in the back pillar. There are rare depictions of the statue wearing a double crown representing the fusion of Sekhmet and Mut. The statues are made in pieces {{and we know that}} from the fragments and unfinished statues. The statue wears a tight fitting gown/garment and the bodice rises up to the breasts. The upper body is nude. There is a broad collar on the shoulders and it is visible between the dress straps. The aegis is represented in the metal collar. The gown is tight {{all the way down to}} the legs below the hem and it's wide.The dress is meant to be the color red and would represent mistress aspect and symbolize lower Egypt and warlike nature. Sekhmet statues have accessories like ankle bands and bracelets. The dress is conservative for the time period. There is a daisy over each breast. This daisy can be seen on Queen Tia, Queen Tiy and on the private people of Amenhotep III. The large rosette over the greats are meant to reflect patterns in the shoulder hair of lions and another theory is that they reflect astronomical symbolism of the shoulder star of the constellation Leo in Egyptian astronomical paintings.|$|E

50|$|A school’s badge evokes {{memory of}} bygone years, artistically symbolizes the school’s concept and culture, {{inherits}} and carries forward the school’s history and tradition. After more than 60 eventful years of tiding over hardships and difficulties, going through vicissitudes and pressing ahead steadily, the college has formed its own rich culture, cultivated {{a quality of}} genuineness, fortitude and sedulousness. Always remaining vigorous and active over past 6 decades, the college has scored notable achievements in various undertakings. ZMC’s badge is designed {{in the form of}} a dove spreading its wings to fly, successfully embodying the leitmotif of peace, harmony and development, setting off the college’s vitality as a burgeoning comprehensive college with medicine being the main discipline. The image and symbolism of a dove are universally acceptable; hence, the design intensifies the audience’s recognition of the badge, and aggrandizes the channel for popularizing it.By combining the form of the initial letters Z and Y of Zunyi and of the Chinese character 义, the badge is designed into a dove spreading its wings to fly, signifying the truth of medicine, philanthropism, brightness, health and happiness. The dove’s wings spread outward {{in the form of a}}n opened book, implying the essence of the college. The <b>dove</b> <b>tail</b> is somewhat magnified, in the shape of an arrowhead piercing into the sky, indicating momentum and speed, emblematic of ZMC’s speedy growth and the bright future for its ambition to rank among the universities of first class. The dot in the character 义 and the letter Y make a gamboling person, giving prominence to the school’s teaching methodology of “put people first”, to the school’s faculty and students’ lofty ideals to explore the unknown world and scale summit after summit of knowledge, and to the school’s spirit of keeping abreast of time, forging ahead and pursuing perfection. The badge makes a flying arrow from the dove’s head to its tail, shaped like letter C standing for college or letter U standing for university, showing that the school is advancing toward a higher level and achieving its higher goals.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{investigation}} {{deals with}} the study of a compressor disc made of α-β titanium alloy of a typical fighter aero-engine having a TBO (Time Between Overhaul) of 550 hours and TTL (total technical life) of 1500 hours. In general, the failure of most of compressor discs is attributed to low cycle fatigue (LCF) due {{to the presence of}} residual tensile stresses at the dovetail slots. In the present study, shot peening was carried out to introduce compressive residual stress at the <b>dove</b> <b>tail</b> slots in order to enhance fatigue life of the disc. The local stress at the longitudinal and transverse edge of the slot generally increases upto 450 MPa and 230 MPa, respectively, during service. In the present study, the introduced residual compressive stresses measured by XRD technique on the slot and face of the disc {{has been found to be}} of the order 650 MPa & 770 MPa, respectively. Stress controlled LCF tests (R= 0. 1, maximum stress = 85 % Yield Strength, frequency = 0. 33 Hz) have been conducted at room temperature. The LCF life of shotpeened disc was observed to be nearly three times as compared to that of unpeened disc. Following this surface treatment, life of the disc has been revised from 800 to 1500 hours, thereby eliminating the need of disc replacement at operating units. This has improved the reliability and serviceability of the fleet...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} bond {{strength and toughness}} {{of a range of}} widely used commercially available synthetic Type 2 structural fibres defined within BS EN 14889 [1] and compared these against novel prototype dove tailed (DT) synthetic Type 2 structural fibres. The <b>dove</b> <b>tail</b> shapes are three in number when viewed across the diameter of the circular DT fibre and they run longitudinally, creating an open flute effect. Synthetic fibres tend to be made from low modulus materials when compared to steel crack control products and they suffer a greater diameter reduction and increase in length when compared to steel; for an equal load. Diameter reduction of fibres in concrete causes de-bonding and eventual failure. DT fibres are designed to offer additional bond when a diameter reduction occurs under load. Fibres were cast into concrete cubes to a depth of half their length and pulled out recording load and extension to ultimate failure. The findings showed large degrees of toughness were available when using dove tailed fibre technology, The DT fibres transferred less bond stress at the point of the initial pull out prior to the dove tailed feature of the fibre taking effect. The dovetailed fibre under test provided additional grip through the contraction of the internal faces of the dovetail features when under load. Further work is needed to determine the optimum DT fibre diameter and aspect ratio that may provide increased bond stress whilst retaining large degrees of toughness...|$|E

However, the car artist who takes the time to read the rules is generally surprised at how free expression can be (in the United States at least). Although pulled over by police at times the car artist who is fluent in the law will find that the police are glad to be educated as they themselves often do not realize what is possible under the many law codes on the books. For daily driver cartists making sure the art is legal can be a daunting task. For some {{it is part of the}} fun.|$|R

40|$|Concrete is {{a widely}} used {{material}} within the civil engineering environment, having many varied applications that utilise its inherent qualities. When concrete is subject to rapid or impact loading it can suffer failure as it is inherently weak in tension. The inclusion of fibres may go some way to mitigate this weakness. This paper investigates a new synthetic <b>dove</b> <b>tailed</b> (DT) cross section fibre with regard to energy absorption and builds upon previous pull out testing by the authors. The test examines polypropylene DT fibres and hybrid blends of DT and other structural synthetic fibres to evaluate the best performing hybrid mix. The parameters of the test are: compressive strength, flexural strength, energy absorption (toughness) measured with load and deflection and time dependant absorbed energy using a drop hammer impact test and high velocity ballistic rifle fire. The findings showed a 50...|$|R
40|$|Patterns of {{replication}} within eukaryotic genomes {{correlate with}} gene expression, chromatin structure, and genome evolution. Recent advances in genome-scale mapping of replication kinetics have allowed these correlations {{to be explored}} in many species, cell types, and growth conditions, and these large data sets have allowed quantitative and computational analyses. One striking new correlation to emerge from these analyses is between replication timing and the three-dimensional structure of chromosomes. This correlation, which is significantly stronger than with any single histone modification or chromosome-binding protein, suggests that replication timing is controlled {{at the level of}} chromosomal domains. This conclusion <b>dove</b> <b>tails</b> with parallel work on the heterogeneity of origin firing and the competition between origins for limiting activators to suggest a model in which the stochastic probability of individual origin firing is modulated by chromosomal domain structure to produce patterns of replication.

50|$|The {{sighting}} arrangement on the Walther LGR {{takes advantage}} of the natural ability of the eye and brain to easily align concentric circles (circles all having a common centre).As rear sighting system a universal Walther diopter was used. This high end target aperture sight offering windage and elevation correction in 0.2 mm (≈ 0.069 MOA) increments at 10 m came with a rubber eye shield. This diopter was used by Walther for their complete match rifle product range and Steyr Mannlicher for their 300 metre full bore rifles. Like any high end diopter this Walther diopter accepts adjustable diopter aperture and optical filter systems to ensure optimal sighting conditions for match shooters.The complementing globe front sight is mounted on <b>dove</b> <b>tails</b> on top of the barrel and has the possibility to easily insert various notch elements. Besides metal notch elements, plastic clear or semi transparent front sight elements of various diameters can also be mounted and quickly be exchanged.For shooters with suboptimal vision the optical foresight aid eagle-eye can be installed to aid their aiming.For raising the sightline of the diopter and foresight by 9.5 mm dovetail blocks that fit the integral 11 mm dovetail rail on top of the receiver were available.|$|R

40|$|Using {{the mosaic}} of six XMM-Newton observations, we study the {{hydrodynamic}} {{state of the}} A 3562, a cluster {{in the center of}} the Shapley Supercluster. The X-ray image reveals a sharp surface brightness gradient within the core of A 3562, a 200 kpc ridge extending to the south-west. A nearby group, SC 1329 - 313, imaged within this program also exhibits a tail aligned with the ridge. Study of the pressure and entropy identified the ridge with a 40 % pressure enhancement. An associated Mach number of 1. 15 relative to a polytropic sound speed for a 5 keV plasma requires the velocity of the group to be 1400 km/s, while the projected velocity difference between the cluster and the group amounts to 1200 - 1500 km/s. Apparent disruption of the group, if attributed to the ram pressure, also requires the velocity of the group in the cluster frame to amount to 1700 +/- 150 km/s. The sharp surface brightness gradient at the center is identified with a contact discontinuity, which together with <b>dove</b> <b>tails</b> in the the large-scale entropy distribution reveals a sloshing of the BCG in response to the passage of the SC 1329 - 313 group. Using the extent of the low-entropy tails in A 3562 we estimate the amplitude of sloshing motion to be 200 /h_ 70 kpc and the oscillation frequency 1 Gyr. Comment: ApJ in press, 10 page...|$|R
