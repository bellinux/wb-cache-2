5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol fuels {{may cause}} {{erroneous}} gas gauge readings in vehicles with capacitance <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> gauging.|$|E
25|$|Second stage engine cutoff was {{commanded}} by the IU at a pre-determined <b>fuel</b> <b>level,</b> {{and the stage}} was separated. By this time, the vehicle had reached its approximate orbital altitude, and the third stage burn was {{just long enough to}} reach a circular parking orbit.|$|E
50|$|Other {{kinds of}} dipsticks {{are used to}} measure {{everything}} from <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> {{to the amount of}} beer left in an ale cask (Firkin).|$|R
50|$|Planned burning {{is carried}} out by the Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning at certain times of year to reduce <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> in parks and {{reserves}} throughout the state.|$|R
50|$|BatRF - BatRF is a data {{collection}} system for trucks designed to monitor important information, such as monitoring distance traveled, tire pressure, <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> and expenses, and vehicle condition or maintenance needs. Stemco distributes the BatRF system.|$|R
25|$|First stage cutoff {{and stage}} {{separation}} were commanded when the IU received {{a signal that}} the tank's <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> had reached a predetermined point. Guidance during {{the second and third}} stage burns depended both on time and navigation measurements, in order to achieve the target orbit using the minimum fuel.|$|E
25|$|G.T.350 was {{available}} with {{air conditioning and}} an AM/FM radio. The steering wheel was a wood-rimmed and satin-trimmed design with the classic Shelby logo in the center. Behind this wheel was a very classy-looking set of gauges. A 140-mph speedometer and a whopping 8,000-rpm tachometer were joined with smaller analog clock, <b>fuel</b> <b>level,</b> water temperature, and oil pressure gauges.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{corrosion}} {{the fuel}} {{system must be}} made of suitable materials, electrical wires must be properly insulated and the <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> sensor must be of pulse and hold type, magneto resistive or other similar non-contact type. In addition, high quality alcohol should have a low concentration of contaminants and have a suitable corrosion inhibitor added. Scientific evidence reveals that also water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the [...] season, new FIA President Jean Todt said that he was in favour of re-introducing the 107% rule, as the {{qualifying}} system has changed again so that all of the sessions are carried out with low <b>fuel</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Concerned {{over the}} losses to his carrier fighter {{aircraft}} strength, {{anxious about the}} threat to his carriers from further Japanese air attacks, and worried about his ships' <b>fuel</b> <b>levels,</b> Fletcher {{announced that he would}} be withdrawing his carrier task forces on the evening of August 8.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring car {{performance}} {{in terms of}} fuel consumption, velocity and other important parameters is crucial in order to ascertain whether a car is operating optimally. The purpose {{of this research is}} to design and develop a new data logger to monitor general car performance. Data has been collected via a wireless device attached to the car, which transmits information to the base station. The data logger (data acquisition processor) was developed based on an 8 -bit Single-Chip Microcontroller. Speed, revs, <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> and temperature probes placed in the experimental car provided the required information. The information was then processed by the data acquisition processor before being transmitted to a computer via an RLM 3000 -Radio Link Modem. Laboratory results of the data logger for different speeds, revs and <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> are presented and discussed herein...|$|R
25|$|Citroën {{unveiled}} {{the car at}} the Paris Salon on 7 October 1948. The car on display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one stop light, and was only available in grey. The <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> was checked with a dip stick/measuring rod, and the speedometer was attached to the windscreen pillar. The only other instrument was an ammeter.|$|E
25|$|The 1962 Valiant {{was given}} a {{completely}} new instrument cluster. Like that of the larger 1962 Plymouth models, the new Valiant cluster was highly regarded for its clean design and easy readability. A large round speedometer was placed at {{the left of the}} cluster, with separate round gauges for <b>fuel</b> <b>level,</b> engine temperature, and charging system condition (amperes) in a row {{to the right of the}} speedometer. Automatic transmission pushbuttons were in a column at the left edge of the panel, and heater pushbuttons were in a column at the right edge. A new shallower-dish steering wheel was also introduced.|$|E
25|$|Two similar {{accidents}} {{occurred in}} the following decade. Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 was a watershed incident in airline safety: on December 29, 1972, its entire flight crew became preoccupied with a burnt-out landing-gear indicator light and failed to notice that the autopilot had inadvertently been disconnected. As a result, the aircraft gradually lost altitude and eventually crashed. A similar incident occurred on December 28, 1978, when the captain of United Airlines Flight 173 was distracted by a landing-gear issue and did not heed his crewmembers' concerns about the aircraft's <b>fuel</b> <b>level,</b> resulting in an exhaustion of fuel to all engines and a subsequent crash.|$|E
50|$|Heidfeld led {{after the}} only safety car period, when he pitted he had around a 25-second lead over Kubica, who {{was down in}} around 10th at the time. Heidfeld was {{released}} {{in front of his}} team mate, but was slow due to <b>fueling</b> <b>levels</b> and was passed by Kubica a lap later.|$|R
5000|$|The Petrol Retailers Association, whose {{membership}} represents {{more than}} 5,500 petrol stations, said that it knew nothing about any form of planned government contingency plans and was advising members to keep <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> high. The group's chairman, Brian Madderson told the BBC: [...] "We have had no word from the Department of Energy and Climate Change whatsoever." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{division}} had {{to ensure}} that accurate information was constantly available at all times, this included the positions and conditions of all the most important ships. This was done by devising an operational plotting system that enabled the Admiralty to track of all ship movements, all scheduling of re-fits, monitoring <b>fuel</b> <b>levels,</b> and monitoring ammunition storage levels world wide [...]|$|R
25|$|The {{effects of}} varying the {{characteristics}} of the dielectric can be used for sensing purposes. Capacitors with an exposed and porous dielectric can be used to measure humidity in air. Capacitors are used to accurately measure the <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> in airplanes; as the fuel covers more of a pair of plates, the circuit capacitance increases. Squeezing the dielectric can change a capacitor at a few tens of bar pressure sufficiently that it {{can be used as a}} pressure sensor. A selected, but otherwise standard, polymer dielectric capacitor, when immersed in a compatible gas or liquid, can work usefully as a very low cost pressure sensor up to many hundreds of bar.|$|E
25|$|OBD II is {{no longer}} only used by {{professionals}} and hobbyists to repair vehicles. OBD II information is commonly used by vehicle telematics devices that perform fleet tracking, monitor fuel efficiency, prevent unsafe driving, {{as well as for}} remote diagnostics and by pay-as-you-drive insurance. Although originally not intended for the above purposes, commonly supported OBD II data such as vehicle speed, RPM, and <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> allow GPS-based fleet tracking devices to monitor vehicle idling times, speeding, and over-revving. By monitoring OBD II DTCs a company can know immediately if one of its vehicles has an engine problem and by interpreting the code the nature of the problem. OBD II is also monitored to block mobile phones when driving and to record trip data for insurance purposes.|$|E
500|$|Investigators {{also cited}} the flight {{engineer}} {{for failing to}} calculate the [...] "minimum approach/landing fuel quantity." [...] The report references the 360° turn that the flight was ordered to make at 20:54 {{as evidence that the}} crew should have known that they were being treated routinely and not given any emergency priority. Instead, the CVR revealed that the flight crew was convinced that they were being given priority. Additionally, the NTSB criticized the first officer for failing to use the word [...] "emergency" [...] as the captain had insisted he do. Compounded with the apparent inability of the captain to hear or understand the radio communications, the NTSB called the situation a [...] "total breakdown in communications by the flightcrew." [...] Summarizing, the investigators cited [...] "the flightcrew's failure to notify ATC of their fuel situation while holding at CAMRN in order to ensure arrival at the approach fix with an adequate approach minimum <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> and a breakdown in communications between the flightcrew and ATC, and among the flight crewmembers" [...] as the two main factors that led to the crash.|$|E
5000|$|The Sync 3 {{infotainment}} {{system is}} added {{as a new}} feature, along with a new smartphone app called Sync Connect, which allows owners to remotely monitor their vehicle, check <b>fuel</b> <b>levels,</b> lock and unlock doors, and start the engine. The 2.5 and 2.0 EcoBoost engine line up were joined by a new [...] 1.5 litre, turbocharged four cylinder option, replacing the 1.6L.|$|R

50|$|A floatstick is {{a device}} to measure <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> in modern large aircraft. It {{is made up of}} two tubes, one {{enclosed}} within the other, around which is a ring-shaped float that contains a magnet. There is also a magnet attached {{to the top of the}} floatstick. The floatstick is withdrawn from the bottom of the wing until the magnets stick, indicating the <b>level</b> of the <b>fuel.</b>|$|R
500|$|The 1993 VR Commodore {{represented}} a major facelift {{of the second}} generation architecture leaving only the doors and roof untouched. Approximately 80percent of car was new {{in comparison to the}} preceding model. Exterior changes brought an overall smoother body, semicircular wheel arches and the [...] "twin-kidney" [...] grille—a Commodore styling trait which remained until the VY model of 2002 and remains a permanent staple on the HSV variants to this day. The rear-end treatment saw raised tail lights, implemented for safety reasons, and a driver's side airbag was introduced as an option: a first for an Australian-built car. Other safety features such as anti-lock brakes and independent rear suspension were only available with the new electronic GM 4L60-E automatic transmission. Along with a driver's airbag and cruise control, these features were packaged into a new Acclaim specification level: a family-oriented safety spec above the entry-level Executive. Holden's strong focus on safety {{can be seen in the}} Used Car Safety Ratings. The findings show that in an accident, VN/VP Commodores provide a [...] "worse than average" [...] level of occupant protection. However, the updated VR/VS models were found to provide a [...] "better than average" [...] level of safety protection. Holden issued a Series II revision in September 1994 bringing audible warning chimes for the handbrake and <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> among other changes.|$|E
2500|$|Below {{the main}} display is a panel which {{displays}} status reports, and below that indicators for <b>fuel</b> <b>level,</b> enemy missile lock on, [...] "terrain following" [...] status, [...] "automatic landing" [...] availability (activated when the ATF enters the catchment area surrounding allied bases), and undercarriage status.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} of the 2S {{is similar to the}} WT-11, with the wingspan increased by [...] and the same fuselage as the WT-11, with the second seat where the WT-11's baggage area is located. The fuel tank was relocated from the fuselage to both wing struts as aerodynamically-shaped plastic tanks, where they are visible in flight and the <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> can be quickly determined. Some WT-11s have had these strut tanks installed as well.|$|E
50|$|Armored Car is an {{overhead}} view maze arcade game released by Stern Electronics in 1981. You drive a money van (the armoured car) through as it scrolls {{from right to}} left. Some intersections are marked with directions. You pick up money to deliver to banks while avoiding criminals by dropping saw horses on the road. <b>Fuel</b> <b>levels</b> must be replenished at gas stations along the way.|$|R
50|$|Being a simulation, F-16 Multirole Fighter is {{reasonably}} accurate, especially {{when compared to}} most console arcade-style games such as Namco's Ace Combat series and Konami's Airforce Delta series. Features such as limited ammunition quantity (important to consider when playing through campaigns) <b>fuel</b> <b>levels,</b> and that many flight characteristics come into play; things like engine flameouts, flatspins, red and blackouts (affected by the g-forces) so the player must quickly learn to compensate.|$|R
50|$|On March 24, 2011, Stardust {{conducted}} a burn to consume its remaining fuel. The spacecraft had little fuel left and scientists hoped {{the data collected}} would help {{in the development of}} a more accurate system for estimating <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> on spacecraft. After the data had been collected, no further antenna aiming was possible and the transmitter was switched off. The spacecraft sent an acknowledgement from approximately 312000000 km away in space.|$|R
2500|$|... "FlexFuel" [...] {{vehicles}} have upgraded {{fuel system}} and engine components which {{are designed for}} long life using E85 or M85, and the ECU can adapt to any fuel blend between gasoline and E85 or M85. Typical upgrades include modifications to: fuel tanks, fuel tank electrical wiring, fuel pumps, fuel filters, fuel lines, filler tubes, <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> sensors, fuel injectors, seals, fuel rails, fuel pressure regulators, valve seats and inlet valves. [...] "Total Flex" [...] Autos destined for the Brazilian market can use E100 (100% Ethanol).|$|E
2500|$|In the North American market, the Celica Supra was {{available}} in two distinct models. There was the [...] "Performance Type" [...] (P-type) and the [...] "Luxury Type" [...] (L-type). While being mechanically identical, they were differentiated by the available options; tire size, wheel size, and body trim. The P-type had fiberglass fender flares over the wheel wells, while the L-type did not. The P-type was also standard with the more sporty eight-way adjustable seats. The P-type {{did not get the}} option of a leather interior until 1983. All editions of the P-type had the same 14x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels and throughout the years the L-type had 14x5.5-inch wheels until 1985 when they were changed to a P-type styled 15x6. The L-type also had the option of a digital dash with trip computer; some Canadian models had this option as well as a few rare instances of American models. The digital dash featured a digital tachometer, digital speedometer, and electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> and coolant level gauges. The trip computer could calculate and display various things such as fuel economy in miles-per-gallon, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and distance remaining to destination. Excluding the 1982 model, all P-types were available with headlight washers as an option, but the L-types were never given such an option. Although gear ratios changed throughout the years, all P-types came standard with a limited slip differential.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} weight, {{the level of}} fuel carried is altered: for {{intermodal}} applications the <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> is 7,300 litres, for coal applications that permit higher axle loads the <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> is increased to 13,500 litres, with an intermediate <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> of 10,750 litres also available. These limits are enforced during refuelling by a float switch in the tank, the permitted level being set by a key switch with an indication displayed in the cab if the limits are breached. The provision of inline refuelling permits the topping up of the tanks in transit from a separate tank wagon behind the locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The first ships sighted by the U.S. strike were oilers, {{thirty miles}} before the carrier groups. The strike {{group from the}} Wasp, more {{concerned}} with their low <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> than with finding the more important Japanese carriers and battleships, dove on the tankers. Two of these were damaged so severely that they were later scuttled, while a third {{was able to put}} out fires and get under way.|$|R
30|$|Heat damage {{appeared}} slightly greater among {{trees with}} relatively high <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> between the bole and the drip line (Figures 4 and 5). Trees with larger than average diameters (i.e., DBH) experienced greater maximum bole scorch heights (Figure 4 C) and lower than average probabilities of crown scorch (Figure 5 A). Trees growing on steeper than average slopes experienced greater than average bole scorch heights (Figure 4 C) and crown damage (Figure 5).|$|R
40|$|Ghana's {{forest cover}} {{which was about}} 8. 2 million {{hectares}} by 1900 is currently estimated to be 1. 6 million. The main factors that {{have contributed to the}} shortfall are human disturbance and forest fires. Currently, forest fires have become the single most important threat to the survival of remaining forests in forest-savanna transitional zone due to recent surge in <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> and drier climate.
