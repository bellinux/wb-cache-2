500|$|Frise and Clark {{had grown}} {{concerned}} with the Stars treatment of its staff and made an agreement in 1946 to leave at the first opportunity. [...] Clark contacted John McConnell, publisher of the Montreal Standard, a newspaper with a smaller circulation than the Star that had earlier offered him a position. [...] McConnell offered the pair salaries similar to what they received at the Star, {{as well as the}} opportunity for Frise to have his strip syndicated in the United States, which would supplement his income. [...] When they handed in their resignations that Christmas Eve, Hindmarsh asked them, [...] "Aren't you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a chance to bid?" [...] Frise told him, [...] "Mr Hindmarsh, you have nothing to bid with." [...] The last Birdseye Center episode ran on 1 February 1947.|$|E
500|$|Crosby {{made his}} NHL debut on October 5, 2005, against the New Jersey Devils, and {{registered}} an assist on the team's first {{goal of the}} season, scored by Mark Recchi in a 5–1 loss. He scored his first NHL goal in the Penguins' home opener on October 8 against goaltender Hannu Toivonen of the Boston Bruins. Despite having registered two assists for a three-point night, the Penguins were defeated 7–6 in overtime. Crosby began his rookie season playing alongside Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux. Unfortunately, Lemieux was forced to retire due to an irregular heartbeat after having played just 26 games of the season. Near the midway point of the season, Penguins head coach Eddie Olczyk was fired and replaced by Michel Therrien on December 15, 2005. [...] The following day, Therrien designated Crosby as an alternate captain for the Penguins. The move drew criticism from some hockey pundits, including Don Cherry, who claimed that Crosby {{did not have the}} experience for the position. He stated, [...] "An 18-year-old kid says he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> ideas. What, from the Quebec League, he's going to give them ideas? Come on. That's ridiculous". Although hopes were high in Pittsburgh for the club to succeed, largely in part to the beginning of Crosby's NHL career and bolstered by the acquisitions of Sergei Gonchar, Žigmund Pálffy and Mark Recchi, the Penguins still finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} U2's first under their 12-year deal with Live Nation. It was {{sponsored}} by BlackBerry, {{in a move that}} broke U2's prior relationship with Apple Inc. and opened possibilities for collaborations between U2 and Research In Motion on mobile music experiences. Lead singer Bono said of the new relationship, [...] "I'm very excited about this. Research in Motion is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> what Apple wouldn't: access to their labs and their people so we can do something really spectacular." [...] The explicit corporate sponsorship of a tour was a first for the group, and was due to the anticipated production costs being higher than for any previous U2 tour. The first commercials for a new Blackberry application, called the [...] "U2 Mobile App", began airing in early July 2009 against the song [...] "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight"; the application allows the user to listen to the album No Line on the Horizon, contains a news section which features updates about the tour, and an interactive section that allows the sharing of images and enables the user to see their position during a concert relative to the band and other application users. Models of the stage were added to Google Earth approximately a week before the scheduled concert took place; tour architect Mark Fisher stated, [...] "We thought {{it would be interesting to}} put up on Google Earth a piece of portable architecture." ...|$|E

5000|$|Once the {{soldiers}} reached {{the home of}} Bill Shelton they encountered over 50 riflemen. The ensuing combat left six of the defenders dead. While Allen and his troops awaited Colonel Keith’s column, news was received that Allen’s 6-year-old son Romulus had died of scarlet fever. Upon his return to Marshall, Allen discovered that his 4-year-old daughter Margaret was dying. Allen was quick to blame the looters who had ransacked his house previously. The next day he buried his children and returned immediately to Shelton Laurel. With Allen, fueled by grief {{and the desire for}} vengeance, reunited with Keith, the two realized that the locals were unlikely to volunteer information. Keith rounded up several Shelton Laurel women and began torturing them in hopes of forcing them <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up their sons' and husbands' whereabouts. They hanged and whipped Mrs. Unus Riddle, a woman of 85. They hanged Mary and Sarah Shelton by their necks until they were nearly dead. The Memphis Bulletin reports: “Old Mrs. Sallie Moore, seventy years of age, was whipped with hickory rods till the blood ran in streams down her back to the ground. … Martha White, an idiotic girl, was beaten and tied by the neck all day to a tree.” The soldiers burnt homes and slaughtered livestock. After several days of rounding up alleged supporters, Keith began marching the captives toward East Tennessee, which at the time was occupied by a substantial Confederate army. However, after two of the captives escaped, Keith ordered the remaining 13 captives into the woods, and had 5 of them shot execution style. [...] Their bodies were dumped into a nearby trench. Among the executed were three boys, ages 13, 14, and 17. Joe Woods, an elderly man of 60, says ““For God’s sake, men, you are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shoot us? If you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> murder <b>us,</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> at least time to pray.” Keith responds, “There’s no time for praying.” The soldier hesitated before shooting the horrified captives, prompting Keith to bellow, “Fire or you will take their place!” The soldiers fired and 4 men were killed instantly, one required a second shot. The next 5 men were made to kneel and after the shots were fired again one man remained still alive. It was 13-year-old David Shelton who clutched the legs of an officer and begged “You have killed my old father and three brothers, you have shot me in both arms. … I forgive you all this — I can get well. … Let me go home to my mother and sisters.” David Shelton was shot 8 more times.|$|R

On the other hand, it will show us more about the language community exists in our society. Of course, this study is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> information <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about what are the up to date and actual topics that happen in our surrounding. This study focused on spoken rather than written language. The objective of this research is to describe the topics of conversation that are shared by students of University of Muhammadiyah Malang in spending their spare time. A descriptive qualitative research was used as design of the study. The subjects of the study were students of University of Muhammadiyah Malang. They were 36 students. The data were obtained through non participant observation, made field noted and recorded the spontaneous conversation without knowing by the subject. The result of the study showed that the topics of conversation that are shared by students of University of Muhammadiyah Malang in spending their spare time in reading floor of the main lecture building were academic topics and non academic topics. The academic topics of conversation were about lecturers, examination, book, library, task, “practicum”, and the non academic topics of conversation were about movie, music concert, boy friend and gossip artist.
