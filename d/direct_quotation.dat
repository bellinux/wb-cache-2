5|$|Czech {{national}} opera {{until this}} {{time had been}} represented only by minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana's second, {{was part of his}} quest to create a truly Czech operatic genre. Smetana's musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms such as the polka and furiant, and although he largely avoided the <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> of folksong he neverthess created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech in spirit.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Mariana {{is connected to}} Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; there is a <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> of Shakespeare's play in regards to a {{character of}} the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana is rejected by the character Angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love. Tennyson's version is set in Lincolnshire, not Vienna as in the Shakespeare play. This makes the characters completely English. Additionally, the scene within the poem {{does not have any}} of the original context but the two works are connected in imagery {{with the idea of a}} dull life and a dejected female named Mariana.|$|E
5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E

His three most important sources, in order, are the Bible, Shakespeare, and Milton.

25|$|The second {{quotation}} {{is found}} in the document On the Councils of Arminum and Seleucia, also known as De Synodis, pg. 15. This second passage is entirely in irregular verse, and seems to be a <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> or a compilation of quotations; it may have been written by someone other than Athanasius, perhaps even a person sympathetic to Arius. This second quotation does not contain several statements usually attributed to Arius by his opponents, is in metrical form, and resembles other passages that have been attributed to Arius. It also contains some positive statements about the Son. But although these quotations seem reasonably accurate, their proper context is lost, thus their place in Arius' larger system of thought is impossible to reconstruct.|$|E

500|$|Sappho's {{poetry is}} known for its clear {{language}} and simple thoughts, sharply-drawn images, and use of <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> which brings a sense of immediacy. [...] Unexpected word-play is a characteristic feature of her style. [...] An example is from fragment 96: [...] "now she stands out among Lydian women as after sunset the rose-fingered moon exceeds all stars", a variation of the Homeric epithet [...] "rosy-fingered Dawn". [...] Sappho's poetry often uses hyperbole, according to ancient critics [...] "because of its charm". An example is found in fragment 111, where Sappho writes that [...] "The groom approaches like Ares Much bigger than a big man".|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1960s Tippett {{worked on a}} series of {{compositions}} that reflected the influence of his American experiences after 1965: The Shires Suite (1970), The Knot Garden (1970) and the Symphony No. 3 (1972). [...] In The Knot Garden Mellers discerns Tippett's [...] "wonderfully acute" [...] ear only intermittently, otherwise: [...] "thirty years on, the piece still sounds and looks knotty indeed, exhausting alike to participants and audience". The Third Symphony is overtly linked by Tippett to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony through a vocal finale of four blues songs, introduced by a <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> from Beethoven's finale. Tippett's intention, explained by the music critic Calum MacDonald, was to explore the contemporary relevance of the grand, universal sentiments in Schiller's Ode to Joy, as set by Beethoven. [...] Tippett's conclusion is that while the need to rejoice remains, the twentieth century has put paid to the Romantic ideals of universality and certainty.|$|E

She wrote that few had studied Christian schools, the [...] "fastest growing sector of private education in the United States". In commending Peshkin's even-handedness, she wrote that his forthrightness about declaring his own biases and effort to present participant voices through <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> were strong elements, though he described more than he analyzed. Rose felt that the [...] "interesting" [...] final chapters of analysis and comparison with public schools [...] "grounded" [...] the overall ethnography, though she wished for more comparison of the adolescent student experience between the academy {{and other kinds of}} American schools. She considers Peshkin's [...] "discussion of the politics of pluralism", that Christian schools both add to American religious pluralism while advocating against it, possibly his best contribution.|$|E
500|$|As Opland notes, however, it is {{not entirely}} clear that Cuthbert is {{attributing}} this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the letter do not use a finite verb to describe Bede's presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert's description places {{the performance of the}} Old English poem {{in the context of a}} series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts. On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert's Latin letter, the observation that Bede [...] "was learned in our song," [...] and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important, either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment or because it is a <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> of Bede's last original composition.|$|E
500|$|Two {{projects}} helped Rimsky-Korsakov {{focus on}} less academic music-making. The {{first was the}} creation of two folk song collections in 1874. Rimsky-Korsakov transcribed 40 Russian songs for voice and piano from performances by folk singer Tvorty Filippov, who approached him at Balakirev's suggestion. This collection was followed by a second containing 100 songs, supplied by friends and servants, or taken from rare and out-of-print collections. Rimsky-Korsakov later credited this work as a great influence on him as a composer; it also supplied a vast amount of musical material from which he could draw for future projects, either by <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> or as models for composing fakeloric passages. The second project was the editing of orchestral scores by pioneer Russian composer Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857) in collaboration with Balakirev and Anatoly Lyadov. Glinka's sister, Lyudmila Ivanovna Shestakova, wanted to preserve her brother's musical legacy in print, and paid the costs of the project from her own pocket. No similar project had been attempted before in Russian music, and guidelines for scholarly musical editing had to be established and agreed. While Balakirev favored making changes in Glinka's music to [...] "correct" [...] what he saw as compositional flaws, Rimsky-Korsakov favored a less intrusive approach. Eventually, Rimsky-Korsakov prevailed. [...] "Work on Glinka's scores was an unexpected schooling for me", he later wrote. [...] "Even before this I had known and worshipped his operas; but as editor of the scores in print I had to go through Glinka's style and instrumentation to their last little note... And this was a beneficent discipline for me, leading me as it did to the path of modern music, after my vicissitudes with counterpoint and strict style".|$|E

40|$|Using textual {{analysis}} {{and interviews with}} student writers, this study aims to provide an insight into second language students’ use of <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> in their MA theses by comparing <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> in high-rated and low-rated Master’s theses, and by exploring student writers’ own motivations to quote directly from sources. The corpus consists of eight high-rated and eight lowrated Master’s theses written in English {{in the field of}} gender studies by students from Central and Eastern Europe studying at an English-medium university in Central Europe. The findings show that high-rated theses display almost three times as many <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> per 1000 words as low-rated theses, which was found to be statistically significant. Differences are also evident in the type of quotations preferred: while high-rated theses primarily use quotation fragments (i. e., quotations shorter than a T-unit), lowrated theses rely on clause-based quotations, which do not require modification when quoted in a text. Interviews with student writers reveal the following motivations to quote directly from sources: (a) source-related motivations (e. g., vivid expression of an idea), (b) writers’ own goals (e. g., stylistic variety), (c) external factors (e. g., lack of time), and (d) students’ beliefs and fears (e. g., fear of plagiarism). The findings are discussed with reference to the development of student academic writing in the area of source use and citation. Pedagogical recommendations aimed at making students’ use of <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> more effective are also offered...|$|R

2500|$|Until recently, it {{was thought}} that no Greek Church Father had taken note of the passage before the 1100s. [...] However, in 1941 a large {{collection}} of the writings of Didymus the Blind (c. 313–398) was discovered in Egypt, in which Didymus states that [...] "We find in certain gospels" [...] an episode in which a woman was accused of a sin, and was about to be stoned, but Jesus intervened [...] "and said to those who were about to cast stones, ‘He who has not sinned, let him take a stone and throw it. [...] If anyone is conscious in himself not to have sinned, let him take a stone and smite her.’ [...] And no one dared," [...] and so forth. [...] This is far from a <b>direct</b> <b>quotation,</b> but it may be a loose summary of the episode. [...] Barring the possibility that Didymus was referring to some other Gospel than the four-Gospel collection that was typically used in the churches in his time, this reference appears to establish that the passage was present in its usual place in some Greek manuscripts known in Alexandria and elsewhere from the 300s onwards.|$|E
