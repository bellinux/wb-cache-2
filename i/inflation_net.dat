After some box office flops, Vyjayanthimala soon signed {{alongside}} Rajendra Kumar in the swashbuckler ruritanian romance Suraj. Directed by T. Prakash Rao, the film had Mumtaz, Bharathi Vishnuvardhan and Neetu Singh. Suraj was huge box office success {{and was one of}} the popular costume dramas in Bollywood. Suraj was the last successful film of Rajendra Kumar and Shankar Jaikishan, who introduced singer Sharda through this film. According to Boxofficeindia.com, the film grossed around 50,000,000 with net gross of 25,000,000 and becomes second highest-grossing film of 1966 with a verdict of [...] "super hit" [...] at the box office.

Based on life of the Nagarvadhu (royal courtesan) of Vaishali Amrapali, she played the title role along with Sunil Dutt, who enacted the role of King Ajatashatru. Upon release, the film opened to widespread critical acclaim and was India's official submission for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 39th Academy Awards. The film was a colossal flop, which left Vyjayanthimala heartbroken, where she decided to quit the industry, though director Baldev Raj Chopra felt that she could have easily continued for another decade in lead roles.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{two years}} sabbatical, Vyjayanthimala re-attained her success in Bollywood through Raj Kapoor's first {{technicolor}} film Sangam. Termed as Kapoor's magnum opus, {{the film was}} produced with a lavish budget by his production company R. K. Films. Earlier in the 1940s, Kapoor planned to launch Sangam {{in the title of}} Gharonda with Dilip Kumar and Nargis and himself in the lead, however the film was delayed several times until 1962. Following Kumar and Dev Anand's refusal {{to be a part of}} the film, Kapoor then fixed Rajendra Kumar and himself as the male leads. Sangam was the first Indian film shot in Europe and outside of Asia. It was the longest running film in India when it was released at 238 minutes. The film also created a record by being the first film to have two cinema intervals. With cinematography by Radhu Kamarkar, the European filming locations include Venice, Paris, Switzerland and London, while the Indian locations include Ooty and Kashmir Valley. Upon release the film was well received by critics and was considered as Bollywood's greatest love triangle. Vyjayanthimala's performance too was praised by critics. Dinesh Raheja of Rediff said that: [...] "to put it simply, radiant...the maturity with which she tackles her character, the insouciance as well as the agony" [...] and called it [...] "one of commercial cinema's most unforgettable performances". Similarly, the film was commercially successful throughout India and other countries as well. On its overall theatrical run, Boxofficeindia.com reported that the film had grossed 8,00,00,000 and netted around [...] with its adjusted to <b>inflation</b> <b>net</b> gross about [...] Subsequently, the film was labelled as a blockbuster, where it was ranked as highest-grossing film of 1964 and the second highest-grossing film of the decade. The film was ranked at fourth by Boxofficeindia.co.in in their list of [...] "Top 50 Film of Last 50 Years" [...] which feature all-time highest grossing Bollywood film with its adjusted to inflation gross about [...] Sangam also had a great box office run outside of India where it was well received in countries such as China, Malaysia and Russia. For her role of Radha, who was caught between her husband and her former lover, Vyjayanthimala was awarded with the Filmfare Best Actress trophy. She then co-starred with Dilip Kumar for the sixth time in Ram Mukherjee's Leader. The film was a comeback film for Kumar, whose last film was Gunga Jumna, also with Vyjayanthimala. Like most of Vyjayanthimala and Kumar's films, their on-screen chemistry received praise from the critics, where Deepak Mahan from The Hindu said: [...] "What made the film even more enjoyable was the equally spirited response of doe-eyed Vyjayantimala, oozing oodles of impish charm in every frame. The pair carried the film on their shoulders, giving abundant joy and mirth to audiences with their outstanding histrionics. Their interactions make the film worth going miles to watch and it is certain that without their resolute shoulders". However, the film Leader did not fare well at the box office, where it was labelled as below average. During the making of Leader, Rediff describes Vyjayanthimala as [...] "recalcitrant" [...] which annoyed Kumar. The film was followed by Gemini Film's Zindagi, directed by Ramanand Sagar. A female-centric film, it features Vyjayanthimala alongside Rajendra Kumar, Raaj Kumar and Prithviraj Kapoor. Zindagi became a success at the box office, where it celebrated a silver jubilee theatrical run and was the fourth highest-grossing film of that year with a verdict of [...] "hit". Soon she signed for Anjali Pictures' Phoolon Ki Sej, with Ashok Kumar and Manoj Kumar, and this became her third consecutive hit of the year. Her last release in 1964 was Ishaara, in which she co-starred with actor Joy Mukherjee for the first time, and her performance ensured that the film was a box office success.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} year {{proved to be}} very successful for Vyjayanthimala where she signed opposite Dilip Kumar in Bimal Roy's Madhumati in the title role. Originally supposed to essay four roles, the director finally scaled it down to three, Madhumati, Madhavi and Radha. The film was launched {{in front of the}} Karlovy Vary International Film Festival Theatre in Czechoslovakia. During the filming at the hills of Nainital, Vyjayanthimala was required to dance with barefoot where she tripped on a stone and fell while hurting herself badly causing damage to her fibre tissues in the sole of her foot. Roy who was terrified and in a quandary over the incident as the shooting could not be stopped insisted on her wearing sandals which made it difficult for her during running sequences. Even after the completion of Madhumati, she still encountered the pain from the injury which always reminded her of Madhumati's shooting experience. Written by Ritwik Ghatak, the film is about Devendra, played by Dilip Kumar, who takes shelter during a storm in an abandoned house. Here he discovers a painting of the owner of the house Raja Ugranarayan painted by him in his previous life when was Anand, also played by Dilip Kumar, and worked as a foreman on a plantation of Raja Ugranarayan. Devendra had been in love with Madhumati, played by Vyjayanthimala. She had committed suicide while trying to save herself from Ugranarayan’s advances. Madhumati’s ghost finally takes revenge on Ugranarayan. The film was well received by critics and audience where it became highest grossing Bollywood film of 1958 and was labelled as blockbuster at box office and ended up as fifth highest-grossing film of the decade with its adjusted <b>inflation</b> <b>net</b> gross to about 586.4 million. Her performance as Madhavi, Radha and the ghost Madhumati earned her accoladates from critics. Shahid Khan from Planetbollywood.com said [...] "Vyjayantimala has never been one of my most favourite actresses but {{this is one of the}} few performances where I am completely bowled over by her. Her expressions while playing both the main characters are perfect. With Madhumati, she brings the wonder, surprise and innocence needed in the person. With Madhavi, she brings the poise, the curiosity and pity for the grief that Anand is going through" [...] and Karan Bali from Upperstall.com wrote that [...] "For Vyjayanthimala, the film showcases both her acting as well as dancing abilities and the dizzying success of Madhumati took Vyjayanthimala to the highest rungs of stardom...to cap off an extremely successful year for her. Both, as an actress of considerable dramatic merit and as a star". Madhumati came to be known as the first film which dealt with the theme of reincarnation and had a gothic noir feel to it. The film later inspired films such as Milan (1967), The Reincarnation of Peter Proud (1975), Mehbooba (1976), Kudrat (1980), Karz (1980), Karan Arjun (1995) and particularly Om Shanti Om (2007) which had also lifted the film's climax which led to Rinki Bhattacharya, the late Roy's daughter accusing the film of plagiarism and threatening legal action against its producers.|$|E

40|$|The most {{striking}} aspects of recent U. S. wage and price behavior are the small year-to-year {{variations in the}} rate of change of wages, the modest 1977 - 79 acceleration {{in the rate of}} change of both wages and the consumption deflator net of food and energy, and an unprecedented gap between the inflation rates recorded by the CPI and personal consumption deflator. A small and simple econometric model is used to forecast the consequences of various policies for the future growth of the monetary base. No policy will be able to prevent an acceleration in the growth rate of the personal consumption deflator net of food and energy from its recent 7 percent track to 8 percent or above {{in the first half of}} 1980. The gross personal consumption deflator will climb even faster, with the difference depending on the behavior of oil and food prices. Thereafter, the effect of slack labor markets will begin to allow <b>inflation</b> <b>net</b> of food and energy to decelerate substantially. A 6 percent rule for the monetary base is too conservative and causes the unemployment rate to rise to 8. 5 percent in 1982. An 8 percent rule for the base is preferable, allows the unemployment rate to begin to fall after late 1981, and still achieves a deceleration of <b>inflation</b> <b>net</b> of food and energy from 8 percent in mid- 1980 to 6 percent in 1983. Thereafter, the growth of the base should be slowed down to keep the economy from overshooting again. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of industrial producer prices is commonly observed {{as one of}} the important leading indicators of consumer price inflation. Nevertheless, there was no apparent relationship between total inflation and producer prices in the Czech Republic from 1993 to 1997. This paper is an attempt to find a possible explanation of the above mentioned paradox using statistical and econometric analyses. The main idea is that the prices of industrial producers do not have a straightforward relationship to the {{development of}} prices in the entire consumer goods basket, but only to its particular subset. Indeed, the performed correlation and regression analyses did show a relation between producer prices and the corrected inflation (with a lag of 3 to 5 months), i. e. <b>inflation</b> <b>net</b> of changes in regulated prices and food prices. As a by-product, the paper also provides some support for the importance of money supply M 2 and the nominal exchange rate as explanatory variables of inflation. ...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the distortions}} {{generated}} by inflation, those caused by its interaction with taxation are particularly important. Due to the non-indexation {{of the tax}} system, inflation exacerbates the inefficiencies generated by taxation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the welfare effects of these distortions in New Zealand. By using a stylised model of the New Zealand tax system, the tax burden on capital income is calculated for different values of the inflation rate. Following Feldstein (1997 a, 1997 b), the paper then estimates the welfare effects of going from 2 percent `true' <b>inflation</b> (<b>net</b> of measurement bias) to price stability. The benefits turn out to be about 0. 4 percent of GDP, approximately half the size of those calculated by Feldstein for the US, the difference being mainly due to a less distortionary tax system. The permanent benefits are then compared with the one-off output loss that would be involved. As for the US, the result is supportive of price stability, but it does not hold for plausible values of some key parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we reconsider {{the degree of}} {{international}} comovement of inflation rates. We use a dynamic hierarchical factor model that is able to decompose Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in a panel of countries into (i) a factor common to all inflation series and all countries, (ii) a factor specific to a given sub-section of the CPI, (iii) a country group-factor and (iv) a country-specific component. With its pyramidal structure, the model allows {{for the possibility that}} the global factor affects the country-group factor and other subordinated factors but not vice versa. Using quarterly data for industrialized and emerging economies from 1996 to 2011 we find that about two thirds of overall inflation volatility are due to country-specific determinants. For CPI <b>inflation</b> <b>net</b> of food and energy, the global factor and the CPI basketspecific factor account for less than 20 % of inflation variation.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} that the interest rate on long-term Japanese government bonds is low in comparison with other industrialised countries for four main reasons: lower <b>inflation,</b> <b>net</b> savings surplus, institutional restrictions and home bias. Monetary policy and institutionalised purchases of government bonds by semi-government agencies keep the market demand for bonds high. We find that since the 1970 s Japanese interest rate movements are better explained by the current account balance than in other industrialised countries. This is caused by sizeable net oversavings and institutional reasons increased the impact of oversavings as such on the long-term interest rate for Japan. Hence, the institutional reasons increase the coefficient value of the savings-investment balance. A reason {{for the existence of}} the high national net savings surplus could be that unsustainable budgetary deficits in Japan called for a Ricardian response. We doubt whether Ricardian equivalence is here the driving factor: household savings have actually fallen over the nineties. Corporate savings, in response to overcapacity and poor investment outlook, have risen more strongly. This has kept the private and national savings balance positive. There is also some indication that ageing has contributed to the structural current account surplus for Japan.

Target of thesis is to analyze economic and social potential of investments into energy sector particularly renewable energy source such as photovoltaics. Is estimated that increasing consumption and its constantly increasing price will result into even more blackout and electricity shortages. Energy security and its access are vital assets in development and key source for economic and human development. Without access to this asset the development {{is less likely to}} occur in Ghana. 2. Willingness of foreign investors to invest in middle and long term horizons in territory of Africa is low due to economic crises and political instability. To increase potential to invest in energy sector in Africa and particularly Ghana it is necessary to start with development aid into sector to convince potential investors in capability and rational retail ability of such investment. Development of such projects can have positive effects on both Ghana and EU in social and economic aspects. 3.

Purpose. To examine financial and clinical work productivity outcomes {{associated with the use}} of the electronic health record (EHR). Methods. 191, 360 billable clinical encounters were analyzed for 12 clinical providers over a 9 -year study period during which an EHR was implemented. Main outcome measures were clinical revenues collected per provider and secondary outcomes were charge capture, patient visit coding levels, transcription costs, patient visit volume per provider, digital drawing, and digital imaging volume. Results. The difference in <b>inflation</b> adjusted <b>net</b> clinical revenue per provider per year did not change significantly in the period after EHR implementation (mean = $ 404, 198; SD = $ 17, 912) than before (mean = $ 411, 420; SD = $ 39, 366) ...|$|R
40|$|This Working Paper {{should not}} be {{reported}} as representing {{the views of the}} IMF. The views expressed in this Working Paper are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. The paper explores the linkages between the global and domestic monetary gaps, and estimates the effects of monetary gaps on output growth, <b>inflation,</b> and <b>net</b> saving rates using panel data for 20 Asian countries for 1980 – 2008. We find a significant pass-through of the global monetary gap to domestic monetary gaps, which in turn affect output growth and inflation, in individual emerging market and developing countries in Asia. Notably, we provide evidence that the global monetary condition is partly responsible for the current account surplus in Asia. We also draw implications for monetary policy coordination for global rebalancing...|$|R
30|$|Since {{the income}} policy {{agreements}} of 1993, the Italian industrial relations are organized around two pillars. The first pillar {{is the national}} collective agreement (Contratto Collettivo Nazionale di Lavoro, CCNL), a sector-specific labour contract negotiated between the sector employers’ association and the main trade unions. Its functions include {{the definition of the}} framework that disciplines the main aspects of labour utilization and the safeguard of real wage levels. The contracts are renewed every 3  years (since 2009, it used to be every 2  years before 2009) by the main social partners. Nominal increases of the base (minimum) wage are benchmarked to an independent 3 -year-ahead forecast of <b>inflation</b> <b>net</b> of imported energetic goods. The social parties agree on the level and the evolution of the base (minimum) wage to be applied to each occupation category (distinguishing various types of blue and white collar workers, as well as middle managers, depending on the sector) over the 3 -year horizon. The second pillar is constituted by firm- or area-level labour contracts. Pay negotiations at the firm level are intended to account for firm-specific developments and local conditions, such as improved productivity or the risk of job loss. These are subordinate to the national one and can (i) modify items related to labour utilization, if the national contract allows them to, or regulate aspects not explicitly covered by the first level and (ii) provide for additional wage increases, which should both redistribute firm-level productivity gains (possibly achieved by the very same firm-level contract through more efficient organization) and align the labour cost to the ongoing labour market conditions. However, only in well-delimited cases of firm’s restructuring or crisis, second-level deals can (temporarily) cut wages below the nationally set sectoral minimum. Still, although legally possible, there is little evidence of firm-level agreement envisaging a decrease in the wage below these minima during the period of our analysis (D’Amuri et al. 2015). Furthermore, despite the introduction of fiscal incentives to promote firm- and local-level bargaining, these agreements are not very widespread (only 20 % of firms with more than 20 employees in 2010) and are limited to larger firms and to specific sectors, respectively (D’Amuri et al. 2015).|$|E
5000|$|Achieving {{these goals}} {{requires}} projecting {{what they will}} cost, and when one needs to withdraw funds. A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or <b>inflation.</b> Using <b>net</b> present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested {{in a variety of}} investments. In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks. Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity. This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks, bonds, cash and alternative investments. The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person.|$|R

AIMCo is increasing internal investments in people and technology to achieve greater cost-efficiencies {{over the next three}} years. It expects to internalize the management of an additional $8 billion of assets ($5 billion in equities and $3 billion in <b>inflation</b> sensitive). The <b>net</b> result is a projected savings of $45 million in operating costs every year, starting in 2012. These cost savings may then be passed along to the Clients on whose behalf funds are managed.|$|R
50|$|Competition {{was very}} intense for this lucrative {{market and the}} claimed {{benefits}} became ever more extravagant. Amongst Pulvermacher's many competitors in the US were the German Electric Belt Company (actually New York based), Dr Crystal's, Dr. Horn's, Addison's, Edson's, Edison's, Owen's and Heidelberg's. Edison's was founded by Thomas Edison Junior, whose father was the famous Thomas Edison. Owen's was originally New York based but expanded across the country until they were put out of business due to fraud. In Europe too, there were competitors. The Medical Battery Company of England made a popular belt. They attempted (unsuccessfully) to sue the Electrical Review when that paper accused them of quackery in 1892. The Iona Company, an Oregon-based company founded by Henry Gaylord Wilshire was still selling belts in 1926 and making large profits: $36,000 ($ <b>inflation</b> adjusted) <b>net</b> from 2,445 belts in five months. By {{the end of the}} 1920s the electric belt's popularity had severely declined (but not the public's appetite for other quack electric cures) and the scientific market had long since moved on to better electrical generation technology than chain batteries.|$|R
40|$|Although {{much work}} {{examines}} whether government bonds constitute net wealth, little attention focuses on whether government money does. Most analysts merely assert that government money is net wealth. In an inflationary environment, however, money experiences "expected-inflation discounting" just as bonds experience "tax discounting. " Indeed, Chiang and Miller (1988) find empirical {{evidence suggesting that}} the private sector discounts money more heavily than bonds. This paper provides the theoretical underpinnings for the two types of discounting in an integrated approach, where both new money and new bonds can finance the interest on outstanding bonds. We first analyze the objective aspect of bond- and money-discounting assuming {{that the private sector}} fully recognizes the economic consequences of bond and money issue. We then offer some conjectures on the subjective aspect of discounting by focusing on reasonable assumptions about the awareness of individual agents. Both aspects lend theoretical support for the view that more discounting of money exists than discounting of bonds. Finally, stability analysis of balanced growth equilibria further buttresses our theoretical findings. tax discounting, expected <b>inflation</b> discounting, <b>net</b> wealth...|$|R

This is consistent with 126 mm of deflation at the centre of the caldera with a 2. 5 - 3. 0 km depth to the source of deformation. The volume of the subsidence bowl is 6. 2 x 106 m 3. When combined with high precision microgravity measurements, the overall change in sub-surface mass may be quantified. After correction for the observed elevation change using the free air gradient of gravity measured for each station, the total change in mass is estimated to be less than 109 kg. A small residual ground <b>inflation</b> and <b>net</b> gravity increase in the eastern part of the caldera may be caused by dyke intrusion in this region. The minimum dimensions of such an intrusion or complex of intrusions are 1 m width, up to 100 m deep and up to several hundred metres thick...|$|R
