25|$|An {{important}} leadership change {{occurred in}} the beginning of the 1990s when Robert Biggs became the fourth <b>executive</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fraternity after Robert Miller stepped down. During the decade, Phi Delta Theta and many other fraternities experienced a decline in membership. The most important policy to be implemented by the fraternity during the decade was the decision made in 1997 to have all chapter facilities alcohol free by 2000. It was an initiative that was strongly pursued by the 1996–98 General Council. The policy was in response to the growing insurance claims against the fraternity, 53% of which were alcohol-related, and a return to the core values of the organization.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of this}} promotion, Paul was unofficially {{in charge}} of the {{development}} of the electric lines in the City of Los Angeles.

In 1920 he was made Vice President of Southern Pacific and assistant to the President. In 1925, he was again promoted, this time to <b>Executive</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company.

25|$|Mulroney {{took the}} job of <b>executive</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iron Ore Company of Canada, a joint {{subsidiary}} of three major U.S. steel corporations. Mulroney earned a salary well into the six-figure range. In 1977, he was appointed company president. Drawing upon his labour law experience, he instituted improved labour relations, and, with commodity prices on the rise, company profits soared during the next several years. In 1983 Mulroney successfully negotiated {{the closing of the}} Schefferville mine, winning a generous settlement for the affected workers. Under his leadership, the company was sold off to foreign interests. In the wake of his loss in the 1976 leadership race, Mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years; he credits his loyal wife Mila with helping him recover. In 1979, he permanently became a teetotaler. During his IOC term, he made liberal use of the company's executive jet, frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips. Mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country. As his business reputation grew, he was invited onto several corporate boards. He declined an offer to run in a Quebec by-election as a federal Liberal.|$|E
