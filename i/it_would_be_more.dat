5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, {{the game is}} focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than 40years {{before the}} first {{crossing}} of Antarctica was achieved, by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955–58. This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay, following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the Skelton Glacier. The entire journey took 98days.|$|E
5|$|The last train ran on 4 July 1991, {{four days}} after the plant closed. Without {{production}} at the plants {{there was no need for}} the railway; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> economical to transport the few last products by truck. The final hauled several wagons down to the coast for scrapping. The closing of the Rjukan Line also terminated operations on the Tinnoset Line, where passenger traffic had remained until 1991.|$|E

5|$|When {{some of the}} behind-the-scenes footage {{was used}} in a BET Access Granted special, some of the scenes that Beyoncé was shown {{shooting}} did {{not appear in the}} finished video. Beyoncé said that the video did not turn out the way she wanted it to be and she had to reshoot most of it. In post-production, she decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> artistic to play the events in reverse.|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E

5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and so that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> difficult to take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E
5|$|One {{security}} conscious commenter on the Engadget {{consumer electronics}} blog addressed the privacy {{implications of the}} oversize bills given the limitations of personal paper shredders, by speculating on whether <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> practical to dispose of these large bills by burning them to protect personal information. An editor for the libertarian monthly Reason also speculated about {{the usefulness of the}} detailed information to government investigators. The original Ars Technica blog posting, on the other hand, dismissed privacy concerns, showing that the detail pages do not contain sensitive information.|$|E

5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21billion. It was reported {{not only that}} a new fleet would not be available until 2024 (at which point the existing helicopters would have remained in service while being over 50 years old), but that terminating the existing program would waste more than $3billion in sunk VH-71 costs. Following the President’s decision to terminate the program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cost effective and less time consuming to continue with {{a variation of the}} existing VH-71 program.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} of the fungus is unclear, and {{depends on what}} taxonomic characters are deemed most important. According to Takahashi, the mushroom's violet pigment, the inamyloid (not staining when treated with Melzer's reagent) hymenophoral tissue (hymenium-bearing tissue), and the smooth hyphae of the outer layer of stem suggest a placement in the section Adonideae (Fr.) Quel., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. However, if greater taxonomic emphasis is placed on the weakly amyloid basidiospores, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> appropriate in the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél.|$|E
5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Final {{assembly}} for the A321 would be, as a {{first for}} any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany). This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant, and the Germans, arguing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480million (€475 million) to finance development costs. An additional $180million (€175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos left Constantinople for Adrianople, {{situated}} {{close to}} the Byzantine–Bulgarian border, in order to monitor the events and to exploit the situation in Bulgaria in his favour. The demise of Constantine Tikh {{came as a shock}} for the Byzantines. Initially, Michael VIII considered marrying his daughter to Ivaylo, but eventually decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> favourable to install a protégé of his own. His candidate was Ivan, son of former Emperor Mitso Asen, who had sought asylum in Byzantium and possessed estates in Asia Minor. Ivan promptly married Michael VIII's daughter Irene, pledged allegiance to Michael VIII and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria as Ivan Asen III. The Byzantines sent gifts to the Bulgarian nobles to incite them to support Ivan Asen III and envoys were dispatched to Tarnovo to arrange for his recognition and the surrender of Empress Maria. In the meantime, Ivan Asen III marched north {{at the head of a}} Byzantine army while Ivaylo was besieging Tarnovo.|$|E

5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{negotiated}} {{the release of}} six of the eleven men on the patrol, but {{were not able to}} gain the freedom of their Sierra Leone Army liaison officer and the other men before the West Side Boys' demands became increasingly unrealistic. Negotiators concluded that these were delaying tactics rather than an effort to resolve the crisis; by 9 September, the soldiers had been held for over a fortnight. Fearing that the soldiers would be killed or moved to a location from which <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> difficult to extract them, the British government authorised an assault on the West Side Boys' base, to take place at dawn the following day, 10 September.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} among modern scholars {{on whether}} David ceded to the Byzantines only those lands {{which had been}} granted {{to him as a}} reward for his assistance against the rebel Bardas Skleros, or if it had been the whole of his principality that was acquired by Basil II. As the former was endowed upon David for lifetime stewardship, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> reasonable to assume that he conceded his entire realm, i.e., Thither Tao/Tayk and the adjacent Armenian counties up to Lake Van. Whatever the extent of David’s domain, the Georgian kings would not so easily reconcile with the loss of those territories, leading to a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century.|$|E
