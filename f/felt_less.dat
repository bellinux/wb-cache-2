5|$|Aronofsky {{realized}} that since writing in 2000 the battle scene between {{the armies of}} Mayans and conquistadors, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Troy, King Arthur, and other films had featured massive battle scenes. He <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> inclined to mimic the scale and rewrote the battle to be mainly between Jackman's conquistador character and the Mayans. The director {{realized that}}, with one man against the army, the rewrite was a suitable metaphor for his film's theme of a man defying odds to do the impossible and conquer death.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of International Velvet, and the heavy touring that followed, the band were pleased {{to return to the}} Monnow Valley Studio to record a third studio album. On the {{recommendation}} of TommyD, the band had been recording sample tracks onto a DPS12 hard disk recorder in their tour bus while on an American tour and they returned to Monnow Valley to record them properly. The band <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> pressure on them for the new album, due to {{the success of}} International Velvet and because they no longer feared being dropped by the label.|$|E
5|$|He {{has been}} called the radical {{conservative}} of his day — not a bad designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, cautious, perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> difficulty in taking a stand; never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.|$|E

5|$|After {{assuming}} his new position, Treloar {{was sent}} to AIF Headquarters in the Middle East where Australian forces were engaged in the North African Campaign. While {{en route to the}} Middle East he visited Malaya. Conditions in North Africa proved more challenging than those in World War I, however, as the combat was fast-moving and the Australian troops <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> motivation to collect artefacts than those of the First AIF. Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell out with his second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency. He also lacked a patron in the AIF and was handicapped by his relatively junior rank. Due to his absence from the Memorial, Treloar had only limited input into the design of its galleries and he was unable to attend its official opening in November 1941.|$|E
25|$|The AFL then {{attempted}} to organize {{workers on the}} AA's behalf. The AFL's strategy was twofold. First, the federation would wait for a strong upturn in economic conditions. When workers <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> dependence on their employer and showed signs of restiveness, the organization would initiate an organizing effort. Second, the federation would create staff-driven unions run from national AFL headquarters. Samuel Gompers and other AFL leaders had a nativist view of the unskilled immigrants working in steel plants. Distrusting immigrant workers to manage their own affairs, the AFL intended to run unions for them.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1671 the {{composition}} of the Comédiens du Roi had significantly altered. Villiers had retired, and Floridor, Montfleury, and Beauchasteau had died. Also departed were the wives of Montfleury and Villiers, and the Mlles Bellerose and Baron. New to the company were Brécourt (Guillaume Marcoureau) and his wife (Étiennette Des Urlis), Champmeslé (Charles Chevillet) and his wife (Marie Desmares), La Fleur (François Juvenon), Poisson's wife (Victorine Guérin), and the outstanding tragic actress Mlle. Dennebault (Françoise Jacob, the daughter of Montfleury). These new company members <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> competitive with Molière, some of them having already been his associates.|$|E

25|$|Music {{has been}} found to be an {{effective}} tool for music therapists through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study found that children who listened to music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> pain than the children who did not listen to music while having an IV inserted.|$|E
25|$|Pollock {{was sacked}} {{from his post}} as team manager in 2002 and was {{replaced}} by Prodrive boss David Richards. Along with Pollock, Richards sacked Technical Director Malcolm Oastler and fifty members of staff at BAR. The Englishman soon began to debate over Villeneuve's £15 million annual salary. From this point on, Villeneuve <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> comfortable at the team. The BAR 004 proved to be a much less competitive car than the teams' previous two, with neither Villeneuve or Panis scoring points consistently with only seven points scored between them, Villeneuve scoring four points to Panis's three.|$|E
25|$|Lee Malia {{has stated}} that the typical writing process {{involves}} Oliver Sykes writing the main structure of the songs, followed by Malia writing the main riff. From this they would collaborate {{with each other to}} structure their work better and then to later include the rest of the band in writing the rest of the song. The writing dynamic of Sempiternal, typically featured Sykes, Malia and newly introduced member Jordan Fish, Malia felt that with Fish's influence on the record he was pushed to create more inspired guitar riffs. As they all took a break before writing their fourth album they <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> of a need for an isolated writing environment.|$|E

25|$|A reanalysis of the AAUW data {{found that}} {{victims of sexual}} {{harassment}} by teachers reported experiencing adverse health effects because of the abuse. 28% {{said that they had}} trouble sleeping and lost their appetite, 51% reported feeling embarrassed, and 37% indicated that they <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> sure of themselves or less confident {{as a result of the}} sexual harassment. Furthermore, 36% of the students said that they were afraid or scared and 29% reported feeling confused about their identity. In addition to negatively affecting health outcomes, teacher sexual abuse influenced the victims' academic performance. The affected students avoided the teacher (43%), they did not want to go to school (36%), avoided talking in class (34%), had trouble paying attention (31%), cut classes (29%), or found it hard to study (29%).|$|E
25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
25|$|Thinking of virginity as {{a stigma}} disempowered many boys {{because they felt}} deeply ashamed and often tried {{to hide the fact}} that they were virgins from their partners, which for some {{resulted}} in their partners teasing them and criticizing them about their limited sexual techniques. The girls who viewed virginity as a stigma did not experience this shaming. Even though they privately thought of virginity as a stigma, these girls believed that society valued their virginity because of the stereotype that women are sexually passive. This, they said, made it easier for them to lose their virginity once they wanted to because they felt society had a more positive view on female virgins and that this may have made them sexually attractive. Thinking of losing virginity as part of a natural developmental process resulted in less power imbalance between boys and girls because these individuals <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> affected by other people and were more in control of their individual sexual experience. Adolescent boys, however, were more likely than adolescent girls to view their loss of virginity as a positive aspect of their sexuality because it is more accepted by peers.|$|E
25|$|Their next album, The Empire Strikes First, was {{released}} in June 2004. Like The Process of Belief, it is widely regarded by fans as {{a return to the}} faster punk-style songwriting that some <b>felt</b> was <b>less</b> prominent in the band's music during their time on Atlantic.|$|R

500|$|The {{progression}} system received criticism. Ingenito {{thought that}} it was an unnecessary addition to the game. He added that the upgrade system hides a lot of content from players unless they play the game frequently. Lathi however thought that after every character is unlocked, he <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> motivated to continue to play the game. LaBella thought that the system does not offer enough content and described it as [...] "thin". This was echoed by Strom, who felt that unlocking the characters was a [...] "grind".|$|E
500|$|Arriving back in London in October 1952, David began a {{relationship}} with an old flame from India, Peter Higgins, a divorced stockbroker; {{it was the beginning}} of the happiest period of her life. She spent the following months writing the book, recreating the recipes to work out the correct measurements. She <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> emotionally connected to Italy than with Greece and southern France and found the writing [...] "uncommonly troublesome", although [...] "as recipe after recipe came out... I realized how much I was learning, and how enormously these dishes were enlarging my own scope and enjoyment". Italian Food was published in November 1954. At the time, many of the ingredients used in the recipes were difficult to obtain in Britain. Looking back in 1963, David wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Li'l Sebastian, {{a miniature}} horse beloved by {{the residents of}} Pawnee, was first introduced in [...] "Harvest Festival", which was also written by Goor. The writers considered having a human character die in [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] rather than the miniature horse, like previously-mentioned characters Mayor Gunderson or Councilman Bill Dexhart. However, they decided that having an animal character die <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> morbid and more appropriate for the finale of a comedy series. The episode ends with Tom and Jean-Ralphio in their new Entertainment 720 headquarters, a completely white [...] room with modern decor and unusual furniture. Schur described the setting as [...] "maybe the craziest thing that's ever been on our series. ... Every time I watch it in the edit bay, I have this weird crisis: 'Is this OK that this scene is how we're ending this entire season?' It's truly nuts. It's like a hallucinogenic nightmare." ...|$|E

500|$|Hall, meanwhile, had {{received}} feedback from parents {{who did not}} like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; {{he did not want}} the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and for the next games added in a stun gun instead. He also removed the pogo stick from the game, both to symbolize that Keen was in a nightmare and therefore <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> empowered, and also to make designing the levels easier as vertical motion {{did not need to be}} as accounted for. Once the parallax scrolling and design changes were completed, Keen Dreams was completed in less than a month even as the team simultaneously worked on another game. A song written by Bobby Prince titled [...] "Eat Your Vegetables" [...] was planned for the game, and lyrics were written, but it was rejected by Softdisk as it would have made the game too large to fit on a single floppy disk.|$|E
500|$|While in Venice {{during her}} culinary tour of Italy, David met the artist Renato Guttuso. They {{struck up a}} friendship, and he agreed to {{illustrate}} her book, which he did, despite the very small fee offered by David's publisher. With two successful books already published, David <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> in need of extracts from earlier writers to bolster her own prose. The Times Literary Supplement said, [...] "More than a collection of recipes, this is book is in effect a readable and discerning [...] dissertation on Italian food and regional dishes, and their preparation in the English kitchen. The text is divided into kinds of food, with chapters on rice, pasta and Italian wines." [...] In The Observer, Freya Stark wrote, [...] "Mrs. David … may be counted among the benefactors of humanity." [...] In The Sunday Times, [...] Evelyn Waugh named Italian Food {{as one of the}} two books that had given him the most pleasure in that year. In 2009, Sir Terence Conran called it [...] "the very best book about Italian food that has ever been published here".|$|E
500|$|The English {{version of}} First Departure {{received}} mixed to average reviews, earning a 77% rating on GameRankings and a 74 out of 100 average from Metacritic. Many reviewers felt {{that despite the}} updated graphics and sound, the game still <b>felt</b> <b>less</b> refined than more modern role-playing games. IGN found the game to have a [...] "bland, awkwardly-told narrative" [...] with [...] "weak characters", but that it would appeal to fans of older games, stating [...] "If {{you can look at}} First Departure and understand that it's based on a very old title, you'll likely be able to overlook the problems and get a fair amount of satisfaction". GameSpot also stated that the title had [...] "limited appeal" [...] in addition to providing little challenge. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com, however, called First Departure an [...] "overlooked classic" [...] with [...] "ridiculously engrossing crafting minutiae" [...] and numerous character party combinations that increase its replay value. GameSpy would additionally declare that [...] "Despite a couple of minor hitches, Star Ocean: First Departure {{is one of the best}} remakes Square Enix has brought to portable consoles." ...|$|E
