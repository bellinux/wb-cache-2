5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the <b>design</b> <b>specification.</b> This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the <b>design</b> <b>specification</b> in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E
5|$|Campbell had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder network topology using capacitors and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary <b>design</b> <b>specification</b> could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E
5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder <b>design</b> <b>specification.</b> Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E

40|$|Customer {{oriented}} {{design is}} more and more important. Quality Function Deployment is often used as a tool to better catch customer wants and has them translated into <b>design</b> <b>specifications.</b> The <b>design</b> <b>specifications</b> are then translated into <b>design</b> <b>specifications</b> of the production system. QFD is not always a sufficient tool to sustain the product management team through this translation process. The solution is found in adding elements from the method of the Scientific Design Process to QFD. In SDP, the following levels in <b>design</b> <b>specifications</b> are used: function, task, properties, and physical state. Process knowledge is the direct link between these <b>design</b> <b>specifications</b> for the product and the means of production. The design activity comprises decomposition in functions matched to a composition in tasks. The integration of SDP into QFD will reduce the number of iterations.

25|$|During 1945, in {{response}} to an approach made by the British Ministry of Supply, which had been seeking design submissions from aviation companies for an envisioned new long range civil flying boat, which was to operate in BOAC's fleet to operate its transatlantic passenger services, Saunders-Roe decided to submit a bid based upon the earlier collaborative <b>design</b> <b>specification.</b> Following evaluations of a range of different propulsion methods and configurations, the design team selected the in-development Bristol Proteus – one of the first turboprop engines – to meet the enormous power requirements of the proposed giant flying boat. In May 1946, the bid made by Saunders-Roe was selected as the winner, leading to the company receiving an order for the production of three SR.45 flying boats.|$|E
25|$|When {{design work}} began in November 1940, the AC1 was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} 2 pounder gun-equipped vehicle, that was intended to be a true Cruiser tank, with a weight of between 16 and 20 tonnes. Due to a lack of home grown experience in tank design a mission was sent to the US to examine the M3 design and Colonel W.D. Watson MC, an artillery officer with many years of tank design experience was provided by the UK. He arrived in December 1940. Like the Canadian Ram, the Australian Cruiser was {{to be based on the}} engine, drive train, and lower hull of the American M3 Medium tank, mated to an upper hull and turret built closely along the lines of a British Crusader. By 1942, attempting to keep pace with German tank developments, the <b>design</b> <b>specification</b> had become more like an American medium tank, resulting in a heavier design and a higher silhouette profile.|$|E
25|$|On August 26, 2003, the CAIB {{issued its}} {{report on the}} accident. The report {{confirmed}} the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in {{the leading edge of}} the left wing, caused by insulating foam shed during launch. The report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident. The report was highly critical of NASA's decision-making and risk-assessment processes. It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions. An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager, where one individual was responsible for achieving safe, timely launches and acceptable costs, which are often conflicting goals. The CAIB report found that NASA had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences. One of those was the conflict between a <b>design</b> <b>specification</b> stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight. The board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture.|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1990 McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics {{revealed}} delays and projected cost increases. [...] Due to complications with the composite materials, aircraft weight had increased to 30% over <b>design</b> <b>specification.</b> This was unwelcome for an airplane {{that needed to}} operate efficiently and effectively from an aircraft carrier. Technical difficulties with {{the complexity of the}} radar system to be used also caused costs to increase; by one estimate the A-12 was to consume up to 70% of the Navy's budget for aircraft. [...] After delays, its critical design review was successfully completed in October 1990 and the maiden flight was rescheduled to early 1992. In December 1990 plans were made for 14 Navy aircraft carriers to equipped with a wing of 20 A-12s each.|$|E
500|$|On 11 March 1943, the Cabinet of the United Kingdom {{formed the}} Brabazon Committee to {{determine}} the UK's airliner needs after {{the conclusion of the}} Second World War. One of its recommendations was for a pressurised, transatlantic mailplane that could carry non-stop, one long ton (1.0 t) of payload at a cruising speed of 400mph (640km/h). De Havilland chose to challenge the widely held scepticism of jet engines as too fuel-hungry and unreliable, So committee member Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, head of the de Havilland company, used his personal influence and his company's expertise to champion the development of a jet propelled aircraft; and proposed a specification for a pure turbojet-powered design. The committee accepted the proposal, calling it the [...] "Type IV" [...] (of five designs), and awarded a development and production contract to de Havilland under the designation Type 106 in February 1945. The type and design were to be so advanced that De Havilland had to undertake the design and development of both the airframe and the engines. This was because in 1945 no turbojet engine manufacturer in the world was drawing up a <b>design</b> <b>specification</b> for an engine with the thrust and specific fuel consumption, that could power an aircraft at the proposed cruising altitude (40 thousand feet), speed, and transatlantic range as was called for by the Type 106. First-phase development of the DH 106 focused on short and intermediate range mailplanes with a small passenger compartment and as few as six seats, before being redefined as a long-range airliner with a capacity of 24 seats. Out of all the Brabazon designs, the DH 106 was seen as the riskiest both in terms of introducing untried design elements and for the financial commitment involved. Nevertheless, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) found the Type IV's specifications attractive, and initially proposed a purchase of 25 aircraft; in December 1945, when a firm contract was laid out, the order total was revised to 10.|$|E

2500|$|The thrust {{required}} {{of the new}} engine, then designated B.E.10 (later Olympus), would initially be [...] with growth potential to [...] The pressure ratio would be an unheard of 9:1. To achieve this, the initial design used a low-pressure (LP) axial compressor and a high-pressure (HP) centrifugal compressor, each being driven by its own single-stage turbine. This two-spool design eliminated the need for features such as {{variable inlet guide vanes}} (Avon, J79), inlet ramps (J65), variable stators (J79) or compressor bleed (Avon) which were required on single spool compressors with pressure ratios above about 6:1. Without these features an engine could not be started nor run at low speeds without destructive blade vibrations. Nor could they accelerate to high speeds with fast acceleration times ("spool up") without surge. The design was progressively modified and the centrifugal HP compressor was replaced by an axial HP compressor. This reduced the diameter of the new engine to the <b>design</b> <b>specification</b> of [...] The Bristol Type 172 was cancelled though development continued for the Avro Vulcan and other projects.|$|E
