5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal {{standard}} referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E

5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic faith of Islam. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> that their faith says {{that there can be}} only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an {{interest}} in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E

5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life.

In the commentary to A Vision of the Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed him to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A Vision of the Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E
5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy {{lay in his}} influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments.

Later <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> that being at {{the receiving end of}} an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E

She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E
5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead. Within his classification of demons, <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Cariappa was {{the first}} of two Indians {{selected}} to undergo training at the Imperial Defence College, at Camberly, in the UK, to attend the higher command courses. With the experience he had gained at the Imperial Defence College, Cariappa felt that dividing the Indian Army during the partition would have a devastating effect on both sides. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> to the hierarchy that without the help of British officers, there was a risk of inexperienced Indian officers taking over higher commands. But his concern was not addressed. During the disquieting period of partition he handled the division of the Army and sharing of its assets between the two new nations as the officer in charge.|$|E

Coppola then appealed his suit, {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E
5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{commented that}} the outside {{environment}} {{was very difficult to}} create. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> that the reason previous games were primarily set indoors is because the current consoles were not powerful enough to portray a true jungle environment. In contrast with urban environments, the jungle does not have a flat surface. The protagonist in Snake Eater has to cross uneven terrain, including rocks, dirt mounds, and treestumps. As a result, the collision engine used in previous installments could not be used, and a new one had to be built from scratch. Setting up the motion capture technology so players could walk over these mounds was a problem during development.|$|E
