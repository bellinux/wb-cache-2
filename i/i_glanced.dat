2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> out the porthole and all I could see was a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly thereafter, however, Lt. Comdr. Carpenter, the ship's navigator, who seldom {{left the}} bridge, shouted, [...] "Hard right rudder, DeLong." [...] I spun the rudder over hard right and started singing out the course changes every ten degrees. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> out the {{porthole}} as the bow swung past {{the line of}} sight to the Juneau {{who had been on}} our starboard quarter in the formation. The ship was swinging at a rapid speed now and I {{had no idea what was}} going on.|$|E
2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at my grandfatherâ€“ his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at this {{question}} rather {{to express a}} detachment than a view.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> {{up at my}} companion, [...] "that {{was surely}} the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glance</b> back to {{discover}} the landlord and a gracefully robed woman standing outside the pretty simplicity of the Utopian inn, watching us doubtfully as we recede.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at Mabane. His {{confirmation}} {{was swift}} and decisive.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at Lady Angela. She {{was looking}} white and troubled.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards the}} ballroom, but my {{companion}} shook his head.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If it's {{really the}} same person,' said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> towards him, 'it {{was at a}} place called Salem House where we were together, and he was an {{excellent}} fellow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seldom {{that one}} {{experiences}} a calm so perfect," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> upward at the slowly-rising smoke. [...] "Don't {{you think it}} is the proverbial calm before the storm?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We rather thought," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> at Richard and Ada, who entreated me {{with their}} eyes to speak, [...] "that perhaps {{she was a little}} unmindful of her home." ...|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards his}} companion, {{and he had}} no alternative.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at Sir Henry. He, too, had {{coloured}} {{up to the}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at {{the latter}} deferentially {{as he stood}} looking out of window.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have an {{impending}} engagement," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> at Wemmick, who was putting fish into the post-office, [...] "that renders me rather uncertain of my time. At once, I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|He sits not a dozen yards away. If <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> over my {{shoulder}} I can see him. And if I catch his eye--and usually I catch his eye--it meets me with an expression---- ...|$|R
6000|$|So we met and passed, <b>I</b> <b>glancing</b> at them idly {{and guiding}} my horses {{to the side}} of the road. When there were perhaps ten yards between us I heard Lady Blanche cry: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{across at}} the girl. She was {{watching}} her uncle with distressed face.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{around the}} room. We were {{absolutely}} alone, but I dropped my voice.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> up. He was strolling leisurely {{along the}} poop {{on the port}} side.|$|E
60|$|He sits not a dozen yards away. If <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> over my {{shoulder}} I can see him. And if I catch his eye--and usually I catch his eye--it meets me with an expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> {{towards the}} new-comer {{and the other}} {{occupants}} of the kitchen. [...] "Nobody seems to welcome her. I should hardly judge {{that she was an}} expected guest." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Angela and <b>I</b> {{exchanged}} <b>glances.</b> <b>I</b> {{think that}} we should both have laughed but for the tears which we had seen in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|The vulture wheeled and sank, sank and wheeled. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards the}} Boers, {{and saw that}} they were all of them on their knees. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> towards the Zulus, and {{saw that they were}} {{watching}} as, I think, they had never watched anything before, for to them this was a new excitement. Then I fixed my eyes upon the bird.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{around at}} the little army of {{servants}} moving noiselessly about on all sides.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at him, {{surprised}} at the question. He {{was staring at the}} English shore.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>glance</b> {{like the}} {{wildfire}} through country and town; [...] I'm {{seen on the}} causeway--I'm seen on the down; [...] The lightning that flashes so bright and so free, [...] Is scarcely so blithe or so bonny as me." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} here, is {{modestly}} brooding behind a damp apron pendent from a clothes-line. As <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at him <b>I</b> become--but I don't know why--vaguely reminded of Woolwich, Chatham, Portsmouth, and Dover. When we get out, my respected fellow-constable Sharpeye, addressing Mr. Superintendent, says: ...|$|R
6000|$|How solemn, as one by one, As {{the ranks}} returning, all worn and sweaty--as the men file by where I [...] stand; As the faces, the masks appear--as <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at the faces, {{studying}} the [...] masks; As <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> upward {{out of this}} page, studying you, dear friend, whoever you [...] are;-- How solemn the thought of my whispering soul, to each in the ranks, and to [...] you! I see, behind each mask, that wonder, a kindred soul. O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend, Nor the bayonet stab what you really are. --The soul, yourself, I see, great as any, good as the best, Waiting secure and content,--which the bullet could never kill, Nor the bayonet stab, O friend! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at {{the figure}} of our {{commander}} in the boat ahead, and took courage.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{out of the}} window. For {{many reasons}} I {{did not wish to}} prolong this interview.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards the}} bed. Guest was sleeping, or feigning sleep. My companion's eyes {{followed}} mine sympathetically.|$|E
6000|$|He sits {{at one of}} {{the little}} club tables in the huge bay by the fire, stuffing. What is he stuffing? <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> judiciously and catch him biting at a round of hot buttered tea-cake, with his eyes on me. Confound him!--with his eyes on me! ...|$|R
