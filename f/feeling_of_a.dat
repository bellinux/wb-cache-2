5|$|Bashō was {{introduced}} to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scene in a few simple elements.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been a general <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shift in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of local law {{was a step}} towards unifying and defining the peoples' belonging to a specific state within the Low Countries, however it did not produce a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common nationality across the entire territory.|$|E

25|$|Neurological-developmental delay This is {{the most}} common cause of {{bedwetting}}. Most bedwetting children are simply delayed in developing the ability to stay dry and have no other developmental issues. Studies suggest that bedwetting may be due to a nervous system that is slow to process the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full bladder.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} is {{cast as a}} broad rondo in two main sections: ABAB–CADA. The {{first half of the}} movement sets up the expectation of an ABABA pattern. The interruption of this pattern with new music just before its expected conclusion gives the rest of the movement the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vast extension. This extended leave-taking acts as a coda for the suite as a whole.|$|E
25|$|NAC Breda’s longest-running and deepest rivalry is {{with their}} nearest neighbour, Willem II from Tilburg, colloquially known as Stillem II (English: Quietness II). This rivalry {{originated}} in the twenties of the 20th century. Matches between the two {{are referred to as}} the derby of Brabant. The two cities of Breda and Tilburg are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that it is city against city with local pride at stake.|$|E

25|$|The {{district}} is interesting {{because of the}} large number of wood-framed outbuildings still remaining from the district's main period of significance (1855–1930). The {{district is}} also significant for the large number of mid-19th-century vernacular homes and commercial buildings which remain intact and retain a large amount of their architectural integrity. The buildings contribute {{to the understanding of the}} agricultural, social, and commercial history of late-19th-century and early-20th-century northern Illinois. Together the structures and their lots convey the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small and active pre-Great Depression farming community. The Scales Mound Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 5, 1990.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} plot, or perhaps more {{accurately}} plot device, Plautus {{served as a}} source of inspiration and also provided the possibility of adaptation for later playwrights. The many deceits that Plautus layered his plays with, giving the audience the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> genre bordering on farce, appear in much of the comedy written by Shakespeare and Molière. For instance, the clever slave has important roles in both L'Avare and L'Etourdi, two plays by Molière, and in both drives the plot and creates the ruse just like Palaestrio in Miles Gloriosus. These similar characters set up the same kind of deceptions in which many of Plautus' plays find their driving force, which is not a simple coincidence.|$|E
25|$|The Man on a Balcony leans nonchalantly {{against a}} {{balustrade}} occupying the foreground of the composition. At first glance he appears bathed in natural light. But upon close examination {{there is no}} clear light source or direction from which the light emanates, giving the overall work the theatrical <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stage set. Aimed at a wide audience, the models monumental three-dimensional presence 'gazes' at the spectator, while the spectator contemplates the painting in return. Just as in Gleizes' Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon (1911) and Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) of the same year, there is present throughout an interplay of perpendicular lines and hyperbolic arcs that produce a rhythm that permeate the complex urban backdrop; here of smokestacks, train tracks, windows, bridge girders and clouds (the view from the balcony of the doctors office on the avenue de l'Opéra).|$|E

50|$|Many {{instances}} of interpersonal emotion regulation, {{such as those}} described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence the <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence the <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> whole group <b>of</b> followers {{to make them feel}} more enthusiastic and motivated. Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence the <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.|$|R
25|$|Pollokshields was {{established}} by the Stirling-Maxwell family in 1849, and was set out or 'feued' by the Edinburgh architect David Rhind. Many well-known Glaswegian architects contributed to its development and, amongst others, it contains villas by Alexander 'Greek' Thomson. There are several contributions by contemporaries of Charles Rennie Mackintosh including a series of good 'Glasgow style' tenements by the architect H. E. Clifford, who was also responsible for the 'A' listed Pollokshields Burgh Hall, in Scottish Baronial style which was inaugurated in 1890, with Maxwell Park. The ground for Maxwell Park was given by Sir John Stirling-Maxwell of Nether Pollok in 1888, and the park was formally opened at the same time. Such was its early population growth Pollokshields attained 'burgh' status in 1876. However, this ended in 1891 when after being offered favourable tax terms {{the residents of the}} burgh agreed to it becoming a suburb of the growing city of Glasgow. The Victorian and Edwardian architecture and the parks of this area have remained almost untouched, leaving the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> leafy Victorian suburb, while being well within the city.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{thought of}} the whole set as a metaphor of life, {{describing}} the stage as having [...] "a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship, which is the voyage, with the rigging and the climbing and the ropes. And the bottom circular area is like the Circus of Lights, so it really is from birth, and the voyaging through life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene has}} been {{described}} as overly intimate. [...] Both the arrangement of the furniture and the lighting contribute to this intimacy. [...] Deborah Solomon describes the scene as having [...] "some of the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French interior, with lovely haut-art touches. Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal stated [...] "This reference to the war is so specific that it conveys little about fear or Roosevelt's plan for universal disarmament. Rockwell just could not get his hands around these airy abstractions." ...|$|E

500|$|Where You Go I Go Too {{comprises}} three tracks, roughly 30, 10, and 15 {{minutes in}} duration, which seamlessly flow {{into each other}} in transitions that were described as [...] "gradual and subtle". The songs grow and develop independent musical traits, such as motifs, polyrhythms, and melodies. According to The Guardian, some musical changes are pronounced, such as {{the introduction of a}} synthesizer, while others, such as small tempo changes, remain [...] "almost insensible". Some critics have noted the album conjures the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> journey.|$|E
500|$|The song, [...] "Hey! It's a Happy Day!" [...] quotes Hubbard's Scientology: A New Slant On Life. [...] Songs {{are set to}} [...] "cheesy synth-keyboard backing" [...] {{and feature}} [...] "sublimely clunky dance breaks". [...] An {{electronic}} score emphasizes the musical's [...] "loony conviction", while sleigh bells give the play a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "jazzed-up saint's play". [...] The songs incorporate video game music, and [...] "beats from a child's keyboard synthesizer." [...] The music in the show has been compared with the symphonic band Polyphonic Spree, and with the educational short films of Schoolhouse Rock.|$|E
500|$|... "The Survivor" [...] {{was first}} {{broadcast}} on NBC on October 13, 1973. Edward Gross, the {{senior editor of}} Cinescape Magazine, rates [...] "The Survivor" [...] as [...] "an above-average episode" [...] that [...] "definitely has the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> live-action [...] show." [...] Marc Altman compared it to other similarly-themed episodes such as [...] "The Man Trap", which featured a shape-changing alien and a lost love, and said [...] "the shape-changing alien is a familiar genre (and Trekkian trope), the romantic twist in which the Vendorian spy betrays his Romulan masters for love is a nice surprise." ...|$|E

"Lunch Time Cypher" [...] {{was meant}} to give the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high school cypher, {{complete}} with beatboxing, random, crazy lyrics from Hopsin, and featured artists Passionate MC and G-Mo Skee. The song [...] "What's My Purpose" [...] is, according to Hopsin, [...] "about a human born into this current dark society. How everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. Nobody is really different. And the government has us here to just make money." [...] He also touches on his race-related arrest after a concert in Orlando, Florida. The album's outro [...] "Caught In the Rain" [...] discusses about how Hopsin is soul-searching and needing to find himself.|$|E
500|$|The opening chase scene, {{involving}} Gosling's character, {{was filmed}} primarily by Refn within the car's interior. In an interview, he revealed {{the idea for}} this scene was to emulate the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "diver in an ocean of sharks," [...] never leaving the vehicle during a car chase so that the audience can see what's happening from the character's point of view. Tight on money and time, he shot the scene in two days. With two different set-ups prepared in the car, the director {{found it difficult to}} have mobility with the camera, so he would switch the camera to two additional set-ups nearby. As downtown Los Angeles had been rejuvenated, Refn avoided certain areas to maintain the novel's gloomy atmosphere, which was helped by the scene being shot at low-angles with minimal light.|$|E
500|$|Producer Harve Bennett was {{exhausted}} by {{his work on}} the previous three Star Trek films and wanted to move on, feeling that he {{was not part of the}} Star Trek [...] "family" [...] and that he had been mistreated by Nimoy. When Shatner tried to convince Bennett to reconsider, the producer insisted on a meeting at his home. After several hours of discussion Bennett agreed to return. Bennett disagreed with several elements of Shatner's story, feeling that because no one could assuredly answer the question of God's existence, the ending of the film would never be satisfying. Bennett also told Shatner that the film had the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tone poem rather than an adventure story. The studio agreed with Bennett, reasoning that the subject matter could be too weighty or offensive to theatergoers.|$|E
