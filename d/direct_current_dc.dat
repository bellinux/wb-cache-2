5|$|Solar panels produce <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> (<b>DC)</b> electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to alternating current (AC), {{which is the}} form transmitted by the electricity grid. This conversion is done by inverters. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each solar array string close to its peak power point.|$|E
5|$|The {{array of}} a {{photovoltaic}} power system, or PV system, produces <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> (<b>DC)</b> power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), {{through the use}} of inverters. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.|$|E

The alternating current (AC) lines to the Central China Grid have a total capacity of 12,000 MW.

5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> (<b>DC)</b> bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> (<b>DC)</b> or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> (<b>DC)</b> link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

We tested the functional effects of very weak scalp DC (< 0. 5 mA, 7 s) on the human motor cortex by assessing the changes in motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic brain stimulation. We performed four different experiments in 15 healthy volunteers. Our findings led {{to the conclusion that}} such weak (< 0. 5 mA) anodal scalp DC, alternated with a cathodal DC, significantly depresses the excitability of the human motor cortex, providing evidence that a small electric field crosses the skull and influences the brain. A possible mechanism of action of scalp DC is the hyperpolarization of the superficial excitatory interneurones in the human motor cortex.

We report the effect of the magnetic field-dependent fluxon core size on flux flow resistivity rho_f. Much {{progress has been made in}} minimizing the technical challenges associated with the use of high currents. Attainment of a FFF phase is indicated by the saturation at highest currents of flux-flow dissipation levels that are well below the normal state resistance and have field-dependent values.

The results reflect lithology, pore water saturation, and dissolved solids in the pore water. If the pore water has a pH less than 5, conductivity maps can indicate acid generating potential. IP measurements can help distinguish mineralogy in mine dumps, especially concentrations of sulfide minerals. EM and DC can help locate acidic/high TDS groundwater associated with mine dumps.

25|$|Impedance is the {{opposition}} to the flow of alternating current (AC) in a complex system.

Therefore, the objective of this work was to test the null hypothesis that low electric <b>direct</b> <b>currents</b> (<b>DC)</b> do not influence chlorhexidine (CHX) efficacy against the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis within a biofilm. A brain heart infusion medium inoculated with Streptococcus gordonii and P. gingivalis was perfused for 7 days in anaerobiosis through two modified Robbins devices (MRD) assembled in parallel. Biofilms grew on hydroxyapatite discs placed {{at the bottom of the}} MRD plugs, and were then treated for 10 min with either CHX or CHX/DC (1. 5 mA or 10 mA). The bactericidal effect against biofilms was then evaluated by comparing the mean proportions of P. gingivalis killed. In the first series of experiments (CHX ± 1. 5 mA), the proportions of P. gingivalis killed were 81. 1 % for biofilms undergoing CHX and 79. 1 % when they were additionally treated with 1. 5 mA (p> 0. 05). In the second series (CHX ± 10 mA), the viability of P. gingivalis was reduced by 87. 3 % with CHX and 98. 9 % when CHX was supplemented with 10 mA (p< 0. 01). The null hypothesis was rejected, since a significant enhancement of the chlorhexidine 0. 2 % efficacy against P. gingivalis was observed when applying 10 mA currents...|$|R
