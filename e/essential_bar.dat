40|$|Accurate edge {{localization}} is <b>essential</b> in <b>bar</b> code decoding. Since {{speckle noise}} {{is the most}} dominant form of noise in laser bar code scanners, {{it is important to}} fully understand its effects on edge detection. Starting with the basic statistical properties of speckle patterns, we present stochastic analysis of speckle noise. We derive the autocorrelation function and power spectral density (PSD) of the noise in terms of intensity distribution of the scanning beam. We then study the signal-to-noise ratio for signals that result from scanning different configurations of edges. Next, we consider statistical properties of edge localization error caused by speckle noise. We show that the standard deviation of the error is determined by the PSD of the noise and relative positions of edges in a bar code symbol. Based on the analysis presented here, we propose new criteria for system design...|$|R
40|$|Fluid Dynamics {{provides}} a sound insight to the geomorphologist {{interested in the}} ubiquitous formation of regular sedimentary patterns by rivers (like bars, braids and meanders). Many theoretical advances as well as laboratory experiments tend to prove that those patterns do not simply reflect a general turbulence pattern. Instead, their formation results from the interaction between a surface flow and an erodible substrate. The interface separating the sediment layer from water {{is found to be}} unstable in many cases. In particular, small laboratory flumes are able to generate regular sediment patterns, at Reynolds number of the order of, or below 100. This suggests that turbulence is not <b>essential</b> to <b>bars,</b> braids and maybe meanders formation. Laminar flumes then become simple models of their natural turbulent counterparts. This poster presents the linear stability analysis of a laminar flow confined in a slowly erodible channel. The basic state is an infinite straight river, which profile is to be determined...|$|R
40|$|With Romania’s {{accession}} to the European Union, {{the practice of}} the legal profession has known a new dimension. Thus, since 1 January, 2007, Romanian lawyers can practice their profession, occasionally or permanently, in any of the European Union member states, as well as in states that are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. However, there is an increasing need for uniform and high-level training of lawyers in the European Union, in the context of developing the European integration process. This is mainly due to {{the very nature of the}} legal profession, which requires a very high level of competence in relation to the increasing complexity of social and economic relationships, as well as guaranteeing the protection of fundamental citizen rights. The rigorous and in-depth knowledge of national and European law norms, along with ethical correctness in the legal profession, are <b>essential</b> conditions for <b>Bar</b> Associations across Europe in the full implementation of fundamental rights, as recognized in the CCBE Charter regarding the legal profession...|$|R
5000|$|The 1965 {{deployment}} {{was somewhat}} marred by {{the refusal of}} the NZ Ministry of External Affairs or the NZ and British ambassadors to allow Royalist to dock with RN warships, in the Tokyo or Yokohama area. According to the RN attache in Tokyo, the RNZN sailors 'could not afford the 1 pound a minute price in the Ginza nightclubs and bars' [...] The captain of Royalist, J.P. Vallant replied to the Deputy Secretary of Defence in Wellington, 'find it quaint that the flagship of the NZ navy is persona non grata in the Tokyo Bay area'. Royalist was confined to the Japanese provincial ports when NZ diplomats persuaded the local police chiefs that their request for a curfew was unwise and it was <b>essential</b> to keep <b>bars</b> open 24 hours. After further shore leave in Bangkok, Singapore, and Subic Bay, Royalist returned to NZ, after a valiant repair of a milking boiler and turbine en route. It was unable to make its final scheduled 1966 visit for Waitangi Day and tour of the NZ ports, and was effectively paid off 5 months early.|$|R
40|$|Only {{patients}} with a severe pectus excavatum deformity should be candidates for surgical repair. Mild and moderate degrees of deformity should be treated with a deep breathing and exercise program and the vacuum bell. The best age for repair is during puberty, but successful repair in adult patients (up to 70 years of age) has been reported. Those scheduled for minimally invasive repair should be measured for bar length and screened for metal allergies. The minimally invasive technique for pectus excavatum repair is done thoracoscopically and requires no rib cartilage or sternal resection. Instead, it relies on bracing the anterior chest wall with a sub-sternal support bar placed in position under the sternum after first correcting the deformity with an introducer specially developed for the procedure. Two bars generally give better correction than one <b>bar.</b> It is <b>essential</b> that the <b>bars</b> be adequately stabilized to prevent bar displacement and recurrence of the deformity. Several techniques {{have been developed to}} elevate the sternum during mediastinal tunneling to improve thoracoscopic visibility in very severe and asymmetric deformities. Since 1987 we have evaluated 3836 patients in our chest wall deformities clinic, of whom 1921 (50 %) have undergone repair. 1738 patients were primary repairs and 1346 of these have had their bars removed two to three years after placement. The biggest challenge in the early years was bar displacement but that has now been reduced to just over 1 % by use of a stabilizer on the left side and “ 0 ” PDS pericostal sutures on the right side. 88. 9 % of patients reported an excellent result, 9. 6 % a good result and 1. 5 % a poor or failed result. In conclusion: The minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum is highly successful when carried out by experienced surgeons in a center dedicated to the management of chest wall malformations...|$|R
40|$|Three {{specific}} {{questions concerning the}} relationship between galaxian morphology and infrared properties were addressed for non-interacting galaxies: (1) Why are high infrared luminosity (L > 10 ¹⁰ L(⊙)) Sa galaxies scarce compared to Sb and Sc galaxies; (2) Is there {{a relationship between the}} bulge to total luminosity and the infrared properties of early type spirals; and (3) Are <b>bars</b> <b>essential</b> to nuclear star formation processes in non-interacting galaxies? These questions were answered using IRAS data, CO (1 - 0) measurements, 2 μm, 10 μm, and visible CCD observations. Only 4 % of Sa's in the Revised Shapley-Ames Catalog (RSAC) with B(Γ) 10 ¹⁰ L(⊙), 1 / 6 of the ratio for Sb's and Sc's. Less than three Sa's of 166 in the RSAC have nuclear starbursts not associated with interactions or active nuclei. A comparison of neutral hydrogen fluxes and CO fluxes with infrared fluxes implies that molecular cloud formation is inhibited in Sa's, leading to the lack of infrared activity. An investigation of the role of bulges in suppressing star formation in Sa through Sb spirals relied on the photometric observations of Kent, Kodaira, and Cornell and on IRAS infrared observations. The bulge to total luminosity is uncorrelated with the ratio of infrared to blue flux, 60 μm/ 100 μm fluxes, or infrared luminosity. These results indicate that disk star formation is relatively unaffected by bulge size. The hypothesis that high far-infrared luminosities in non-interacting galaxies are dependent on material fed into their nuclei by bars was tested by near infrared imaging of a sample of 15 optically unbarred galaxies in a search for hidden bars. These galaxies were non-interacting, non-Seyfert galaxies with far infrared luminosities > 10 ¹⁰ L(⊙) and hot colors between 60 and 100 μm (S₆₀/S₁₀₀ > 0. 5, indicative of nuclear starbursts). At least 8 of these galaxies do not appear to have bars. Strong bars therefore are not an absolute requirement for high infrared luminosity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{field of}} long-crested {{transverse}} bars was monitored from a 2. 5 -year series of topographic Lidar surveys {{in the vicinity}} of a tidal inlet on the macrotidal (mean spring tidal range = 7 to 12 m) west coast of Cotentin (Normandy, France). The bar field, the alongshore extent of which is about 1. 8 km, is composed of a total of 8 bars with lengths varying from 320 m to 1300 m and mean heights comprised between 0. 5 m and 2. 5 m. Bar cross-sections are variable between bars and for a single bar, and also over time. The surveys show a consistent northward migration of the bars at a mean rate of about 2 m/month, but the rate is larger in winter than in summer. The Lidar observations show that the tidal inlet, located at the southern limit of the bar field where the bars start forming, comprises a large sediment platform that acts as a source of sand for the bars. The ebb jet debouching from the inlet is deflected northward by the ambient strong shore-parallel tidal currents in this large tide-range setting, and this may be the primary mechanism leading to the emplacement of the bars. Smaller wave-formed swash bars that further feed the development of these large transverse bars have also been observed. Monitoring of bar migration in the course of six consecutive spring tides with fair-weather conditions showed that strong spring tidal currents are sufficient to drive bar mobility in the absence of waves. Storm wave resuspension of sand is thus expected to enhance bar mobility rates, as shown by the higher rates of winter bar migration compared to the summer rates. The ebb jet explains the slower bar migration rates at the vicinity of the inlet, these rates increasing with distance northward of the inlet as the tidal currents become unimpeded. The main difference between these macrotidal transverse bars and their counterparts in microtidal settings resides in these strong tidal currents that are the <b>essential</b> driver of <b>bar</b> migration, unlike the wave-driven migration of microtidal bars. The large tidal range, in conjunction with storm wave activity, also induces longshore and seasonal variability in bar morphology. The transverse bars of Normandy appear to be inscribed in a sand circulation system involving the west Cotentin coast, the large ebb tidal delta from which they are formed, and the central Cotentin embayment where they are ultimately incorporated into the nearshore sand pool. Longer-term field hydrodynamic monitoring and modelling will be required in order to further elucidate the mode of formation of these transverse bars...|$|R
