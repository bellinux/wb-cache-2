The results and simulation are performed on characteristic forms such as rectangles and ellipses with different centers. 1 Introduction The report describes the general setup of the machine parts and the technical problems we had to deal with. We modelled the grinding of the shape of the lens and of a bevel on the edge of the lens. In general all glasses are made of one frame and two lenses with different strength. Because every customer who needs glasses wants to choose his individual frame and has individual eye-measures, lenses have to be grind precisely. Normally, lenses the optician buys from the manufacturer have the shape of a circle with optical center indicated by a crug. The optician has to grind the lenses so that they are symmetric and fit to the [...] ...|$|E

50|$|Whilst not an {{acknowledged}} {{remake of}} the 1974 film directed by Robert Altman, Mississippi Grind has some commonalities with California Split. Both films open at a poker table with neither character knowing the other. The second scene for both films {{takes place in a}} dark bar where both characters bump into each other and proceed to get inebriated. One character ends up on the other's couch in scene 3 and is late for work, the other is reading the form guide with a female friend. One of the main characters is working full time, the other not. The working character (played by George Segal in California Split and Ben Mendelsohn in Mississippi Grind) both films leaves work early to attend a racetrack with the other. In scene 5, they win the first bet they place at the track (and this is the only bet they place that we actually see in both films). Both films contain a scene where the main character(s) are held up in a parking lot. Both workers have debts with bookmakers they cannot repay (with scenes taking place in cafes to discuss repayments). There is basketball hustler scene. The worker ends the movie with a feeling of emptiness despite winning big in the final scene. They attend both horse tracks and greyhounds tracks (the latter only spoken about in California Split). Both working characters have dalliances with prostitutes. The working character is desperate in the lead-up to the final scene, only to secure an unbeatable streak gambling.

50|$|In {{grinding}}, {{the wheel}} follows a simple path. For example, in plunge grinding a shaft, the wheel moves in towards {{the axis of}} the <b>part,</b> <b>grinds</b> it, and then moves back out. Since each slice of the wheel repeatedly contacts the same slice of the workpiece, any inaccuracies in the geometric shape of the grinding wheel will be transferred onto the part.

The accuracy becomes even worse as the grind wheel wears, so truing must occur periodically to reshape it.|$|R

As a result of this study the following findings were made: The specific material removal rate (Q’) can be increased by more than 100 percent by using sol-gel wheels with metalworking fluids containing a high concentration of extreme pressure (EP) lubricants, instead of conventional aluminum oxide wheels with non-EP-containing fluids. The sol-gel grinding wheel generates an eight to ten times higher G-ratio than a traditional aluminum oxide wheel. Metalworking fluids with two levels of EP lubricants were compared with a fluid that did not contain EP lubricants. The fluid with the highest EP level gives six to nine times higher G-ratios than the non-EP containing fluid. The combination of the sol-gel wheel with the highest-EP-level fluid results in a 56 -fold increase in G-ratio over that of the conventional aluminum oxid...|$|R
