40|$|Secondary {{asset market}} data for {{combines}} and tractors {{are used to}} estimate and separate out historical economic depreciation, embodied technological change and time value change. Combines and tractors generally exhibit constant geometric economic depreciation on a year to year basis. Depreciation rates vary by manufacturer. Farm investors can use these manufacturer specific depreciation rates reported here to estimate terminal asset values. The study found significant seasonal differences in machinery depreciation rates. A major source of error in forecasting terminal asset values comes from changes related to time. There is a predictable time component to the constant quality asset index {{that has not been}} investigated in previous studies. Unanticipated shocks to demand should be followed by price reversion to long-run average manufacturing costs as industry capacity adjusts to demand. This reversion component is predicable. Investment risk over longer planning horizons may be lower when both <b>depreciation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and time component estimates are employed. Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} my thesis is "Comparison of {{development}} of depreciation methods of long-term assets and {{their influence on}} the tax base". The {{aim of this study}} was to capture the development of methods of depreciation, amortization of transferring these methods into the numerical expression and assess the impact of the development of depreciation to the tax base. This work does not cover only the current depreciation issues, but focuses on the development of depreciation for the period from 1995 to 2010. Development of income taxes, <b>depreciation</b> rates and <b>coefficients</b> from 1995 - 2010 was favorable for taxpayers. The tax rate was decreasing. Depreciation rates have increased and rates fell, which provoked a reduction of the minimum period of depreciation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{describe}} development in de lege lata regulation of the tangible assets tax depreciation in the Czech Republic. The period under consideration was that since 1990. For the period 1990 â€“ 2009 the legal state valid and operative as of December 31 st of the relevant year and in case of the year 2010 as of the state valid and operative as of June 30 th were taken into account. To obtain information on relevant de lege lata regulation, the computerized system of legal information ASPI was used. The results of carried out comparison are presented above all in tables and connected commentaries. Even if the attention was paid only to one main selected category of property, {{it was necessary to}} approach to a description and assessment of only selected changes because of the extensiveness of the issue in focus. At the very beginning, the paper deals with the specification of the basic legal principles governing the Czech law. Subsequently the paper gives a description of the legal regulation valid and operative until 31 st December 1992 and the way of transformation to new rules stated in the Act No. 586 / 1992 Coll., on Income Taxes, as amended. Since 1993, this Act on Income Taxes has represented the basic legal standard regulating among others the issue of property depreciation. In relation to regulations stated in this Act, the attention is paid to the development in selected aspects. Namely the depreciable period, number of depreciation categories, determination of depreciable tangible property according to Section 26 of the Act on Income Taxes, <b>depreciation</b> rates and <b>coefficients</b> are involved. Besides, the paper follows also the main means of tax liability optimization due the course of the period under consideration. After consideration of acquired results, one can observe that the most changes were realized on the level of relevant provisions of the Act on Income Taxes during the nineties of the last century. When speaking of present legal regulation, this one can be assessed as a relatively steady in relation to followed provisions of the Act on Income Taxes. In general, the trend can be assessed, from the tax-payers point of view, as a positive one. However, taking account of this conclusion, it is to stress that the paper is dealing only with a part of the issue of tangible property depreciation. For deeper analysis it seems to be useful to include other aspects, such as e. g. assessment of impact of changes in legal regulations in question on the tax base...|$|R
40|$|A near {{consensus}} in the contemporary monetary economics is that monetary policy can achieve its objectives more precisely if it is designed as a rule rather than discretion. Even a well intentioned discretionary monetary policy becomes time inconsistent while consistency {{is at the heart}} of rule based policy adopted by an autonomous and transparent central bank. In standard Macroeconomic Models a loss function, defined over output gap and deviation of inflation from its optimal value, is assigned to the central banker who has the autonomy to choose its operating target so that the loss to the society is minimum. Assuming behavioral equations of the private sector as constraint, the first order conditions are derived from loss minimization, which after manipulation give a policy reaction function that is made explicit in an instrument rule while it remains implicit in the targeting rules (Svensson 1997). Empirical literature brings to light the superiority of rule based policy in a variety of Macroeconomic Models and against a bunch of structural shocks that may hit the economy. The underlying thesis sets two objectives regarding monetary policy of Pakistan. The first objective is to estimate monetary policy reaction function. For this purpose, the Taylor type rules and McCallum rules are estimated using quarterly data on Pakistan economy over the period 1993 Q 3 to 2010 Q 2. Both types of rules have been modified by incorporating exchange rate management and interest rate smoothing as policy objectives. Moreover, we have found recursive estimates of the parameters to sort out policy inconsistency. We have also looked into the issue of nonlinearity of the monetary policy reaction function with regards to output gap and inflation rate assuming asymmetric preferences of monetary authority. The second objective is to estimate loss, defined as sum of variances of output gap and inflation rate, associated with different specificationsof the rules, which is then compared with that found in the historical data. We find that monetary authority in Pakistan does not follow Taylor rule as coefficient of output gap is negative and statistically insignificant and the coefficient of inflation rate, though statistically significant, is far below the benchmark value suggested by Taylor (1993). State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is found to involve in exchange rate management and interest rate smoothing and this result is robust to different modifications in the Taylor rule. The parameters of output gap, inflation rate and differenced exchange rate, in the reaction function, are not stable over time and vary over the business cycle and across different inflationary regimes. The variation in the coefficient of output gap is found countercyclical while the coefficient of inflation rate follows the same pattern with respect to inflationary regimes. The coefficients of exchange rate and lagged interest rate remain almost stable. The threshold value of output gap is found 2. 5 % below which the response of interest rate to output gap fluctuations is positive but above which the response is insignificant. The threshold rate of inflation is found at 6 % and coefficient of output gap is found positive only high inflationary regime while the coefficients of inflation rate and exchange rate are significant only in low inflationary regime. Monetary authority responds to currency depreciation more strongly when interest rate is low compared to that when it is high. Moreover, the response of interest rate to output gap is significant only if currency depreciation is below threshold (estimated at 0. 68) while response to exchange rate is significant only if there is high speed of depreciation (above threshold). The results are robust to inclusion of fiscal deficit in the Taylor rule. In Pakistan, fiscal deficit negatively affects interest rate which is because of the borrowing of government from State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for budgetary support. In a modified version of the Taylor rule interest rate is found to negatively respond to changes in growth rate of real GDP. Growth rate of monetary base negatively depends on the difference between nominal GDP growth rate and its average value indicating countercyclical response at the part of monetary authority. Moreover, growth rate of money exhibits strong inertia and is negatively related to currency <b>depreciation.</b> The <b>coefficients</b> in the McCallum rule too are not stable during the sample period. The coefficients of growth rate of nominal GDP and exchange rate are not stable over time, while the parameter capturing inertia is stable over the sample period. The response of monetary growth rate to nominal GDP growth rate and to exchange rate are significant only when nominal GDP is above its threshold value and/or when currency depreciates at higher rate. The simulation analysis confirms that policy consistency can improve welfare significantly and rule based policy, in general, is found superior to the one that has been observed during the sample period. Moreover, the original Taylor (1993) rule is found the best among all specifications and inclusion of exchange rate and lagged interest rate negatively affects welfare and the condition of zero lower bound on nominal interest rate is violated, in most of the cases, when interest rate smoothing is included as a policy objective. Interestingly, making monetary policy reaction function nonlinear does not add to the performance of the rule. The stochastic simulation also confirms that Taylor rule can perform well in a variety of shocks that may hit the economy. Finally, it is found that Taylor rule may perform well even if the fiscal deficit partially dilutes the stance of monetary policy but the performance of the rule is better in a model of monetary dominance...|$|R
