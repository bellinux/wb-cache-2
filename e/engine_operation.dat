5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During <b>engine</b> <b>operation,</b> it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} flight segment from Baltimore to Columbia, the crew {{experienced}} fuel flow disruptions to both right side engines, eventually leading {{both of them}} to shut down, after multiple unsuccessful attempts by the crew to restore proper fuel flow and <b>engine</b> <b>operation.</b> Flying with asymmetric thrust from the two left side engines (which were operating normally at that point), the captain decided to land at Byrd Field (now called Richmond International Airport), near Richmond, Virginia, as a precaution.|$|E

The Presara, marketed under the Grande moniker in New Zealand and the Middle East, also features high-intensity discharge headlamps with auto levelling front lighting system. When reversing, the side mirrors face down towards the ground (unless the mirror adjustment switch is in the off position) to assist the driver when parking in places where space is compromised.|$|E

5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during <b>engine</b> <b>operation.</b> Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During <b>engine</b> <b>operation,</b> the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E

25|$|ED95 designates a {{blend of}} 95% ethanol and 5% {{ignition}} improver; it is used in modified diesel engines where high compression is used to ignite the fuel, {{as opposed to the}} operation of gasoline engines, where spark plugs are used. This fuel was developed by Swedish ethanol producer SEKAB. Because of the high ignition temperatures of pure ethanol, the addition of ignition improver is necessary for successful diesel <b>engine</b> <b>operation.</b> A diesel engine running on ethanol also has a higher compression ratio and an adapted fuel system.|$|E

25|$|The tower mill at Alkborough {{was built}} circa 1860 of red brick and tar, {{originally}} for the milling of cereals. It replaced a post mill which was recorded as still standing in 1853. It remained in wind operation until 1916 (but continued with <b>engine</b> <b>operation</b> {{for a short}} while thereafter), and from 2009 became part of a private dwelling. The mill retains two millstones in situ on the first floor. The floors contain re-used timber from the post mill, and two posts are made from a common sail whip.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the initial}} run of 36 Scout C airframes, later Scout C {{production}} batches, consisting of 50 aircraft {{built for the}} RNAS and 75 for the RFC, changed the cowl to a flat-fronted shorter-depth version able to house either the Gnome Lambda rotary, or the alternate choice of a nine-cylinder 80hp Le Rhône 9C rotary engine when the Gnome Lambda was not used, and moved the oil tank forward to a position {{in front of the}} pilot for better weight distribution and more reliable <b>engine</b> <b>operation.</b> The later cowl for the remaining Scout C aircraft still had the small opening of the domed unit, with both cowl designs having a circumferential slot-style cutaway made at mid-cowl depth of about one-sixth the circumference, to the lowest perimeter of the cowl to increase the cooling effect, and to allow any unburned fuel/oil mix to drain away. A total of some 161 Scout C airframes were produced for the British military as a whole, with the transition to the Scout D standard taking place in a gradual progression of feature changes.|$|E
500|$|Air {{pollution}} from <b>engine</b> <b>operation</b> and from cargo fires is another serious concern. Large ships are often run on low quality fuel oils, such as bunker oil, which is highly polluting {{and has been}} shown to be a health risk. [...] Ship fires may result in the loss of the ship due to lack of specialized firefighting gear and techniques and fires can burn for days.|$|E

2500|$|Temperature {{reduction}} from {{shade trees}} in parking lots lowers {{the amount of}} evaporative emissions from parked cars. Unshaded parking lots {{can be viewed as}} miniature heat islands, where temperatures can be even higher than surrounding areas. Tree canopies will reduce air temperatures significantly. Although the bulk of hydrocarbon emissions come from tailpipe exhaust, 16% of hydrocarbon emissions are from evaporative emissions that occur when the fuel delivery systems of parked vehicles are heated. These evaporative emissions and the exhaust emissions of the first few minutes of <b>engine</b> <b>operation</b> are sensitive to local microclimate. If cars are shaded in parking lots, evaporative emissions from fuel and volatilized plastics will be greatly reduced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second stage}} {{was the last}} inspection. Here the plane was flight tested and then turned over to its crew. [...] The engines were run up, the plane taxied and then flown by {{military}} crews to check instruments, radios and single <b>engine</b> <b>operation.</b> The planes were flown north from Baer to Kendallville, Indiana, and back to Baer. This was about 80 miles round trip. Around Kendallville one engine was shut down {{to see how the}} aircraft handled. The military flew the planes during the test flight, but often the pilot would be accompanied by a civilian test pilot. When the flight turned up additional problems they were corrected by the Flight Test section. [...] There were Pratt and Whitney technical representatives on the field for the engines, as well as other factory representatives from Douglas and Curtiss-Wright for the airframes.|$|E

2500|$|For the 2009 {{model the}} G35 sedan was {{replaced}} by the G37 sedan. The G37 sedan was first unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show for the European market. Exterior, interior and options remain identical to the 2008 G35 model range but the sedan now also sports the 3.7-liter VQ37VHR [...] "VVEL" [...] V6, rated [...] at 7,000 rpm and [...] at 5,200 rpm that was previously introduced in the G37 Coupe. Although the engine gains only [...] torque over the VQ35HR and this torque value arrives at a later 5,200 rpm vs. 4,800 in the VQ35HR, the torque curve itself is improved and flattened across the rpm range via Nissan's new VVEL (Variable Valve Event and Lift) variable valve timing resulting in better throttle response and low rpm torque. The G37s VQ37VHR engine has been touted by car magazines and reviewers as an improvement over the VQ35HR engine mostly adding much more refinement and smoother <b>engine</b> <b>operation,</b> especially at high rpm where the VQ35HR engine was frequently criticized for NVH and sounding strained, harsh and loud. The often criticized too aggressive clutch engagement, notchiness of the 6-speed manual in the G35 and engine vibrations transferred through the shifter and pedals in the G35 6MT cars was also addressed in the new G37 models.|$|E
