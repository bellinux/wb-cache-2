5|$|Given {{the lack}} of a living will, a trial was held before Pinellas County Judge George Greer during the week of January 24, 2000 to {{determine}} what Terri Schiavo's wishes would have been regarding life-prolonging procedures. Michael Schiavo was represented by attorney George Felos, who had won a landmark right-to-die case before the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The 1905 the Florida Legislature {{passed the}} Buckman Act, which reorganized the Florida college system into {{a school for}} white males (University of the State of Florida), a school for white females (Florida Female College later changed to Florida State College for Women), and a school for African Americans (State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students). The Buckman Act was controversial, as it changed the {{character}} of a historic coeducational state school into a school for women. An early and major benefactor of the school, James Westcott III (1839–1887), willed substantial monies to the school to support continued operations. In 1911 his estate sued the state educational board contending the estate was not intended to support a single-sex school. The <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> decided the issue in favor of the State of Florida stating the change in character (existing from 1905 to 1947) was within the intent of the Westcott will. By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women's college in the United States and was the first state women's college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida so honored. Florida State was the largest of the original two universities in Florida, even during the period as the college for women until 1919.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Waters was {{instrumental}} both in creating and then greatly expanding the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> website {{at a time}} when the World-Wide Web was new and barely understood. Under the administration of Chief Justice Gerald Kogan, Waters led the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> efforts to begin webcasting video of all of its oral arguments when the technology to do so first became available.|$|R

5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The {{closeness of the}} Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on {{the argument that the}} use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush {{was the first person to}} win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.|$|E
25|$|On remand, the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> {{issued an}} opinion on December 22, 2000, that did not dispute whether December 12 was the {{deadline}} for recounts under state law, although this was disputed in a concurring opinion by <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> Justice Leander Shaw who nevertheless expressed deference to the U.S. Supreme Court's view on this issue and who also argued that, in any case, the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> would (in his opinion) be unable to craft a remedy which would satisfy all of the U.S. Supreme Court's equal protection, due process, and other concerns.|$|E

2500|$|Bush {{also argued}} that the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> ruling {{violated}} [...] of the U.S. Constitution. Essentially, Bush argued that the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> interpretation of <b>Florida</b> law was so erroneous that their ruling {{had the effect of}} making new law. Since this [...] "new law" [...] had not been directed by the Florida legislature, it violated Article II. Bush argued that Article II gives the federal judiciary the power to interpret state election law in presidential elections to ensure that the intent of the state legislature is followed.|$|R

25|$|In 1983, Clarence E. Hill {{was convicted}} {{of the murder of}} a Pensacola, Florida police officer, and {{subsequently}} sentenced to death in 1985, in the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> case of Hill v. State. At a resentencing hearing in 1986, Hill’s death sentence was reinstated, this time being upheld by the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> In November 1989, a warrant for Hill’s execution was signed by then Governor Robert Martinez, after which Hill sought postconviction relief in both the Florida state courts and the U.S. District Court. In 1992, Hill’s relief was granted when it was ruled that the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> as well as Hill’s trial court had not properly reevaluated the aggravating factors warranting a death sentence when one of them was vacated. In Hill v. State, the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> having sufficiently reweighed the mitigating factors, resentenced Hill to death. Hill then sought federal habeas corpus relief, which was first denied by the U.S. District Court, then affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} {{had been}} established previously by several state courts, including the California Supreme Court in 1978, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1979 and the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{numerous}} {{aggravating circumstances}} and no mitigating circumstance, {{the trial judge}} sentenced Washington to death {{on each of the}} murder counts. The <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> affirmed Washington's sentences on direct appeal.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{unanimous}} opinion authored by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court dismissed the writ of certiorari {{for want of}} jurisdiction. Rehnquist wrote that the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> decision did not fit any of the categories where the Court [...] "treated state-court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although there were further proceedings {{to take place in}} the state court." [...] Thus, the Court concluded that the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> decision was not final. This was partly based on a doctrine from the Cox decision which decided that certain decisions were not 'final' when the trial proceedings had not been completed.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Fieri officiated {{the wedding}} of celebrity chef Art Smith on Miami Beach. The wedding, which {{included}} over two dozen same-sex couples, was held to celebrate <b>Florida's</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> lifting the state ban on same-sex marriage.|$|R

25|$|Three justices (Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas) {{argued that}} the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> had acted {{contrary}} to {{the intent of the}} Florida legislature. Four justices (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer) specifically disputed this in their dissenting opinions, and the remaining two Justices (O'Connor and Kennedy) declined to join Rehnquist's concurrence on the matter.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of Coker, the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> ruled that Florida capital child rape {{statutes}} were unconstitutional in the Robert L. Buford case of 1981 and the Lucious L. Andrews case in 1983. Before his sentence was overturned, Andrews was the last man on death row who had not murdered anyone.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1968, the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> {{ruled in}} Pinellas County Classroom Teachers Association v. Board of Public Instruction, 214 So. 2d 34 (September 18, 1968), that state law did not {{prohibit}} public employees (such as teachers) from bargaining collectively. However, {{the court also}} said that public employees {{did not have the}} right to strike.|$|E
50|$|Before {{becoming}} the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> first {{public information officer}} in 1996, Waters served for nine years as a staff attorney. He worked in this capacity {{for nearly three years}} with Florida's first woman Justice, Rosemary Barkett from West Palm Beach. The remaining time was spent advising Justice Gerald Kogan from Miami until, upon becoming Chief Justice in 1996, Kogan moved Waters permanently into court administration and his current job.|$|R
5000|$|In 1981, he and Florida Representative Tom Bush {{successfully}} attached {{an amendment}} to the state budget that would deny funding to any state university that advocated sexual activity between unmarried adults. [...] Within months, <b>Florida's</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> unanimously ruled the provision an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment. [...] Shortly thereafter, several ethics allegations were made against Senator Trask, [...] and he resigned from office in July 1982.|$|R
2500|$|Antonin Scalia {{wrote for}} the majority. The <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court's</b> {{distinction}} between void and voidable contracts was, as Cantero had said, irrelevant under Prima Paint and Southland. The relevant section of the FAA was indeed applicable to the case, he said, since it required that contracts with arbitration clauses be treated like all others, and that its definition of [...] "contract" [...] included those that would or could later be voided since it explicitly mentioned such contracts that might later be revoked.|$|R
25|$|Washington then sought {{collateral}} {{relief in}} state court on the ground, inter alia, that counsel had rendered ineffective assistance at the sentencing proceeding in several respects, including his failure to request a psychiatric report, to investigate and present character witnesses, and to seek a presentence report. The trial court denied relief, and the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> affirmed.|$|E
25|$|Durousseau {{was arrested}} and charged with five counts of murder on June 17, 2003. On December 13, 2007 he was sentenced to die by lethal {{injection}} for the murder of Tyresa Mack.

In January 2017, Durousseau's death sentence was overturned by the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|E
25|$|Five justices {{agreed that}} December 12 (the {{date of the}} decision) was the {{deadline}} Florida had established for recounts (Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas in support; Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer opposed). Justices Souter and Breyer wanted to remand {{the case to the}} <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> to permit that court to establish uniform standards of what constituted a legal vote and then manually recount all ballots using those standards.|$|E
50|$|Makar {{has written}} law review and law journal {{articles}} {{on a broad}} range of topics, many of which have been cited by commentators and courts, with several garnering legal writing awards.

He secured the initial state funding to start a Poinciana Valencia Campus and the Lake Toho Restoration which will clean water flowing through the Northern Everglades. In addition, he boldly led the Democratic House and Senate Caucuses in drafting and presenting an important Congressional Map during the 2014 Special Session on Redistricting.|$|R
50|$|Republican John Mica has {{represented}} the 7th District since 1992.

In 2012, when Mica ran for re-election, he won with 59% of the vote, his smallest margin of victory in twenty years. Mica ran for re-election and wound up unopposed in the primary election after John Morning ended his campaign in November 2015.|$|R
