40|$|Background: Floppy eyelid {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disorder characterized by tarsal atonia, common spontaneous eversion of the upper eyelids in conjunction with chronic papillary conjunctivitis. Floppy eyelid {{syndrome is}} a frequent cause of recurrent keratitis of different severity up to corneal ulceration. Â  Aim: To assess tear production, tear film and status of cornea in patients with floppy eyelid syndrome. Materials and methods: We examined 8 women aged 47 â€“ 81 years (median 59 years) with clinical signs of floppy eyelid syndrome. For functional assessment, Schirmer and Norn tests were used. Â  Results: All patients had dry eye syndrome due to increased evaporation and fluid loss from the ocular surface in combination with meibomian gland dysfunction. In all cases, keratitis of varied severity was diagnosed: pitted corneal erosions in 7 patients, severe keratitis on 1 patient. In this patient, untimely diagnosis of floppy eyelid syndrome and inadequate treatment resulted {{in the development of}} purulent corneal ulcer, endophthalmitis and subsequent eye enucleation.

40|$|The {{covalent}} immobilization of trypsin on sterilized cotton <b>gauze</b> <b>bandage</b> {{was carried}} out for future use as an anti-inflammatory agent on wound dressing. The optimal immobilization conditions were determined: the influence of pH, concentration, and volume of the trypsin solution used in the immobilization procedure was studied. The catalytic properties and kinetic parameters, {{as well as the}} storage stability of the immobilized and free enzyme were compared. Results showed that the optimal pH and temperature for the immobilized trypsin in the hydrolysis of N-benzoyl-DL-arginine p-nitroanilide were 9. 5 and 55 ÂºC, which were higher than those of the free form (7. 5 and 45 ÂºC). It was found, at 37 ÂºC and pH 7. 0 (approximately, the physiological conditions), that the Km (Michaelis constant) was 3. 98 Âµmol/mL and that Vmax (maximal reaction rate) was 0. 719 Âµmol/(min mg) for the immobilized trypsin, compared to a Km of 2. 46 mmol/mL and a Vmax of 2. 89 Âµmol/(min mg) for the free trypsin. The amount of immobilized trypsin was 6 mg/g dried support. After 30 days, no trypsin had liberated from the support.

40|$|Uncontrolled {{bleeding}} from traumatic wounds {{is a major}} factor in deaths resulting from military conflict, accidents, disasters and crime. Self-assembling peptide nanofibers have shown superior hemostatic activity, and herein, we elucidate their mechanism by visualizing the formation of nanofiber-based clots that aggregate blood components with a similar morphology to fibrin-based clots. Furthermore, to enhance its direct application to a wound, we developed layer-by-layer assembled thin film coatings onto common materials used for wound dressingsâ€”gauze and gelatin sponges. We find these nanofibers elute upon hydration under physiological conditions and generate nanofiber-based clots with blood. After exposure to a range of harsh temperature conditions (âˆ’ 80 to 60 Â°C) for a week and even 5 months at 60 Â°C, these hemostatic bandages remain capable of releasing active nanofibers. In addition, the application of these nanofiber-based films from <b>gauze</b> <b>bandages</b> was found to accelerate hemostasis in porcine skin wounds as compared to plain gauze. The thermal robustness, in combination with the self-assembling peptideâ€™s potent hemostatic activity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low cost of production, makes this a promising approach for a cheap yet effective hemostatic bandage.
