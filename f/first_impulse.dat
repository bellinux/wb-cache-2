25|$|At {{the end of}} 1985, at {{the first}} prehispanic {{societies}} meeting, {{in relation to the}} Chupícuaro culture it was noted, that Chupícuaro tradition ceramics manufacturing groups, should be considered part of Mesoamerican stratified societies, with a definite political and territorial structure and not as isolated village societies, lacking ceremonial centers and architecture. From that <b>first</b> <b>impulse,</b> subsequent social groups presented own cultural expressions, at regional level in the Mesoamerican context.|$|E
25|$|On 21 October 1413, the {{precarious}} {{balance of power}} in East Frisia (in what is today part of Germany) shifted, when the chieftain, Keno II tom Brok, captured the town of Emden. His enemy, the chieftain, Hisko Abdena, who was Provost of Emden, fled across the Ems river to the city of Groningen, where his arrival gave the <b>first</b> <b>impulse</b> to a transfer of power to the Schieringers, led by one Coppyn Jarichs, who {{was the son of a}} merchant from Staveren who had settled in Groningen. The old rulers were exiled, and went to seek support from Keno tom Brok, who already had connections with some of the Vetkoper chieftains from Hunsingo, Fivelgo and Oldambt, the Ferhildema family among them. Tom Brok captured Termunten, west of the Ems river, and became such a threat to Groningen, that church treasures were melted down to pay for a mercenary army to protect the city. However, in the night of 14 September 1415 the Vetkopers took Groningen by way of a ruse, whereupon the Schieringers were exiled, and went, unsurprisingly, to seek support from their associates in Oostergo and Westergo.|$|E

The candidate promised change in government by means of reduced partisanship and decried the Bush Administration as one [...] "whose <b>first</b> <b>impulse</b> is to divide and to conquer." [...] Vilsack acknowledged his underdog status, given his low profile outside Iowa, which hampered fundraising.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, {{a few weeks before}} his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, {{including}} Sergey, on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union. His roommate on the trip was future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that [...] "his <b>first</b> <b>impulse</b> on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car". Malseed adds, [...] "On {{the second day of the}} trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Monk's {{delicate}} {{mental condition}} means that {{his ability to}} function can be severely impaired {{by a variety of}} factors. One example is shown during the season 5 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Garbage Strike", in which the smell of garbage prevents Monk from being able to easily identify the murderer of sanitation union boss Jimmy Cusack, eventually causing him to have a psychotic break. Another example: when entering a chaotic murder scene in the episode [...] "Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale", his <b>first</b> <b>impulse</b> is to straighten the lamps, though he is frequently able to hold off his fixations when examining bodies or collecting evidence. Even though Monk's mental state in the series {{is said to be a}} result of his wife's death, he shows signs of OCD in flashbacks dating back to childhood. To deal with his OCD and phobias, Monk visits a psychiatrist – Dr. Charles Kroger (Stanley Kamel) in the first six seasons and Dr. Neven Bell (Héctor Elizondo) in the last two seasons – weekly, and at several points, daily.|$|E
500|$|Cardcaptor Sakura {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{shortly before the}} conclusion of Clamp's Magic Knight Rayearth, which was serialized in Nakayoshi. Clamp's head editor Yamonouchi asked them to do another series in Nakayoshi, and Clamp {{decided to make a}} [...] "Nakayoshi-esque" [...] series, as opposed to Rayearth, which Clamp described as unlike anything they had done before. Head Clamp writer Nanase Ohkawa's <b>first</b> <b>impulse</b> was to create a magical girl series, despite not being well-versed in the genre. Ohkawa wanted the heroine Sakura {{to be in the same}} age group as the majority of Nakayoshis readers so that fans could relate to her. Due to it being different from how Clamp normally conceived characters, Ohkawa designed the other characters such as Tomoyo and Cerberus to be more like Clamp's previous creations. Once Ohkawa had enough information on the characters, she had the three artists in Clamp—Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi and Satsuki Igarashi—design them based on her descriptions. When designing Cerberus, Ohkawa wanted a mascot-type companion for Sakura, but Nekoi tried various forms, including dogs and squirrels, before designing the final version. Syaoran and Toya were conceived to be a common type of character featured in Clamp's works.|$|E

He hastily concealed the note in his breast-pocket, with a vacant smile. Masters eyed him half contemptuously, half compassionately.|$|R

2500|$|Diane Keaton {{was born}} as Diane Hall on January 5, 1946, in Los Angeles, California. Her mother, Dorothy Deanne (née Keaton; 1921–2008), was a {{homemaker}} and amateur photographer; her father, John Newton Ignatius [...] "Jack" [...] Hall (1922–1990), {{was a real}} estate broker and civil engineer. Keaton was raised a Free Methodist by her mother. Her mother won the [...] "Mrs. Los Angeles" [...] pageant for homemakers; Keaton has said that the theatricality of the event inspired her <b>first</b> <b>impulse</b> to be an actress, and led to her wanting to work on stage. She has also credited Katharine Hepburn, whom she admires for playing strong and independent women, as one of her inspirations.|$|E
2500|$|The M1 and M2 Carbines {{continued}} in service during the Korean War. A postwar U.S. Army evaluation reported that [...] "here are practically no data bearing on {{the accuracy of the}} carbine at ranges in excess of 50 yards. The record contains a few examples of carbine-aimed fire felling an enemy soldier at this distance or perhaps a little more. But they are so few in number that no general conclusion can be drawn from them. Where carbine fire had proved killing effect, approximately 95 percent of the time the target was dropped at less than 50 yards." [...] The evaluation also reported that [...] "ommanders noted that it took two to three engagements at least to settle their men to the automatic feature of the carbine so that they would not greatly waste ammunition under the <b>first</b> <b>impulse</b> of engagement. By experience, they would come to handle it semiautomatically, but it took prolonged battle hardening to bring about this adjustment in the human equation." ...|$|E

25|$|Controversy remains {{about the}} origins of Maya civilization as {{scholars}} continue to search for and engage in debate about the roots or <b>first</b> <b>impulses</b> of what became an ancient civilization traditionally considered to {{have been one of the}} greatest of the world. Combined with the early frame of cultural development relative to elsewhere in Mesoamerica and given that the Southern area remains distinctly mysterious with respect to how and why complex societies developed as dramatically as they did, the Southern Maya Area is almost as much a theoretical construct as it is a geographical and temporal reality. This is because topics such as cultural evolution, complex societies, early urbanism, and the construction of (ancient) identity, all framed and discussed in highly abstract ways, necessarily are raised.|$|R

25|$|Biomechatronics mimics how {{the human}} body works.

The leg's muscle spindle nerve cells then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the brain. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to muscles in the leg and foot to set it down.|$|R
5000|$|Punks Not Dead is {{the debut}} studio album by the Scottish punk rock band The Exploited, {{released}} in April 1981 on Secret Records. Strongly {{working class and}} loyal to the <b>first</b> <b>impulses</b> of the 1970s punk movement, the album was a reaction to critics who believed the punk rock genre was dead, and went against popular trends such as new wave and post-punk. The album - and especially the title track - is {{a reaction to the}} punk rock band Crass' song [...] "Punk is Dead". It contains the double A side singles [...] "Army Life/Fuck the Mods" [...] and the later follow up [...] "I Believe in Anarchy".
