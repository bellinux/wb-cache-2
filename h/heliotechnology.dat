40|$|Solar {{irradiance}} {{is estimated}} {{on the basis}} of three hourly cloud observations and compared with the measured irradiance. This indicates {{that it is possible to}} predict daily global irradiation to within 15 % and thus illustrates the potential for extending the solar energy data base available for <b>heliotechnology</b> in Western Australia...|$|E
40|$|Global irradiation/sunshine {{duration}} {{regression analysis}} {{is used to}} estimate the mean daily global irradiation at sunshine monitoring stations within Western Australia. It is shown that this method estimates the monthly mean daily global irradiation to within 10 % and thus {{has the potential for}} extending the available global irradiation data base for <b>heliotechnology...</b>|$|E
