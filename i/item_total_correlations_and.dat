The Fresno Test (FT) has been validated only among general practitioners and occupational therapists and does not assess integration of research evidence with patient perspectives and clinical expertise. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop and validate a modified FT to assess EBP knowledge and skills relevant to physical therapist (PT) practice. Methods The FT was modified to include PT-specific content and two new questions to assess integration of patient perspectives and clinical expertise with research evidence. An expert panel reviewed the test for content validity. A cross-sectional cohort representing three training levels (EBP-novice students, EBP-trained students, EBP-expert faculty) completed the test. Two blinded raters, not involved in test development, independently scored each test. Construct validity was assessed through analysis of variance for linear trends among known groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Routine data {{collection}} {{is now considered}} mandatory. Therefore, staff rated clinical scales that consist of multiple items should have the minimum number of items necessary for rigorous measurement. This study explores the possibility of developing a short form Barthel index, suitable for use in clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and audit, that satisfies criteria for rigorous measurement and is psychometrically equivalent to the 10 item instrument.  METHODS—Data were analysed from 844 consecutive admissions to a neurological rehabilitation unit in London. Random half samples were generated. Short forms were developed in one sample (n= 419), by selecting items with the best measurement properties, and tested in the other (n= 418). For each of the 10 items of the BI, <b>item</b> <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>and</b> effect sizes were computed and rank ordered. The best items were defined as those with the lowest cross product of these rank orderings. The acceptability, reliability, validity, and responsiveness of three short form BIs (five, four, and three item) were determined and compared with the 10 item BI. Agreement between scores generated by short forms and 10 item BI was determined using intraclass correlation coefficients and the method of Bland and Altman.  RESULTS—The five best items in this sample were transfers, bathing, toilet use, stairs, and mobility. Of the three short forms examined, the five item BI had the best measurement properties and was psychometrically equivalent to the 10 item BI. Agreement between scores generated by the two measures for individual patients was excellent (ICC= 0. 90) but not identical (limits of agreement= 1. 84 ± 3. 84).  CONCLUSIONS—The five item short form BI may be a suitable outcome measure for group comparison studies in comparable samples. Further evaluations are needed. Results demonstrate a fundamental difference between assessment and measurement {{and the importance of}} incorporating psychometric methods in the development and evaluation of health measures. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{socioeconomic}} status on the diagnosis, treatment, survival, and {{overall quality of}} life in persons with cancer has been well documented. Yet, many studies overlook the relevance of socioeconomic factors when measuring the impact of cancer care. A multitude of tools exist for the measuring of health-related quality of life (QOL) in oncology, but the majority do not recognize socioeconomic well-being as a relevant domain. The FACT-G, perhaps the most often used measure of QOL in oncology, measures the domains of physical, functional, social/family, and emotional well-being as core measures with optional instruments available to address spiritual well-being and concerns related to specific cancer sites. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop and validate a theory-based subscale measuring the construct of socioeconomic well-being to be included as a core domain of the FACT-G. Theories of socioeconomic status and related well-being were explored. The Ecological Theory of Germain and Gitterman (1996) and James Coleman 2 ̆ 7 s theory of social class (1990) were used as the basis for construct definition and item development. Following expert review, the proposed measure, a demographic questionnaire, and other instruments necessary for the validation study were mailed to a random sample of 1200 persons diagnosed with cancer between 1 / 1 / 2004 and 12 / 30 / 2007 and listed on the Tumor Registry of the James Graham Brown Cancer Center (JGBCC) and the University of Louisville Hospital. The study was approved by the University of Louisville, JGBCC, and University Hospital oversight committees for protection of human subjects. Classical measurement theory directed the analysis of the proposed instrument. This iterative process included analysis of reliability via the Cronbach alpha, evaluation of corrected <b>item</b> <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>and</b> factor loadings, and analysis of content and construct validity at the item level via principal component analysis. This process resulted in one scale measuring overall socioeconomic well-being with two subscales (Material Capital and Social Capital) and a total of 17 items. Convergent and discriminant construct validity at the scale level was then established by comparing the new subscales and total scale to three sets of variables hypothesized to have differing degrees of correlation with the scales (Class I, II, and III criterion variables). Incremental validity was evaluated using a hierarchical regression model. The resulting instrument for the measurement of health-related socioeconomic well-being {{could be used as a}} core component of the FACT-G or a stand alone measure, and is appropriate for application in both clinical and research settings...|$|E

The latter four items had very low <b>item</b> to <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>and</b> hence did not contribute much to the questionnaire. Conclusions: The Trust in Physician questionnaire needs to be modified to accurately measure the domains of trust in the context of the study area. More qualitative studies are required to understand the domains of trust in this cultural and social context...|$|R

The PD sleep scale, second version (PDSS- 2), has been proposed as a helpful tool for measuring sleep disorders in PD. We aimed to validate the Italian version of the PDSS- 2. One hundred and twenty-three consecutive PD outpatients (76 males) were evaluated by means of PDSS- 2, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (self-administered scales), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating (motor section) and Hoehn and Yahr Scales, and Mini Mental State Examination. PDSS- 2 internal consistency was satisfactory (Cronbach's α: 0. 77) with significant <b>item</b> to <b>total</b> score <b>correlation</b> <b>and</b> high intra-class <b>correlation</b> coefficient for test-retest reliability (0. 943). Total PDSS- 2 score was correlated with the scores on all other clinical scales. The factor analysis identified five factors, related to five areas of nocturnal disturbances, similarly as the original PDSS- 2. The five factors mainly reflected: (1) nocturnal movement-related problems, (2) quality of sleep, (3) dreaming distress, (4) fragmentation of sleep and (5) insomnia symptoms. The PDSS- 2 scale has confirmed its usefulness in evaluating sleep problems in Italian PD patients...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) is a {{validated}} self-report questionnaire {{designed to}} assess moderate to vigorous physical activity in children. Currently however, there are no data supporting {{the use of the}} PAQ-C in British samples. Design Two studies using independent samples assessed the psychometric properties of the PAQ-C in children aged 9 – 11 from the UK. Method Study one (N = 336) examined general test score characteristics, internal reliability, factor structure and construct validity of the PAQ-C with the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI). Study two (N = 131) re-examined the factor structure and assessed convergent validity with BMI and cardiovascular fitness (CVF). Results The PAQ-C had acceptable <b>item</b> distribution, <b>item</b> <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> (>. 30) <b>and</b> internal reliability (α =. 82 &. 84). Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) identified two factors which appear {{to be sensitive to the}} context in which the activity is performed ‘in school’ and ‘out of school’. The PAQ-C was related to the SRHI (r =. 30) and inversely related to CVF (r = −. 38) but not with BMI. Conclusions With the exception of one problematic item; physical activity during PE, several analyses suggested that the PAQ-C had acceptable measurement properties in this group. Pragmatically, the ease of use and efficient format of the PAQ-C makes it a feasible option for large studies and/or when time, money and manpower are limited. That said, further development of the PAQ-C may be required for younger samples and its usefulness for intervention research has yet to be established...|$|R

(some col.) The development and psychometric {{characteristics of the}} Minnesota Visual Autism Symptom Scale (MN-VASS) was described. The relationship between the literature surrounding autism symptoms, the diagnostic criteria for autism, and the resulting content of subscales was presented. Item analyses were conducted using <b>item</b> <b>total</b> <b>correlations.</b> All of the <b>item</b> <b>total</b> <b>correlations</b> were above. 30, suggesting adequate item functioning. Two internal consistency estimates of reliability were computed for the MN-VASS: a split-half coefficient expressed as a Spearman-Brown corrected <b>correlation</b> <b>and</b> coefficient alpha. For the split-half coefficient, the scale was split between whole subscales so that the traits of autism measured on the scale would be equally divided between the halves. The value was. 89 for split half and. 90 for coefficient alpha, suggesting satisfactory reliability. Test Retest reliability was reported as a correlation coefficient of. 90 for the entire scale (n= 22), with subscale correlations ranging from. 63 to. 93. Inter rater agreement was between 60 % and 87 %. Convergent validity was investigated between the Childhood Autism Rating Scale and the MN-VASS. A correlation of. 89 was reported between the two scales. Teacher/therapist evaluations of the scale suggest that the MN-VASS is a useful and valid measure of the important and teachable behaviors which can be addressed through a program of instruction for children on the autism spectrum...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the construct validity}} and {{the internal consistency of}} the Medical Student Stressor Questionnaire (MSSQ) among medical students hence in the future it could be used as a valid and reliable instrument to identify stressors among medical students. Methods: The blueprint for the development of MSSQ was developed after a review of literature on the subject and a discussion with experts in the field. It comprised of 40 items with six hypothetical groups. The face validity of the questionnaire was established through discussion with 141 final year medical students whereas content validity was established through discussion with experts from field of Medical Education and Psychiatry. It was administered to a total of 761 medical students. Data was analysed using Statistical Package Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12. Factor analysis was applied to test construct validity of the MSSQ. Reliability analysis (Cronbach’s alpha <b>and</b> <b>item</b> <b>total</b> <b>correlation)</b> was applied to test internal consistency of the MSSQ.
