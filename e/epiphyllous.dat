40|$|Leaf {{surfaces}} of tropical vascular plants provide homes for diverse groups of organisms, including <b>epiphyllous</b> (leaf-colonizing) bryophytes. Each leaf harbors a temporally and spatially discrete community of organisms, providing an excellent system for answering {{some of the}} most fundamental questions in ecology and evolution. In this dissertation, I investigated two main aspects of <b>epiphyllous</b> bryophyte biology: 1) adaptive traits of bryophytes to living on the leaf surface, and 2) community assembly of <b>epiphyllous</b> bryophytes in space (between-hosts) and time (succession). For the first part, I used published trait data and phylogeny of liverworts in family Lejeuneaceae to demonstrate that only the production of asexual propagules appeared to evolve in response to living on the leaf surface, while other hypothesized traits did not have correlated evolution with epiphylly. The second portion dealt with the assembly of communities among different host types. In this part, I identified communities of <b>epiphyllous</b> bryophytes from the same set of three hosts across the gradient of water deficit fluctuation, as represented by the daily range of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on the island Moorea, French Polynesia. Dissimilarity of <b>epiphyllous</b> communities among host types (beta diversity) increased with the increasing VPD range, suggesting that assembly of bryophyte community may depend on microclimate fluctuation. In the last portion of this dissertation, I investigated temporal changes of <b>epiphyllous</b> communities on Inocarpus fagifer, using chronosequence and long-term observation of tagged leaves in the field. Data from both approaches showed significant changes in abundance, species richness, and composition over time. These successional changes, however, did not follow any single trajectory, resulting in divergent communities among leaves of older age. Together, the results from this dissertation work improve our understanding of fundamental biology of <b>epiphyllous</b> bryophytes and allow future researchers to use this system to answer broader questions in ecology and evolution...|$|E

40|$|Question: Is there, at the macro-habitat scale, a {{relationship}} between the fraction of evergreen forests and the presence probability of <b>epiphyllous</b> liverworts? Can these two parameters be estimated and mapped using an NDVI-based indicator that is derived from time-series of SPOT-VGT imagery? Location: Southern China. Methods: Applying the ISODATA algorithm, we classified SPOT-VGT NDVI time-series imagery and produced an NDVI map at 1 -km 2 resolution containing 128 NDVI classes. That map and the National Land Cover Map of China (2000) were used to prepare a scheme for field sampling. For 537 1 -km 2 areas, located in 19 blocks of 100 km Ã 100 km, field data were collected. They represented 51 preselected NDVI classes that were assumed to contain evergreen forests. Data on the fractions of forest and evergreen forest, the fraction of evergreen forest in forest present and presence probability of <b>epiphyllous</b> liverworts were regressed against different NDVI class-specific indicators by means of weighted least-squares regression (WLSR). Results: The SPOT-VGT NDVI for March was found to best explain the variation between 1 -km 2 areas in the presence probability of <b>epiphyllous</b> liverworts (R 2 = 0. 64; linear relationship; RMSE = 0. 38) as the area fraction (%) of evergreen forest (R 2 = 0. 90; exponential relationship; RMSE = 6. 1 %). <b>Epiphyllous</b> liverworts were only found within 1 -km 2 areas when the SPOT-VGT NDVI value for March was more than 0. 50 (model estimate: 0. 43 Â± 0. 20) and the fraction of evergreen forest in 1 km 2 was above 14 % (model estimate: 5 Â± 35 %). The estimation errors (with 95 % confidence interval) of these two relationships were calculated using a bootstrap resampling method with 1000 replications; they were, respectively, 0. 49 - 0. 76 and 0. 85 - 0. 94 for R 2, and 0. 11 - 0. 23 and 5. 2 - 11. 9 % for RMSE. Other positive relationships were found between the presence probability of <b>epiphyllous</b> liverworts and the fraction of evergreen forest (R 2 = 0. 64, linear relationship; RMSE = 0. 38) and between the fraction of evergreen forest and forest within 1 -km 2 areas (R 2 = 0. 80, linear relationship; RMSE = 29 %). Conclusion: We show that for southern China, the fraction of evergreen forest and the presence probability of <b>epiphyllous</b> liverworts can directly be inferred by making use of SPOT-VGT NDVI imagery. The findings are fully consistent with earlier reported hotspots for <b>epiphyllous</b> liverworts. At the macro-habitat scale, the presence probability of <b>epiphyllous</b> liverworts proved quantitatively related to the fraction of evergreen forest. This suggests causal relationships with patch size and/or rainfall patterns. We believe that the derived maps may serve as a foundation for a range of further studies.

40|$|Ginkgo biloba, a {{dioecious}} plant {{known as}} a living fossil, is an ancient gymnosperm that stands distinct from other gymnosperms and angiosperms. Ginkgo biloba var. epiphylla (G. biloba var. epiphylla), with ovules borne on the leaf blade, is an unusual germplasm derived from G. biloba. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene regulators that play critical roles in diverse biological and metabolic processes. Currently, {{little is known about}} the miRNAs involved in the key stage of partly <b>epiphyllous</b> ovule germination in G. biloba var. epiphylla. Two small RNA libraries constructed from <b>epiphyllous</b> ovule leaves and normal leaves of G. biloba var. epiphylla were sequenced on an Illumina/Solexa platform. A total of 82 miRNA sequences belonging to 23 families and 53 putative novel miRNAs were identified in the two libraries. Differential expression analysis showed that 25 conserved and 21 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed between <b>epiphyllous</b> ovule leaves and normal leaves. The expression patterns of partially differentially expressed miRNAs and the transcript levels of their predicted target genes were validated by quantitative real time RT-PCR. All the expression profiles of the 21 selected miRNAs were similar to those detected by Solexa deep sequencing. Additionally, the transcript levels of almost all the putative target genes of 9 selected miRNAs were opposite to those of the corresponding miRNAs. The putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were annotated with Gene Ontology terms related to reproductive process, metabolic process and responding to stimulus.

Especial emphasis is placed upon the necessity for population study techniques to establish taxonomic limits for variability within taxa for dispersed fossil fungal spores irrespective of which classification and nomenclatural system is followed.

The mechanisms and processes of the origin of cryptic species diversity are still poorly understand based on the lack of studies especially in context of environment factors. Here we explored evidence for cryptic species within the <b>epiphyllous</b> liverworts Cololejeunea lanciloba complex based on two loci, the plastid trnL-F region and the nuclear ribosomal ITS region. Several analytic approaches were employed to delimit species based on DNA sequence variation including phylogenetic reconstruction, statistical parsimony networks analysis and two recently introduced species delimitation criteria: Rosenbergâs reciprocal monophyly and Rodrigoâs randomly distinct. We found evidence for thirteen genetically distinct putative species, each consisting of more than one haplotype, rather than four morphologically-circumscribed species. The results implied that the highly conserved phenotypes are not congruent with the genetic differentiation, contributing to incorrect assessments of the biodiversity of <b>epiphyllous</b> liverworts.

40|$|Leaf {{surfaces}} {{provide a}} habitat {{for a wide}} range of organisms including bacteria, fungi, algae and bryophytes.
