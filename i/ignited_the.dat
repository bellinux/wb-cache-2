5|$|On 5 August 1911, {{the ship}} {{suffered}} {{an explosion in}} one of her 12-inch guns when it failed to fire during gunnery practice. After some time passed, the breech was opened and <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> propellant; the resulting fire killed 16 crewmen and several officers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a glove box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously <b>ignited.</b> <b>The</b> fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy. The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission.|$|E
50|$|The NSDs provide <b>the</b> spark to <b>ignite</b> <b>the</b> CDF, {{which in}} turn <b>ignites</b> <b>the</b> LSC for booster destruction. The safe and arm device {{provides}} mechanical isolation between the NSDs and the CDF before launch and during the SRB separation sequence.|$|R
50|$|The fire 2 {{commands}} {{cause the}} redundant NSDs to fire through a thin barrier seal down a flame tunnel. This ignites a pyro booster charge, which is {{retained in the}} safe and arm device behind a perforated plate. <b>The</b> booster charge <b>ignites</b> <b>the</b> propellant in the igniter initiator; and combustion products of this propellant <b>ignite</b> <b>the</b> solid rocket motor initiator, which fires down the entire vertical length of the solid rocket motor <b>igniting</b> <b>the</b> solid rocket motor propellant along its entire surface area instantaneously.|$|R
50|$|Through the years, several {{methods of}} <b>igniting</b> <b>the</b> {{propellant}} have been developed. Originally, {{a small hole}} (a touch hole) was drilled into the breech so that a fine propellant (Black powder, the same propellant used in the gun) could be poured in, and an external flame or spark was applied, (see matchlock and flintlock). Later, Percussion caps and self-contained cartridges (see Cartridge (firearms)), had primers that detonated after mechanical deformation, <b>igniting</b> <b>the</b> propellant. Electric current {{can also be used}} to <b>ignite</b> <b>the</b> propellant, (see Primer (firearm), electric-primed).|$|R
5|$|Following several {{constitutional}} conferences, the Constitution Act officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially {{with four}} provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory {{to form the}} Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> Red River Rebellion {{and the creation of}} the province of Manitoba in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{polonium}} {{was produced}} {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project during World War II. It was a critical part of the implosion-type nuclear weapon design used in the Fat Man bomb on Nagasaki in 1945. Polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the 'urchin' detonator {{at the center of the}} bomb's spherical plutonium pit. The urchin <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt-criticality to ensure the bomb did not fizzle.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 1920, Haruna was {{involved}} in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a breech explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No.1 turret, killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of the turret. A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> gunpowder bags in the breech, detonating the shell while still in the barrel. The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where the elevation of her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.|$|E
50|$|A gas lighter is {{a device}} {{which is used}} to <b>ignite</b> <b>the</b> gas stove. It is used in gas stoves which do not have {{automatic}} ignition systems. It uses a physical phenomenon called piezo-electric effect to generate an electric spark which <b>ignites</b> <b>the</b> combustible gas from the stove burner.|$|R

5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|The novel {{started a}} new era of {{literature}} after the downfall of President Suharto and <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> sastra wangi (literally 'fragrant literature') literary movement as well as an influx of sexually themed literary works by women. Utami disagrees with the label sastra wangi, stating that it reflects the obsession of the press with the women writers and not their work.|$|E
5|$|When {{the trigger}} was pulled, the spring pushed {{the firing pin}} {{forwards}} into the bomb, which <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> propellant in the bomb and launched {{it out of the}} trough and into the air. The recoil caused by the detonation of the propellant then blew the firing pin backwards onto the spring; this automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots, eliminating the need to manually re-cock.|$|E

5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it <b>ignited.</b> <b>The</b> third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Ballooning was a risky {{business}} for the pioneers. Blanchard lost consciousness on a few occasions, endured freezing temperatures and almost drowned when her balloon crashed in a marsh. In 1819, {{she became the first}} woman to be killed in an aviation accident when, during an exhibition in the Tivoli Gardens in Paris, she launched fireworks that <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> gas in her balloon. Her craft crashed on the roof of a house and she fell to her death. She is commonly referred to as Madame Blanchard and is also known by many combinations of her maiden and married names, including Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Sophie Armant and Madeleine-Sophie Armant Blanchard.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 Troy {{suffered}} {{another major}} fire, {{the worst in}} its history. A locomotive's spark <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> wooden Green Island drawbridge that existed at the time, and when {{that could not be}} contained to the bridge it spread to the east, ultimately devastating 507 buildings over a 16-block area. As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months from the ashes of its predecessor. The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.|$|E

5|$|Only twelve {{men were}} picked up before the ship capsized and sank at 19:26, and five of them died after being rescued. Among the dead was one of Spee's sons, Otto von Spee. In total, 327 {{officers}} and men {{were killed in the}} battle. In the course of the engagement, Nürnberg had hit Kent thirty-eight times, but did not cause significant damage. One shell struck one of Kents casemate guns and <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> propellant charges inside, but the magazine was flooded before the fire could destroy the ship. The sinking was commemorated in a painting entitled The Last Man by Hans Bohrdt, which depicted a German sailor waving the Imperial ensign as Nürnberg slipped beneath the waves.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} gunpowder attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the gunpowder ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, ground porcelain and iron filings. The flame that shot from the lance reached a distance of three meters. The heated tinder that <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the gunpowder was consumed, the fire lance could be wielded like a normal spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with gunpowder.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} gun batteries, {{the crew of}} Blücher, {{including}} the personnel manning the guns, were tasked with fighting the fire. By that time she {{had taken on a}} list of 18degrees, although this was not initially problematic. The fire eventually reached one of the ship's 10.5cm ammunition magazines between turbine room 1 and turbine room 2/3, which exploded violently. The blast ruptured several bulkheads in the engine rooms and <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> ship's fuel stores. The battered ship slowly began to capsize and the order to abandon ship was given. Blücher rolled over and sank at 07:30, with significant casualties. Naval historian Erich Gröner states that the number of casualties is unknown, but Henrik Lunde gives a loss of life figure ranging between 600 and 1,000 soldiers and sailors. Jürgen Rohwer meanwhile states that 125 seamen and 195 soldiers died in the sinking.|$|E

Pulling <b>the</b> trigger <b>ignites</b> <b>the</b> blank which in turn <b>ignites</b> <b>the</b> charge on the grenade causing the grenade to be expelled from the barrel.|$|R
5|$|For nine days, the British {{soldiers}} and sailors of the expeditionary force constructed gun batteries and trenches around the fort, bringing ashore large quantities of supplies and equipment in readiness for a lengthy siege. At 16:30 on 19 February the preparations were complete and the bombardment began, 14 heavy cannon and 28 mortars beginning a continuous attack on the fort which lasted {{for the next four}} days. French casualties in the overcrowded fort were severe, with 200 men killed or wounded. British casualties were minimal, with five killed and 11 wounded, principally in an explosion in an ammunition tent manned by sailors from HMS Amaranthe. At 12:00 on 23 February, Villaret de Joyeuse's trumpeter was sent to the British camp with a message proposing surrender terms. These were unacceptable to Beckwith and the bombardment resumed at 22:00, continuing until 09:00 the following morning when three white flags were raised over the fort and the French admiral surrendered unconditionally. The bombardment had cracked the roof of the fort's magazine, and there were fears that further shelling might have <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> gunpowder and destroyed the building completely.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are <b>ignited.</b> <b>The</b> burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These <b>ignited</b> <b>the</b> vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E
