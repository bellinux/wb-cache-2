40|$|The {{lack of a}} {{necessary}} rational framework for assessing ship stability was the main concern of this research. The aim {{was to develop a}} rational philosophy and a logical procedure of assessing intact stability in order to ensure a consistent and unified approach to design for operation and for survival. The method uniquely brings together a linearised analysis for assessing a potentially dangerous roll motion with a probabilistic assessment of ship performance in rough seas on a standard test-track. This represents a significant advance on previous research. A novel feature of the analysis was that prediction of the extreme capsize roll motion was not attempted per se. Instead a reduced level of roll response termed "potentially dangerous" roll motion was selected (based on discussions with seagoing personnel) beyond which there was evidence that loss of the vessel is likely. Validation of the linear spectral analysis used in the simulations was performed using full scale trial results of a <b>fisheries</b> <b>protection</b> <b>vessel.</b> Provided that measured values of roll damping coefficient were used, the predicted values of extreme roll closely matched the maximum values experienced on sea trials up to the chosen value of critical roll angle of 30 degrees. Particular attention was paid to the realistic modelling of total system behaviour in rough seas. Families of wave spectra were used to represent the complete range of wave conditions encountered in nature. Avoidance and pacifying seamanship were incorporated {{based on the results of}} available trials data and discussions with serving masters. Independent (Bernoulli) trials procedures were used to calculate the cumulative probability of a critical roll motion being exceeded at least once during the vessel's passage through the test-track. The value of critical motion exceedance obtained was 5 x 10 ˉ² for the <b>fisheries</b> <b>protection</b> <b>vessel</b> which has a large metacentic height and is reported to have good seakeeping characteristics.

50|$|In January 1977 the UK {{extended}} its territorial waters from 12 miles to 200 miles {{to create an}} exclusive economic zone for fishery rights.

5000|$|Since {{the days}} of World War I, Germany had had a {{tradition}} of employing patrol trawlers. The type was classified before 1945 as a Vorpostenboot (literally, [...] "outpost boat").

2500|$|In the interwar period {{he served}} on Norwegian <b>fishery</b> <b>protection</b> <b>vessels,</b> torpedo boats, minelayers and coastal defence ships.

At the time, Sleipner was being used as a tender for the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service. In late 1931, Bruun served on the <b>fishery</b> <b>protection</b> <b>vessel</b> [...] during a cruise to Finnmark in the far north of Norway. On 1 July 1931 he was temporarily promoted to the rank of acting captain, a promotion which was made permanent in December 1933. In mid-1932 Bruun held command of the torpedo boat , and by 1933, he was the second-in-command at the Royal Norwegian Navy's torpedo school.

5000|$|In June 2006, Finnie {{cancelled}} {{a tender}} {{for a new}} <b>fishery</b> <b>protection</b> <b>vessel</b> for the Scottish <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Protection</b> Agency. The tender has been provisionally awarded to English firm Appledore, but Finnie claimed there was a [...] "fatal flaw" [...] in the tendering process which could have left the Executive liable for damages if the tender had proceeded. However, the Scotland on Sunday reported that a rival bidder, Port Glasgow based Ferguson's was both in Finnie's constituency, {{and that he was}} a lifelong friend of the chief executive.|$|R
