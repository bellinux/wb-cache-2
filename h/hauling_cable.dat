500|$|An {{emergency}} brake engages {{if the air}} pressure needed to control the incline is insufficient; the brake also engages if a dead man's switch is tripped in the operator's booth. In addition to the <b>hauling</b> <b>cables,</b> a [...] safety cable capable of withstanding [...] is also connected to the cars.|$|R
50|$|The Whitby and Pickering Railway {{was opened}} in 1836, with the incline from Beckhole to Goathland {{worked as a}} rope <b>hauled</b> <b>cable</b> railway. A railway station was established. The incline was {{replaced}} by a deviation in 1865, part of the line remained in use as a branch to Beck Hole until it closed in 1951.|$|R
50|$|On 29 August 1961, {{the cable}} car was badly damaged when a Republic F-84F Thunderstreak of the French Arm√©e de l'Air tore its <b>hauling</b> <b>cable.</b> Three cars crashed and six people were killed. Pilot Bernard Ziegler landed his damaged plane safely. The upward cable was undamaged, but 59 riders {{had to wait}} hours for rescue.|$|E
50|$|The B-29 {{played an}} {{important}} role in developing the effective use of aerial refueling during the late 1940s. The first aircraft involved in this programme were the KB-29M tanker and B-29MR receiver. At first, a grappling system, known as the looped hose method, was used; the tanker would formate behind, above and to the left of the receiver. It would then unreel a <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> attached to a 55lb weight (to make it dangle near vertically). The receiver would trail a <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> ending in a drag cone (to make this trail near horizontally) and a grapnel. With both cables trailed, the tanker would cross to the right of the receiver so the two cables snagged each other. With cables snagged, the tanker hauled both into its fuselage where the receiver's cable was connected to the tanker's hose. This was then hauled into the receiver. After connecting with internal fuel compartments pumping would begin. When the receiver was full the process was reversed allowing the tanker to recover its hose and the receiver its <b>hauling</b> <b>cable.</b> While this system was clumsy, it was often used in the late 1940s before a better system was developed. It was most notably used to refuel the Lucky Lady II during her famous circumnavigation of the globe in 1949. The ability of the USAF to circumnavigate the globe demonstrated that its bombers could strike at any target. This helped sway the argument as to whether the USAF or US Navy should provide the US's nuclear delivery capability. The USAF won with the consequential massive expansion of the USAF's Strategic Air Command and cancellation of the US Navy's super carriers.|$|E
5000|$|The Burgberg Cable Car (Burgbergseilbahn) is a {{cable car}} in Bad Harzburg, Germany. It {{was built in}} 1929 by the Bleichert {{engineering}} corporation and has a length of 481 metres. Its <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> has a diameter of 18 mm, its carrying cable a diameter of 37 mm. It is driven by a [...] engine at the summit station. It has two cabins carrying up to 18 passengers each.|$|E

50|$|The haul rope is 7,875 feet (2400m) of 35mm {{solid core}} cable. The cable has a {{breaking}} strength of 172,230 lb. The <b>haul</b> <b>cable</b> operates at 30,050 lb (15 tons) tension per side. The cabins ride on 2 each 50 mm double locking coil track ropes. Each cable is 3526 ft (1075 m) long with a breaking strength of 616,700 lbs. All cables were manufactured by Fatzer of Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the Bagne, only those prisoners with {{sentences}} of less than fifteen years were put to work in the arsenal; the others remained in chains in their dormitories. The resulting poor health of the long-term prisoners and epidemics in the Bagne led to a change in policy; all the prisoners were put to work, usually the heavy manual labor of the port, <b>hauling</b> <b>cables,</b> turning capstans, and carrying supplies. This duty was termed fatigue.|$|R
50|$|The cableway, {{which is}} {{operated}} by the Zugspitzbahn AG, is a reversible system with two carrying cables and no pylons. Its carrying cables have a diameter of 50 mm; its <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> a diameter of 34 mm.Drive is provided by 2 motors each of 210 kW in the valley station. The cabins of the Zugspitze Glacier cable car have a capacity of 100 people and can transport 1,000 people per hour in each direction.|$|E
5000|$|The drive, with {{an engine}} of 454 HP and maximum speed of 10 m/s, {{is housed in}} the upper station. The first section of the Nebelhorn {{cableway}} has 3 supports, which are 41, 38 and 21 metres high. The second section, also rebuilt in 1977, has a length of 2,617.11 metres, a main cable of 55 mm and a <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> of 21 mm in diameter. It climbs a total height of 652 metres.|$|E
50|$|The Tegelberg Cable Car (Tegelbergbahn), on the Tegelberg {{mountain}} near Schwangau {{in southern}} Bavaria. The cable car is 2,146.18 metres long, climbs {{a height of}} 892.5 metres, has a carrying cable of 48 mm in diameter and a <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> of 26 mm in diameter. It has two cabins each capable of transporting up to 44 persons. They are driven by a 2,540 KW engine. The cableway has a 38 metre high support pillar, made of reinforced concrete.|$|E
50|$|The Fichtelberg Cable Car (Fichtelberg Schwebebahn) is a German {{cable car}} in the Ore Mountains in Saxony that runs {{from the town of}} Oberwiesenthal to the Fichtelberg {{mountain}} top. It is the oldest cable car in Germany, leading from the valley station at an altitude of 905 metres above sea level to the top station at 1,208 metres above sea level, having a length of 1,175 metres and a maximum upward gradient of 50 per cent. The Fichtelberg Cable Car is equipped with two carrying and two <b>hauling</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{cableway}} and {{the cabins}} {{come from the}} Leitner Group. A continuous circulating bi-cable aerial ropeway system, where the track cable acts as a rail {{in the sky and}} the <b>haul</b> <b>cable</b> pulls the cabins, allows long spans between towers. It is the first of its type to be installed in Hong Kong. Martin Leitner, chief sales officer of Leitner, explained that the cable car system used in Hong Kong is much heavier and bigger than that used in Austria. He said the steel columns used to support the system have to be stronger, and thus more expensive.|$|R

5000|$|The Nebelhorn Cable Car (Nebelhornbahn) in Oberstdorf, Germany is a {{cable car}} on the Nebelhorn {{mountain}} that was constructed in 3 sections. It was first built between 1928 and 1930 and rebuilt in 1977 and 1991. The first section of the Nebelhorn cable car, renewed in 1977, has a length of 2,202.68 metres, a carrying cable of 55 mm and a <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> of 21 mm in diameter. It climbs a total height of 452 metres.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, the {{intended}} purpose of the narrow gauge railroad below the telephone cables was limited to hauling out excavation debris and <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> spools during the installation of telephone lines, but in 1903, the company renegotiated its franchise to allow {{the use of this}} railroad for freight and mail service. In early 1905, the system was taken over by the Illinois Tunnel Company. By this time, 26 mi of a projected 60 mi of tunnel had been completed. [...] The actual construction work was subcontracted to the Illinois Telephone Construction Company, under the management of George W. Jackson (1861-1922).|$|E
5000|$|The Herzogstand Cable Car [...] (Herzogstandbahn) {{was built}} in 1994 as {{replacement}} for a 4500 ft chair lift through the Bavarian alps. Its two cabins carry passengers from Lake Walchensee (800 m above NN) to the Fahrenberg mountain (1,600 m above NN) on the upper slopes of the Herzogstand mountain. The cableway uses a 43 mm carrying cable and a 21 mm <b>hauling</b> <b>cable.</b> The cable car is driven by a 185 kilowatt engine. The cable way has two supports, which are 28 m and 24 m high. The journey time each way is four minutes and the cars reach {{a top speed of}} 8 m/s.|$|E
50|$|Motive {{power can}} be manual, animal (especially horses and mules), <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> by {{stationary}} engine, or utilize small locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The only {{surviving}} tram service within Wales is the Great Orme Tramway, a <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> tramway in Llandudno which survives as {{a tourist}} attraction.|$|R
5000|$|In 1894 {{the line}} opened, using a steam engine to <b>haul</b> the <b>cable</b> {{and with a}} Riggenbach rack rail for braking. The haulage system was unusual in that whilst the [...] steam engine was at the upper station, the boiler was at the lower station, with the two linked by steam pipes.|$|R
5000|$|The city of Chicago {{granted the}} newly formed Illinois Telephone and Telegraph company the rights to {{construct}} utility tunnels under the streets of Chicago in 1899 to carry its planned network of telephone cables. Initial plans for the tunnels called for filling them with phone cables, leaving a 6 ft by 14 in passage for maintenance. When the city refused to permit manholes through which cable could be unreeled into the tunnels, the plans were changed to include rails for <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> spools through the tunnels. [...] The city was largely unaware {{of the nature of}} the tunneling, and the first 16 mi of tunnel were excavated somewhat covertly, working from the basement of a saloon and carting away the spoil after midnight.|$|E
5000|$|The first plant of this type, called Alpine express I, {{was built}} in 1991 in Saas Fee. In 1994, a further section - the Alpine express II - became operational, however, a {{continuous}} service of both sections is not possible. The cabs of these plants have space for 30 persons and travel with a speed of 6 m/s pulled by an endless <b>hauling</b> <b>cable,</b> and suspended from two carrying cables. A lane thus consists of three cables (from which the system takes its name). As with most rotating cabin cableways, gondolas are detachable from the cables {{in order to allow}} easy disembarkation without disrupting the transit of other cars on the system. The system offers the following advantages over less sophisticated aerial cable-driven transportation systems: ...|$|E
50|$|To {{begin with}} the ore was chiselled free and carted {{to the surface of}} the open pits or shallow mines in baskets. Once shaft depths {{increased}} to between about 10-60 metres hand winches (Handh√§spel) were used, operated by one or two workers (Knechten). The crude ore was placed in wooden buckets for transportation. For the rather short, horizontal gangways leading to the shaft the ore was carried in Trogs for several centuries (long before the introduction of blasting). In the 17th century the shafts reached depths of between 100 and 200 m. Ore could no longer be removed by hand and horsepower was increasingly used. The horses worked in a cone-shaped building, the G√∂pel or Gaipel, which housed a horse whim, a winch that was driven by the horses walking in a circle. The <b>hauling</b> <b>cable</b> (made of natural fibre) or cast-iron chain was wound up and down over a vertical axle. The cable was routed down the shaft and hauled barrels of ore up and down. Due to the shaft's incline, barrels were covered with iron runners on one side, resting partly on the side of the shaft. Above ground at the pithead the ore was emptied out and transported away by horse and cart for processing. From the 18th century shaft depths of several hundred metres were being achieved and horse whims were reaching the limits of their capability. Where the mines were lucrative and their energy consumption high as a result of shaft depth or the ingress of water, water power had been used since the 16th century. Water wheels (Kunstr√§der) drove piston pumps in order to keep the mine dewatered (zu Sumpfe). Reversible water wheels (Kehrr√§der) powered the transportation of ore or winnings. Depending on the terrain conditions the reversible wheels were located either in underground wheel houses (Radstuben) near the shaft (the cable drum being set on the same axle as the water wheel) or above ground in the valley. When using the latter method the wheel's rotation was converted into reciprocating motion using a crank mechanism (Krummen Zapfen) and transmitted over twin flat rods, several hundred metres long, to the shaft. Here, reciprocating motion was re-converted into rotary motion.|$|E
50|$|The {{track and}} <b>hauling</b> <b>cables</b> were {{dismantled}} while the damaged gondolas were dismantled after 3 years. The masts and the stations were kept intact. The aerial tramway was never restored. In 2014, the upper station and both supporting masts were dismantled due to planned {{restoration of the}} tramway as a reversible gondola cable car from slightly moved lower station. However, the upper station location remained the same. The old lower station, due to its unique architecture, is a cultural heritage object. The planned restoration was abandoned due to local opposition and visual flaws of the new lower station {{on one of the}} main squares of the city in front of Radisson Hotel. Another issue with the restoration was the over sized five supporting masts, two of them being located on hilly streets causing already narrow streets to reduce even more in width.|$|R
5000|$|Eibsee Cable Car has {{a length}} of 4450 m and an {{elevation}} gain of 1950 m. The Eibsee Cable Car runs over two pylons, which are 65 m and 85 m high, respectively. The latter is the highest cable support pylon in Germany. The two cabins taking 44 persons each are suspended from two track ropes and are moved by two haulage ropes. The track ropes have a diameter of 46 mm each, and the <b>hauling</b> <b>cables</b> have a diameter of 29 mm each. It runs on [...] of power, generated in the valley station. The route is normally traveled in 10 minutes at a speed of 36 km/h. The tramway can accommodate 300 persons per direction each hour. The elevation gain of 1950 m {{continues to be the}} highest of all aerial cableways achieved in a single section.|$|R
50|$|The second {{prototype}} {{was fitted}} with a propeller-driven winch to <b>haul</b> in drogue <b>cable</b> after air-to-air firing sorties. This was first flown on 26 May 1938.|$|R
50|$|The Clay Street Hill Railroad was {{the first}} {{successful}} <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> street railway. It was located on Clay Street, a notably steep street in San Francisco in California, and first operated in August 1873.|$|R
50|$|In October 2009 it was {{confirmed}} that the Byrom Street cutting was a hitching and unhitching point for trains being <b>cable</b> <b>hauled</b> to Edge Hill via the Victoria Tunnel. Shunting locomotives took trains from The Waterloo Good Station to the cutting to be hitched onto the cable. The Cutting was also a water and fuelling point for shunters. After 1895 <b>cable</b> <b>hauling</b> ceased and locomotives pulled trains the whole length of the Victoria and Waterloo tunnels. Byrom Street Cutting became a runaway catch point for runaway trains in the tunnel. Byrom Street cutting was never a passenger station. The Victoria and Waterloo tunnels were cleared of debris and reflectors placed on the roof after a survey of the tunnels.|$|R
50|$|Each {{section of}} the line is worked by coaches with 64 seats that are <b>hauled</b> by 40-millimetre-thick <b>cables</b> from their upper stations. The {{diameter}} of the electrically driven cable drums is 3.85 metres. The gradient of the line varies between 25 and 82 %.|$|R
50|$|The holds {{were opened}} to release trapped PoWs and the damaged ship was beached close to Methoni Castle on Cape Methoni. Many PoWs {{jumped into the}} sea and took their chance to swim to the rocky shore. A South African lance corporal, Bernard Friedlander of the 3rd Battalion, Transvaal Scottish Regiment, swam ashore with a rope, which took him 90 minutes. The rope was then used to <b>haul</b> a <b>cable</b> ashore, which was made fast on land. Nearly 1,600 {{survivors}} then used the cable to reach safety.|$|R
50|$|Until 1923 {{there was}} no through tram service between Leith and Edinburgh; at the {{boundary}} in Leith Walk {{it was necessary to}} change from a Leith tram (electrically powered) to an Edinburgh tram (<b>cable</b> <b>hauled)</b> until the electrification of the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways in the early 1920s.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shove off," [...] was shouted. The boat {{shot from}} the vessel's side.
