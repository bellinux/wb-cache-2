50|$|In communications, traffic {{policing}} is {{the process}} of monitoring network traffic for compliance with a <b>traffic</b> <b>contract</b> and taking steps to enforce that <b>contract.</b> <b>Traffic</b> sources which are aware of a <b>traffic</b> <b>contract</b> may apply <b>traffic</b> shaping to ensure their output stays within the contract and is thus not discarded. Traffic exceeding a <b>traffic</b> <b>contract</b> may be discarded immediately, marked as non-compliant, or left as-is, depending on administrative policy and the characteristics of the excess traffic.|$|R

5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a <b>traffic</b> <b>contract</b> with that pathway. The <b>traffic</b> <b>contract</b> is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} <b>traffic</b> <b>contract</b> it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|R

40|$|Ethnic {{conflicts}} and their links to <b>international</b> human <b>trafficking</b> have recently received {{a surge in}} international attention. It appears that ethnic conflicts exacerbate the internal displacement of individuals from networks of family and community, and their access to economic and social safety nets. These same individuals are then vulnerable to being trafficked by the hopes of better economic prospects elsewhere. In this paper, we empirically examine this link between ethnic fragmentation, conflicts, internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees and <b>international</b> <b>trafficking,</b> making use of a novel dataset of <b>international</b> <b>trafficking.</b> We conduct a direct estimation, which highlights the ultimate impact of ethnic fragmentation and conflict on <b>international</b> <b>trafficking</b> through internal and international displacements. ethnic fragmentation, conflict, displaced persons, human trafficking...|$|R

50|$|A traffic shaper {{works by}} delaying metered traffic such that each packet {{complies}} with the relevant <b>traffic</b> <b>contract.</b> Metering may be implemented with for example the leaky bucket or token bucket algorithms (the former typically in ATM and the latter in IP networks). Metered packets or cells are then stored in a FIFO buffer for each separately shaped class, until they can be transmitted {{in compliance with the}} prevailing <b>traffic</b> <b>contract.</b> This may occur immediately (if the traffic arriving at the shaper is already compliant), after some delay (waiting in the buffer until its scheduled release time) or never (in case of buffer overflow).|$|R
40|$|CAC {{is defined}} as a set of actions {{executed}} by the network in the phase of connection setup if VP/VC connection should be accepted or denied.

If a new connection is accepted, then a <b>traffic</b> <b>contract</b> between the network and user is signed.
