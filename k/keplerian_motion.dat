The line profiles are very symmetric, have high line/continuum ratios and have central velocity shifts of < 5 km/s relative to the stellar radial velocity. The disks in this subsample are accreting onto their central stars at high rates relative to the parent sample. All disks show CO lines from v= 2, suggesting that the lines are excited, at least in part, by UV fluorescence. Analysis of their spatial distribution shows that the lines are formed within a few AU of the central star. It is concluded that these broad centrally peaked line profiles are inconsistent with the double peaked profiles expected from just an inclined disk in Keplerian rotation. Alternative non-Keplerian line formation mechanisms are discussed, including thermally and magnetically launched winds and funnel flows. The most likely interpretation is that these profiles originate {{from a combination of}} emission from the inner part (< a few AU) of a circumstellar disk, perhaps with enhanced turbulence, and a slow moving disk wind, launched by either EUV emission or soft X-rays.
