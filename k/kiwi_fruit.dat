500|$|The Solomon Islands skink is {{represented}} in {{both public and private}} collections. [...] The Philadelphia Zoo has bred these skinks over multiple generations for the past 40 years. [...] The keeping of the Solomon Islands skink in captivity is not without its challenges: as it is a large arboreal tropical animal. [...] It requires a large arboreal enclosure, with [...] a constant temperature between 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit, with heat being provided from above as well as below, allowing the skink to bask in the heat from above as it would during dusk, while providing a radiant heat from below to aid digestion. [...] The dynamics of the skink's circulus means that not all groups do well when new animals are introduced. [...] Despite successful breeding programs, their somewhat unusual nature of single births and slow growth has made these programs challenging. [...] A well-cared for monkey-tailed skink can live twenty-five to thirty years. [...] A well-balanced diet consisting primarily [...] of kale, green beans, and cooked sweet potato, supplemented with slices of peeled <b>kiwi</b> <b>fruit,</b> apple, and papaya, as well as access to a large shallow, clean water source aid in increasing longevity. [...] Bathing them in shallow lukewarm water during the beginning of the monthly shed, greatly reduces the stress inherent in shedding, as well as speeds the process.|$|E
2500|$|Economic: [...] Perhaps {{the most}} common {{motivation}} for introducing a species into a new place is that of economic gain. Non-native species can become such a common part of an environment, culture, and even diet that little thought is given to their geographic origin.

The biological material was represented by: green onion, spinach leaves, pear fruits (from vegetable farms around Suceava town) and <b>kiwi</b> <b>fruits</b> (from supermarket). The ascorbic acid content was determined through a method based on reduction (by the ascorbic acid) of 2. 6 -Dichlorphenol-indophenol to the corresponding leucoderivate. Through grinding and one hour exposure to air at 20 - 22 °C, the largest reduction in ascorbic acid content was in pear fruits (50 %), {{and the lowest}} one in spinach leaves (11. 7 %). By means of thermal processing (boiling) the ascorbic acid content of the analyzed species has changed in different proportions. Thus, as compared to fresh samples, in boiled ones the vitamin C content has decreased most in pear fruits (by 52. 6 %) and least in spinach leaves (by 38. 5 %). Under the same conditions, in green onion sample the ascorbic acid mean content has increased by 10. 8 %, compared to fresh sample. In the fruit species, under thermal processing conditions, the ascorbic acid mean content was different as against heat-unprocessed samples. Thus, at <b>kiwi</b> <b>fruits</b> both in samples poached with sugar and without sugar, the total content of ascorbic acid (from product and boiling liquid) was superior to the heat-unprocessed samples. In contrast, at pear fruits, under the same experimental conditions, the total content of ascorbic acid was lower than in heat-unprocessed samples...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Proteinases {{present in}} <b>kiwi</b> <b>fruits</b> are {{potentially}} allergenic enzymes {{belonging to the}} papain family of cysteine proteinases. Actinidin is a prominent kiwi enzyme. The study of kiwi proteinases {{is important for the}} follow-up of fruit maturation, a deeper insight in the allergenic properties of individual proteins, and the application of kiwi proteinases formeat tenderisation and other industrial purposes. RESULTS: Kiwi crude extracts were analysed by two-dimensional zymography on gelatin-containing gels. The digestion by the reactivated proteolytic enzymes after electrophoresis resulted in insights into kiwi proteinases. A mixture of several enzyme isotypes with the same pI but different molecular mass was observed. Clear spots, corresponding to the proteolytic activities, were excised, digested with trypsin, and submitted to MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry for protein identification. The most representative enzyme was actinidin. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative achievements of the present study are the: (1) two-dimensional zymographic map of kiwi gelatinases without the need for extensive purification; and (2) direct identification of proteinase isotypes by means of direct MALDI-ToFMS analysis of the zymographic spots. c 2010 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R
25|$|Often in {{commercial}} farming, different breeds {{are used for}} rootstock, fruit bearing plants, and pollinators. Therefore, the seeds produced are crossbreeds of their parents. Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, {{there is no guarantee}} that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, seedlings take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the <b>kiwi</b> is <b>fruit</b> bearing or a pollinator is time consuming. Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new cultivars, are propagated asexually. This is done by grafting the fruit producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.|$|R

5000|$|The Soconusco {{is one of}} {{the most}} fertile areas of the country for {{agriculture}} with plentiful rain and soil enriched by volcanic ash. Large scale cultivation in the area began in the Mesoamerican period with the growing of cacao. Today, crops include coffee, bananas, papaya, mango, <b>kiwi,</b> passion <b>fruit,</b> carambola and African palm [...] Over half of the area’s working population is dedicated to agriculture and livestock. Coffee, bananas and mangos represent over eighty percent of the areas agricultural production. Thirty seven percent of the area’s arable land is dedicated to coffee and another 25% to corn accounting for 62% of all cropland. The rest is mostly dedicated to mangos, cacao and sesame seed. The most exported crops are coffee, mangos, papayas and bananas with over 90% going to the United States. One new tropical fruit being grown in the area is the rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum L.) native to Malaysia and Indonesia but become increasingly popular in Central America and Mexico. One important grower is the Rancho San Alberto in the Cacahoatán municipality which pioneered the growing of this fruit in the country in the mid 20th century. Overall it is estimated that there are 50,000 producing trees over 500 hectares. Growing sectors of the agriculture include organic produce and African palm. The production of ornamental plants began in the early 2000s in the coffee plantations as did “agrotourism” or the opening of plantations to visitors with accommodations and sometimes spa facilities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{physiological}} {{characteristics of}} <b>kiwi</b> (Actinidia delicosa) <b>fruit</b> were analyzed, which inclued its nutritional composition, in vitro-antioxidant activities, and neuronal cell protective effects. The most abundant components of mineral, amino acid, and fatty acid {{were found to}} be potassium (K), glutamic acid, and a-linolenic acid, respectively. The major free sugars were fructose, glucose, and sucrose. In addition, β-carotene and vitamin C contents were 1. 35 µg/ 100 mL and 29. 21 mg/ 100 g, respectively. The 2, 2 '-azinobis-(3 -ethylbenothiazline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical-scavenging activity of the n-hexane fraction obtained from the kiwi extract was 10. 52 % at a concentration of 1000 µg/mL.

40|$|Aim: The main aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} the differences between some Northern countries regarding what foods, according to the patients, elicit hypersensitivity symptoms. Methods: At the participating clinics, patients with a history of food hypersensitivity (n = 1139) were asked to fill in a questionnaire in which 86 different foodstuffs were listed. Skin-prick tests (SPT) were performed with common inhalant allergens. Results: The foods that were reported as eliciting symptoms differed between countries. In Russia, Estonia, and Lithuania; citrus fruits, chocolate, honey, apple, hazelnut, strawberry, fish, tomato, egg, and milk were most often reported as causes of hypersensitivity. In Sweden and Denmark; birch pollen (BP) related foods, such as nuts, apple, pear, <b>kiwi,</b> stone <b>fruits,</b> and carrot were the most common causes. In all countries, children, more often than adults, had symptoms of allergic reaction to citrus fruits, tomato, strawberry, milk, egg, and fish. Most patients (95 %) reported hypersensitivity to several foodstuffs (median: eight foods). The most common symptoms were oral allergy syndrome and urticaria. Severe symptoms were most common with fish, shellfish, nuts, and milk. Slight symptoms were most common with rice, coriander, poppy seed, lingonberry, corn, caraway, red currant, and fig. Earlier well-known correlations, such as that between BP sensitization and some fruits and vegetables, as well as that between mugwort and some spices, were corroborated. Positive correlations were found between self-reported hypersensitivity to crustaceans and SPT with horse. A negative correlation was seen between hypersensitivity to crustaceans and SPT with BP. Conclusions: The foodstuffs that often are reported to cause food hypersensitivity, differ between Sweden/Denmark on one side and the Baltic States and Russia on the other. BP-related foods dominate in Scandinavia, whereas some mugwort-related foods are of more importance in Russia and the Baltic States...|$|R
