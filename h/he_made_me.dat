500|$|Dave Van Ronk {{gives this}} {{account of the}} song's origin: [...] "Bob Dylan heard me fooling around {{with one of my}} grandmother's favorites, 'The Chimes of Trinity,' a sentimental ballad about Trinity Church, that went {{something}} like Tolling for the outcast, tolling for the gay/Tolling for the , long since passed away/As we whiled away the hours, down on old Broadway/And we listened to the chimes of Trinity. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> sing it for him a few times until he had the gist of it, then reworked it into 'Chimes of Freedom.' Her version was better." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{guitar and}} bass {{ensemble}} was primarily dictated by Frusciante, {{rather than a}} collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore, the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on By the Way, using tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band's subsequent studio album, Stadium Arcadium, Flea reflected on the composition of By the Way, stating: [...] "John went to this whole level of artistry. But <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel like I had nothing to offer, like I knew shit." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1964 {{he began}} to suffer from {{problems}} with his sight, which he attributed to the close analysis of artwork entailed by his job. He consulted eye specialist Patrick Trevor-Roper, who diagnosed a latent squint and recommended that Chatwin take a six-month break from his work at Sotheby's. [...] Trevor-Roper {{had been involved in}} the design of an eye hospital in Addis Ababa, and suggested Chatwin visit East Africa. In February 1965, Chatwin left for Sudan. It was on this trip that Chatwin first encountered a nomadic tribe; their way of life intrigued him. [...] "My nomadic guide," [...] he wrote, [...] "carried a sword, a purse and a pot of scented goat's grease for anointing his hair. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel overburdened and inadequate..." [...] Chatwin would remain fascinated by nomads {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Jerry Claiborne {{took over}} as {{head coach of the}} Terrapins, which had only nine wins in the past five years. In his first season, Maryland {{improved}} to 5–5–1, and the following year, they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades. The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11–0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as [...] "vanilla", and said his strategy was [...] "run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense." [...] He went on to say, [...] "But, there's no question <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a tougher player [...] [...] [...] We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker. It was like he had a sign on our back, 'Hit us, we're stupid'. It made you a tougher player." ...|$|E
500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Steiger had {{intended}} {{returning to the}} stage, and had signed on to play the title character in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo, at the Lincoln Center Repertory Company in April 1967, but the production was cancelled when he became ill. Steiger won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Chief of Police Bill Gillespie in In the Heat of the Night, opposite Sidney Poitier. He played a Southern police chief searching for a murderer. Prejudiced against blacks, he jumps {{to the conclusion that}} the culprit is Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), an African-American man passing through town after visiting his mother, who later turns out to be an experienced homicide detective from Philadelphia. The film deals with the way the two men interact and join forces in solving the crime, as Steiger's Gillespie learns to greatly respect the black man he initially took to be a criminal. Steiger drew upon his experience in the Navy with a Southerner named [...] "King", remembering his accent. Poitier considered Steiger and Spencer Tracy to have been the finest actors he had ever worked with, remarking in 1995, [...] "He's so good <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> dig into bags I never knew I had." [...] A. D. Murphy of Variety described Steiger's performance as [...] "outstanding", writing: [...] "Steiger's transformation from a diehard Dixie bigot to a man who learns to respect Poitier stands out in smooth comparison to the wandering solution of the murder." [...] Steiger won a plethora of other awards, including a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Laurel Award and awards for Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle.|$|E

500|$|For the 1981 season, Ferrari {{introduced}} {{their first}} turbo engined F1 car, the 126C, which produced tremendous power but was let down by its poor handling. Villeneuve was partnered with Didier Pironi who noted that Villeneuve [...] "had a little family [...] but <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> welcome {{and made me}} feel at home overnight... treated me as an equal in every way." [...] Villeneuve won two races during the season. At the Spanish Grand Prix Villeneuve kept five quicker cars behind him {{for most of the}} race using the superior straight-line speed of his car. After an hour and 46 minutes of racing Villeneuve led second-placed Jacques Laffite by only 0.22 seconds. Fifth-placed Elio de Angelis was only just over a second further back. Harvey Postlethwaite, who was hired by Ferrari to design the follow-on and much more successful 126C2 that won the Constructors' Championship in 1982, later commented on the 126C: [...] "That car...had literally one quarter of the downforce that, say Williams or Brabham had. It had a power advantage over the Cosworths for sure, but it also had massive throttle lag at that time. In terms of sheer ability I think Gilles was on a different plane to the other drivers. To win those races, the 1981 GPs at Monaco and Jarama — on tight circuits — was quite out of this world. I know how bad that car was." [...] At the 1981 Canadian Grand Prix Villeneuve damaged the front wing of his Ferrari and drove for most of the race in heavy rain with the wing obscuring his view ahead. There was a risk of being black flagged but eventually the wing became detached and Villeneuve drove on to finish third with the nose section of his car missing.|$|E

With the guidance of her father, Lee excelled at sports at a very early age.

2500|$|Despite his {{criticism}} of Zhao, Chen Yun was the Party elder most respected by Zhao, and Zhao would frequently attempt to consult with Chen before implementing new policies. Li Xiannian resented Zhao personally for Zhao's interest in foreign culture, and for Zhao's willingness to learn from economic models that had been successful outside of China. According to Zhao, Li Xiannian [...] "hated me because I was implementing Deng Xiaoping's reforms, but since {{it was difficult for}} him to openly oppose Deng, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> the target of the opposition." ...|$|E

He also worked with his father in the construction industry to support his career. Speaking about his father's role in his career, Nadeau said, [...] "I learned a lot from my dad, Gerry, while I was growing up.

2500|$|As {{the only}} person capable of {{controlling}} Puyi, Johnston had much more influence than his title of English tutor would suggest as the eunuchs began to rely upon Johnston to steer Puyi away from his more capricious moods. When the 14 year-old Puyi had some western-style clothing purchased to wear from a theater company, Johnston flew into a rage, saying that Puyi was wearing cheap clothing unworthy of an emperor, and had Puyi buy expensive clothes from a western-style department store, telling Puyi [...] "If you wear clothes from a second-hand shop, you won't be a gentleman, you'll be..." [...] with Puyi noting {{he was unable to}} finish his sentence. Under Johnston's influence, Puyi started to insist that his eunuchs address him as [...] "Henry" [...] and later his wife Wanrong as [...] "Elizabeth" [...] as Puyi began to speak [...] "Chinglish"-a mixture of Mandarin and English that was to be his preferred model of speech. Puyi recalled about Johnston: [...] "I thought everything about him was first-rate. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel that Westerners were the most intelligent and civilized people in the world and that he was the most learned of Westerners" [...] and that [...] "Johnston had become the major part of my soul". In May 1919, Puyi noticed the protests in Beijing generated by the May 4th movement as thousands of Chinese university students protested against the decision by the great powers at the Paris peace conference to award the former German concessions in Shangdong province together with the former German colony of Qingdao to Japan. For Puyi, the May 4th movement, which he asked Johnston about, was a revelation as it marked {{the first time in his}} life that he noticed that people outside the Forbidden City had concerns that were not about him.|$|E
