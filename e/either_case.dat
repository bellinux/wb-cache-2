The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In <b>either</b> <b>case,</b> the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E

In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In <b>either</b> <b>case,</b> the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have {{questioned whether the}} diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In <b>either</b> <b>case,</b> the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E

5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in <b>either</b> <b>case</b> double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects {{a situation where}} resources are not specialised and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant {{opportunity costs}}. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in <b>either</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1637 Wiśniowiecki {{might have}} fought under Hetman Mikołaj Potocki against the Cossack {{rebellion}} of Pavel Pavluk (the Pawluk Uprising); Jan Widacki notes that historians are not certain whether {{he did and}} in <b>either</b> <b>case,</b> no detailed accounts of his possible participation survive. A year later, returning from the Sejm and from the engagement ceremony with Gryzelda, he gathered a 4,000 strong division that participated in putting down of the Ostrzanin Uprising and arrived at the region affected by the unrest in June that year. Together with Hetman Potocki he defeated the insurgents at the Battle of Żownin, which turned into a rather difficult siege of the Cossack camp that lasted from 13 June till the Cossack relief forces were defeated on 4 August, and the Cossacks capitulated on 7 August.|$|E

In <b>either</b> <b>cases,</b> the female [...] "flicks" [...] her eggs, swinging her tail, up to several feet to land on the forest floor. These eggs must be kept relatively cool - under 25°C - or they are unlikely to hatch.|$|R
40|$|The mapping {{between the}} metal-insulator {{transition}} of the quantum Hall {{system and a}} superfluid-to-insulator transition is revisited based on a disordered anyon model. The one-parameter scaling of the superfluid-to-insulator transition is employed {{for the analysis of}} the scaling behavior of the integer quantum Hall transitions. The analysis reveals the direct transition from a quantum Hall plateau to the insulator in weak disorder limit, and a float-down transition for strong disorders. In <b>either</b> <b>cases,</b> the transition corresponds to a non-chirality superfluid-to-insulator transition, with the longitudinal and transverse quantum Hall conductivities following a semi-circle relation...|$|R

5|$|In February 2015, Jenner was {{involved}} in a fatal multiple-vehicle collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. Kim Howe, an animal rights activist and actress, was killed when Jenner's SUV ran into Howe's car. Accounts of the sequence of collisions have varied, as have the number of people injured. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges, but three civil lawsuits were brought by Howe's stepchildren and drivers of other cars involved in the collision. Jessica Steindorff, a Hollywood agent who was hit by Howe's car, settled her case in December 2015. Howe's stepchildren settled their case in January 2016.

5|$|Katherine Merry Devine, 14, was {{abducted}} on November 25, 1973, {{and her body}} was found the next month in the Capitol State Forest near Olympia, Washington. Brenda Joy Baker, 14, was seen hitchhiking near Puyallup, Washington on May 27, 1974; {{her body was found}} in Millersylvania State Park a month later. Though Bundy was widely believed responsible for both murders, he told Keppel that he had no knowledge of <b>either</b> <b>case.</b> DNA analysis led to the arrest and conviction of William E. Cosden for Devine's murder in 2002. The Baker homicide remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, {{the year}} of the portrait. He befriended Ingres either through his son Édouard Bertin, a student of the painter, or via Étienne-Jean Delécluze, Ingres' friend and the Journals art critic. In <b>either</b> <b>case</b> the genesis of the {{commission}} is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists. Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.|$|E

5000|$|This type {{of virus}} usually must enter the host nucleus before {{it is able to}} {{replicate}}. Some of these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate their genome, while others, such as adenoviruses or herpes viruses, encode their own replication factors. However, in <b>either</b> <b>cases,</b> replication of the viral genome is highly dependent on a cellular state permissive to DNA replication and, thus, on the cell cycle. The virus may induce the cell to forcefully undergo cell division, which may lead to transformation of the cell and, ultimately, cancer.

5|$|Maintenance problems. The {{chain-driven}} {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash, which provided combustible material, and sparks from heavy braking would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary, to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In <b>either</b> <b>case,</b> the local fire brigade would be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming {{into contact with the}} hot boiler causing stress to the casings. Many photographs show an un-rebuilt locomotive with warped casings, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E
5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic {{is given in}} the original sources. This may be {{because he was a}} child of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was a child of a daughter of Ímar, which in <b>either</b> <b>case</b> would mean his legitimacy to rule in the eyes of his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the Uí Ímair {{and was one of the}} earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.|$|E
5|$|On 8 July, Heydrich {{announced}} that all Jews {{were to be}} regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot. On 17 July Heydrich ordered that the Einsatzgruppen were to kill all Jewish Red Army prisoners of war, plus all Red Army prisoners of war from Georgia and Central Asia, as they too might be Jews. Unlike in Germany, where the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 defined as Jewish anyone with at least three Jewish grandparents, the Einsatzgruppen defined as Jewish anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent; in <b>either</b> <b>case,</b> whether or not the person practised the religion was irrelevant. The unit was also assigned to exterminate Romani people and the mentally ill. It was common practice for the Einsatzgruppen to shoot hostages.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{numerical}} algorithm for time-dependent convection–diffusion–reaction problems and compare its performance with the well-known numerical methods in the literature. Time discretization is performed by using fractional-step θ-scheme, while an economical {{form of the}} residual-free bubble method {{is used for the}} space discretization. We compare the proposed algorithm with the classical stabilized finite element methods over several benchmark problems {{for a wide range of}} problem configurations. The effect of the order in the sequence of discretization (in time and in space) to the quality of the approximation is also investigated. Numerical experiments show the improvement through the proposed algorithm over the classical methods in <b>either</b> <b>cases...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} neurogenic bladder {{dysfunction}} due to tethered spinal cord syndrome in adults were experienced. They visited our hospital with the complaint of dysuria. The excretory urogram were almost normal. Urodynamic examinations revealed normoactive detrusor-overactive sphincter in case 1, and overactive detrusor-overactive sphincter in case 2. Cystometry-electromyogram demonstrated detrusor-external urethral sphincter dyssynergia in <b>either</b> <b>cases.</b> They were diagnosed as neurogenic bladder due to intraspinal tumor with spina bifida by myelography, computed tomography, and urodynamic examination. Laminectomy, subtotal extirpation of tumor and neurectomy of filum terminale were performed by orthopedists in both cases. The tumor was pathologically diagnosed as lipomas. Postoperatively they showed satisfactory recovery in micturition...|$|R

It was set ablaze and destroyed on 23 January, either as an agreed precaution against discovery or as an unauthorised act by Quintal—in <b>either</b> <b>case,</b> there was now no means of escape. The island proved an ideal haven for the mutineers—uninhabited, virtually inaccessible, with plenty of food, water and fertile land. For a while, mutineers and Tahitians existed peaceably.

40|$|We {{study the}} bound states of a two {{dimensional}} free electron gas (2 DEG) {{subjected to a}} perpendicular inhomogeneous magnetic field. An analytical transfer matrix (ATM) based exact quantization formula is derived for magnetic fields that vary (arbitrarily) along one spatial direction. As illustrative examples, we consider (1) a class of symmetric power law magnetic fields confined within a strip, followed by the problem of a (2) 2 DEG placed under a thin ferromagnetic film, which are hitherto unexplored. The exact Landau levels for <b>either</b> <b>cases</b> are obtained. Also, {{the role of the}} fringing magnetic field (present in the second example) on these levels is discussed.
