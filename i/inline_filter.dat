50|$|Propellants {{are forced}} into the {{combustion}} chamber by compressed air, stored at 200 bar in two steel vessels. This pressure is released through an electrically-fired cartridge that opens a valve with a blow-out disc. This is {{the full extent of}} the electrical control system. Once fired, the valve does not close again. A pressure regulator delivers air at 33 bar, through a shuttle valve that pressurised first the catalyst tanks and then the propellant tank. This delay ensures reliable ignition in the combustion chamber. A non-return valve ensures that no catalyst can flow backwards into the air or propellant plumbing, with an explosive result. A rubber diaphram, broken as propellant pressure builds, ensures that there is no backflow through the combustion chamber either.

40|$|Closed-path eddy-covariance (EC) {{systems are}} used to monitor exchanges of trace gases (e. g., carbon dioxide [CO 2], water vapor [H 2 O], nitrous oxide and methane) between the {{atmosphere}} and biosphere. Traditional EC-intake systems are equipped with inline filters to prevent airborne dust particulate from contaminating the optical windows of the sample cell which causes measurement degradation. The <b>inline</b> <b>filter</b> should have a fine pore size (1 to 20  µm is common) to adequately protect the optics and a large filtration surface area to extend the time before it clogs. However, the filter must also have minimal internal volume to preserve good frequency response. This paper reports test results of the field performance of an EC system (EC 155, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan Utah, USA) with a prototype vortex intake replacing the <b>inline</b> <b>filter</b> of a traditional EC system. The vortex-intake design is based on fluid dynamics theory. An air sample is drawn into the vortex chamber, where it spins in a vortex flow. The initially homogenous flow is separated when particle momentum forces heavier particles to {{the periphery of the}} chamber, leaving a much cleaner airstream at the center. Clean air (75  % of total flow) is drawn {{from the center of the}} vortex chamber, through a tube, to the sample cell where it is exposed to the optical windows of the gas analyzer. The remaining 25  % of the flow carries the heavier dust particles away through a separate bypass tube. An EC 155 system measured CO 2 and H 2 O fluxes in two urban-forest ecosystems in the megalopolis of Beijing, China. These sites present a challenge for EC measurements because of the generally poor air quality which has high concentrations of suspended particulate. The closed-path EC system with vortex intake significantly reduced maintenance requirements by preserving optical signal strength and sample-cell pressure within acceptable ranges for much longer periods. The system with vortex intake also maintained an excellent frequency response. For example, at the Badaling site, the amount of system downtime attributed solely to clogged filters was reduced from 26  % with traditional inline filters to 0  % with the prototype vortex intake. The use of a vortex intake could extend the geographical applicability of the EC technique in ecology and allow investigators to acquire more accurate and continuous measurements of trace-gas fluxes in a wider range of ecosystems...|$|E

This study investigates whether leukocyte depletion during coronary perfusion following reoxygenation can maintain endothelial and myocyte function, or less oxidant dam-age in a porcine neonatal model. After 30 minutes hypoxemia, 13 piglets underwent 60 minutes reoxygenation. The aorta was clamped and coronary reperfusion was either with normal blood (N= 6), or leukocyte free blood by an <b>inline</b> <b>filter</b> (N= 7). Cardiac function and endothelial re-sponse were assessed {{before and after}} cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Contractile recovery was improved by leukocyte depletion. Additionally, the antioxidant reserve capacity reserved more (534 ± 36 versus 772 ± 91; p< 0. 05) than reoxygenation without a leukocyte-depleting filter. Leukocyte depletion returned more extreme relaxation to acetylcholine (71. 8 ± 20. 4 % versus 41. 2 ± 9. 8 %; p< 0. 05), but did not change the endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside in either group.

Optimization of both the removal of particulate matter and collection of bio-oil will require this information. In addition, the success of catalytic reforming of bio-oil to high-value chemicals will depend upon this transport phase.;A variety of experimental techniques were used to identify the transport phase.

In Phase I, test organisms were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated 5 % dextrose injections showed visual turbidity within 48 hours. Identification of contaminating organisms by subculturing the inoculum of each filter was successful. Nine TPN solutions were inoculated with test organisms using the methods in Phase I. All contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hours.

40|$|An online, {{semi-continuous}} {{instrument to}} measure both total and gas phase atmospheric {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and determine the concentration of ROS in the particle phase (ROS(p)) was developed. This instrument {{was based on a}} fluorescent probe for quantifying ambient ROS, specifically 2 ' 7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescin, or DCFH probe. This probe was analyzed for sensitivity to a variety of offline and online parameters for efficient use in a field instrument. The ROS(p) instrument measures the peak light intensity at 530 nm to determine ambient ROS concentrations. ROS particles and gases are collected in a mist chamber in a nebulized mist. The instrument alternates measurements of ROS(p+g), or ROS(tot) by means of an <b>inline</b> <b>filter.</b> Fine (PM₂. ₅) (ROS(p) is determined by subtraction of the ROS(g) concentration from the ROS(tot), as the ROS(g) signal could not be excluded. This instrument was tested during the summer (May-July) of 2012 at urban and rural sites in the metropolitan Atlanta and surrounding region. Concentrations of ROS(p) determined from this instrument were often below limit of detection. Average concentrations of ROS(p) were found to be 0. 25 nmol/m³ in urban Atlanta (Jefferson St. and Georgia Tech), and 0. 15 nmol/m³ in Yorkville, a rural site. A side by side comparison of this method with a filter collection method was made in July. The average ROS(p) offline concentrations were 0. 15 nmol/m³. These concentrations were comparable to the online average concentrations of 0. 21 nmol/m³ for the same period of time. This average and the majority of the measurements comprising it is dominated by the high limit of detection. The ROS instrument as constructed and operated is an efficient way to conduct ROS(p) measurements at the level of a filter study while reducing the labor intensive filter collection and extraction. In order for this instrument to be successful at measuring ambient ROS in the particle phase, the removal of the gas phase from the current sampling scheme is critical as the ROS(g) concentrations are over 90 % of the measured ROS. The system as currently operable is best suited for source measurements, including biomass burning plumes or fresh exhaust to capture immediate formation.

This work investigates routes to miniaturization of chip-scale optical devices. Two new techniques and devices based thereon are introduced for the first time. One technique makes use of integrated metallic mirrors to construct reflectors which are by an order of magnitude smaller than their counterparts. Another technique is based on folding of chip-scale devices to fit long structures into small area on a chip. Although both techniques are demonstrated on some specific examples, the developed toolkit is applicable to a wide range of chip-scale devices including modulators, filters, channel add-drop multiplexers, detectors, and others.

50|$|Texas Tech's first {{radio station}} wasn’t a true {{broadcast}} radio station, but a carrier current station, where a low-power AM signal {{is sent to}} receivers through a building's electrical wiring. Signal reception was limited to receivers either plugged directly into the building's electrical system or placed {{close enough to the}} power lines which would act as a leaky feeder. The signal was limited to the building in which it was broadcast, because the electrical transformers and switch gear that supplied electricity to the building, would prevent the signal being passed elsewhere. Additional wiring had to be run directly to other buildings for the signal to be heard in them. Carrier current stations are not licensed by the FCC, but operate under the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 15 (Title 47 CFR Part 15). Such stations are not issued official call signs nor are they subject to federal regulation as commercial radio stations are. Despite their limited range, carrier current stations offer several benefits: their transmitters are rather cheap and easy to construct, they can operate on any AM frequency, and if the signal originates on the campus of an educational institution, there is theoretically no power limit. By increasing the transmitter power and using <b>inline</b> <b>filters,</b> the signal quality is improved and a greater number of buildings can be served.
