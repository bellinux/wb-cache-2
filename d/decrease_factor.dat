40|$|The IEEE 802. 11 medium {{access control}} (MAC) {{protocol}} provides a contention-based distributed channel access mechanism for mobile stations to share the wireless medium, which may introduce a lot of collisions in case of overloaded active stations. Slow contention window (CW) decrease scheme is a simple and efficient solution for this problem. In this paper, we use an analytical model to compare the slow CW decrease scheme to the IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol. Several parameters are investigated such {{as the number of}} stations, the initial CW size, the <b>decrease</b> <b>factor</b> value, the maximum backoff stage and the coexistence with the RequestToSend and ClearToSend (RTS/CTS) mechanism. The results show that the slow CW decrease scheme can efficiently improve the throughput of IEEE 802. 11, and that the throughput gain is higher when the <b>decrease</b> <b>factor</b> is larger. Moreover, the initial CW size and maximum backoff stage also affect the performance of slow CW decrease scheme...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} is to {{study the effects of}} isovolemic hemodilution on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in non-ischemic rats. Regional CBF was measured by Laser-Doppler flowmetery and hydrogen clearance method in the rat's thalamus simultaneously. It is possible for the Laser-Doppler flowmeter (LDF) to make continuous measurement of rCBF. Thirteen Wistar rats were anesthetized with 1. 5 % halothane by mask. Isovolemic hemodilution was performed to exchange of 7 ml of human albumin for 7 ml rat blood gradually. After this process the values of hematocrit (Hct) decreased from 44. 8 to 31. 7. The rCBF of the thalamus measured by LDF increased by 25. 8 %. The increase in rCBF correlated almost linearly with the decrease in Hct. The decrease of mean red cell density caused by hemodilution in the tissue is a <b>decrease</b> <b>factor</b> of CBF which is the theoretical basis of this method. In spite of the <b>decrease</b> <b>factor</b> measured CBF was increased. These data suggest that the remarkable increase in red cells velocity may occur with hemodilution...|$|E

Subgaleal hemorrhage complications result from massive bleeding. We present a neonate with unremarkable family history and uneventful pregnancy with a vaginal delivery with no instrumentation, presenting with severe subgaleal bleeding at 52 hours of life. Aggressive support measures were implemented and bleeding managed. The unexpected bleeding lead to a coagulation study and the diagnosis of severe hemophilia A. There were no known sequelae.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a novel {{congestion}} control scheme is proposed that aims at providing a smoother and reduced loss rate adaptation behavior {{compared to that}} under the basic Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AI/MD) scheme; such a scheme {{is expected to be}} more appropriate for continuous media streaming applications. The basic features of the proposed scheme are that: (a) the rate increment is modulated by the distance between the flow’s current rate and a targeted maximum rate determined by the streaming application; (b) the multiplicative <b>decrease</b> <b>factor</b> is shaped by the induced packet losses. These features are responsible for a dynamic and self-adjusting rate adaptation behavior that is shown to improve convergence to fairness, the oscillatory behavior and induced packet losses. Numerical results illustrate the good properties and intrinsic advantages of the proposed scheme. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} expansionary technology shocks (shocks that increase labor productivity and factor inputs) as opposed to contractionary technology shocks (shocks that increase labor productivity, but <b>decrease</b> <b>factor</b> inputs). We estimate these two shocks jointly {{based on a minimum}} set of identifying restrictions in a structural VAR. We show that most of the business cycle variation of key macroeconomic variables such as output and consumption is driven by expansionary technology shocks. However, contractionary technology shocks are important to understand the variation in labor productivity and production inputs. In addition, these shocks trigger different reactions of certain variables, which can help explain why existing evidence on technology shocks does not deliver clear results. In a simple DSGE model with managerial technology, which is consistent with our identifying restrictions, we interpret contractionary technology shocks as process innovations and motivate the difference to expansionary technology shocks...|$|E

The results show that TOP performance over binary mode ABR is very sensitive to parameter value settings, and that a poor choice of parameters can result in ABR performance worse than that of the much less expensive UBR-EPD scheme...|$|E
