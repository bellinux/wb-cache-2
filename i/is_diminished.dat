5|$|Scholar M. Daphne Kutzer {{points out}} that Mr. McGregor's role is larger in The Flopsy Bunnies than in the two {{previous}} rabbit books, but he inspires less fear in The Flopsy Bunnies than in Peter Rabbit because his role as fearsome antagonist <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> when he becomes a comic foil in the book's final scenes. Nonetheless, for young readers, {{he is still a}} frightening figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies whose parents have failed to adequately protect them.|$|E
5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its shape {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction, but at the equator the effective gravity <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, {{in the sense that the}} effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at the equator, as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E

5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat with wet, often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed sphagnum. The sphagnum wicks moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the sphagnum or made unavailable by the low soil pH. Since nutrient availability is low, competition from other plants <b>is</b> <b>diminished,</b> allowing the carnivorous English sundew to flourish.|$|E
5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E

5|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a percentage starting at 100, which <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> when they are shot or attacked by enemies. If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one life and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets. The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels. Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition {{can be found in}} hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered. The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels.|$|E
25|$|Stevens, J., dissenting. :The {{categorical}} rule {{created by}} the court is unsound and an unwise addition {{to the law of}} takings. In the past the court had worked at rejecting an absolute formula for determining a taking and have frequently in the past held a law that renders property valueless may not constitute a taking. The new rule {{created by the}} court is arbitrary because a landowner whose property <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> in value 95% recovers nothing while an owner whose property <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> 100% recovers the landâ€™s full value.|$|E

5000|$|In {{classical}} music from Western culture, a <b>diminished</b> fourth (...) <b>is</b> an interval produced by narrowing a perfect fourth by a chromatic semitone. For example, the interval from C to F {{is a perfect}} fourth, five semitones wide, and both the intervals from C to F, and from C to F <b>are</b> <b>diminished</b> fourths, spanning four semitones. <b>Being</b> <b>diminished,</b> it <b>is</b> considered a dissonant interval.|$|R

25|$|In a 1994 report {{released}} by five top cigarette companies, cysteine {{is one of}} the 599 additives to cigarettes. Like most cigarette additives, however, its use or purpose is unknown. Its inclusion in cigarettes could offer two benefits: acting as an expectorant, since smoking increases mucus production in the lungs; or increasing the beneficial antioxidant glutathione (which <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> in smokers).|$|E
25|$|Anticholinergic {{side effects}} such as dry mouth and {{constipation}} are either greatly reduced {{in comparison to}} imipramine and most other TCAs or fully lacking with iprindole. However, it still has significant antihistamine effects and therefore can produce sedation, though this <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> relative to other TCAs similarly. Iprindole also lacks significant alpha-blocking properties, and hence does not pose a risk of orthostatic hypotension.|$|E

25|$|No terra {{material}} {{similar to}} that in the Kuiper quadrangle (De Hon and others, 1981) was recognized in the Beethoven quadrangle. Its absence may be due, in part, to fewer clusters of large young craters whose coalesced ejecta blankets could have yielded the coarsely textured, rough surfaces that characterize the unit in the Kuiper area. Also, the visible effect of roughness <b>is</b> <b>diminished</b> by the higher sun angle at which the Beethoven images were acquired.|$|E
