40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of the built environment, we know little about the biology of species living in human-constructed habitats. <b>Camel</b> <b>crickets</b> (Rhaphidophoridae) are commonly observed in North American houses and include a range of native taxa as well as the Asian Diestrammena asynamora (Adelung), a species occasionally reported from houses though considered to be established only in greenhouses. We launched a continental-scale citizen science campaign to better understand the relative distributions and frequency of native and nonnative <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> in human homes across North America. Participants contributed survey data about {{the presence or absence of}} <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> in homes, as well as photographs and specimens of <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> allowing us to identify the major genera and/or species in and around houses. Together, these data offer insight into the geographical distribution of <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> as a presence in homes, as well as the relative frequency and distribution of native and nonnative <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> encountered in houses. In so doing, we show that the exotic Diestrammena asynamora not only has become a common presence in eastern houses, but is found in these environments far more frequently than native <b>camel</b> <b>crickets.</b> Supplemental pitfall trapping along transects in 10 urban yards in Raleigh, NC revealed that D. asynamora can be extremely abundant locally around some homes, with as many as 52 individuals collected from pitfalls in a single yard over two days of sampling. The number of D. asynamora individuals present in a trap was negatively correlated with the trap’s distance from a house, suggesting that these insects may be preferentially associated with houses but also are present outside. In addition, we report the establishment in the northeastern United States of a second exotic species, putatively Diestrammena japanica Blatchley, which was previously undocumented in the literature. Our results offer new insight into the relative frequency and distribution of <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> living in human homes, and emphasize the importance of the built environment as habitat for two little-known invading species of Orthoptera...|$|R

Here we provide evidence of the effects of invasive rats (Rattus spp.) on island invertebrate populations using a large-scale natural experiment. We investigated the effects of invasive rats on Falkland <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> (Parudenus spp.) in the Falkland Islands (South Atlantic) by comparing an index of <b>camel</b> <b>cricket</b> relative abundance between 18 rat-infested islands, six rat-eradicated islands and 13 naturally rat-free islands (in total, 37 islands).

In the <b>camel</b> <b>cricket</b> Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus Rehn, we test (1) the role of chemical cues in conspecific attraction, and (2) {{the role of the}} abdominal tubercles of adult males in producing those cues.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{orthopteran}} communication {{have focused on}} acoustic communication. However, <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> (01 ihoptera: Raphidophoridae) do not produce songs as {{they do not have}} wings as adults, and almost nothing is known about their mating behavior. In insects, chemical cues in the form of cuticular pheromones may function as sexual signals to attract potential mates. To explore the mating behavior of <b>camel</b> <b>crickets,</b> I conducted several studies with Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus. Adult male P. marmoratus have several distinct features lacking in females and in juveniles: they possess prominent bumps called tubercles on the dorsal side of their abdomen, and adult males also have strongly and curiously bent hind tibiae. In this thesis, I tested if the tubercles function in chemical communication, and if male hind tibia functions in male-female mating interactions. Using behavioral trials, electron microscopy, and histological sectioning, I determined that it is very likely that male tubercles produce chemical cues important to females. I also analyzed mating behaviors with videotape. These observations suggested that males sometimes use their hind tibia to force females to copulate. Males used their Vlll hind legs to exert control over females by grasping the females and pressing them against the male's bodies until copulation was achieved. The males also used their hind legs to fight other males and the fights escalated until one of the males retreated. These are the first detailed quantitative studies of mating behavior in any species of Prisotceuthophilus and among the first for any <b>camel</b> <b>cricket...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{orthopteran}} family Rhaphidophoridae {{includes the}} cave weta, cave <b>crickets,</b> camelback <b>crickets,</b> <b>camel</b> <b>crickets,</b> spider crickets (sometimes shortened to [...] "criders", or [...] "land shrimp" [...] or sprickets") and sand treaders, of the suborder Ensifera. Those occurring in New Zealand, Australia, and Tasmania are typically {{referred to as}} jumping or cave weta. Most are found in forest environments or within caves, animal burrows, cellars, under stones, in wood or in similar environments. They are characterized in part by their long antennae and legs. The well-known field crickets are from a different superfamily (Grylloidea) and only look vaguely similar, while {{members of the family}} Tettigoniidae may look superficially similar in body form.|$|R
5000|$|Cave and <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> are {{of little}} {{economic}} importance {{except as a}} nuisance in buildings and homes, especially basements.

They are fairly common invaders of homes in Hokkaido and other cool regions in Japan, where they are called kamado-uma or colloquially benjo korogi (literally [...] "toilet cricket").|$|R
50|$|The {{features}} which distinguish crickets in the superfamily Grylloidea {{from other}} Ensiferans are long, thread-like antennae, three tarsal segments, slender tactile cerci {{at the tip}} of the abdomen and bulbous sensory bristles on the cerci.

The term cricket is widely, but loosely, used to describe any cricket-like insect in the order Ensifera, being applied to bush crickets (Tettigoniidae), Jerusalem <b>crickets</b> (Stenopelmatus), <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> and cave crickets (Rhaphidophoridae) and wetas (Anostostomatidae), and the relatives of these. All these insects have four tarsal segments and are probably more closely related to each other than they are to the true crickets, Gryllidae.|$|R
50|$|Though a {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} study of Pterygodermatites peromysci hasn’t been worked out, there do exist stereo microscope images of the morphology of the egg with a hatching third stage infectious juvenile which infect white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, (Figure 2, source 4). Parasitic infection of the definitive mouse occurs once the encysted egg in the haemocoel of the intermediate host, a <b>camel</b> <b>cricket,</b> is ingested via mouse based predation of the intermediate host. To complete this life cycle characteristic of nematodes in the rictulariidae family, Pterygodermatites peromysci larvae migrates into the gastrointestinal tract, molting into a 4th stage juvenile and then into an adult. The life cycle is continued when the mouse sheds its embryonated eggs into the environment (Figure 1, source 4). What is notable about this life-cycle is that the eggs are embryonated, rather than non-embryonated, when they are passed into the environment. Since the intermediate host is most abundant during the months of August - September, the prevalence of infection in these mice is greatest during {{the end of the}} summer months. Furthermore, the eggs are able to survive the winter, hatch in the spring, and then continue the infection cycle with the <b>camel</b> <b>crickets</b> (4). However though Pterygodermatites peromysci has been more commonly observed in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), it has also been reported identified using flying squirrels as its definitive host such as the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) and the southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) which illustrates that there is more than one possible definitive host for this Pterygodermatites peromysci (5).|$|R

40|$|This thesis makes {{progress}} in two broad fields of research, descriptive ornithology and invasion ecology, {{based largely on}} fieldwork in the Falkland Islands. Populations of two little-studied South American waders, the Two-banded Plover Charadrius falklandicus and the Rufous-chested Dotterel Charadrius modestus, were monitored over a four-year period at a single island site: in chapters two, three and four this thesis presents information on the diel pattern ofincubation sharing by males and females of both species (the two species showed opposite diel sex-roles), data on morphology including sexual dimorphism (male-biased in both species), breeding systems data including estimates of mate fidelity, and for Two-banded Plovers, demographic estimates including annual survival rates of adults and hatching success of nests. These are among the first detailed studies of the breeding behaviour and life-histories of anysouthern South American waders. Concurrent with the single-site wader study, an inter-islandnatural experimental approach was used to investigate the effects of non-native mammalian predators, firstly on the expression of anti-predator behaviour in the Two-banded Plover (chapter five) and secondly on the relative abundance of populations of an endemic insect, the Falkland <b>Camel</b> <b>Cricket</b> Parudenus falklandicus (chapter six). The latter chapters both infer strong effects of non-native mammalian predators: firstly, Two-banded Plovers expressed much larger flushing distances {{in response to an}} approaching (human) stimulus at sites where feral cats Felis catus were present, although flushing distances were shorter when background exposure to humans was relatively high (I interpret these effects as generalisation and habituation respectively). Secondly, the relative abundance of <b>Camel</b> <b>Crickets</b> in a given habitat type was substantially higher in the absence of Norway Rats Rattus norvegicus, regardless of whether the rats were naturally absent orhad been deliberately eradicated. Following the apparently strong effect of rats on insects in the Falkland Islands, in chapter seven I use literature from other island groups to review the effects of invasive rodents on island invertebrate populations; I conclude that negative effects are widespread and non-randomly distributed among invertebrate species, with large invertebrates particularly susceptible to rodent impacts. Finally, in chapter eight, potentially productive areas for future research and synthesis are suggested...|$|R

40|$|Sika deer (Cervus nippon) have {{experienced}} a rapid increase in the Japanese archipelago. Although the effects of deer grazing have been widely studied, the indirect effects have received little attention. Using an eight-year-old deer exclosure in western Tokyo (Japan), we studied the direct effects on plants and the indirect effects on insects and microenvironments. Plant biomass was 14 times higher inside the exclosure than outside. Shrubs (e. g., Aralia elata and Hydrangea paniculata) and trees (e. g., Symplocos sawafutagi and Clethra barbinervis) were more abundant inside, whereas only unpalatable trees in poor condition grew outside (e. g., Pterostyrax hispida and Cynanchum caudatum). In the summer months, the maximum temperature was 8 – 10 °C higher outside the exclosure and humidity was lower. Soil movement was 80 times more pronounced outside than inside.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 59) In {{the animal}} kingdom, males of many species possess striking weaponry used in intrasexual competition {{for access to}} females. Until recently, there were no known cases of male weaponry being used against females in sexual coercion. However, in the <b>camel</b> <b>cricket</b> Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus, males use modified hind legs (modifications consist of femoral spines and bent tibiae) not only to fight with each other, but also to trap females and force them to copulate. As male hind leg armaments are positively allometric, the largest males would be best equipped to force-copulate, although they should be the most attractive to females. In order to resolve this potential paradox and determine which males {{are most likely to}} force-copulate, I manipulated male body size with diet and performed mating trials. The use of forced copulation was conditional on male body size, with smaller males being more likely to attempt coercive mating. The finding is in accord with the literature on male predictors of forced copulation and suggests an evolutionary exaptation of hind leg armaments in this species, wherein an intrasexual fighting weapon took on a secondary function of sexual coercion. In addition to this study, I performed a comparative survey of armaments, examining fighting and mating behavior in four morphologically similar congeners (P. ???Huachuca summer,???
