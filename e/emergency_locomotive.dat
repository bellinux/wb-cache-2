500|$|Testimony to {{the inquiry}} {{established}} {{the damage to}} the troop train and those on it. The wooden cars with steel underframes gave little resistance to the impact, unlike the Continentals steel cars. A CNR official testified that it would cost $127million to replace all such cars with modern steel ones. Dr. Kimmett testified, stating that though he had six bottles of penicillin when he began his work, no syringe could be found to administer it. When a syringe was later found, five of the bottles could no longer be found. No heating was available on the troop train until the arrival of the <b>emergency</b> <b>locomotive</b> from Red Pass Junction, and no blood plasma had been brought on the hospital trainâ€”none was available until the injured reached Jasper. Dr. Kimmett testified that it was [...] "very difficult" [...] to administer plasma on the train, and that two men died between Jasper and Edson.|$|E
50|$|The Central China Railway {{suffered}} from a severe motive power shortage from its establishment in 1939. After receiving regauged JNR locomotives second-hand as an <b>emergency</b> measure, new <b>locomotives</b> were delivered in the early 1940s. Amongst these were ten Pashishi class locomotives built for the Central China Railway by Kawasaki in 1942 and 1943.|$|R
5000|$|The first German {{attempts}} to use control cars (German: Steuerwagen) and remote control-equipped steam locomotives were before World War II by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB). The driver's control instructions were transmitted {{from the control}} car to the locomotive by a Chadburn-type machine telegraph (similar to engine order telegraphs on ships). The order had to be immediately acknowledged and implemented by the automatic firebox controllers. This indirect control was judged as impractical and unsafe, because, although the driver controlled the brake directly, the danger existed that in an <b>emergency</b> the <b>locomotive</b> would continue supplying [...] "push" [...] power {{for some time and}} possibly derail the train.|$|R
50|$|The railway also {{operates}} three {{diesel locomotives}} {{which are used}} on days of total fire ban, plant or works trains, or when insufficient steam locomotives are available, including in <b>emergencies.</b> The diesel <b>locomotives</b> originally operated on railways in Tasmania (D21, formerly V12) and Queensland (DH5, formerly DH5 and later CC02, and DH31, formerly DH59), and were regauged and rebuilt for use on the Puffing Billy Railway.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately afterwards, No. 5, {{moving on}} track No. 1, was {{approaching}} {{the point where}} the accident occurred at a speed of 76 miles per hour. The train was moving on a curve to the right and was passing Extra 1736 West moving on track No. 3. The engineer then observed that the track immediately in front of his locomotive had been shifted northward toward track No. 3. Before he could move the brake valve to <b>emergency</b> position the <b>locomotive</b> was derailed and collided with Extra 1736 West. At about the same time the locomotive of No. 12 passed the locomotive of No. 5.|$|R
2500|$|... 4449 was {{the last}} engine {{manufactured}} in Southern Pacific's first order of GS-4 (Golden State/General Service) locomotives. 4449 was placed into service on May 30, 1941, and spent its early career assigned to the Coast Daylight, SP's premier passenger train between San Francisco and Los Angeles, California, but it also pulled many other of the SP's named passenger trains. After the arrival of newer GS-4s and GS-5s, 4449 was assigned to Golden State Route and Sunset Route passenger trains. 4449 was reassigned to the Coast Division in the early 1950s. One of 4449's career highlights happened on October 17, 1954, when 4449 and sister 4447 pulled a special 10-car train for the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society from Los Angeles to Owenyo, California, and return. In 1955, after {{being one of the}} last few Daylight steam engines in Daylight livery, 4449 was painted black and silver and its side skirting (a streamlining feature of the Daylight steam engines) was removed due to dieselization of the Coast Daylight in January of that year. 4449 was then assigned to Southern Pacific's San Joaquin Valley line, occasionally pulling passenger trains such as the San Joaquin Daylight between Oakland and Bakersfield as well as fast freight and helper service. 4449 was semi-retired from service on September 24, 1956, and was kept as an <b>emergency</b> back-up <b>locomotive</b> until it was officially retired on October 2, 1957, and was placed in storage along with several other GS-class engines near Southern Pacific's Bakersfield roundhouse.|$|R
