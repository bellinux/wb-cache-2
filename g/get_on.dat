5|$|A teleporting mutant. This was will.i.am's major live-action film debut. Although he {{initially}} did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with the casting director, {{he got the}} role {{because he wanted to}} play a mutant with the same power as Nightcrawler. He enrolled in boot camp to get into shape for the part. When filming a fight, he scarred his knuckles after accidentally punching and breaking the camera.|$|E

5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> a train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E
5|$|Another injury problem; {{this time}} an ankle {{ligament}} injury sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just twogoals in 17games in the 1997–98 season. His injury {{was reflected in}} the club's form, and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League. However, United (now managed by Shearer's old boss at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish) had a good run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final. The team were unable to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2–0 to Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the game, the Hokies struggled on offense and were held scoreless until well into the second quarter. Kansas, however, was able to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the board several times, jumping to a 17–0 lead before Virginia Tech scored its first points. Kansas's broke the game open in the first quarter after All-American cornerback Aqib Talib intercepted a pass by backup Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor and returned the ball 60yards for the game's opening points.|$|E
5|$|It wasn't like Janet , {{where we}} all grew up together.

5|$|Lines 4, 5 and 6 of the Oslo Metro {{operate to}} Nydalen, {{each with a}} 15-minute headway. Lines 4 and 5 operate {{counterclockwise}} through the ring via {{the western part of}} town into the Common Tunnel, while line 6 operates clockwise via the eastern part into the Common Tunnel. Line 5 continues eastwards only to Storo before stopping; lines 4 and 6 swap numbers between Nydalen and Storo. Travel time from Nydalen to Stortinget is 13 minutes clockwise and 12 minutes counterclockwise. Therefore, any traveler heading for the city center can <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the first train, independent of its direction (except line 5 to Storo), and can be certain it will be the quickest connection to the downtown area.|$|E

5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial.

Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Pořádek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped {{the fact that he was}} not wanted on stage.|$|E
5|$|Mindful of the {{enormous}} success of the Philharmonia Chorus, founded in 1957 by Legge to work with his Philharmonia Orchestra, the LSO decided to establish its own chorus. The LSO Chorus (later called the London Symphony Chorus) was formed in 1966 under John Alldis as chorus master. Its early years were difficult; Kertész did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with Alldis, and there were difficulties within the chorus. Most of its members were amateurs, but at first, they were reinforced by {{a small number of}} professionals. This led to disputes over the balance between amateurs and professionals. There was a brief crisis, after which the professional element was removed, and the LSO chorus became, and remains, an outstanding amateur chorus.|$|E

Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his girth was too large for the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, he shouldn't {{have been allowed to}} ride.

5|$|The 1981 Peach Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 2, 1981 at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Hurricanes scored a touchdown {{on the first}} drive {{of the game and}} tacked on another touchdown early in the second quarter. Tech was held scoreless in the early going, thanks to twoMiami interceptions at the goal line as Virginia Tech was threatening to score. Late in the second quarter, Tech was finally able to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the scoreboard with a field goal, but at halftime, the Miami Hurricanes led 14–3.|$|E
