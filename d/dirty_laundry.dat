50|$|Laundering by dry hand {{involves}} soaking, beating, scrubbing, and rinsing dirty textiles. Before indoor plumbing, the housewife {{also had}} to carry all the water used for washing, boiling, and rinsing the laundry; according to an 1886 calculation, women fetched water eight to ten times every day from a pump, well, or spring. Water for the laundry would be hand carried, heated on a fire for washing, then poured into the tub. That made the warm soapy water precious; it would be reused, first to wash the least soiled clothing, then to wash progressively <b>dirtier</b> <b>laundry.</b>|$|R
50|$|After Lori's funeral, {{some of the}} Ruffs {{drove to}} Leonard {{to see if they}} could find out more about her in her house.

They then discovered the lock box in a closet, pried it open with a screwdriver, and discovered the documentation of Ruff's past. Also found in the lock box was a paper with several seemingly random scribblings.|$|R

25|$|In July 2011, Lacoste, {{along with}} other major fashion and {{sportswear}} brands including Nike, Adidas and Abercrombie & Fitch, {{was the subject of}} <b>Dirty</b> <b>Laundry,</b> a report by the environmental group Greenpeace. According to the findings of the report, Lacoste was accused of working with suppliers in China which contribute to the pollution of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Samples taken from one facility belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and another belonging to the Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, perfluorinated compounds and perfluorooctane sulfonate.|$|E
25|$|Task Review: Renaissance's {{execution}} of the task was virtually flawless thanks to Raef and Simon; the team targeted large companies and got several orders by going door-to-door, making big earnings in both areas, while finishing their washing and pressing on time before the laundry closed and not losing any articles of clothing in the process. Meanwhile, Alpha's performance was dogged by problems; while they managed to secure work from businesses with <b>dirty</b> <b>laundry,</b> they had little luck going door-to-door. The team also started their work late, meaning they did not finish {{by the end of}} the first day, and lost two items in the process for which they were fined. As a direct result, the team effectively lost the task.|$|E
25|$|Following the film's success, the group, sans Hardin, {{moved to}} Los Angeles. Upon arrival, they met {{a lawyer for}} the William Morris Agency who {{connected}} them with producer Scott Rudin. As a result, the duo acquired a lawyer, an agent, and a script deal. Despite initially believing themselves {{to be on the verge}} of success, the duo struggled for several years. Stone slept on <b>dirty</b> <b>laundry</b> for upwards of a year because he could not afford to purchase a mattress. They unsuccessfully pitched a children's program titled Time Warped to Fox Kids, which would have involved fictionalized stories of people in history. The trio created two separate pilots, spaced a year apart, and despite the approval of development executive Pam Brady, the network disbanded the Fox Kids division.|$|E
50|$|Trapped in a {{world she}} cannot {{comprehend}} and unable to please her husband, Chand is desperate. Hope {{comes in the form}} of Rosa (Yanna McIntosh), a tough and savvy Jamaican woman who works alongside Chand in a factory where immigrant women from all over the world clean and press <b>dirty</b> hotel <b>laundry.</b> Rosa sees past the make-up that covers Chand’s bruised face. Realizing Chand has nowhere to turn, Rosa gives her a magical root advising her “to put it in whatever the bastard drinks.” The root is supposed to seduce the one who takes it, making them fall hopelessly in love with the person who gives it to them. Chand’s attempts with the magic root lead to surreal incidents and her life gradually begins to mirror an Indian fable involving a King Cobra. As the lines between fantasy and reality converge, Chand and Rocky come face to face with each other and themselves. Eventually, Chand comprehends all the surreal episodes in her life and upon separation from her husband decides to go back to India.|$|R
5000|$|In {{her home}} port, the lower {{steamship}} port of Turku, the coal trimmer soon became {{the subject of}} many letters to the editor and received complaints from the residents of apartment houses {{on the banks of the}} Aura River, who claimed that the soot from her chimneys made their <b>laundry</b> <b>dirty.</b> As a result, the coal stores were replaced by oil containers in 1976, and the boiler hatches were replaced with oil-driven blowers. The rest of the engine has been preserved unaltered, in its original shape. In fact there are five steam engines altogether: the main engine, winch engine, rudder engine and two water pumps. People interested in steam engines come from all over the world to admire this [...] "museum piece", which still is in excellent condition and in active use, and probably will remain so for decades.|$|R

500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own <b>dirty</b> <b>laundry,</b> please'".|$|E

2500|$|A {{rough cut}} of the movie was {{screened}} for the Beatles on 20 July 1969. Lindsay-Hogg recalled that the rough cut was about an hour longer than the released version: [...] "There was much more stuff of John and Yoko, {{and the other three}} didn't really think that was appropriate because they wanted to make it a 'nicer' movie. They didn't want {{to have a lot of}} the <b>dirty</b> <b>laundry,</b> so a lot of it was cut down."
