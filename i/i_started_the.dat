25|$|I got my {{stopwatch}} {{going again}} {{to check the}} length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints {{of no more than}} 300 yards. Altig was at the front when <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> check — and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport — something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front — and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.|$|E
500|$|Many {{viewers and}} fans of EastEnders {{expected}} Poppy's return {{to be only}} temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor Lorraine Newman decided that Bright will remain with EastEnders {{for the foreseeable future}} as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is [...] "less than enthusiastic" [...] to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a Halloween ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, [...] "The backroom staff {{had a lot of fun}} planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is [...] "plenty more on the table" [...] for Poppy adding, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her [...] "successful sibling". Bright said of their relationship, [...] "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. But I think she can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when I came back and they told me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E

2500|$|Still {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the album, the singer acknowledged that she had to follow a more honest approach on her next project: [...] " [...] just made me realize that people want authentic Monica," [...] she stated. [...] "They don't want me to keep up with all the different gimmicks and trends that are taking place." [...] In late 2007, Monica started work on her follow-up album. Intending to create a record that lived up to the sound her previous hits, particularly those from the 1990s, she expressed that she wanted to appeal to her existing fans although her label was concerned with making the project sound up to date: [...] "I am going back to where <b>I</b> <b>started.</b> <b>The</b> next album I would like people to get more songs like [...] "Why I Love You So Much," [...] "Angel of Mine," [...] or the things they really, really love from me [...]" [...] Originally titled Lessons Learned—a reference to the mistakes Monica felt she made with The Makings of Me – the singer decided to change the project after recording the album's title track in 2008 as she felt that Still Standing was more appropriate for the body of work that she and Bryan-Michael Cox pulled off.|$|E
