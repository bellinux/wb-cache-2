It was, however, not until January 26, 1870, that Virginia was readmitted; Johnston {{was able to}} take his seat shortly afterward. The delay was due to a Congressional need to pass an act that would allow Virginia {{representation}} in the body.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2010, Hughes {{was named}} the Yankees' fifth starter. Throughout the season, the Yankees {{occasionally}} had Hughes skip starts to limit his innings, <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> this would help him stay healthy. On April 21, Hughes carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the Athletics before allowing a leadoff single to Eric Chavez; he faced two more hitters prior to being relieved, having struck out 10 batters.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment of the O Street Market {{was delayed}} {{for two years}} as the {{developers}} sought {{to meet the demands}} imposed by the Historic Preservation Review Board.

5|$|In {{addition}} to Hanna-Barbera's Speed Buggy (1973) and Wonder Wheels (1977–78), the three series were commonly grouped together {{due to the}} similarities in plot and characters. Reception-wise, several critics reacted negatively to the violence and portrayal of motorcycles in the series, prompting viewers to write letters to NBC <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> the show would be pulled off the air. Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch had a total of 13 episodes, each consisting of 3 segments, or a total of 39 segments. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a three disc set.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{first season}} was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. Due to its success, the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons {{timeslots}} <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> it {{would result in}} higher ratings for the lead out shows. It would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time. Many of the producers were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top 10 while airing on Sunday and they felt the move would destroy its ratings.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1995, Rosecroft {{was forced}} to cut costs. Its owners lowered the amount of purse money, {{eliminated}} stake races, and {{reduced the number of}} racing days. They decided to sell both Rosecroft and Ocean Downs to Cloverleaf Enterprises, a horseman's organization, in mid-1995 for $11 million. Weisman's Colt Enterprises reported that if the racetrack could not be sold, the company would have to file for bankruptcy. Cloverleaf accepted a $10.6 million loan from Bally Entertainment <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> a casino would be allowed at Rosecroft.|$|E

5|$|When Luna {{saw that}} the American advance had halted, mainly to {{stabilize}} their lines, he again mobilized his troops to attack La Loma on February 10. Fierce fighting ensued but the Filipinos were forced to withdraw thereafter. Caloocan was left with American forces {{in control of the}} southern terminus of the Manila to Dagupan railway, along with five engines, fifty passenger coaches, and a hundred freight cars. After consolidating control of Caloocan, the obvious next objective for American forces would be the Republic capital at Malolos. However, General Otis delayed for almost a month <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> Filipino forces would be deployed in its defense.|$|E
5|$|With {{its first}} season, The Simpsons became the Fox network's first series to {{rank among the}} top thirty highest rated shows of a {{television}} season. Due to this success, Fox decided to switch The Simpsons timeslot <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> it would result in higher ratings for the shows that would air after it. The series moved from 8:00p.m. on Sunday nights to the same time on Thursdays, where it competed with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of the Human Genome Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA from nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Ohio {{expressed}} interest in adopting a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> it might someday become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist the Stars and Stripes in its place. Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January, Pole {{had dropped}} to twenty-one votes, but the French faction {{remained}} split between Carafa, de Bourbon, Lorraine, and Salviati; Este's candidacy, though desired {{by many in the}} French College, had not yet been put forward, perhaps having been held back <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> he would be more acceptable as the conclave dragged on. Toward the end of January, in accordance with traditional efforts to counter dillatory cardinals, the amenities and rations of the conclave were decreased and the upper story windows were closed to reduce the natural lighting and fresh air. Soon afterwards, Ridolfithe French candidate most acceptable to Farnesedied amid accusations of poisoning on January 31.|$|E
5|$|Even as the XF-108 {{program was}} {{progressing}} well, {{there were signs}} that would ultimately lead to its eventual cancellation. Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats, the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as rising costs, contributed to the termination of the XF-108. The cancellation was announced on 23September 1959. North American continued refining the design through 1960 <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> the program might be revived. Despite the extra money and time spent on the Rapier, it was not wholly in vain; the North American A-5 Vigilante supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy, which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft, retained the fuselage/weapon package and systems design of the Rapier. In many ways the Vigilante {{could be seen as}} the successful application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design.|$|E

5|$|Garfield {{had been}} a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nation’s premier summer {{vacation}} spots until World War I. In early September, {{it was decided to}} bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> the beach air would help him recover. When they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly {{to the door of the}} oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.|$|E
5|$|However, the Sogdians epitomized the {{religious}} plurality found along the trade routes. The largest body of Sogdian texts are Buddhist, and Sogdians {{were among the}} principal translators of Buddhist sutras into Chinese. However, Buddhism did not take root in Sogdiana itself. Additionally, the Bulayiq monastery {{to the north of}} Turpan contained Sogdian Christian texts and there are numerous Manichaean texts in Sogdiana from nearby Qocho. The reconversion of Sogdians from Buddhism to Zoroastrianism coincided with the adoption of Zoroastrianism by the Sassanid Empire of Persia. From the 4th century onwards, Sogdian Buddhist pilgrims left behind evidence of their travels along the steep cliffs of the Indus River and Hunza Valley. It was here that they carved images of the Buddha and holy stupas in addition to their full names, <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> the Buddha would grant them his protection.|$|E
5|$|Intimidation is an {{important}} element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.|$|E

5|$|Liliʻuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions {{as a way to}} express her feelings for her people, her country, and {{what was happening in the}} political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she would never leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> the history and culture of her people would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett {{dismissed}} {{seven of}} the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> the judge would reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid {{because there was no}} change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.|$|E
5|$|The other {{executives}} decide to produce Norville's invention <b>in</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> it will flop and depress the company's stock. The invention {{turns out to}} be the hula hoop, which initially fails but then turns into an enormous success. Norville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon. Amy, who had fallen for his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the flexi-straw. Norville dismisses it and fires Buzz. Meanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital.|$|E
