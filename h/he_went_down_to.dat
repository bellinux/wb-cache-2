5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the {{prospect}} of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust's works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, {{his poor}} grass-court form {{from the past}} continued, as <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> unseeded Lleyton Hewitt in the second round. In the Davis Cup quarter-final against the Czech Republic, del Potro won his matches against Ivo Minář and Berdych in {{straight}} sets, but Argentina still lost the tie 2–3, eliminating them from the competition. A few weeks later, he defeated Hewitt and Fernando González {{en route to the}} Washington final. He successfully defended his title against top-seeded Wimbledon finalist Andy Roddick to win his second tournament of the year and become the first player since Andre Agassi to win back-to-back Washington titles. Del Potro played the following week at the Masters 1000 in Montreal, where he was seeded sixth, defeating world No. 2 Nadal in the quarterfinals, his second win in a row over Nadal. He then defeated Roddick in the semifinals, saving a match point, to advance to his first Masters 1000 final, and to improve his head-to-head record against Roddick to 3–0. In the final, he lost against Murray in three sets. He later withdrew from the next Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati due to fatigue.|$|E

25|$|Emperor loyalist Nitta Yoshisada in 1333 invaded Kamakura, deposing its Regent Hōjō Takatoki {{and ending}} the 145-year old Kamakura shogunate. According to the legend, {{being unable to}} defeat Kamakura {{defenses}} on land, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Shichirigahama and, at the impassable cape of Inamuragasaki, prayed to the god Ryūjin to withdraw the waves and let him through.|$|E
25|$|Monday came, all was well. Tuesday came, he not sick. Wednesday came, {{and still}} he was well; with which his impertinent wife did much twit {{him in his}} teeth.

Being {{in the middle of}} the Thames, he presently fell down, only saying, 'An impost, an impost,' and so died. A most sad storm of wind immediately following.|$|E
25|$|During the descent, Captain Cronin ordered Flight Engineer Thomas to {{tell the}} flight attendants to prepare for an {{emergency}} landing, but Thomas was unable to contact them through the intercom. He asked the captain for permission {{to go down to}} find out what was happening, and Cronin agreed. Thomas saw severe damage immediately upon leaving the cockpit; the aircraft's skin was peeled off in some areas on the upper deck, revealing the frames and stringers. As <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the lower deck, the magnitude of the damage became apparent as he saw the large hole in the side of the cabin. Thomas returned to the cockpit and reported that a large section of fuselage was open aft of the Number 1 exit door. He concluded that it was probably a bomb and that, considering the damage, it would be unwise to exceed the airplane's stall speed by more than a small margin.|$|E

500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ohno lost over 9kilograms (20 pounds) of weight from when he appeared at the 2002 Winter Games. [...] <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a 65.7kg (145lb) bodyframe and a 2.5% Body fat percentage enduring a 5-month 3-a-day training program combined with a strict nutritional program. [...] As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. [...] With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: [...] "Come these Games, there's no one who's going to be fitter than me. There's just no way. Whether I can put it together on the ice or not and feel good, that's a different story. But I know, from a physical training standpoint, nobody's even close... I've never prepared like this in my life — for anything. [...] I want to leave nothing on the table." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{accordance}} with the Jewish law his parents presented the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem, where the righteous Simeon and Anna the Prophetess gave thanks to God who had sent his salvation. Joseph and Mary then returned to Nazareth. There [...] "the child grew and became strong, and was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him." [...] Each year his parents went to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover, and when Jesus {{was twelve years old}} they found him in the Temple listening to the teachers and asking questions so that all who heard him were amazed. His mother rebuked him for causing them anxiety, because they had not known where he was, but he answered that he was in his Father's house.

2500|$|Captain Caral Stromgren, Sechelts [...] "regular" [...] captain {{stated that}} he had been ill, so Captain James had {{relieved}} him. (Jarvis testified later that he and James had fired Stromgren, apparently related to his unawareness that he had lost a propeller blade and the possibility it posed for damage to the ship.) In any case, Stromgren had wanted to talk with Captain James on 24 March, so <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Grand Trunk Pacific dock, where he found that Sechelt had been shifted over to Canadian Pacific Railway dock. It was blowing hard and raining, so he did not think Sechelt would go out, so he decided to speak with Captain James later. He did not learn until the next day that Sechelt had gone out and been lost. Had he been in command he would never had taken her out. With some exceptions, he considered Sechelt to have been in good condition.|$|E

2500|$|The job of Air Group Commander (CAG) {{brought a}} new challenge. The job was offered at 2200, {{the night before the}} {{invasion}} of Iwo Jima, where Hornet was to play a pivotal role in close air support. The first takeoff was at 0430, to allow the aircraft to be over the beach 30 minutes prior to sunrise. Although an experienced pilot with flight time in an extremely wide variety of aircraft, Arnold had never flown a Hellcat. After planning the attack, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the flight deck and boarded the CAG aircraft with its 99 on the nose. [...] With a flashlight under a blanket, he familiarized himself with the aircraft, then went to his room for a brief rest. The self-checkout must have worked. He made his first Hellcat takeoff at night, into combat. On that very first flight he got the only two kills he was to get in the Hellcat.|$|E
2500|$|The Portuguese {{were able}} {{to fend off the}} smaller crafts with hand grenades, but they made little effect on the {{floating}} tower, which grappled the poop deck. Up to this point the Portuguese casualties had been few, with only four or five Portuguese along with a few Africans and lascars killed, while the Japanese dead were estimated at several hundred. However, six hours into the fighting, a shot from the tower-junk hit a fire pot that a Portuguese soldier was about to throw, smashing it onto the gunpowder at his feet. This started a conflagration that spread through the deck and set the mizzen sail ablaze. Pessoa and his men retreated to the forecastle, where they realized {{that they did not have}} enough men to simultaneously fight the fire and the Japanese boarders. At this point Pessoa ordered the ship's magazine to be set on fire since he would rather die than surrender. When the ship's purser hesitated, Pessoa cast away his sword and shield and picked up a crucifix, then he exclaimed: [...] "Blessed be thou, oh Lord, since thou willest that all this should end!" [...] He then told his crew to save themselves as <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> start the fire himself. The Nossa Senhora da Graça then blew up in two successive explosions, split into two, and sank with cargo, crew, and boarders alike. The Japanese killed all they could see swimming in the water, but a few survivors made it onto the shore to safety. André Pessoa's body, however, was never found.|$|E
2500|$|The second tale, {{related by}} the travel writer Will R. Bird, occurs {{at a time}} when men from the north shore of the Minas Basin used to cross the water to buy horses from farmers in the Annapolis Valley. During his summer travels in the late 1950s, Bird {{encountered}} an oldtimer on a farm near the Parrsboro golf course across the harbour from Partridge Island. [...] "You ever hear of our sea horse?" [...] the oldtimer asked. [...] "There ain't nothing to match it in Nova Scotia." [...] The story begins when Tom Smith crosses over to buy a mare from a man in Canning. The mare then had a black foal that [...] "was one of the finest ever seen on this shore." [...] After about seven years, the farmer from Canning showed up at Smith's farm and, obviously regretting that he had sold the mare, he offered Smith [...] "more'n twice the going price" [...] for his fast, black horse. [...] "Tom was a man who watched the dollars and he just couldn't resist," [...] the oldtimer said. The farmer from Canning took the boat back while Smith drove the horse around the Basin to deliver it. [...] "He was no more'n back home," [...] the old man said, [...] "when he happened to look toward the pasture and there was the black horse. Tom couldn't believe his eyes." [...] When <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the beach, he saw hoof marks showing where the animal had come ashore. Apparently, the horse had known to wait for low tide before attempting the crossing, but, it [...] "made a mighty long swim just the same." [...] The story ends with Smith returning to Canning to give the money back. [...] "He told the man he couldn't sell a horse that wanted to be with him that much, and the stranger agreed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted.

I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet ....

Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E
