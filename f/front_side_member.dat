40|$|Changes in {{geometry}} after springback are a {{major problem}} for the automotive industry. In order to make adjustments of the part to be formed, extra processes are needed. Since their implementation is both time-consuming and expensive, the industry would stand to gain if geometrical changes could be predicted {{at the time that the}} tool is being designed. Today, sheet-metal-forming simulations are, to a large extent, used to evaluate the forming process. Reliable results of the forming process can be obtained regarding, for instance, thinning, forces and fractures, but prediction of springback is not accurate enough to be fully reliable. Furthermore, the introduction of new, high strength steels, such as TRIP steels, emphasize the springback problem even more. This demands an increased ability to accurately predict the outcome of the forming process.

50|$|The 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander (second generation) is {{also built}} around Mitsubishi’s {{next-generation}} RISE unibody design (GS platform). The RISE body features collision energy absorbing joints {{designed to reduce}} {{the force of the}} impact that is transferred to the passenger cell. These are constructed with improved thickness and strength engineered into the vehicle frame’s structure. Inner sides of the pillars and roof have impact absorbing rib structures to mitigate head injuries in a collision. A cross frame under the front seat squab restricts forward movement of the occupantin in a frontal impact. It uses more high-tensile steel sheeting to increase stiffness and employs octagonal-section straight <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>members</b> and a reinforced cabin environment. An aluminum roof panel lowers the center of gravity and reduces roll inertia. Compared to the previous Outlander, torsional rigidity has been increased by 18 percent, and bending rigidity is up by 39 percent. The Outlander received a four star rating from the EuroNCAP test.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Springback is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in sheet metal forming since the elastic recovery of the internal stresses is induced after removal of the tooling. The numerical analysis of springback is a complicated time-consuming job and its result is greatly effected by a type of the yield function, finite elements used and the constraint condition for eliminating a rigid body motion. In this paper, optimization of the draw-bead force is carried out utilizing the response surface method {{in order to reduce}} springback and improve shape accuracy of a deep drawn product. In the optimization process, the tendency of springback is evaluated qualitatively without springback simulation usually done with the implicit solving scheme. Instead of springback simulation, the amount of stress deviation along the thickness direction in the deep drawn product is used as an indicator of springback. The stamping process is analyzed for a <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>member</b> formed with advanced high strength steel (AHSS) sheets such as DP 60. The analysis procedure fully covers the binder-wrap, stamping, trimming and springback processes with the commercial elasto-plastic finite element code LS-DYNA 3 D. The effect of the restraining force of draw-beads is confirmed with the decreased stress deviation. The analysis result shown in the final springback simulation demonstrates that the present analysis provides a guideline for controlling the evolution of springback based on the finite element simulation of complicated auto-bod...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{shortened}} lead-times in {{the automotive}} industry have dramatically increased {{the need for more}} efficient development methods at every stage of the process development chain. In order to decrease the long lead-time for producing a forming tool, sheet-metal-forming simulation was introduced. Even though sheet-metal-forming simulation is widely used in {{the automotive industry}} today, there are still challenges to be overcome. Two important examples are the prediction of springback and surface defects. If reliable predictions of these phenomena could be achieved, much money could be saved in reduced lead-times and adjustment costs. These areas, together with drawbeads, were also highlighted as areas of significant interest when the use of FE simulation was compared to the use of try-out tools. In this evaluation the Production Performance Matrix (PSM) and the Process Correspondence Matrix (PCM) were used. In order to use the achieved information efficiently, a method for efficient information exchange for the FE simulation results was proposed. The main goal with this project was to find a method for analysis of macro-geometric defects (such as surface defects and springback). Analysis of surface defects involves difficulties in both experimental and numerical assessment. Since the defects are very small and also depend on both position and shape in the classification procedure, it is difficult to find an evaluation system which can detect both small variance {{in the shape of the}} surface and classify the defects. Furthermore, the numerical results depend both on the accuracy in the prediction of the forming behavior and the springback. In order to compare the results of the same classification procedure, a method has been developed whereby the surface can be analysed both numerically and experimentally in the same evaluation software. In this way, the classification will be the same and the results will be directly comparable. Regarding springback, a study of the parameters resulted in the conclusion that the important factors to consider in FE simulations of springback are, among others, to have small elements, low tool speed and good material models. The results were applied to an automotive part, a <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>member.</b> The simulations exaggerated the twist but the error was moderate for mild steel and Rephos steel. However, a TRIP steel was also examined and there the deviation was much larger. In the forming process the flow of material is controlled among other things by drawbeads. The material flow is very important in order to have a correct stress distribution in the formed part, which in turn affects both springback and surface defects. In this work a method for optimising the restraining force (which represents drawbeads in FE simulations) with a small number of iterations has been developed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{fundamental}} challenge of balancing the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> transparent conductive oxide (TCO) in silicon heterojunction solar cells. We present two-dimensional numerical device simulations as well as experimental investigations concerning n-type silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells featuring either a front emitter or rear emitter. By varying both, the pitch of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metal grid electrode and the sheet resistance of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO, the fill factor losses associated with the two-dimensional carrier transport are investigated. We prove experimentally {{that in the case}} of the rear emitter design a substantial part of the lateral carrier transport is shifted from the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO into the absorber, thus, lowering the effective sheet resistance of the <b>front</b> <b>side.</b> Owing to this additional lateral current path the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO are less pronounced for a rear emitter cell design compared to the traditional front emitter cell design.
