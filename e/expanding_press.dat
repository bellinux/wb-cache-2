40|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, debates around {{mechanization}} and printmaking raised questions about artistic authority and professional status for the <b>expanding</b> <b>press.</b> In 1877, the art critic John Ruskin accused Whistler of ‘flinging a pot of paint {{in the face of}} the public’ with his Nocturne in Black and Gold, and Whistler sued Ruskin for libel. Less than two decades after the Whistler v. Ruskin case, two further libelous attacks appeared in the press which appeared to have equally serious implications for artists’ careers. In the first, the artist Joseph Pennell penned an attack on the Royal Academician, Herbert Herkomer. In the second, Joseph Pennell was the target of an attack by the artist Walter Sickert. These two disputes centred on printmaking techniques and reproduction. Moreover, the press played a fundamental role in offering a public space for both textual and visual elements of the debate. Journals became the platform for the articulation of contemporary concerns about mechanical reproduction and the status of etching and lithography as fine arts...|$|E
40|$|Itinerant lecturers declaiming upon free trade, Chartism, temperance, or anti-slavery {{could be}} heard in market places and halls across the country during the years 1837 - 60. The power of the spoken word was such that all major {{pressure}} groups employed lecturers and sent them on extensive tours. Print historians tend to overplay the importance of newspapers and tracts in disseminating political ideas and forming public opinion. This thesis demonstrates the importance of older, traditional forms of communication. Inert printed pages were no match for charismatic oratory. Combining personal magnetism, drama and immediacy, the itinerant lecturer was the most effective medium through which to reach those with limited access to books, newspapers or national political culture. Orators crucially united their dispersed audiences in national struggles for reform, fomenting discussion and coalescing political opinion, while railways, the telegraph and <b>expanding</b> <b>press</b> reportage allowed speakers and their arguments to circulate rapidly. Understanding of political oratory and public meetings has been skewed by over-emphasis upon the hustings and high-profile politicians. This has generated two misconceptions: that political meetings were generally rowdy and that a golden age of political oratory was secured only through Gladstone’s legendary stumping tours. However, this thesis argues that, far from being disorderly, public meetings were carefully regulated and controlled offering disenfranchised males a genuine democratic space for political discussion. Its detailed research into Yorkshire and the North East, demonstrates both the growth of popular political speechmaking {{and the emergence of}} a class of professional lecturers. It identifies a paradigm shift from classical oratory to more populist styles of speaking, as more humble speakers took to the platform; and it argues that through the growth of popular political oratory the platform had been rehabilitated by the 1860 s and the lecture format commercialized...|$|E

5000|$|Byrd Stadium, {{constructed}} {{at a cost}} of $1 million, opened September 30, 1950 {{in order}} to replace an older, much smaller Old Byrd Stadium. For four decades, Maryland Stadium consisted of a horseshoe-shaped bowl with capacity of 34,680. In 1991, the five-story Tyser Tower, featuring luxury suites and an <b>expanded</b> <b>press</b> area, was completed {{on the south side of}} the stadium, as well as the Gossett Football Team House adjacent to the east endzone. In 1995, the stadium's capacity was raised to 48,055 through the addition of an upper deck on the north side of the stadium. In November 2001, as the football team once again became an ACC-title contender, temporary bleachers were brought in for an additional 3,000 seats. Those bleachers remain to this day. In 2002, a full-color video scoreboard was added in the east endzone and an expansion of the Gossett Football Team House was begun. The athletic department hoped to parlay the success of the Ralph Friedgen era into a stadium expansion that would have increased capacity to 65,000, but considering that attendance has become sparse over the last several years, under Friedgen and Randy Edsall, those plans have been put on hold or abandoned. Maryland Stadium's attendance record is 58,973, set on November 1, 1975. The record was achieved with temporary seating for a game featuring the #14 Terps and #9 Penn State. Lights were installed in 1985. https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1985/01/19/byrd-stadium-to-get-permanent-lights/4cad7d3e-5a64-496f-bc87-72ebf9f950ac/ ...|$|R
