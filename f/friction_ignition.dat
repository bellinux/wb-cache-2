50|$|Louis V. Aronson gained public {{recognition}} {{when he won}} {{an award}} in 1893 from the Belgian government {{for the creation of}} the first non-toxic match, and young businessman Aronson received 50,000 Francs, equaling $10,000 in U.S. dollars. In 1897 he received a U.S. patent (592,227) for a match design (called the Wind-match) that would light in windy conditions or when wet. He continued working on his match designs including inventing the “Birds Eye” or “Kitchen” match that had a dual-tip design in 1903; this was an important safety improvement because friction matches of the day would sometimes light accidentally especially when stepped on or while in one’s pocket. He realized that placing a small <b>friction</b> <b>ignition</b> chemical on the tip instead of the entire match-head greatly limited accidental ignition. This style of match is still in use today.|$|E
40|$|The basic {{approach}} for analyzing hydrostatic bearing flows at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is briefly discussed. The Hydrostatic Bearing Team has responsibility for assessing and evaluating flow codes; evaluating <b>friction,</b> <b>ignition,</b> and galling effects; evaluating wear; and performing tests. The Office of Aerospace and Exploration Technology Turbomachinery Seals Tasks consist of tests and analysis. The MSFC in-house analyses utilize one-dimensional bulk-flow codes. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis {{is used to}} enhance understanding of bearing flow physics or to perform parametric analysis that are outside the bulk flow database. As long as the bulk flow codes are accurate enough for most needs, they will be utilized accordingly and will be supported by CFD analysis on an as-needed basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{space flight}} {{community}} has been investigating lightweight composite materials for use in propellant tanks for both liquid and gaseous oxygen for space flight vehicles. The use of these materials presents some risks pertaining to ignition and burning hazards {{in the presence of}} oxygen. Through hazard analysis process, some ignition mechanisms have been identified as being potentially credible. One of the ignition mechanisms was reciprocal friction; however, test data do not exist {{that could be used to}} clear or fail these types of materials as "oxygen compatible" for the reciprocal <b>friction</b> <b>ignition</b> mechanism. Therefore, testing was performed at White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) to provide data to evaluate this ignition mechanism. This paper presents the test system, approach, data results, and findings of the reciprocal friction testing performed on composite sample materials being considered for propellant tanks...|$|E
50|$|Ritual Significance Despite his {{importance}} {{in the act of}} creation, Black God (or Haashch’eezhini) appears very seldom in Navajo ritual. The only sacrament involving Him is the Nightway (or Yeibichai), a nine-day midwinter healing ceremony. On the ninth and final day of the ritual, a man arrives in the guise of the Black God. It is not uncommon for Black God to be portrayed by an old man dressed in traditional garb including: fox skin, black body paint, and the Black God mask. The impersonator carries with him a fire-drill (a device that uses <b>friction</b> to incite <b>ignition)</b> and shredded bark (tinder) with which he will demonstrate his pyromancy.|$|R
40|$|Evaluating the {{effectiveness}} of mechanical ignition sources in igniting dust clouds and deposits {{is a major problem}} when assessing the risks in powder handling plants. This paper describes the results obtained in the recent European collaborative project, MECHEX, with explosible dusts. These involved both <b>friction</b> and impact <b>ignition</b> tests with different dusts including coal, maize starch, calcium stearate, suphur and sawdust as well as hotspot tests. using both large hotspots in dust deposits and small laser heated hot particles in dust clouds. The experimental work was carried with the aim of providing guidance for inclusion in European Standards on mechanical equipment for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. Although still inconclusive, the results obtained provide further information for understanding the complex problem of frictional ignition...|$|R
40|$|Friction is a known {{ignition}} source for metals in oxygen-enriched atmospheres. The test system {{developed by the}} NASA White Sands Test Facility in response to ASTM G- 94 has been used successfully to determine the relative ignition from friction of numerous metallic materials and metallic materials pairs. These results have been ranked {{in terms of a}} pressure-velocity product (PV) as measured under the prescribed test conditions. A high value of 4. 1 (exp 8) watts per square meter for Inconel MA 754 is used to imply resistance to <b>friction</b> <b>ignition,</b> whereas a low value of 1. 04 (exp 8) watts per square meter for stainless steel 304 is taken as indicating material susceptible to <b>friction</b> <b>ignition.</b> No attempt has been made to relate PV values to other material properties. This work reports the analysis of the WSTF friction-ignition test system for producing fundamental properties of metallic materials relating to ignition through friction. Three materials, aluminum, titanium, and nickel were tested in the WSTF frictional ignition instrument system under atmospheres of oxygen or nitrogen. Test conditions were modified to reach a steady state of operation, that is applied, the force was reduced and the rotational speed was reduced. Additional temperature measurements were made on the stator sample. The aluminum immediately galled on contact (reproducible) and the test was stopped. Titanium immediately ignited as a result of non-uniform contact of the stator and rotor. This was reproducible. A portion of the stator sampled burned, but the test continued. Temperature measurements on the stator were used to validate the mathematical model used for estimating the interface (stator/rotor) temperature. These interface temperature measurements and the associate thermal flux into the stator were used to distinguish material-phase transitions, chemical reaction, and mechanical work. The mechanical work was used to analyze surface asperities in the materials and to estimate a coefficient of fiction. The coefficient of fiction was analyzed in terms of material properties that is, hardness, Young's modulus and elasticity/plasticity of the material...|$|E
40|$|Metallic {{contaminant}} {{was found}} in the liquid oxygen (LOX) pre-valve screen of the shuttle main engine propulsion system on two orbiter vehicles. To investigate the potential for an ignition, NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility performed (modified) rotating <b>friction</b> <b>ignition</b> testing in LOX. This testing simulated a contaminant particle in the low-pressure oxygen turbo pump (LPOTP) and the high-pressure oxygen turbo pump (HPOTP) of the shuttle main propulsion system. Monel(R) K- 500 and Inconel(R) 718 samples represented the LPOTP and HPOTP materials. Aluminum foil tape and titanium foil represented the contaminant particles. In both the Monel(R) and Inconel(R) material configurations, the aluminum foil tape samples did not ignite after 30 s of rubbing. In contrast, all of the titanium foil samples ignited regardless of the rubbing duration or material configuration. However, the titanium foil ignitions did not propagate to the Monel and Inconel materials...|$|E
40|$|Titanium fire is {{the typical}} catastrophic fault in the aero-engine. Aiming at the urgent demand for {{experimental}} technique of titanium fire from advanced high thrust-weight ratio aero-engine, the combustion technology and theory of titanium alloy based on friction oxygen concentration method (FOC) were systematically studied. The evaluation method of fireproof {{property and the}} <b>friction</b> <b>ignition</b> model were built, and the fireproof mechanism was illustrated. By generalizing recent progress in experimental technique of titanium fire from three levels, including evolutionary rule, mechanism and prevention and control technology, the ideas and directions of experimental technique associated with the application research of titanium fire in the future were proposed, namely overall evaluation of fireproof property close to air flow environment of the aero-engine, prediction model of fireproof property and experimental verification of fireproof technique under the air flow environment of aero-engine. It is necessary to establish the prevention system of titanium fire in aero-engine, which contributes to the realization of "full titanium" in compressor and to the increase of high thrust-weight ratio...|$|E
40|$|Frictional {{ignition}} occurrences in Queensland {{coal mines}} have been increasing {{during the past}} decade due to increased mechanisation of the mining process. A method to determine the energy emitted during a pick on rock strike has been found using the SIMTARS <b>Friction</b> <b>Ignition</b> Rig. A number of site samples have been used to simulate rock strikes as would occur with a continuous miner or longwall shearer contacting roof, floor, or dyke rock. Analysis of the three key indicators – hotspot size, temperature, and duration – allows the calculation of the amount of energy being emitted from the rock face. Due to the time-based nature of the rate of energy (heat) emission, a plot can be drawn from the data and used to rank frictional ignition potential between rock types and mine sites. Once comprehensive testing of a large sample of coal mine rocks has been completed, the mines that are at most risk of a frictional ignition can be advised as to how to best avoid such an occurrence. It has also been found that quartz content is not the primary indicator for frictional ignition potential...|$|E

40|$|The {{multimodal}} <b>friction</b> <b>ignition</b> tester (MFIT) is a testbed for {{experiments on}} the thermal and mechanical effects of friction on material specimens in pressurized, oxygen-rich atmospheres. In simplest terms, a test involves recording sensory data while rubbing two specimens {{against each other}} at a controlled normal force, with either a random stroke or a sinusoidal stroke having controlled amplitude and frequency. The term multimodal in the full name of the apparatus refers to a capability for imposing any combination of widely ranging values of the atmospheric pressure, atmospheric oxygen content, stroke length, stroke frequency, and normal force. The MFIT was designed especially for studying the tendency toward heating and combustion of nonmetallic composite materials and the fretting of metals subjected to dynamic (vibrational) friction forces {{in the presence of}} liquid oxygen or pressurized gaseous oxygen test conditions approximating conditions expected to be encountered in proposed composite material oxygen tanks aboard aircraft and spacecraft in flight. The MFIT includes a stainless-steel pressure vessel capable of retaining the required test atmosphere. Mounted atop the vessel is a pneumatic cylinder containing a piston for exerting the specified normal force between the two specimens. Through a shaft seal, the piston shaft extends downward into the vessel. One of the specimens is mounted on a block, denoted the pressure block, {{at the lower end of}} the piston shaft. This specimen is pressed down against the other specimen, which is mounted in a recess in another block, denoted the slip block, that can be moved horizontally but not vertically. The slip block is driven in reciprocating horizontal motion by an electrodynamic vibration exciter outside the pressure vessel. The armature of the electrodynamic exciter is connected to the slip block via a horizontal shaft that extends into the pressure vessel via a second shaft seal. The reciprocating horizontal motion can be chosen to be random with a flat spectrum over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 1 kHz, or to be sinusoidal at any peak-to-peak amplitude up to 0. 8 in. (. 2 cm) and fixed or varying frequency up to 1 kHz. The temperatures of the specimen and of the vessel are measured by thermocouples. A digital video camera mounted outside the pressure vessel is aimed into the vessel through a sapphire window, with its focus fixed on the interface between the two specimens. A position transducer monitors the displacement of the pneumatic-cylinder shaft. The pressure in the vessel is also monitored. During a test, the output of the video camera, the temperatures, and the pneumatic-shaft displacement are monitored and recorded. The test is continued for a predetermined amount of time (typically, 10 minutes) or until either (1) the output of the position transducer shows a sudden change indicative of degradation of either or both specimens, (2) ignition or another significant reaction is observed, or (3) pressure in the vessel increases beyond a pre-set level that triggers an automatic shutdown...|$|E
