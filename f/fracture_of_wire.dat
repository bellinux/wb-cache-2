40|$|The {{reliability}} of semiconductor devices as {{influenced by the}} {{reliability of}} wire bonds used in the assembly of the devices is investigated. The specific type of failure dealt with involves <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> bonds {{as a result of}} repeated flexure of the wire at the heel of the bond when the devices are operated in an on-off mode. The mechanism of failure is one of induced fracture of the wire. To improve the reliability of a chosen transistor, one-mil diameter wires of aluminum with various alloy additions were studied using an accelerated fatigue testing machine. In addition, the electroprobe was used to study the metallurgy of the wires as to microstructure and kinetics of the growth of insoluble phases. Thermocompression and ultrasonic bonding techniques were also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Inoue Endovascular Graft (IEG) {{consisted}} of cylinder made from thin Dacron sheet suspended by {{a framework of}} extra-flexible wire. We previously reported that IEG {{was able to be}} successfully placed within the canine true aneurysm. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether IEG can be used as a device for treatment of dissecting aneurysm. Aortic dissections (DeBakey type III) were created non-surgically in 10 dogs. The graft was deployed through 15 -F long sheath into the aneurysm to close the entry. The graft size was chosen according to the diameter of the intact descending aorta (distal to entry site) by aortography in the same way as true aneurysm in 5 dogs (group I). In another 5 dogs (group II), the graft size was selected according to the true lumen diameter by IVUS. The entry was completely closed after immediate implantation in all dogs used in this study. All 5 dogs in group I died as long as 11 days (mean, 7 days) after graft deployment. At autopsy, 3 of 5 dogs showed ruptured aneurysmal wall caused by extravasation of graft. Remaining 2 dogs, in which entry was not completely covered by graft, showed complete obstruction of aortic lumen induced by compression of false lumen. However, all grafts in group II were tolerated very well and followed-up at 5 months after graft deployment. At that time, there was no rupture of aneurysmal wall and no migration, leakage or damage (rupture of Dacron cylinder or <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> frame) of graft in all dogs. These grafts remained patent and pressure gradient (PG) was 14 mmHg except one (PG= 60 mmHgl. This was killed and examined by autopsy. The graft was well covered by thin, translucent neointima and effectively recreated the new aortic lumen, completely closing the entry. Conclusion 1) Inoue Endovascular Graft was proved to be effective in treatment of aortic dissection without surgery provided that the graft was chosen according to true lumen diameter. 2) IVUS was feasible and safe to provide accurate measurement of true lumen diameter for selection of correct graft size and guide for implantation site to completely close the entry lumen...|$|E

Thermodynamic analyses of molten aluminum interaction with refractories was also carried out using FactSage at 710 °C to predict the stable phases.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> NiTi SMA <b>wire</b> undergoing thermal cycling, activated through resistive heating, under a constant load referred to as thermo-mechanical cycling (TMC).

But, the important observation in this study is the generation of cracks in the bulk of the material during TMC, preferentially at the core region <b>of</b> the <b>wire.</b> It has been shown that generation of cracks at the core region is due to strain inhomogeneity during TMC as a consequence of variation in the volume fraction of austenite and martensite phases across the wire cross section.

In the laboratory test, the loading and unloading-deflection properties <b>of</b> the <b>wires</b> were determined in a three-point bending test and their surface properties were studied in a scanning electron microscope. This test attempts to simulate a common clinical situation. The NiTi material showed a non-linear force-deflection relationship. The increase in force from 1 mm deflection and onwards was very slow and the force delivered during unloading from large deflections was almost constant. This behaviour was somewhat different for smaller downward deflections <b>of</b> NiTi <b>wires.</b> Plastic deformation was insignificant. The clinical study confirmed the laboratory results obtained, characterizing a wire material much superior to stainless steel and even superior to Nitinol for alignment purposes.

In the cyclic tensile test, PWHT at 623 K (350 °C) improves the cyclic deformation behavior of the weldment by reducing the accumulated residual strain, whereas PWHT at 723 K (450 °C) provides no benefit to the cyclic deformation behavior.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the <b>fracture</b> toughness <b>of</b> a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resin and a bis-acryl composite (BAC) resin reinforced with stainless steel wire, glass, and polyethylene fiber. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Four groups (n= 13) of each of the 2 materials were prepared for the single-edge 3 -point-bending test. Three groups had the different reinforcements, and the group without reinforcement served as control. Using a universal testing machine, peak load to fracture was recorded and fracture toughness (KIC) was calculated in MNm- 1. 5. Median KIC values were compared by means of nonparametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test, α=. 05). RESULTs. For the controls, the fracture toughness for PMMA resin (KIC= 27. 9) was significantly lower (P. 10, for BAC resin and KIC= 25. 8, P>. 10, for PMMA resin).
