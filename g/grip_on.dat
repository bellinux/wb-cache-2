5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate {{political authority}} {{as the leader of}} the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and nominal head of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier. Brezhnev soon would maximize his <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power and would be the dominating authority in the collective leadership.|$|E
5|$|Back country skis: Designed for ski touring {{on natural}} snow conditions. Recommended lengths are between 150 and 195 centimeters for adult skiers, {{depending}} on {{height and weight}} of the user. Back country skis are typically heavier and wider than classic and skate skis; they often have metal edges for better <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> hard snow; and their greater sidecut helps to carve turns.|$|E
5|$|Braun {{underwent}} surgery in October to desensitize the pain receptors near the nerves {{at the base}} of his right thumb. The problem was affecting his <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the bat. The surgery was performed by Dr. Vernon Williams. Through 2014, he was fifth among all active ballplayers in career slugging percentage, and second among active left fielders in career fielding percentage.|$|E

Women's grips have two finger holes and resemble men's ring grips.|$|R
5|$|In 1788, the Tây Sơn moved {{north to}} attack the Trịnh and unite Vietnam. Nguyễn Ánh took {{advantage}} of the situation to return to southern Vietnam. After rebuilding his army, he recaptured Saigon on September 7, 1788. His <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the south was enhanced by a group of Frenchmen and equipment that Pigneau had recruited, although the magnitude of the aid has been the source of dispute.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1955, {{the tide}} {{turned against the}} various sects, as Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm of the State of Vietnam and his VNA began to {{consolidate}} their <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the south. Ba Cụt and his allies were driven into the jungle, and their position was threatened by government offensives. After almost a year of fighting, Ba Cụt was captured. He {{was sentenced to death}} and publicly beheaded in Cần Thơ.|$|E
5|$|In the fallout, Bo {{was removed}} {{as the party}} chief of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo. Bo's {{dismissal}} exposed disunity within Communist Party ranks shortly before a major leadership transition, and some observers suspected {{that it was because}} he threatened Xi Jinping's future <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power. He was later stripped of all his positions, lost his seat at the National People's Congress, and was eventually expelled from the party.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the election, Dato' Onn Ja'afar {{had changed}} his approach, forming the Parti Negara after IMP {{suffered}} crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the Parti Negara failed to shake the Alliance's <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power. However, some believe Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E
5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} sea mussels to {{maintain}} their <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles. Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus 770 times, tensile strength 58 times, and toughness 92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times.|$|E

5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their fingers and toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E
5|$|Tho was apprehended {{during the}} coup and put {{under house arrest}} while the {{plotters}} consolidated their <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power; he was then removed from the political scene. General Nguyen Van Vy, who had returned from France after Diệm's deposal to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff for training, was put under house arrest before being released within a day of the coup's success.|$|E
5|$|Thơ was apprehended {{during the}} coup and put {{under house arrest}} while the {{plotters}} consolidated their <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power; he was then removed from the political scene. The civilian arm of the government was replaced with Khánh appointees, and Thơ left politics, having personally enriched himself during his period in government. His activities after leaving politics are not known. He died in 1976 in Saigon.|$|E

5|$|A {{favourite}} of {{the ruling}} Ngô family, Đính received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as more capable. He converted to Roman Catholicism to curry favour with Diệm, and headed the military wing of the Cần Lao party, a secret Catholic organisation that maintained the Ngôs' <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power. At the age of 32, Đính became the youngest ever ARVN general and {{the commander of the}} II Corps, but he was regarded as a dangerous, egotistical and impetuous figure with a weakness for alcohol and partying.|$|E
5|$|After his victory, Zabdas marched {{south along}} the Jordan Valley and {{apparently}} met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in Antioch, Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.|$|E
5|$|After marrying {{his niece}} Martina and being crowned by the Patriarch, the 35-year-old Heraclius {{set out to}} perform his work as emperor. Phocas' brother, Comentiolus, {{commanded}} a sizable force in central Anatolia but was assassinated by the Armenian commander Justin, removing {{a major threat to}} Heraclius' reign. Still, transfer of the forces commanded by Comentiolus had been delayed, allowing the Persians to advance further in Anatolia. Trying to increase revenues and reduce costs, Heraclius limited the number of state-sponsored personnel of the Church in Constantinople by not paying new staff from the imperial fisc. He used ceremonies to legitimize his dynasty, and he secured a reputation for justice to strengthen his <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power.|$|E

5|$|By August31, {{the storm}} began to slow and turn towards the west-northwest. The NHC {{noted that they}} did not have a firm <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the storm and were unsure of its future track and intensity. Below average sea surface {{temperatures}} ahead of the system would hamper significant development. Continuing on this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September2, the storm attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300mi (500km) east of Guadeloupe. At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Shortly after Christine attained this intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> {{power was}} {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E
5|$|China's power {{began to}} decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the {{subsequent}} Ming Dynastyneglected the importance of China's trade from sea power. The Ming rulers let China's naval dominance and its <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the Spice trade slacken, and the European powers stepped in. Portugal, with its technological advances in naval architecture, weaponry, seamanship and navigation, took over the Spice Trade and subdued China's navy. With this, European Imperialism {{and the age of}} European Hegemony was beginning, although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade.|$|E
