This paper presents two general stochastic-resonance theorems for threshold neurons that process noisy Bernoulli input sequences. The performance measure is Shannon mutual information.

The first theorem shows that this stochastic-resonance effect holds for all finite-variance noise probability density functions that obey a simple mean constraint that the user can control.

Due to the vagueness of the law, which does not specify a [...] "lapse period," [...] it was thought likely that if Bell's ever attempted to return to Illinois distribution, Union Beverage's parent company (National Wine and Spirits) would have the right to demand substantial compensation from the distributor. However, beginning in late 2007, Bell's beer began its return to Illinois via two new distributors by creating two new beer brands, Kalamazoo Royal Amber Ale and Kalamazoo Hopsoulution. [...] This was done for legal reasons: since each beer avoided the use of the [...] "Bell's" [...] name and logo, and used a different recipe from previous Bell's brands, Bell contended that these were not the same beers assigned to his former distributor. Nevertheless, Bell said he [...] "expects to be sued by his former distributor, National Wine & Spirits."

The matching-Furness method is investigated by use of simulated traffic data and is applied to a set of real data collected on the Brescia-Padova motorway network in Italy. The matching-Furness method gives consistently better estimates than the least squares estimator (Cremer and Keller, 1987) and the linked static-dynamic correlation model (Keller and Ploss, 1987).

40|$|In the {{derivation}} of <b>Bell's</b> inequalities, probability <b>distribution</b> {{is supposed}} to be a function of only hidden variable. We point out that the true implication of the probability <b>distribution</b> of <b>Bell's</b> correlation function is the distribution of the joint measurement outcomes on the two sides. So it is a function of both hidden variable and settings. In this case, Bell's inequalities fail. Our further analysis shows that Bell's locality holds neither for dependent events nor for independent events. We think that the measurements of EPR pairs are dependent events, thus violation of Bell's inequalities cannot rule out the existence of local hidden variable. In order to explain the results of EPR-type experiments, we suppose that polarization entangled photon pair can be composed of two circularly or linearly polarized photons with correlated hidden variables, and a couple of experiments of quantum measurement are proposed. The first uses delayed measurement on one photon of the EPR pair to demonstrate directly whether measurement on the other could have any non-local influence on it. Then several experiments are suggested to reveal the components of polarization entangled photon pair. The last one uses successive polarization measurements on a pair of EPR photons to show that two photons with a same quantum state will behave in the same way under the same measuring condition.

The phase <b>distribution</b> in the <b>bell's</b> manifold as well as the film thickness on the bell was determined, the latter result being compared with an analytical solution also. The simulations were carried out on a CRAYOpteron Cluster available at the Hochleistungsrechenzentrum HLRS of the University of Stuttgart.

40|$|The sump size {{is being}} reduced {{in order to}} lower the {{construction}} costs of urban drainage pump stations in Japan. As {{a result of such}} size reductions, undesirable vortices such as air-entrained and submerged vortices are apt to appear in sumps because of the higher flow velocities. The Turbomachinery Society of Japan (TSJ) Standard S 002 : 2005 states that the appearance of such visible vortices is not permissible for conventional sumps, and experiments with scale models usually have been done to assess the performance of sumps. Such tests, however, are expensive and time-consuming, and therefore, alternative computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for evaluating sump performance are desirable. The Research Committee on Pump Sump Model Testing, which is an organization in the TSJ, carried out a benchmark for flows in model sumps. They contributed commercial CFD codes such as "Virtual Fluid System 3 D", "Star-CD 3. 22 ", “Star-CD 3. 26 ”, and “ANSYS CFX 10. 0 ”. Some of the benchmark results were reported by Matsui, J. at the 23 rd IAHR Symposium in Yokohama, Oct 2006. The remaining results comprise this second paper. The calculated results were compared with experimental ones for flow patterns, locations of vortices, and their vorticity. In the experiments, the critical submergences for flow rates were minutely examined through visual observation with a video camera. The locations of the vortices were obtained by using the laser light sheet visualization method. The velocity and vorticity distribution in the sump were measured by using a PIV method. The following results were obtained. 1) The critical submergence for the air-entrained vortex is almost proportional to the flow rate in the sump. The vortex behavior is unsteady and the duration of the vortex varies greatly. 2) The submerged vortex appears accompanying the air-entrained vortex in the region of low submergences and high flow rates. The critical submergence for the submerged vortex is also proportional to the flow rate. 3) Some CFD codes can predict the visible vortex occurrence and its location for submergence and flow rate conditions with enough accuracy for industrial use. 4) The calculated velocity <b>distribution</b> at the <b>bell</b> entrance qualitatively agrees with the experimental results. However, the agreement is poor in terms of the magnitude and distribution patterns of the vorticity. This difference is caused by the lack of accuracy of the experiment and CFD computation. 5) Predicting the critical submergence for the visible vortices was not imposed in the benchmark. The calculated stream lines and vortex core lines are not able to be used to predict the visible vortices with much accuracy. An additional post-processing such as obtaining the vortex core static pressure and comparing it with ambient pressure for an air-entrained vortex or with the saturated vapor pressure of the water for a submerged vortex would be necessary to predict the visible vortices.
