5|$|In Islam: The Untold Story, Holland {{deals with}} {{the origins of the}} {{religion}} Islam. Travelling to Saudi Arabia, he visits Arabian Bedouins to hear their orthodox <b>Islamic</b> accounts of the religion's origins. Holland then talks to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a practising Muslim who teaches <b>Islamic</b> studies at the George Washington University, Washington D.C., and Patricia Crone, a non-Muslim historian of <b>Islamic</b> history at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. The former defends the orthodox <b>Islamic</b> account of the faith's history, citing its development within oral history, but Crone challenges the reliability of oral history, and therefore the traditional account.|$|E
5|$|<b>Islamic</b> feminists {{advocate}} women's rights, gender equality, {{and social}} justice grounded within an <b>Islamic</b> framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of <b>Islamic</b> teaching through the Quran, hadith (sayings of Muhammad), and sharia (law) towards {{the creation of a}} more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of <b>Islamic</b> feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.|$|E
5|$|<b>Islamic</b> {{geometric}} patterns {{derived from}} simpler designs used in earlier cultures: Greek, Roman, and Sasanian. They {{are one of}} three forms of <b>Islamic</b> decoration, the others being the arabesque based on curving and branching plant forms, and <b>Islamic</b> calligraphy; all three are frequently used together. Geometric designs and arabesques are forms of <b>Islamic</b> interlace patterns.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October 2012, a {{group of}} 50 <b>Islamic</b> clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwā – a ruling of <b>Islamic</b> law – against the Taliban gunmen who tried to kill Yousafzai. <b>Islamic</b> {{scholars}} from the Sunni Ittehad Council publicly denounced attempts by the Pakistani Taliban to mount religious justifications for the shooting of Yousafzai and two of her classmates.|$|E

5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, new problems emerged for <b>Islamic</b> law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the <b>Islamic</b> capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the <b>Islamic</b> state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel <b>Islamic</b> solutions without the close supervision of the hub of <b>Islamic</b> law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers. The Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly, in an attempt to apply it more consistently.|$|E
5|$|Born to a {{merchant}} {{and his wife}} in Gresik, Dutch East Indies, Fakih studied {{with his father and}} at a series of pesantren (<b>Islamic</b> boarding schools) until the 1920s. In 1925 he became involved with the Muhammadiyah, rising quickly through the leadership until he became the head of the Surabaya branch in 1938. He was also active in local politics. When a group of <b>Islamic</b> organisations formed the Indonesian <b>Islamic</b> Assembly in 1937, Fakih became treasurer. He continued to be involved in politics and <b>Islamic</b> groups during the Japanese occupation and ensuing national revolution. While serving as minister of religious affairs, he oversaw educational and institutional reform, growing in prominence within the Muhammadiyah. He served as deputy chairman of the organisation under several different leaders before being chosen as its chairman in late 1968, several days before his death.|$|E

5|$|Gutawa {{followed}} Harmony Cinta in August 2010 {{with a third}} album, the <b>Islamic</b> religious album Balada Shalawat (Ballads for Salah). During recording, Gutawa received coaching from an <b>Islamic</b> scholar, or ustad, {{regarding the}} correct pronunciation of Arabic lyrics used in some songs. The album was launched during Ramadhan, with profits donated to Indonesia's poor.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Council of Ulemas, an <b>Islamic</b> body in Indonesia, {{passed a}} fatwa banning yoga {{on the grounds}} that it {{contains}} Hindu elements. These fatwas have, in turn, been criticized by Darul Uloom Deoband, a Deobandi <b>Islamic</b> seminary in India. Similar fatwas banning yoga, for its link to Hinduism, were issued by the Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa in Egypt in 2004, and by <b>Islamic</b> clerics in Singapore earlier.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Islamic</b> and Arab {{histories}} Heraclius is {{the only}} Roman Emperor who is discussed at any length. Owing to {{his role as the}} Roman Emperor at the time Islam emerged, he was remembered in Arabic literature, such as the <b>Islamic</b> hadith and sira.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, the Pentagon {{announced}} that Apaches had been dispatched to Baghdad to protect embassy personnel from <b>Islamic</b> State militant attacks. On 4 October 2014, Apaches began performing missions in Operation Inherent Resolve against <b>Islamic</b> State ground forces. In October 2014, U.S. Army AH-64s and Air Force fighters participated in four air strikes on <b>Islamic</b> State units northeast of Fallujah. In June 2016, Apaches {{were used in}} support of the Iraqi Army's Mosul offensive and provided support during the Battle of Mosul, sometimes flying night missions supporting Iraqi operations.|$|E

5|$|Medieval <b>Islamic</b> science had {{practical}} purposes {{as well as}} the goal of understanding. For example, astronomy was useful for determining the Qibla, the direction in which to pray, botany had practical application in agriculture, as in the works of Ibn Bassāl and Ibn al-'Awwam, and geography enabled Abu Zayd al-Balkhi to make accurate maps. <b>Islamic</b> mathematicians such as al-Khwarizmi, Avicenna and Jamshid al-Kashi developed methods in algebra, geometry and trigonometry. <b>Islamic</b> doctors described diseases like smallpox and measles and challenged classical Greek medical theory. Al-Biruni, Avicenna and others described the preparation of hundreds of drugs made from medicinal plants and chemical compounds. <b>Islamic</b> physicists studied optics and mechanics (as well as astronomy) and criticised Aristotle's view of motion.|$|E
5|$|Palestine was conquered by the <b>Islamic</b> Caliphate, {{beginning}} in 634 CE. In 636, the Battle of Yarmouk during the Muslim {{conquest of the}} Levant marked the start of Muslim hegemony over the region, which became known as Jund Filastin within the province of Bilâd al-Shâm (Greater Syria). In 661, with the Assassination of Ali, Muawiyah I became the Caliph of the <b>Islamic</b> world after being crowned in Jerusalem. The Dome of the Rock, completed in 691, was the world's first great work of <b>Islamic</b> architecture.|$|E
5|$|Science in {{the medieval}} <b>Islamic</b> world was the science {{developed}} and practised during the <b>Islamic</b> Golden Age under the Umayyads of Córdoba, the Abbadids of Seville, the Samanids, the Ziyarids, Buyid Persia, Tamerlane's Transoxiana, the Abbasid Caliphate and beyond, spanning the period c. 800 to 1429. <b>Islamic</b> scientific achievements encompassed {{a wide range of}} subject areas, especially astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included alchemy and chemistry, botany, geography and cartography, ophthalmology, pharmacology, physics, and zoology.|$|E
5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{encourages}} {{everyone to}} fulfill the <b>Islamic</b> requirement of dawah even if the person falls short of strong religious intellect. This {{was different from the}} other <b>Islamic</b> movements which were mainly ulama-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of <b>Islamic</b> scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote dawah as a mechanism of self-reform.|$|E
5|$|The Oran fatwa was a responsum fatwa, or an <b>Islamic</b> legal opinion, {{issued in}} 1504 {{to address the}} crisis that {{occurred}} when Muslims in the Crown of Castile (now part of Spain) were forced to convert to Christianity in 15001502. The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (<b>Islamic</b> law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in <b>Islamic</b> law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, and recommendations when obliged to violate <b>Islamic</b> law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} geometrical {{forms in}} <b>Islamic</b> art were occasional isolated geometric shapes such as 8-pointed stars and lozenges containing squares. These date from 836 in the Great Mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia, {{and since then}} have spread all across the <b>Islamic</b> world.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} and its museum house an internationally celebrated collection of historic Quranic manuscripts from {{various parts of}} the <b>Islamic</b> world, from China in the East and to Spain in the West, representing a progression of calligraphic traditions from the first Hijri century (622–722 AD) and of the <b>Islamic</b> Golden Age, to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal system}} of Saudi Arabia {{is based on}} Sharia, <b>Islamic</b> law derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the <b>Islamic</b> prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include <b>Islamic</b> {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia {{is influenced by the}} medieval (<b>Islamic</b> Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of <b>Islamic</b> jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, and the lack of judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, but this is yet to be implemented. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature.|$|E
5|$|The pilgrimage occurs {{from the}} 8th to 12th (or {{in some cases}} 13th) of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the <b>Islamic</b> {{calendar}}. Because the <b>Islamic</b> calendar is lunar and the <b>Islamic</b> year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year, the Gregorian date of Hajj changes from year to year. Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which pilgrims wear two white sheets of seamless cloth and abstain from certain actions.|$|E

5|$|Various {{sources of}} sharia {{are used by}} <b>Islamic</b> {{jurisprudence}} to elucidate the body of <b>Islamic</b> law. The primary source accepted universally by all Muslims is the Qur'an, the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported Sunnah, but rejected by others; Quranism. The Qur'an is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of God. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the <b>Islamic</b> prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E
25|$|The Iranian regular military, or <b>Islamic</b> Republic of Iran Army, {{consist of}} the <b>Islamic</b> Republic of Iran Army Ground Forces, <b>Islamic</b> Republic of Iran Navy, <b>Islamic</b> Republic of Iran Air Force, and the <b>Islamic</b> Republic of Iran Air Defense Force. The regular armed forces have an {{estimated}} 398,000 personnel: the <b>Islamic</b> Republic of Iran Army, 350,000 personnel, of which 220,000 are conscripts; the <b>Islamic</b> Republic of Iran Navy, 18,000 personnel, and the <b>Islamic</b> Republic of Iran Air Force, 30,000 airmen.

25|$|<b>Islamic</b> {{military}} jurisprudence {{refers to}} what has been accepted in Sharia (<b>Islamic</b> law) and Fiqh (<b>Islamic</b> jurisprudence) by Ulama (<b>Islamic</b> scholars) as the correct <b>Islamic</b> manner which is expected to be obeyed by Muslims in times of war.
