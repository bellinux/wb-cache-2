5|$|Bulgaria's {{population}} of 7.2 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly {{concentrated in the}} administrative centres of its 28 provinces. Most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city, Sofia.

5|$|The {{underpinnings}} {{of the local}} <b>economy</b> <b>are</b> based on Moncton's heritage as a commercial, distribution, transportation, and retailing centre. This is due to Moncton's central location in the Maritimes: it has the largest catchment area in Atlantic Canada with 1.6 million people living within a three-hour drive of the city. The insurance, information technology, educational, and health care sectors also are major factors in the local economy with the city's two hospitals alone employing over five thousand people.|$|E

50|$|A closed {{household}} <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> a society's {{economic system}} in which goods are not traded. Instead, those goods are produced and consumed by the same households. In other words, a closed household <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> an <b>economy</b> where households <b>are</b> closed to trading. This kind of <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> present, for example, in hunter-gatherer societies.|$|R
50|$|Agglomeration <b>economies</b> <b>are</b> closely {{associated}} with economies of scale and the network effects mentioned above. A positive outcome, agglomeration <b>economies,</b> <b>is</b> achieved only if the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.

5|$|Who's Your City? {{is divided}} into four parts {{with a total of}} 16 chapters. The first part {{presents}} data that suggests the world's population and <b>economy</b> <b>are</b> becoming increasingly geographically concentrated into few mega-regions, such as BosWash and the San Francisco Bay Area. Thomas Friedman's Flat World Theory, or his assertion that distance and place is becoming irrelevant, is countered by Florida with maps of population growth, economic activity, innovation (as demonstrated by patent registration), and scientific discovery (as demonstrated by residence of the most heavily cited scientists).|$|E
5|$|Brought by JC's {{agents to}} Liberty Island, Alex learns that the island holds an old {{part of the}} pre-Collapse {{worldwide}} communication network {{which can be used}} by each faction. No matter what choices Alex has made up to now, they can choose to side with any faction, or kill all the leaders on Liberty Island. If Alex follows JC's plan, the biomods are distributed worldwide, giving Helios the ability to access all human thought, allowing it to govern humanity. If Alex sides with the Illuminati, they use the network to help create a global surveillance state where communication and the <b>economy</b> <b>are</b> controlled. If Alex joins the Templars, they help unite humanity under a theocracy where biomod use and those considered impure are ruthlessly suppressed. Killing all other factions on Liberty Island leads to global chaos, turning Earth into a wasteland dominated by the Omar.|$|E
5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea otters and the human <b>economy</b> <b>are</b> not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E

5|$|Other key {{sectors of}} the Turkish <b>economy</b> <b>are</b> banking, construction, home appliances, electronics, textiles, oil refining, {{petrochemical}} products, food, mining, iron and steel, and machine industry. In 2010, the agricultural sector accounted for 9 percent of GDP, while the industrial sector accounted for 26 percent and the services sector for 65 percent. However, agriculture still accounted {{for a quarter of}} employment. In 2004, it was estimated that 46 percent of total disposable income was received by the top 20 percent of income earners, while the lowest 20 percent received only 6 percent. The rate of female employment in Turkey was 30 percent in 2012, the lowest among all OECD countries.|$|E

50|$|An {{informal}} <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> {{economic activity}} that is neither taxed nor monitored by a government, contrasted with a formal economy. The informal <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> thus not included in that government's gross national product (GNP). Although the informal <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> often associated with developing countries, all economic systems contain an informal economy in some proportion.|$|R

5000|$|Planned <b>economies</b> <b>are</b> held in {{contrast}} with command economies, where a planned <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> [...] "an economic {{system in which the}} government controls and regulates production, distribution, prices, etc." [...] but a command economy, while also having this type of regulation, necessarily has substantial public ownership of industry. Therefore, command <b>economies</b> <b>are</b> planned <b>economies,</b> but not necessarily the reverse.|$|R
25|$|The {{environmental}} degradation has driven many Yokot'an, especially men, to urban centers for employment. As a result, family cohesion has suffered and traditions, especially those {{pertaining to the}} traditional <b>economy,</b> <b>are</b> not as well preserved. There is also a major alcoholism problem caused by difficulty adapting to mainstream Mexican society and the comparative wealth experienced by recent arrivals to the cities.|$|E
25|$|Chicago's {{history and}} <b>economy</b> <b>are</b> {{closely tied to}} its {{proximity}} to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge lake freighters use the city's Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect, moderating Chicago's climate; making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.|$|E

25|$|The mainstays of the Maldives <b>economy</b> <b>are</b> its {{fisheries}} and tourism. Both are intrinsically {{related to the}} coral reefs. The fisheries were the dominant {{sector of the economy}} until 1985, when the tourism industry overtook the fisheries in terms of its contribution to GDP.

25|$|Although {{statistics}} of the Soviet <b>economy</b> <b>are</b> notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was {{catching up to}} the West. However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by Japan).|$|E
25|$|The Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) {{with the}} People's Republic of China was signed on 29 June 2010, in Chongqing.
