5|$|In 1788, Hamilton served {{yet another}} term in what {{proved to be}} the last session of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation. When the term of Philip Schuyler was up in 1791, elected in his place was the {{attorney}} general of New York, one Aaron Burr. Hamilton blamed Burr for this result, and ill characterizations of Burr appear in his correspondence thereafter. The two men <b>did</b> <b>work</b> together from time to time thereafter on various projects, including Hamilton's army of 1798 and the Manhattan Water Company.|$|E

5|$|After the break-up, Strummer {{contacted}} Jones in {{an effort}} to reform the Clash. Jones, however, had already formed a new band, Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.), that had released its debut late in 1985. The two <b>did</b> <b>work</b> together on their respective 1986 projects. Jones helped out with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the Sid and Nancy soundtrack. Strummer, in turn, cowrote a number of the tracks on the second B.A.D. album, No.10, Upping St., which he also co-produced. With Jones committed to B.A.D., Strummer moved on to various solo projects and screen acting work. Simonon formed a band called Havana 3am. Headon recorded a solo album, before once again spiraling into drug abuse. Chimes drummed with a succession of different acts.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force in November 1941 in the artillery. He was sent to Warwick Farm, then on the western {{outskirts}} of Sydney, for training. A non-conformist known for being forthright, Fingleton did not enjoy military discipline. In May 1942, he went AWOL from his post at Double Bay {{on the shores of}} Sydney Harbour to visit his wife. As a result, he was missing when a Japanese midget submarine launched an attack in the harbour. Soon after, he was deployed to Townsville in northern Queensland in anticipation of a Japanese land invasion, which never materialised. He was then transferred to the Press Relations unit. There he <b>did</b> <b>work</b> in intelligence analysis and censorship.|$|E

5|$|For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out {{to recruit}} some top nuclear physicists, of whom there were few in Canada.

A compromise was reached whereby Thode <b>did</b> <b>work</b> for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including J.

5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} with being {{the first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of Pythagoras of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed {{there is not a single}} mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates <b>did</b> <b>work</b> with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E
5|$|Adams <b>did</b> <b>work</b> for {{publishers}} {{other than}} Marvel during the 1980s, {{as when he}} drew several pages of Batman #400 in 1986 and Action Comics Annual #1 in 1987. The latter {{is viewed as a}} turning point in Adam's drawing style, characterized by bulkier figures of Batman and Superman, though Adams explains that this was in part due to the influence of The Dark Knight Returns, and that the overall change in art was style partly due to deliberate experimentation on his part, and partly to Dick Giordano's inking, which exhibited a different line weight. That same year, he illustrated Gumby Summer Fun Special #1 by Comico Comics, a job he obtained through Comico editor Diana Schutz, an old friend who noticed the incidental images of Gumby that Adams had included in the pages of Longshot. Adams, who did not harbor fond memories of that cartoon as a child, and who feared he would be typecast as a Gumby artist if he took the job, told Schultz he would only do it if she could get Bob Burden to write it, on the assumption that Schultz would decline this condition. Schultz, who initially wanted Mark Evanier for the job, considered this, and eventually agreed to it after contacting Burden, who was enthusiastic about the idea. That book, which demonstrated Adams' versatility in handling comedy as well as superheroics, garnered him and Burden a 1988 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue. Adams would later illustrate a second Gumby book, Gumby's Winter Fun Special, which was written by Steve Purcell.|$|E
40|$|Background Accreditation {{is usually}} a {{voluntary}} plan supported by a non-governmental institution and trained evaluators that examine the competency of organizations providing health service according to pre-specified performance standards. Objectives The current study aimed to determine the degree of establishment of accreditation standards using logical framework of Zachman. Methods This descriptive research was conducted during year 2015. The population of the study included {{people involved in the}} establishment of accreditation standards. Sampling was conducted in the form of complete enumeration according to 36 standards of accreditation. The instrument used for data collection was the “Logical framework of Zachman”. Columns of framework consisted of people involved in conducting the work (Who), the purpose of the work (Why), strategy of the work (What), work time (When), and sub-system of <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> (Where) and way of <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> (How), and rows of framework included the view of hospital chief, director/assistants of hospital, officials and personnel. Test chi-square was used to compare between accreditation standards text and studied hospital gap. Descriptive statistical method was used for variables. Results People involved in <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> and sub-systems of <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> at the hospital were consistent with specified accreditation standards. In 27 % of the standards, time interval of <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> in the hospital was not conducted according to accreditation standards. In terms of way of <b>doing</b> <b>work,</b> 25 % of standards had not been established, and 26 % of them had been established incompletely. During interviews, it was found that 59 % of personnel of purpose of <b>doing</b> <b>work,</b> and 94 % of them are not informed about the strategy of <b>doing</b> <b>work,</b> according to accreditation standards in the hospital. Conclusions Uncertainties in the accreditation standards in dimensions of purpose, people involved, strategy and time interval of <b>doing</b> <b>work,</b> respectively, led to a lack of understanding the intention of author/developers of standards by personnel. As a result, this led to lack of complete establishment of accreditation standards in the studied hospital...|$|R

5|$|Later in 1902, May {{once again}} moved, this time further {{west to the}} town of Edmonton, in the North-West Territory. Upon his arrival there, he would {{purchase}} several lots of land on which he would construct a series of cottages, houses and terraces that he would later sell. In Edmonton, he would establish himself as a prominent contractor, building many notable early buildings of the town, and later city. He partnered with Charles W. Sharpe and established the May-Sharpe Construction company. With his firm, buildings he was involved in constructing included the town's first Canadian Northern Railway station, a post office, the Bank of Montreal, Merchants' Bank and Bank of Commerce buildings, the Hudson's Bay Company store, the first provincial penitentiary building, and the residences of city notables Richard Secord, Frank Oliver and Edward Ainslie Braithwaite. He was also involved {{in the construction of the}} Clover Bar railway bridge, for which he set the concrete piers and foundation, as well as the Land Titles Building in Regina, Saskatchewan. From 1909 to 1912, May would also construct the still-standing LeMarchand mansion, atop the North Saskatchewan River Valley as well as assist in the construction of McDougall United Church. The LeMarchand mansion construction however would bankrupt him and force him to move to a cottage on Koney Island on Cooking Lake, beside the present day Edmonton/Cooking Lake Water Aerodrome in Strathcona County, until his debts were settled. In 1921, he <b>did</b> <b>work</b> at Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, as superintendent of the Windsor Transportation Company.|$|E
