Design goals included a requirement {{for the detection of}} flaws as small as two thousandths of an inch on parts up to 8 by 8 inches in size. The inspection engine is a Datacube, Inc., MV 200 pipeline processor. As each part is inspected, four 2 K by 2 K pixel quadrant images are stitched together to construct a single 4 K by 4 K pixel image with the aid of multiple fiducials located in each quadrant. The part fiducial locations, mask image, and punched-hole position data are generated, beforehand, from CAD designs using a defect map editor (DME), a preprocessing software package developed for the PC. The DME also generates a part ``defect map``. Each unique structure in the printed pattern is defined as an object. Objects are grouped into user-defined categories such as die pads, contact fingers, traces, and electrolysis buses. The map is used during the runtime inspection to associate each detected defect with an object group and a particular defect specification for that group.

40|$|AbstractThe {{presented}} process {{offers a}} simplified method for manufacturing multilayer ceramics (MC) {{in comparison to}} the conventional multilayer ceramics technology (MCT). It combines the <b>tape</b> casting of <b>ceramic</b> <b>green</b> <b>tapes</b> and the subsequent screen printing of electrodes into one single co-casting process. Since the co-casting process circumvents also the stacking and laminating of single <b>ceramic</b> <b>green</b> <b>tapes,</b> MC with layer thicknesses as thin as 20 μm could be manufactured by this technique.

A conceptual micro-fluidic module has been presented and few unit entities necessary for its realization have been described. The purpose of these entities is to position the sensors and actuators by using piezoelectric materials. Investigations are performed to make useful constructions like diaphragms and cantilevers for laying the sensing elements, cavities for burying the electronic chip devices, and channels for fluid transportation.

The permeability of unlaminated and laminated green tapes was determined as a function of binder content for binder removed by air oxidation. The tapes are comprised of barium titanate as the dielectric, and polyvinyl butyral and dioctyl phthanlate are the main compoents of the binder mixture. The flow in porous media through the tapes was analyzed in terms of models for describing Knudsen, slip, and Poiseuille flow mechanisms. The characteristic pore size was determined to be 0. 5 - 2 [mu]m, and thus Poiseuille flow was the dominant transport mechanism contributing to the flux. The permeability was then determined from Darcy's law for flow in porous media. The permeability was also determined from micro-structural attributes in terms of the specific surface, the pore fraction, and a term to account for tortuosity and constrictions.

40|$|For the {{processing}} of <b>ceramic</b> <b>green</b> <b>tapes</b> to form 3 D components, different technologies are known, for instance lamination to multilayer or folding. In the metal and plastic industry, deep drawing is after bending one of the famous method for reshaping of sheet metals and polymers. However, for processing green tapes this technology is not used because of the following debinding and sintering steps. During the complex shaping process, the within the polymer matrix arranged ceramic particles become rearrange and an inhomogeneous particle distribution can arise. During sintering this can result in defect because of inhomogeneous shrinkage behavior.
