40|$|<b>Innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> {{continue}} {{to be an important}} focus of economic development policies in many nations. Leading <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> demonstrate that regional concentration strengthens the innovative capability and can lead to successful competitiveness on a global level, as demonstrated by regions such as Silicon Valley (US), Cambridge (UK) and Sophia Antipolis (France). However the successful creation of clusters still presents a challenge to policy makers as efforts to do so regularly fail. The development of <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> has therefore received much academic and policymaker attention. While past research has examined a variety of factors as drivers for clustering effects, the role of communication within the cluster - and, specifically, the role of key individual communicators - in underpinning successful cluster development has received almost no academic attention. In this chapter, we will draw upon the relevant literature to develop a conceptual framework that will underpin research on this important topic by investigating the role of communicators in <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters.</b> Building on communication theories, the framework suggests that there are four influence-levels that shape and impact the role of communications in innovation clusters: the Individual Level, the Organizational Level, the Cluster Level and the Context. The interdisciplinary view on clustering effects contributes valuable insight to both communication studies and cluster theories. The framework developed within this chapter provides a structure to aid future research on the role of communicators within <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters...</b>|$|R

Indeed, members of <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> must necessarily enter into conflict with both the established procedures and the formal institutional routines and rules that are inadequate for innovative disruption.

40|$|The paper aims to {{investigate}} how <b>innovations</b> <b>cluster</b> in different technological systems (TSs) when their “techno-economic”, rather than “territorial” space, is considered. <b>Innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> of economic sectors are identified {{by referring to}} the innovation “potential” represented by their R&D expenditure and by applying social network analysis to the intersectoral R&D flows matrices of 15 OECD countries in the mid- 1990 s. Different clusterization models are first tested in order to detect the way sectors group {{on the basis of}} the embodied R&D flows they exchange. Actual clusters are then mapped in the different TSs by looking for intersectoral relationships which can be qualified to constitute “reduced TSs” (ReTSs). In all the 15 TSs investigated the techno-economic space appears organized in hierarchies, along which its constitutive sectors grouped into clusters with different density and composition. Once ReTSs are looked for, the 15 TSs display highly heterogeneous structures, but with some interesting similarity on the basis of which different clusters of TSs can be identified in turn. <b>Innovation</b> <b>clusters,</b> technological systems, R&D expenditure, embodied innovation flows,...|$|R
