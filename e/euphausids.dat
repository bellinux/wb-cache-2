As the gut of a marine mammal is functionally very similar to that of a human, Anisakis species are able to infect humans who eat raw or undercooked fish.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Four {{species of}} ellobiopsids {{were taken in}} Alaskan coastal waters. Thalassomyces fagei (a synonym of Amallocystis fagei) was found to parasitize {{specimens}} of the <b>euphausid</b> Thysanoessa raschii taken in Kachemak Bay, Alaska. The development of T. fagei external to the host from a small knob to the mature form was found to occur by repeated dichotomous branching. T. fagei occurred dur-ing April and May hut was not observed at other times of the year. Thalassomyces sp. {{was found to be}} parasitic on specimens of the mysid Acanthomysis pseudoma-cropsis taken in Kachemak Bay, Alaska. The range of Thalassomyces capillosus, para-sitic on the caridean Pasiphaea pacifica, is extended from Coos Bay, Oregon, to Orca Bay, Prince William Sound, Alaska. Ellobiopsis chattoni was found to parasitize the copepod Metridia longa, a new host of this ellobiopsid. Specimens of E. chattoni were taken in the waters of southeastern Alaska, extending the range of E. chattoni from the Atlantic to the north Pacific. THE SYSTEMATIC POSITION of the family Ello-biopsidae Coutiere and the genera therein has been an enigma since their original description. According to Margaret]epps (1937), T. Scott in 1897 first described the ellobiopsid now known as Ellobiopsis chattoni as a "? infusorian parasite " of the copepod Calanus finmarchicu s. She state's also that in 1910 Caullery associated the ellobiopsids with the Dinoflagellata. Various authors have continued to consider these or-ganisms to be closely related to the dinoflagel-lates. ]epps points out that a relation with the fungi is possible. Boschma (1949, 1956, and 1959) reviewed the entire group and preferred to consider them as "Protista of uncertain posi-tion. " He noted that the ellobiopsids have af-finities with the following groups: parasitic peridinians, flagellates, and possibly fungi of the family Saprolegniaceae, and that the group is made up of a number of heterogeneous elements. The family Ellobiopsidae is a rather hetero-geneous group consisting of several genera. Members of the genus Ellobio cystis are epi-bionts, whereas members of the genera Ellobi-opsis and Thalassomyces are parasites. This study is concerned only with the last two genera...|$|R

40|$|The {{zooplankton}} prey {{composition and}} feeding periodicity of juvenile and adult seahorses Hippocampus barbouri reared in illuminated and non-illuminated sea cages were compared. Mean {{frequency of occurrence}} (%FO), prey composition (%N), and gut fullness of seahorses were calculated from analyses of gut contents. Compared with juvenile seahorses, adults consumed more variety of prey consisting of copepods, larvae of decapods, polychaetes and fish, and <b>euphausid</b> shrimps. Calanoid copedods {{were found in the}} gut of more juvenile (%FO = 47) and adult (%FO = 64) seahorses in illuminated cages but harpacticoid copepods were ingested by more juvenile fish (%FO = 50) in non-illuminated cages. Decapod larvae (%N = 66) in illuminated cages dominated the diet of juvenile seahorses, whereas in non-illuminated cages harpacticoid copepods (%N = 59) did. Calanoid copepods and decapod larvae (%N = 91 â€“ 97) comprised the bulk of ingested prey among adult seahorses in all experimental cages. The gut of caged seahorses was generally full during daytime but declined in the evening, becoming almost empty at midnight, particularly among juveniles. Cage illumination commencing at midnight increased the number of filled guts at dawn (0400 h) among juvenile and adult seahorses. Unlike adult seahorses over a 24 -h period, the overall incidence of filled guts among juveniles was not different between those in non-illuminated and illuminated cages. These results provide an alternative to growing caged H. barbouri on cultured live food, particularly copepods attracted by night illumination.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} further {{data on the}} occurrence of Pseudoterranova decipiens in fish from two different sampling sites in the Antarctic. A total of 690 fish belonging to 33 species from the eastern Weddell Sea and 322 fish belonging to 12 species from the South Shetland Islands were examined. Altogether, 23 fish species {{were found to be}} infested and 11 new host records could be established. P. decipiens occurred at a water depth of between 80 and 820 m. Chaenocephalus aceratus and Notothenia coriiceps from the South Shetland Islands were the species with the highest prevalence (95 %) and intensity (2 - 194 and 1 - 121, respectively) of infestation. Both are transport hosts, which mainly feed on benthic nototheniid fish species and accumulate the nematodes. Bathypelagic, pelagic, or mainly <b>euphausid</b> feeding fish species were only lightly infested, if at all. This demonstrates the benthic life cycle of P. decipiens in the Antarctic. The preferred site of infestation was the body cavity and the liver; no specimen could be isolated from the fish musculature. This might be explained by the low water temperatures. The infestation of fish from the Weddell Sea was distinctly lower than that of fish around the South Shetland Islands. Besides possible differences in final host populations at the two localities studied, the loss of eggs and larvae under the eastern Weddell Sea shelf ice and over the continental slope and differences in the availability of the first intermediate and macroinvertebrate hosts led to a lower level of infestation. Another role, although nondecisive, may be played by the reduced time of development and infectivity of eggs and larvae, respectively, in the extremely cold waters of the Weddell Sea. P. decipiens is not a rare but, rather a well-established parasite of the Antarctic fauna, which demonstrates the ability of this cosmopolitan species to complete its life cycle even under conditions of subzero temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Aspects of {{the tail}} flip, escape {{response}} of a thermosbaenacean, Tethysbaena argentarii, were examined {{with the aid of}} S-VHS video. The first part of the escape action involves a 1808 shift in orientation, where head and tail change position within 2 / 50 to 4 / 50 sec. This shift is caused by two successive, tail flips: first a ventral movement, which brings the tail region close to the thorax; then a dorsal motion, which causes the thorax/head region to flip backwards because of greater water drag in the tail region (tail fan). The 1808 change in orientation is sometimes followed by a number a forceful dorso-ventral tail flips that promote rapid swimming in the new direction. The type of escape reaction in Tethysbaena argentarii is different from the ‘jet’stream ’ type of escape reaction seen in various shrimp, <b>euphausids,</b> and mysids, but it bears some similarity to that seen in stomatopods and in various crayfish where a 1808 shift in orientation is also seen...|$|E

The ingestion rates measured at many oceanic stations and in winter were often too low to sustain EPR. Egg production efficiency (GGE) > 100 % indicated that sustained EPR might have relied, particularly in winter, on alternative food sources such as a more carnivorous diet and/or on the faecal pellets of <b>euphausids...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{fragment}} of the nifH gene was amplified from anaerobic microbial enrichments initiated with marine planktonic invertebrates, including copepods and <b>euphausids.</b> A {{number of the}} nifH sequences from these enrichments were phylogenetically related to Cluster III nifH sequences of Clostridium pasteurianum and Desulfovibrio gigas. nifH fragments were cloned and sequenced from strains of Desulfobacter curvatus, Desulfonema limicola, and Chromatium purpuratum {{in order to provide}} the basis for identifying nifH sequences amplified from uncultivated microorganisms in the enrichments. Nitrogenase genes from Desulfonema limicola and Desulfobacter curvatus clustered with the sequence from Desulfovibrio gigas. Some of the nifH gene sequences from the zooplankton-derived microbial enrichments clustered with these sequences {{as well as a number}} of previously reported sequences from marine microbial mats, termite guts and intact invertebrate zooplankton. Some of the nitrogen-fixing phylotypes in the enrichments appeared to be active, since nitrogenase activity was detected by the acetylene reduction technique in the enrichments. Multiple copies of nifH were amplified from the Desulfobacter curvatus culture, with one of the sequences clustering with non-vanadium second alternative anfH sequences, but no anfH sequences were recovered from the enrichments. The results demonstrate that there are nitrogen-fixing anaerobes associated with planktonic crustacea, and the identified nifH phylotypes could be important in oceanic nitrogen fixation. z 1999 Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Of those zooplankters above reefs on {{the lagoon}} shelf at Enewetak Atoll {{at some time}} during the diel cycle, the vast {{majority}} of those larger than about 1. 5 mm were there only at night. Many of these larger forms were local residents that by day sheltered in or near shelf substrata, or in swarms close to these substrata, and at night made purposeful forays above the shelf. Many others, however, were transients from the deeper regions of the lagoon, or from the open sea outside the atoll, and these were above the shelf at night by chance. The residents included various polychaetes, cypridinacean ostracods, copepods, mysids, tan aids, isopods, amphipods, and carideans. The transients were mostly holoplankters that included halocyprid ostracods, calanoid copepods, <b>euphausids,</b> and chaetognaths. Both residents and transients were above the shelf at night as a result of diel vertical migrations. The residents were adapted to stay within reach of their diurnal habitats while in the nocturnal water column, often by avoiding currents, and so were readily able to return to those habitats at dawn. The open-water transients, however, lacked such adaptations, and, as a result, probably many were stranded in the shallows above the shelf at dawn, unable to return to their daytime depths and probably vulnerable to planktivorous fishes...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the feeding ecology of Nephrops norvegicus was carried out on a seasonal basis simultaneously in seven locations in the Eastern and Western Mediterranean and the adjacent Atlantic: the south coast of Portugal, Faro; the Alboran Sea, Malaga; the Catalan Sea, Barcelona; the Ligurian Sea, Genoa; theTyrrhenian Sea, Pisa; the Adriatic Sea, Ancona and the Aegean Sea, Gulf of Euboikos. The major groups observed (frequency of occurrence method) in the stomachs of Nephrops norvegicus were decapod crustaceans, other crustaceans (<b>euphausids</b> and peracarids) and fish. The results obtained showed {{no significant differences between}} sites or seasons, and can be considered very consistent. All major taxa were present in the diet at all sites and for all seasons, a fact that {{can be explained by the}} great similarity of the bathyal fauna in all sites, which provide a major trophic resource for N. norvegicus. The percentage of fullness was also estimated per site and season, and we registered a clear decrease of this value during the summer period for all sites, except the Tyrrheanian Sea, where the lowest value was found in autumn. PCA - analysis did not clearly separate the regions (sites). The Shannon-Weaver (H´), index of diversity, was also determined per site and season, and we found a significant difference between the values of the Atlantic coast and the Western Mediterranean when compared with those of the Eastern Mediterranean...|$|E
40|$|Durinq the summerer and {{autumn of}} 1980 the squid Todarodes sagittatus invaded the Norwegian Sea and {{adjacent}} areas in great quantities. The invasion may partly {{be connected with}} an increased influx of Atlantic water, as indicated by considerable numbers of salps. Materials for investigation were collected from April 1980 to April 1981 in northeast Atlantic waters, the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea, and in the coastal waters of Norway. The mean dorsal mantle length (DML) increased from 16 - 18 cm for both sexes in April 1980 to 31 - 32 cm (males) and to 35 - 38 cm (females) in December, and further to 33 cm and 40 cm respectively in March 1981. Weight-length relations were calculated for various size groups. Growth curves were fitted to the length-frequency data, applying the von Bertalanffy equation L(t) = Loo (1 - exp[-k(t-to) ]). The liver weight varied from 4 % to 17 % of the total weight, average figures from 6. 7 % to 10. 9 %. Males constituted from 0 % to 10 % of the samples in coastal areas, in open waters, 20 - 28 %. Food consisted mainly of fish, followed by cephalopods, <b>euphausids</b> and amphipods. In coastal areas T. sagittatus is supposed to {{eat a lot of}} 0 -group fish. Age readings of daily rings in the statoliths indicate a life cycle of 1 - 1 ½ years. Most of the squid investigated were 6 - 11 months old. Behaviour of squid was studied using echo sounders and underwater TV cameras. The Norwegian squid fishery yielded 2. 500 metric tons in 1980...|$|E
40|$|Parasitic isopods of Bopyroidea and Cryptoniscoidea (commonly {{referred}} to as epicarideans) are unique in using crustaceans as both intermediate and definitive hosts. In total, 795 epicarideans are known, representing ~ 7. 7 % of described isopods. The rate of description of parasitic species has not matched that of free-living isopods and this disparity will likely continue due to the more cryptic nature of these parasites. Distribution patterns of epicarideans are influenced {{by a combination of}} their definitive (both benthic and pelagic species) and intermediate (pelagic copepod) host distributions, although host specificity is poorly known for most species. Among epicarideans, nearly all species in Bopyroidea are ectoparasitic on decapod hosts. Bopyrids are the most diverse taxon (605 species), with their highest diversity in the North West Pacific (139 species), East Asian Sea (120 species), and Central Indian Ocean (44 species). The diversity patterns of Cryptoniscoidea (99 species, endoparasites of a diverse assemblage of crustacean hosts) are distinct from bopyrids, with the greatest diversity of cryptoniscoids in the North East Atlantic (18 species) followed by the Antarctic, Mediterranean, and Arctic regions (13, 12, and 8 species, respectively). Dajidae (54 species, ectoparasites of shrimp, mysids, and <b>euphausids)</b> exhibits highest diversity in the Antarctic (7 species) with 14 species in the Arctic and North East Atlantic regions combined. Entoniscidae (37 species, endoparasites within anomuran, brachyuran and shrimp hosts) show highest diversity in the North West Pacific (10 species) and North East Atlantic (8 species). Most epicarideans are known from relatively shallow waters, although some bopyrids are known from depths below 4000 m. Lack of parasitic groups in certain geographic areas is likely a sampling artifact and we predict that the Central Indian Ocean and East Asian Sea (in particular, the Indo-Malay-Philippines Archipelago) hold a wealth of undescribed species, reflecting our knowledge of host diversity patterns...|$|E
40|$|<b>Euphausids,</b> Amphipods and Copepods are {{important}} food organisms for the Alaska pollack {{in the adjacent}} waters of the Funka Bay. In this paper, the seasonal variations of distribution of these three crustacean groups were examined on the date obtained from the vertical hauls with a NORPAC net at six definite stations once each month from February 1974 to February 1975. (1) Euphausia pacifica of calyptopis and furcilia stages appeared at the inshore station of 50 m depth with the inflow of the surface layer water of the Oyashio current in February and March. From July to September, the larger one of this species were predominant at the offshore stations (300 - 350 m depth) where {{the tip of the}} bottom layer water of the Oyashio current existed, and became most abundant in the same stations with the access of the mixed water mass of the Tsugaru warm current and the Oyashio mid water current in December and January. (2) Amphipods, mainly Parathemisto japonica, were abundant in the offshore stations in March-April and July-August. Their seasonal distribution showed approximately a similar trend to that of E. pacifica. (3) Pseudocalanus minutus of small size in the Copepods group appeared at the inshore station from March to May. Calanus cristatus, C. plumchrus and Eucalanus bungii bungii were chiefly distributed at the offshore stations (300 - 400 m depth). Their abundance increased from February to May and decreased from August to September. (4) There is a large variation in the abundance of distribution of these crustacean groups during some years in the abundance of the Alaska pollack, suggesting that the feeding ecology of the Alaska pollack also varies widely with the availability of these food organisms...|$|E
40|$|A seasonally-varying {{sedimentation}} {{pattern was}} observed for the alkenone flux measured with sediment traps {{in the northern}} North Atlantic. In the Norwegian Sea (traps were set at 500, 1000 and 3000 m) the alkenone flux varied between 0. 1 and 7. 1 μg m− 2 d− 1 and followed the seasonal pattern of the bulk parameters. Maximum fluxes occurred from mid-October until mid-November and were also high in May. A surprising result was that considerably higher particle fluxes were observed at 3000 m. For the alkenone flux, the highest additional input of 250 % was observed during the period when sediment resuspension was greatest in summer. At the Barents Sea continental margin (traps at 1840 and 1950 m) the alkenone fluxes follow the sedimentation pattern of the bulk parameters, with a less visible signal of distinct seasonality observed in the 1950 m trap. The sedimentation of total alkenones varied between 0. 8 and 144 μg m− 2 d− 1 at 1840 m and between 0. 5 and 31. 0 μg m− 2 d− 1 at 1950 m. Resuspension and lateral advection contributed significantly to measured fluxes in the two near-bottom traps. Alkenone concentrations were determined in faecal pellets of Appendicularia, ostracods and <b>euphausids</b> from selected samples at the Barents Sea site. The alkenone flux in pellets (4 % to 24 % of total) was 5 to 6 times higher at 1950 m depth than at 1840 m and the major part (77 – 78 %) of the total flux of C 37 : 3 reaching the near-bottom trap at 1950 m was associated with faecal pellets of the meso-zooplankton. Spatial and temporal variations of the U 37 k′ signals were observed, indicating that the imprint in the alkenone signal depends on the origin and transport pathway of the organic material. Strong deviations occur in areas where nepheloid layers contribute particles of long residence times to the primary flux...|$|E
