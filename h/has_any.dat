5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field <b>has</b> <b>any</b> true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E

5|$|In 1842, {{the young}} Danish {{archaeologist}} J. J. A. Worsaae disagreed the Haraldskær Woman was Gunnhild. A pioneer in archaeological stratigraphy, Worsaae presented evidence the Haraldskær Woman dated from the Iron Age.

Though no one proved the Haraldskær Woman <b>has</b> <b>any</b> royal lineage, her body lies in state in a display in the north transept of Saint Nicolai Church.|$|E
5|$|Leslie is {{approached}} by scouts looking for potential candidates for elected office, {{which has always}} been one of her dreams. Impressed by the memorial service and the harvest festival Leslie previously organized, they believe she would be a good candidate for upcoming city council seats, or possibly the mayoral position. With the expected increased media attention on her personal life, the scouts ask whether Leslie <b>has</b> <b>any</b> secret scandals in her life. She denies any such scandals exist, thus omitting her secret relationship with Ben, and the scouts promise to contact her about preparing an electoral run.|$|E

5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{can be used}} {{to prove}} an isoperimetric {{inequality}} for surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is a non-increasing function of the distance from the origin, such as the paraboloid. On such a surface, the smooth compact set that <b>has</b> <b>any</b> given area and minimum perimeter for that area is necessarily a circle centered at the origin. The proof applies the curve-shortening flow to two curves, a metric circle and the boundary of any other compact set, and compares the change in perimeter of the two curves as they are both reduced to a point by the flow.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, {{citing a}} drop in {{production}} and difficulty servicing significant debt {{as a result of}} the 1998 Mafco transaction, shareholder MacAndrews & Forbes agreed to a debt restructuring arrangement with Panavision's creditors. Private equity firm Cerberus Capital was the lead investor in the deal, which involved a US$140 million reduction in debt and a US$40 million cash infusion. In return the majority shareholder Ronald Perelman was required to relinquish control of Panavision, and he no longer <b>has</b> <b>any</b> equity in the company. In June 2013, its creditors sued over an unpaid debt of $1.7 million, threatening to dissolve the company if they win.|$|E

The Wilsons are African-American {{and all of the other}} characters are white, including the Stephens family: Darrin (Dick Sargent), his wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery), their daughter Tabitha (Erin Murphy), and their son Adam (David Lawrence). Tabitha is glad to be able to spend a few days with Lisa and says they will temporarily be sisters. Darrin is another of Larry's employees at advertising agency McMann and Tate. Darrin is trying to land a million-dollar account from Mr. Brockway (Parley Baer), who owns a toy company. Mr. Brockway visits the Stephens residence unannounced to find out if Darrin <b>has</b> <b>any</b> dark secrets. When Mr. Brockway arrives, Samantha is tending to Adam upstairs, so Lisa answers the door. When Lisa says her father works for McMann and Tate and that she is Tabitha's sister, Mr. Brockway leaves, saying he has seen enough.|$|E
5|$|Krabs' rival {{and former}} best friend Plankton {{operates}} the Chum Bucket, a failing restaurant {{across the street}} from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton's futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer sidekick Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out of fear that Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs also makes it his duty to ensure that the Chum Bucket never <b>has</b> <b>any</b> business whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer <b>has</b> <b>any</b> meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns the key in the system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E

5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about Blois' episcopate comes from his acta, or records; 86 of them survive. There is an early 14th-century {{reference}} to Blois' matricula, which can mean register, list, or list of students, but given the distance in time from when it was recorded to Blois' episcopate, it is unclear what exactly was meant by this. Nor <b>has</b> <b>any</b> such document survived. Blois' acta show him to have been an active and diligent administrator, especially concerned with the establishment of vicarages and with parish care. He also spent time mediating disputes, including one in 1204 over a church at Eynesbury that was disputed between Saer de Quincy, the canons of Newnham Priory and monks of St Neot's Priory. Most of his clerks and household members appear to have been non-relatives, with only another William de Blois, appointed Archdeacon of Buckingham by the bishop before becoming Bishop of Worcester in 1218, being a relative.|$|E
5|$|Opinions {{are divided}} {{as to where}} in {{biological}} evolution consciousness emerged and {{about whether or not}} consciousness <b>has</b> <b>any</b> survival value. It has been argued that consciousness emerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles. Other authors date the origins of consciousness to the first animals with nervous systems or early vertebrates in the Cambrian over 500 million years ago. Donald Griffin suggests in his book Animal Minds a gradual evolution of consciousness. Each of these scenarios raises the question of the possible survival value of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any {{notion that the}} German Empire <b>has</b> <b>any</b> place in dictating the terms of peace. The authors also insist that the German populace must accept some blame for having not resisted the march to war {{on the part of}} the German government. The authors maintain that immediate calls for negotiation would not be favorable, as the German state would potentially dictate the process from a position of diplomatic and military power. Instead, the manifesto proclaims that the war must be continued so that the German state loses its military strength, and by extension, its ability to negotiate.|$|E
