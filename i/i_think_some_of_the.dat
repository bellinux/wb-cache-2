500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, [...] "It's a pretty exhausting record. It's quite dense and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking {{a lot more about}} what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on." ...|$|E
500|$|Somewhat {{overshadowed by}} Henderson's winning goal, was a four-point game by Phil Esposito, two goals and two assists, and {{a hand in}} all three goals of the third period. Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in myself, that I was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{its release}} Brian Lane noted that fans either seem {{to love the}} album or [...] "fucking hate it".

We have to fight and to kill; {{we want to be}} sure that God's blessing is on our fighting and our killing; we have to go into battle; and we want to know that there, too, we are doing God's work, and to be sure that God is on our side." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pleasantest {{people in}} Italy are the army gentlemen.

'Last night <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{people here}} heard some rather new notions, to them, about the true {{relation}} {{of man and}} woman, parent and child, &c.

60|$|Even {{this brief}} outline will show, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{inconsistencies}} and omissions of Pope's train of thought. A careful examination of his arguments in detail would be wholly {{out of place}} here. The reader who wishes to pursue the subject further may consult Warburton's elaborate vindication of Pope's argument, and Elwin's equally prosy refutation, or better still the admirable summary by Leslie Stephen in the chapter on this poem in his life of Pope ('English Men of Letters'). No one is now likely {{to turn to the}} writer of the early eighteenth century for a system of the universe, least of all to a writer so incapable of exact or systematic thinking as Alexander Pope. If the 'Essay on Man' has any claim to be read to-day, it must be as a piece of literature pure and simple. For philosophy and poetry combined, Browning and Tennyson lie nearer to our age and mode of thought than Pope.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} down, sir," [...] {{she said as}} Ned threw {{open the door and}} she entered, still panting from her long run, [...] "to tell you that Cartwright's mill is going to be attacked. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Varley men are {{concerned}} in it. Anyhow, the news has got about in the village. Feyther and Bill are both watched, and could not get away to give you the news; but feyther told me, and I slipped out at the back door and made my way round by the moor, for they have got a guard on the road to prevent any one passing. There is no time to spare, for they were to join a party from Longroyd Bridge, at ten o'clock at the steeple in Sir George Armitage's fields, which ain't more than three miles from the mill. It's half past ten now, but maybe they will be late. I couldn't get away before, and indeed feyther only learned the particulars just as I started. He told me to come straight to you, as you would know what to do. I said, 'Should I go and fetch the troops?' but he said No--it would be sure to be found out who had brought them, and our lives wouldn't be worth having. But I don't mind risking it, sir, if you think that's the best plan." ...|$|E
6000|$|These three tendencies cohere, or are cohering, in an {{institution}} which is not without a great historical basis and not without great modern conveniences. And as France was the standard-bearer of citizenship in 1798, Germany is the standard-bearer of this alternative solution in 1915. The institution which our fathers called Slavery fits in with, or rather logically flows from, all the three spirits of which I have spoken, and promises great advantages to each of them. It can give the individual worker everything except the power to alter the State--that is, his own status. Finality (or what certain eleutheromaniacs would call hopelessness) of status is the soul of Slavery--and of Compulsory Insurance. Then again, Germany gives the individual exactly the liberty {{that has always been}} given to a slave--the liberty to think, the liberty to dream, the liberty to rage; the liberty to indulge in any intellectual hypotheses about the unalterable world and state--such as have always been free to slaves, from the stoical maxims of Epictetus to the skylarking fairy tales of Uncle Remus. And it has been truly urged by all defenders of slavery that, if history has merely a material test, the material condition of the subordinate under slavery tends to be good rather than bad. When I once pointed out how precisely the [...] "model village" [...] of a great employer reproduces the safety and seclusion of an old slave estate, the employer thought it quite enough to answer indignantly that he had provided baths, playing-grounds, a theatre, etc., for his workers. He would probably have thought it odd to hear a planter in South Carolina boast that he had provided banjos, hymn-books, and places suitable for the cake-walk. Yet the planter must have provided the banjos, for a slave cannot own property. And if this Germanic sociology is indeed to prevail among us, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broad-minded thinkers who concur in its prevalence owe something like an apology to many gallant gentlemen whose graves lie where the last battle was fought in the Wilderness; men who had the courage to fight for it, the courage to die for it and, above all, the courage to call it by its name.|$|E
