5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can be <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little light. It {{can be difficult}} to control because it grows fast and spreads over other objects in the tank.|$|E

5|$|The books also aroused controversies in the {{literary}} and publishing worlds. From 1997 to 1998, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won almost all the UK awards <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> children, {{but none of the}} children's book awards <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> adults, and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children. In 1999, the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award children's division was entered {{for the first time on}} the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, Seamus Heaney's translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.|$|E
5|$|The conspiracy, <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> the British Indian Government's own {{evaluation}} at the time, {{and those}} of several contemporary and modern historians, was an important event in the Indian independence movement {{and was one of}} the significant threats faced by the Raj in the second decade of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Walton's {{only other}} opera, The Bear, {{based on a}} comic {{vaudeville}} by Chekhov, is <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> critics as much more successful. It is, however, a one-act piece, a genre not regularly staged at most opera houses, and so is infrequently seen. Operabase records four productions of the piece worldwide between 2013 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|Weber's ideal {{bureaucracy}} is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated {{lines of}} authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) {{on the basis of}} written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> organisations, not by individuals.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> court-appointed psychologists to be competent to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather than be tried separately on each.|$|E

The series features contestants preparing a home-cooked family recipe, while professional chefs Beau MacMillan, Antonia Lofaso and Jeff Henderson {{make the same}} recipe in an upscale restaurant version. The two dishes are then <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> a panel of food critics, who decide the winner. The series premiered on August 23, 2012, and aired its last episode on September 13, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned {{to do at the}} Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has ever been proven.|$|E

5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
