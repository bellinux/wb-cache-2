40|$|AbstractAn <b>electrical</b> <b>method</b> {{to measure}} {{extracellular}} bioelectrical activity in vitro is presented.

Small extracellular voltage variations {{in the order of}} μVs induce through the double-layer capacitor a displacement current that is measured. This current is then enhanced by a gain factor proportional to the electrode capacitance. In addition, when measurements are carried out at low frequencies in current mode the electrode contribution to the noise can be minimized. The performance of the electrodes and the method is demonstrated using zebrafish hearts and glioma cell cultures.

50|$|In {{previous}} research on indoor bioaerosol in residential environments, microorganisms have been quantified by conventional culture-based techniques, in which colony forming units (CFU) on selective media are counted. Cultivating methods have several disadvantages. Culture-based methods are known to underestimate environmental microbial diversity, {{based on the fact}} that only a small percentage of microbes can be cultivated in the laboratory. This underestimation is likely to be signified for the quantification of bioaerosol, since colony counts of airborne microbes are typically quite different from direct counts. Culture-based methods also need relatively long incubation times (over 24 hours) and are labor-intensive. Consequently, culture-based methods are no longer suitable for effective and rapid identification and quantification of bioaerosol, and non-culture based methods, such as immunoassays, molecular biological tests, and optical, and <b>electrical</b> <b>methods,</b> have been developing over the past few decades.|$|E

These approaches can have important implications in clinical and pharmaceutical applications where determination of live and dead bacteria is the rate limiting step. This work was licensed to BioVitesse, Inc. <b>Electrical</b> <b>methods</b> were then applied to the detection of white blood cells with {{the development of a new}} lysate-based impedance spectroscopy (in collaboration with MGH/Harvard during his sabbatical).

The work is the basis of a new startup (Daktari, Inc.) and is being applied to detection of CD4+ white blood cells for the global health and detection of AIDs/HIV infection. Prof. Bashir has continued his impact on development of electrical based biosensors by developing selective nanopore channel sensors which showed that short 18mer single stranded DNA molecules (akin to miRNA molecules) cane detected selectively using Solid State Nanopore Sensors that are functionalized with DNA molecules. This new class of hybrid Nanopore sensors combines the power of solid state devices with exquisite selectivity of biological molecules.|$|E
