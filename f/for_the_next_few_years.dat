5|$|Auden was reintroduced to Christopher Isherwood in 1925 by {{his fellow}} student A. S. T. Fisher. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> Auden sent poems to Isherwood for {{comments}} and criticism; the two maintained a sexual friendship in intervals between {{their relations with}} others. In 1935–39 they collaborated on three plays and a travel book.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with many}} others in the Labour movement, Wilkinson's attitudes were radicalised by the Russian Revolution of 1917. She saw {{communism}} as {{the shape of the}} future, and when the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was formed in the summer of 1920, Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} ILP members with Marxist leanings who became founder members. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> the CPGB was the main focus of her political activity, although she kept her membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted dual CPGB/Labour memberships.|$|E
5|$|Among {{those who}} met with Jinnah to seek his return was Liaquat Ali Khan, who {{would be a major}} {{political}} associate of Jinnah {{in the years to come}} and the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. At Jinnah's request, Liaquat discussed the return with a large number of Muslim politicians and confirmed his recommendation to Jinnah. In early 1934, Jinnah relocated to the subcontinent, though he shuttled between London and India on business <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> selling his house in Hampstead and closing his legal practice in Britain.|$|E

5|$|At Danvers State Hospital Southard met Myrtelle Canavan, {{with whom}} he worked and {{published}} in neuropathology <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> When Canavan received a tempting job offer from the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, in his capacity with the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases, Southard petitioned the board to create a position for her as his assistant, and her salary was {{enough for her to}} refuse the Pennsylvania offer.|$|E
5|$|Neuer {{was born}} in Fremont, Ohio, {{and was one of}} eight {{children}} born to Henry Neuer and Jennie Catherman. He and his family moved to Sunbury, Pennsylvania, when he was a child. In 1898, Neuer enlisted in the Spanish–American War as a private, and was discharged the following year. After his discharge, he worked as a brakeman for a local railroad <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> In late 1904, the Detroit Tigers intended to sign Neuer to a contract. However, nothing came of it and he never played a game with the organization.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the Dalmatian cities <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> but eventually withdrew without major success, as the mountainous terrain and distance were {{not suitable for}} their style of warfare. They pursued Béla IV {{from town to town}} in Dalmatia. The Croatian nobility and Dalmatian towns such as Trogir and Rab helped Béla IV to escape. After this failure, the Mongols retreated and Béla IV rewarded the Croatian towns and nobility. Only the city of Split did not help Béla IV in his escape.|$|E

5|$|A {{cheerleader}} at school, Lawrence {{also played}} softball, field hockey and basketball, which she {{played on a}} boys team that her father coached. She was fond of horseback riding while growing up and frequently visited a local horse farm. She has a damaged coccyx from being thrown off a horse. The actress has said that {{she knew she would}} be famous from an early age. When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina. Her first acting assignment was at the age of nine with the role of a prostitute in a church play based on the Book of Jonah. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.|$|E
5|$|After the Duke’s {{service in}} Malta was over they {{returned}} to England where the family lived <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> They divided their time between Eastwell Park, their country home in Kent, and Clarence House, their residence in London facing Buckingham Palace. Eastwell, a large estate of 2,500 acres near Ashford, with its forest and park was the children's favorite residence. In January 1886, shortly after Princess Victoria turned nine, the family left England when her father was appointed commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean naval squadron, based on Malta. For the next three years, the family lived at the San Anton Palace in Malta, Victoria's birthplace.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wind}} power {{industry}} {{was affected by}} the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050. The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power. In some cases, wind onshore is already the cheapest electric power generation option and costs are continuing to decline. The contracted prices for wind onshore <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> are now as low as 30 USD/MWh.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, {{he found}} work as a factor's clerk in a {{warehouse}} at Horseley Fields, Wolverhampton, until the early 1880s {{when he left the}} warehouse after failing to repay a loan. He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> his whereabouts are not known for certain, but he appears to have lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as pencils and key rings on the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|In 1725, Newton {{was born}} in Wapping, a {{district}} in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, {{and his mother was}} a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1315 or in 1316, Harclay {{was taken}} captive by the Scots, who demanded 2000 marks in ransom. His {{meteoric}} rise {{over the previous}} years had made him some enemies in local society, who now {{took the opportunity to}} spread slanderous rumours about him at court. The king nevertheless helped raise the necessary money to secure Harclay's freedom, but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> he seems to have been out of royal favour. It was not until 1319 that he once more was appointed sheriff, {{and at the same time}} made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles, and Warden of the West Marches. In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was seen}} of Katsura <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> She made 30 {{exhibition}} appearances in 1958, {{and went on}} a one-week exhibition engagement the following year with Harold Worst, but did not compete in any professional tournaments. In 1959, she made two television appearances on ABC's You Asked for It, {{and one on the}} CBS primetime television hit What's My Line?. Katsura returned to competition in 1961, playing a challenge match for the World Three-Cushion title against Worst, then reigning world champion, and was defeated by him. Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter, only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976. She moved back to Japan in about 1990 and died in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Władysław IV owed nominal {{allegiance}} to the Imperial Habsburgs {{as a member of}} the Order of the Golden Fleece. His relationship with the Habsburgs was relatively strong; although he was not above carrying some negotiations with their enemies, like France, he refused Cardinal Richelieu's 1635 proposal of an alliance and a full-out war against them, despite potential lure of territorial gains in Silesia. He realized that such a move would cause much unrest in a heavily Catholic Commonwealth, that he likely lacked the authority and power to push such a change of policy through the Sejm, and that the resulting conflict would be very difficult. From 1636 onward, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> Władysław strengthened his ties with the Habsburgs.|$|E
5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first {{two parts of the}} book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E

5|$|Ifs {{new owner}} was Robert Guinn, of Galaxy Publishing. The change of {{ownership}} was abrupt {{and led to a}} delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not appearing until July 1959. The editor was Horace Gold, who was also the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction; Galaxy had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and If and Galaxy appeared in alternate months <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> In a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with If was to experiment, using new writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science-fiction historian Mike Ashley, the effect was that If became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In 1658, Ottoman {{power was}} {{redirected}} north {{in a campaign}} against George II Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania, which evolved into a long conflict with the Habsburgs. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> the Venetian fleet, again {{under the command of}} Morosini, unsuccessfully attempted to maintain the blockade of the Straits of the Dardanelles. Morosini also resumed his tactic of attacking Ottoman strongholds: a siege of the island of Santa Maura (Lefkada) in August 1658 failed, but in 1659, the Venetians, aided by the Maniots, sacked Kalamata in the Peloponnese, followed by Torone in the Chalcidice, Karystos in Euboea, and Çeşme. However, since Venice could not spare forces to occupy these places, these raids gained the Republic nothing of substance. On the Ottoman side, Köprülü Mehmed ordered the construction of two new forts, Sedd el Bahr ("Rampart of the Sea") and Kilid Bahr ("Key of the Sea"), at the European shore of the entrance of the Dardanelles, to prohibit the Venetians from entering the Straits again.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, in {{the middle}} of the World Series match between two Bay Area {{baseball}} teams, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck and caused widespread infrastructural damage, including the failure of the Bay Bridge, a major link between San Francisco and Oakland. Even so, the Bay Area's technology industry continued to expand and growth in Silicon Valley accelerated that the United States Census confirmed that year that San Jose had overtaken San Francisco in terms of population. The commercialization of the Internet {{in the middle}} of the decade rapidly created a speculative bubble in the high-tech economy known as the Dot-com bubble. This bubble began collapsing in the early 2000s and the industry continued contracting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> nearly wiping out the market. Companies like Amazon.com and Google managed to weather the crash however, and following the industry's return to normalcy, their market value increased significantly.|$|E
