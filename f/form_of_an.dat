40|$|In this thesis, I mainly {{study the}} <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smooth {{projective}} variety over a finite field k and the attached Hasse-Weil zeta functions. I also study the <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scheme. The study begins with understanding {{the relationship between}} etale cohomology and the Hasse-Weil zeta function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smooth projective variety over k. In order to classify <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quasi-projective variety V over a perfect field K, I study nonabelian cohomology and Galois descent to give <b>a</b> proof <b>of</b> the bijection between the equivalence classes of K'/K-forms of V and H 1 (Gal(K'/K), AutK' (V)), where K'/K is some Galois extension. I also present explicitly <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> elliptic curves and their corresponding Hasse-Weil zeta functions. The second part of my thesis is focused on <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scheme, especially in the affine case. This is <b>a</b> generalization <b>of</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variety. I define <b>an</b> etale <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scheme and generalize Milne's definition of the first Cech cohomology <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-abelian sheaf to any (not necessarily abelian) presheaf. I prove there exists an injective map in the affine case from the set of equivalence classes <b>of</b> affine etale <b>forms</b> into the first Cech cohomology <b>of</b> <b>a</b> contravariant functor. I prove that the definition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> etale <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scheme {{is compatible with the}} definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variety over a perfect field. I also prove that the first Galois cohomology can be canonically identified with the first Cech cohomology when the base is Spec k for some perfect, field k...|$|R
