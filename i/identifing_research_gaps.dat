40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} are ideation tools {{and their ability to}} catalyse ideas to address complex design problems. Complex design problems change over time and the interactions among the components of the problem and the interaction between the problem and its environment are of such that the system as a whole cannot be fully understood simply by analyzing its components (Cilliers 1998, pp. I). Ideation for this research is defined as a process of generating, developing and communicating ideas that are critical to the design process (Broadbent, in Fowles 1979, pp. 15). Based on Karni and Arciszewski, who stated that ideation tools should act more like an observer or suggester rather than controller or an expert, I defne design ideation tools as tools or methods that enhance, increase and improve the user's ability to generate ideas with the client (Karni and Arciszewski 1997; Reineg and Briggs 2007). Based on a survey of over 70 ideation tools, protocol analysis of design activities, a web survey and semistructured interviews, I conclude that designers and clients may not have sufficient knowledge of ideation or ideation tools in either testing or practice as a catalyst for generating possibilities and that measuring ideation tools based on how many ideas they generate is misleading because it relates creativity and idea generation but does not adequately reflect the participants' experience. This research suggests that participants' cultural perceptions of design ideation and the design process actively inhibit idea generation and that a shift from design outcome led ideation tool design to designing ideation tools that engage design contexts are necessary to effectively address complex design problems. This <b>research</b> <b>identifed</b> a <b>gap</b> in ideation tools for designers to collaborate with their clients during the ideation phase to catalyse possibilities to complex design problems as the contribution to new knowledge.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} research propositions that can potentially fill <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the literature of environmental scanning. Major databases such as ABI/INFORM, and Emerald have been searched to gather literature. The literature on environmental scanning is reviewed with an aim to identify patterns in scanning practices as well as <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the extant literature. Three major phases of the development and three main characteristics of the literature have been identified. Four propositions are suggested to fill the <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the literature of the environmental scanning practices; namely, firm characteristics, market orientation, and top management cognition perspective. Further empirical research is needed to test the four propositions in order to provide a full picture for the environmental scanning literature. The contributions of this paper are: 1) the revelation of the evolution of the environmental scanning literature; 2) the identification of <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the environmental scanning literature; 3) the establishment of propositions through which future research can further the knowledge of environmental scanning. <br /...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Dietary Goals for the United States were {{introduced}} in 1977 and have been followed by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) every 5 years from 1980 to 2010. The DGA provide science-based advice to promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases through diet and physical activity. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees are charged to provide updates of the DGA topics using the best available science. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees' reports also identified 169 <b>research</b> <b>gaps.</b> To date, these gaps have not been compiled and assessed. We evaluated trends in number, topics, and specificity of <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> by year by placing them in the following topic categories: general, chronic diseases/conditions, diet/diet pattern, food/ingredient, and nutrient-specific <b>research</b> <b>gaps.</b> Some <b>research</b> topics (eg, sodium and hypertension and appropriate uses of DGA) have been identified consistently across the years, some emerged in later years (eg, increasingly specific <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> between dietary fatty acids and cardiovascular disease), and others appeared intermittently (eg, relationships between dietary components and cancer). These results are {{a call to action}} for all DGA stakeholders to have an immediate dialogue about how the research enterprise can best address critical research needs in a timely way to support public policy...|$|R

The literature on born global, available in major databases such as ABI/INFORM, Ebscohost and Emerald, has been reviewed with an aim to study born global firms’ behaviour and identify the <b>research</b> <b>gaps.</b> A conceptual model with the entrepreneurial cognition and motivation as the antecedents of entrepreneurial behaviour has been established, and nine research propositions are suggested to fill the <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the literature. This study contributes in three major ways. First, it integrates the key theoretical paradigms and establishes their relationships with born global firms’ behaviours. Second, it identifies the <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> and develops a conceptual model. Third, it shows the critical factors required for the success of born global firms. Future research is recommended to empirically test the proposed model and to determine the validity of this model...|$|R

The paper initially provides a theoretical investigation identifying the <b>research</b> <b>gap</b> within the literature. The <b>research</b> <b>gap</b> further is explored through an empirical research. Research findings derive from the analysis of 11 in-depth interviews taken from a new media consultancy in UK. Moreover, the findings distinctively support that, staff resistance is beyond previously (traditional) assumed polar distinctions. In that way, the investigation illustrates that, staff resistance combines opposing meanings of their actions. Thus, it is revealed new aspects of employees resistance within the case organization, a knowledge intensive firm (KIF) ...|$|R
