5000|$|A {{catadioptric}} {{optical system}} {{is one where}} refraction and reflection are combined in an optical system, usually via lenses (<b>dioptrics)</b> and curved mirrors (catoptrics). Catadioptric combinations are used in focusing systems such as search lights, headlamps, early lighthouse focusing systems, optical telescopes, microscopes, and telephoto lenses. Other optical systems that use lenses and mirrors are {{also referred to as}} [...] "catadioptric" [...] such as surveillance catadioptric sensors.|$|E
50|$|His {{research}} in this regard was based on theoretical investigations in <b>dioptrics</b> conducted on the so-called Burning Sphere (al-Kura al-muhriqa) {{in the tradition of}} Ibn Sahl (d. ca. 1000) and Ibn al-Haytham (d. ca. 1041) after him. As he noted in his Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir (The Revision of the Optics), Farisi used a large clear vessel of glass {{in the shape of a}} sphere, which was filled with water, in order to have an experimental large-scale model of a rain drop. He then placed this model within a camera obscura that has a controlled aperture for the introduction of light. He projected light unto the sphere and ultimately deducted through several trials and detailed observations of reflections and refractions of light that the colors of the rainbow are phenomena of the decomposition of light. His research had resonances with the studies of his contemporary Theodoric of Freiberg (without any contacts between them; even though they both relied on Ibn al-Haytham's legacy), and later with the experiments of Descartes and Newton in <b>dioptrics</b> (for instance, Newton conducted a similar experiment at Trinity College, though using a prism rather than a sphere).|$|E
5000|$|The {{difference}} between the near-sighted and far-sighted people was noted already by Aristotle. Graeco-Roman physician Galen first used the term [...] "myopia" [...] for near-sightedness. Johannes Kepler in his Clarification of Ophthalmic <b>Dioptrics</b> (1604) first demonstrated that near-sightedness {{was due to the}} incident light focusing in front of the retina. Kepler also showed that near-sightedness could be corrected by concave lenses. In 1632 Vopiscus Fortunatus Plempius examined a myopic eye and confirmed that myopia was due to a lengthening of its axial diameter.|$|E
5000|$|In Part V of the , Bacon {{discusses}} {{physiology of}} eyesight and {{the anatomy of}} the eye and the brain, considering light, distance, position, and size, direct and reflected vision, refraction, mirrors, and lenses. His treatment was primarily oriented by the Latin translation of Alhazen's Book of Optics. He also draws heavily on Eugene of Palermo's Latin translation of the Arabic translation of Ptolemy's Optics; on Robert Grosseteste's work based on Al-Kindi's Optics; [...] and, through Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), on Ibn Sahl's work on <b>dioptrics.</b>|$|E

50|$|Despite {{frequent}} moves, {{he wrote}} all his major work during his 20+ {{years in the}} Netherlands, where he managed to revolutionize mathematics and philosophy. In 1633, Galileo was condemned by the Catholic Church, and Descartes abandoned plans to publish Treatise on the World, his work of the previous four years. Nevertheless, in 1637 he published part of this work in three essays: Les Météores (The Meteors), La Dioptrique (<b>Dioptrics)</b> and La Géométrie (Geometry), preceded by an introduction, his famous Discours de la méthode (Discourse on the Method). In it, Descartes lays out four rules of thought, meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation.|$|E
50|$|He knew Descartes from La Flèche, {{where for}} some of the time he {{supervised}} Descartes's studies as principal prefect. Later, Descartes found him sympathetic enough to use as a sounding board, and potential intermediary with Pierre Bourdin, another Jesuit and critic of the <b>Dioptrics.</b> A letter to Dinet in 1642 attacked both Bourdin and Gisbertus Voetius, an opponent at the University of Utrecht. The letter also set out his position in relation to scholastic philosophy. By including it in the second edition of his Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes raised the stakes in these fights. At that time Dinet was in a position of influence, as Jesuit provincial in Paris, for the Île-de-France.|$|E
5000|$|In 1870-71 Dudgeon wrote {{notes on}} the <b>Dioptrics</b> of Vision (1871), and invented {{spectacles}} for use under water, intended to correct refraction. Original but unaccepted views which he held on the accommodation of the eye, and described to the International Medical Congress, were published in The Human Eye: its Optical Construction popularly explained (1878). In 1878 he obtained a Pond's sphygmograph, {{and with the help}} of J. Gauter he made a pocket instrument for registering the pulse. He published an account of it in The Sphygmograph: its history and use as an aid to diagnosis in ordinary practice (1882), and the device became known as the [...] "Dudgeon sphygmograph". The approach was later adapted, and integrated with a recorder, by Sir James Mackenzie.|$|E
5000|$|The {{publication}} of Opticks represented a major contribution to science, different from {{but in some}} ways rivalling the Principia. Opticks is largely a record of experiments and the deductions made from them, covering a wide range of topics in what was later to be known as physical optics. That is, this work is not a geometric discussion of catoptrics or <b>dioptrics,</b> the traditional subjects of reflection of light by mirrors of different shapes and the exploration of how light is [...] "bent" [...] as it passes from one medium, such as air, into another, such as water or glass. Rather, the Opticks is a study of the nature of light and colour and the various phenomena of diffraction, which Newton called the [...] "inflexion" [...] of light.|$|E
5000|$|The {{duty of the}} man who {{investigates the}} {{writings}} of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and ... attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency. Alhazen An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (i'tibar)(Arabic: إعتبار) and controlled testing in his scientific inquiries. Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (ilm tabi'i) with mathematics (ta'alim; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in Kitab al-Manazir (The Optics; De aspectibus or Perspectivae) and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and <b>dioptrics</b> (the study of the reflection and refraction of light, respectively).|$|E

At the time he didn't think it was important enough to spend his time on.

50|$|La {{perspective}} curieuse, {{a richly}} illustrated manual on perspective, revealed {{for the first}} time the secrets of anamorphosis and trompe l'oeil. It contained the first published reference to Descartes's derivation of the law of refraction. First published in 1638 with 25 plates, Nicéron's work was enlarged by Roberval and republished in 1663, along with the first edition, posthumously published, of a scholarly work on optics and catoptrics by Mersenne (1588 - 1648). In the original work, Nicéron concentrated primarily on the practical applications of perspective, catoptrics, and <b>dioptrics,</b> and on the illusory effects of optics, then traditionally associated with natural magic. The work's first book (out of four) presents briefly the fundamental geometrical theorems and then develops a general method of perspective, borrowing heavily from Alberti and Dürer. The second book addresses the problem of establishing perspective for paintings executed on curved or irregular surfaces, like vaults and niches, and presents the general technique of anamorphosis. Here Nicéron shows, for example, how to construct on the interior surface of a cone a distorted image that, when viewed from the end through the base, appears in proper proportion. Book three discusses and explains the anamorphosis of figures that are viewed by reflection from plane, cylindrical, and conical mirrors. Book four deals with the distortions created by refraction. The added work on optics by Mersenne contained the author's final contributions to optics, including experimental studies of visual acuity and binocular vision and a critical discussion of contemporary hypotheses on the nature of light.|$|E

40|$|In 1690, Christiaan Huygens (1629 - 1695) {{published}} Traité de la Lumière, containing his renowned wave {{theory of}} light. It {{is considered a}} landmark in seventeenth-century science, for the way Huygens mathematized the corpuscular nature of light and his probabilistic conception of nature knowledge. This book discusses the development of Huygens' wave theory, reconstructing the winding road that eventually led to Traité de la Lumière. For the first time, {{the full range of}} manuscript sources is taken into account. In addition, the development of Huygens' thinking on the nature of light is put in the context of his optics as a whole, which was dominated by his lifelong pursuit of theoretical and practical <b>dioptrics.</b> In so doing, this book offers the first account on the development of Huygens' mathematical analysis of lenses and telescopes and its significance for the origin of the wave theory of light. As Huygens applied his mathematical proficiency to practical issues pertaining to telescopes - including trying to design a perfect telescope by means of mathematical theory - his <b>dioptrics</b> is significant for our understanding of seventeenth-century relations between theory and practice. With this full account of Huygens' optics, this book sheds new light on the history of seventeenth-century optics {{and the rise of the}} new mathematical sciences, as well as Huygens' oeuvre as a whole. Students of the history of optics, of early mathematical physics, and the Scientific Revolution, will find this book enlightening...|$|E
