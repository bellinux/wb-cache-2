We have calculated rates for electron capture <b>on</b> <b>nuclei</b> with mass numbers A= 65 - 112 for the temperatures and densities appropriate for core collapse.

This leads to significant changes in core collapse simulations. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, REVTeX...|$|R

40|$|Total beam {{lifetime}} {{consists of}} two components: the residual-gas-scattering lifetime and Touschek lifetime. The residual-gas lifetime is comprised of the elastic and inelastic scattering on electrons and elastic and inelastic scattering <b>on</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Touschek scattering involves scattering of particles within the bunch. One usually calculates only the elastic scattering <b>on</b> <b>nuclei</b> (single Coulomb scattering) and inelastic scattering <b>on</b> <b>nuclei</b> (bremsstrahlung) of the residual-gas-scattering lifetime component. Experience gained from computing the beam lifetime in the Advanced Photon Source (APS) storage ring shows that the electron scattering should not be neglected, particularly the inelastic contribution. Given the measured quantities from the APS storage ring, one can compare theoretical predictions with experimental results. Uncertainties in calculating the various contributions to lifetime will be discussed...|$|R
