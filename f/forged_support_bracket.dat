Junglefy were also responsible for fabrication, assembly and installation of Blanc’s vertical garden, ensuring it met Australian building standards and was integrated into the 28-month building program, including the installation of the <b>support</b> <b>brackets,</b> frames, sheeting, irrigation, felt and plants. Junglefy continue to be responsible for the ongoing maintenance and plant health of the entire site, much of this work is completed via a swing stage regularly checking on structure, plant health, pests and diseases as well as pruning and removal of rubbish.|$|R
25|$|Drum mounts are fittings, {{normally}} {{attached to}} the drum shell, that enable a drum to be attached to a <b>supporting</b> <b>bracket,</b> stand or rack. Traditionally, smaller tom-tom drums are supported by mounts and known as hanging toms, while snare drums rest on a stand not {{attached to the}} drum, and floor toms and bass drums rest on their own legs.|$|R
50|$|The slab lifter uses two safety devices. Safety {{chains and}} a <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> allow safe lifting of large slabs. This lifting {{appliance}} {{also has a}} safety locking device that is engaged when the gripping pads are activated {{by the weight of}} the stone. This prevents any jerking movement from releasing the stone. It is easily disengaged once the slab is secured at its destination.|$|R
50|$|A {{floating}} shelf {{is designed}} to fit within a minimalist decor by hiding the <b>supporting</b> <b>brackets</b> within the shelf. The shelf has at least two symmetrical channels into which slide brackets attached to the wall. Screws are inserted through {{the bottom of the}} shelf to hold it on the brackets. Though usually constructed of light-weight material such as MDF and laminated, these shelves can often hold considerable weight.|$|R
50|$|Adjustable {{shelving}} allows {{more flexible}} use of shelves to hold items of value for storage, display or sale. Like fixed shelves, the horizontal planes are normally made of strong {{materials such as}} wood or steel (occasionally glass or other materials), but their exact vertical positioning can be varied - usually {{through the use of}} uprights into which <b>supporting</b> <b>brackets</b> or the shelves themselves can be fixed at different heights.|$|R

50|$|The Linebarger House is a {{historic}} house at 606 West Central Avenue in Bentonville, Arkansas. This two-story Craftsman-style house was built in 1920 by C. A. Linebarger, {{one of the principal}} developers of the Bella Vista resort area north of Bentonville. As one of the first Craftsman houses built, it {{played a significant role in}} popularizing the style in the region, with a deep porch whose roof is supported by stone porch piers, wide eaves with decorative <b>supporting</b> <b>brackets,</b> and exposed rafter tails.|$|R
50|$|One {{edge of the}} {{expansion}} card holds the contacts (the edge connector or pin header) that fit into the slot. They establish the electrical contact between the electronics on the card and on the motherboard. Peripheral expansion cards generally have connectors for external cables. In the PC-compatible personal computer, these were located in the <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> {{at the back of}} the cabinet. Industrial backplane systems had connectors mounted on the top edge of the card, opposite to the backplane pins.|$|R
50|$|A feature {{which was}} to be {{followed}} for all subsequent SAR locomotives was their relatively large firegrate area of 37 sq ft. The round-topped firebox had flexible stays fitted in the breaking zones. Three <b>support</b> <b>brackets</b> tied the boiler barrel to the main bar frames. As far as practicable, mountings were fixed to a steam stand on the firebox top and fitted with extensions to the spindles to carry the handles inside the cab, within easy reach of the enginemen.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to {{the process}} feature of the coke dry {{quenching}} (CDQ), the factors of the destructive mechanism that influence the sequence function properties of the brick were analyzed. The countermeasures have been adopted for the defects of the bricks for CDQ, such as inferior thermal shock stability and short lifetime, etc. In order to search the effect of thermal expansion stress and mechanical load stress on the CDQ, the temperature field and stress field of the flue in the CDQ were analyzed according to the thermal elastic and plastic theory. The Drucker-Prager plasticity model combined with a tension cut-off criterion was described material behavior. All material properties were taken as temperature dependent. The result indicates that the <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> under high gradient temperature will bring on the highest thermal stress, which {{is the main reason}} of fracture of the <b>support</b> <b>bracket.</b> The cycling temperature has the ability to cause repeated crack propagation throughout the whole service period. To solve this problem, the design of the structure, the method of the heat exchange and the properties of the materials will be improved. The obtained results give a good insight into the reasons of material failure and help to find counter-measures for prolonging the lifetime of CDQ...|$|R

50|$|In March 1999, {{concrete}} slabs forming {{the ceiling of}} the tunnel beneath Government Center fell onto the westbound lanes of Interstate 195, causing a six-vehicle accident in which a minivan overturned. Amazingly nobody was killed in the incident which was later determine to have resulted from corrosion of the <b>support</b> <b>brackets</b> which held the {{concrete slabs}}. As a result, state highway officials ordered the immediate removal of all the concrete ceiling slabs beneath Government Center. This however, left the underside of the building vulnerable to fire, {{in the event of an}} accident within the tunnel.|$|R
