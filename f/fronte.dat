5|$|The Zara {{garrison}} numbered about 9,000 {{men under}} the overall command of Generale di Brigata (Brigadier) Emilio Giglioli. The garrison {{consisted of two}} main groupings {{and an assortment of}} supporting units. The two main groupings were the regimental-sized <b>Fronte</b> a Terra (Land Front), which comprised three static machine gun battalions and a bicycle-mounted Bersaglieri battalion, and the battalion-strength <b>Fronte</b> a Mare (Sea Front), which consisted of two machine gun companies, an anti-aircraft battery, a coastal artillery battery and a naval artillery battery. Supporting units consisted of an artillery regiment of three battalions, two independent artillery battalions, a machine gun battalion, a motorised anti-aircraft battalion (less one battery), an engineer battalion, a company of Blackshirts, and a company of L3/35 tankettes.|$|E
25|$|Suzuki was {{the first}} company to offer a kei car in 1955. One {{interesting}} departure from other Kei cars was the <b>Fronte</b> Coupé introduced in September 1971. It was a 2+2 (or a strict 2-seater) Giugiaro-designed mini GT based on the rear-engine Suzuki <b>Fronte,</b> measuring a mere 2,995mm. It used a 359cc two-stroke engine developing 31, 34 or 37hp (35 in later models) depending on equipment level. The <b>Fronte</b> Coupé was discontinued in June, 1976, as it didn't suit the new Kei Jidosha limits, nor the stricter emissions regulations.|$|E
25|$|The new <b>Fronte</b> was a {{big step}} away from the SS20, making the switch from a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive {{configuration}} to a more up-to-date transversely mounted engine in front, driving the front wheels. Wheelbase was increased from 2030 to 2150mm and the new car was much more spacious. The four-door <b>Fronte</b> had an opening rear glass window, whereas the two-door Alto got a proper rear hatch. In some export markets the car was just known as the Suzuki SS40. In Europe, the <b>Fronte</b> (labelled Alto) was also sold with a 796cc four-stroke three (SS80) from July 1981 and was 100mm longer, thanks to bigger bumpers. These cars also received larger 12-inch wheels. Four-doors received the SS80F chassis code, while three-door passenger versions were called SS80G.|$|E
25|$|After a {{hiatus of}} over a year, Suzuki {{returned}} to the sports minicar market with the new Cervo in October 1977. The SS20 Cervo was mainly a JDM model (although it was also sold as a LHD in Chile) with a 539cc three-cylinder, two-stroke engine. The SS20 used the chassis from the 1976 <b>Fronte</b> 7-S, but was equipped with the larger T5A engine (this was the rear-mounted version of the LJ50 used in the Jimny and <b>Fronte</b> Hatch, {{also known as the}} T5B in the FF Alto/Fronte). The body was based on the Giugiaro designed <b>Fronte</b> Coupé, but with a bulge in the front and bigger bumpers which led to the loss of some of the original's grace. Instead of square headlights, the Cervo received round items. The new rear glass hatch added convenience.|$|E
25|$|And then, {{only six}} months later, Suzuki's longest running {{nameplate}} was laid to rest. When Japanese tax laws for vehicles in the kei class were changed in April 1989, kei commercial vehicles were no longer quite as favored as before. But, since the Alto had long had a much larger market share than the <b>Fronte,</b> {{it was decided to}} drop the <b>Fronte</b> name and focus marketing efforts on the Alto, which now became available as a five-door and three-door sedan as well as a three-door van. With the 796cc engine, the CN11S <b>Fronte</b> was built in China as the Anchi 6330. The CN11 was never exported to Europe, as they received the Cervo Mode (labelled as an Alto) instead. However, South Korea's Daewoo built the car under license as the Tico, and this model saw a great deal of sales particularly in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|By July 1969 a three-door wagon version {{intended}} for private use arrived, the LS11 Suzuki <b>Fronte</b> Estate, to give passenger car buyers a model with more luggage room without {{the indignity of}} having to buy a commercial vehicle. The Estate had the same top-hinged rear opening, but featured a more comfortable, while still folding, rear seat. There was also a folding luggage shelf in the trunk. Sops to safety, already somewhat better than the regular <b>Fronte</b> because of the engine location and the driver's seat being located farther back, included an anti-glare dashboard and a round horn pad in the steering wheel.|$|E
25|$|Another famous Turkish film {{director}} is Ferzan Özpetek, whose films like Hamam (1997), Harem suaré (1999), Le Fate Ignoranti (2001), La finestra di <b>fronte</b> (2003), Cuore Sacro (2005) and Saturno contro (2007) won him international fame and awards. The film La finestra di <b>fronte</b> (2003) was particularly successful, winning the Best Film and Scholars Jury awards at the 2003 David di Donatello Awards, the Crystal Globe and Best Director awards at the 2003 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the 2003 Silver Ribbon for Best Original Story from the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists, the Festival Prize at the 2004 Foyle Film Festival, the Audience Award at the 2004 Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival, and the Canvas Audience Award at the 2004 Flanders International Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|Some Italian civilians {{participated in}} the Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia until 1943, like Rosa Dainelli. This Italian doctor {{was a woman who}} became {{an active member of the}} <b>Fronte</b> di Resistenza (Front of Resistance), an Italian {{organization}} which fought the Allies in a guerrilla war from December 1941 until summer of 1943.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 several {{parties and}} {{individuals}} abandoned the BNG. Encontro Irmandiño abandoned the bloc and joined with <b>Fronte</b> Obreira Galega, the FPG, Movemento pola Base and other collectives to form Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood. Anova obtained 9 {{seats in the}} 2012 Galician election {{as part of the}} Galician Left Alternative coalition. BNG obtained 7 seats and PPdG won the elections again.|$|E
25|$|The Suzuki Cervo is a kei car {{manufactured}} by Suzuki Motor Corporation. Introduced in 1976 as {{the successor to}} the Suzuki <b>Fronte</b> Coupé, the Cervo name was originally affixed to a kei sports coupe, and then to models derived from the Suzuki Alto. The nameplate was retired between 1998 and 2006, and again in March 2010, {{although it may be}} revived for the Indian market in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The crown {{is at his}} feet, and {{on either}} side the step is lined with two levels of text. The left hand upper line reads VITA SINE MORTE IN CAPITE ("Life without death on his head"), that on the right LUVENTUS SINE SENECTUTE IN <b>FRONTE</b> ("Youth without age on his forehead"). These are placed above—on {{the left and right}} respectively—the words GAUDIUM SINE MERORE A DEXTRIS ("Joy without sorrow on his right side") and SECURITAS SINE TIMORE A SINISTRIS ("Safety without fear on his left side").|$|E
25|$|The LC10 was {{introduced}} with great fanfare {{and a large}} marketing campaign, which included television commercials. First reaching dealerships on 27 May 1967, market response was immediate and strong. While the original target production was 3000 per month, this was soon nearly tripled. Monthly production remained above 8000 {{until the end of}} the LC10's life. A new, additional factory in Iwata was opened in August 1967 to add supplementary capacity. While in overall a fairly simple and light car, the triple carburettors were awkwardly located at the front of the engine, behind the rear seat. To adjust them, a mechanic would have to reach through a small egg-shaped opening from the rear seat. Another complaint touched on the car's near absence of luggage space. The rear lights and the front indicators used the same lenses, only of different colors. There was even a brochure made of a US-market <b>Fronte</b> 360, complete with miles-per-hour speedo and uncovered sealed-beam headlights, but most likely none were brought over. The <b>Fronte</b> soon received a very minor update reflecting stricter safety laws; as of October 1968 it sported a driver's side integrated headrest, seat belts up front, and turn signal flashers on all four corners.|$|E
25|$|Other {{noteworthy}} recent Italian films include: Jona che visse nella balena {{directed by}} Roberto Faenza, Il grande cocomero by Francesca Archibugi, The Profession of Arms (Il mestiere delle armi) by Olmi, L'ora di religione by Marco Bellocchio, Il ladro di bambini, Lamerica, The Keys to the House (Le chiavi di casa) by Gianni Amelio, I'm Not Scared (Io non ho paura) by Gabriele Salvatores, Le fate ignoranti, Facing Windows (La finestra di <b>fronte)</b> by Ferzan Özpetek, Good Morning, Night (Buongiorno, notte) by Ferzan Özpetek, The Best of Youth (La meglio gioventù) by Marco Tullio Giordana, The Beast in the Heart (La bestia nel cuore) by Cristina Comencini.|$|E
25|$|After a {{classical}} education, Giovanni studied {{law at the}} University of Palermo following {{a brief period of}} study at Livorno's naval academy. Falcone and Borsellino met again at Palermo University. While Falcone drifted away from his parents' middle-class conservative Catholicism towards Communism, Borsellino was religious and conservative; in his youth he {{had been a member of}} the <b>Fronte</b> Universitario d'Azione Nazionale (FUAN), a right-wing university organisation affiliated with the neo-fascist Movimento Sociale Italiano. However, neither ever joined a political party, and although the ideologies of their political movements were diametrically opposed, they shared a history of opposing the Mafia. Their different political leanings did not thwart their friendship. Falcone wanted a naval career but his father thought him too independent-minded for the armed forces, and sent him to study law.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting new Kei car rules, in July 1976 {{the length}} of the Hatch was {{extended}} to 3190mm (wheelbase to 2100mm), all ahead of the firewall. The new front and new large bumpers made what was an already odd-looking car even stranger. Now the Suzuki <b>Fronte</b> Hatch 55 (or 550), it received the three-cylinder 539cc LJ50 engine, which was a de-smogged L50 engine with an extra cylinder tacked on: it was also known as the T5A/T5B in other applications. The new model code was SH10. The inside remained nearly unchanged and the only differences at the rear was a new, larger bumper, and the change to a single strut for the rear gate for increased access. Power remained 25PS as per late 360 Hatches, but torque was up considerably. The lineup was again restricted to B, D, and T models, with the T receiving chromed rather than painted bumpers.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} was a project begun by General Motors as the M-car. When {{they realized that}} the project {{was not going to}} be profitable enough, the entire unfinished design was sold to Suzuki in return for a five per cent stake in the company. Suzuki completed the design and development work and put the car on sale from October 1983 in the Japanese market, as the Cultus. This is also why the car's design was such a natural fit in the General Motors lineup, with a clear GM corporate look. The model was also exported worldwide by Suzuki and assembled by a number of General Motors franchises, often undergoing badge engineering. The first-generation Swifts all share the SA model code prefix and was Suzuki's first earnest entry into a class of car with larger dimensions and engines than of the kei class Suzuki <b>Fronte.</b> Three- and four-cylinder versions of the G engine family were available, although some secondary markets installed Suzuki's one-liter four-cylinder F10A engine in a model which carries the SA410 chassis code.|$|E
25|$|A big {{first for}} Suzuki was the {{availability}} of a four-door version, lagging behind competing offerings from Daihatsu, Subaru, and Honda. Between the two engines, two bodystyles and several different equipment levels, a confusingly large lineup was on offer: two-door GU, GD, GH, GC, GT, GT type II, and four-door FU, FD, FH, FC, FT. In July 1974 the 37hp GT engine was downgraded to 35PS, while the 34PS version was replaced by a 32PS unit. The lowest powered 32 and 34 PS models had single Solex carburetors rather than the triple units used on more powerful models. Later on, the range was rationalized and the models renamed Standard, Deluxe, and Custom. The LC20 was taken out of production in May 1976, although the doors and basic layout would continue in use for the succeeding SS10 (<b>Fronte</b> 7-S) series. The LC20 also entered CKD production in Indonesia, with Suzuki's local partner PT Indohero, in 1976. It, along with the ST10 Carry, was the first four-wheeled Suzuki built there. It was only built there for about a year, soon being replaced by the new SS20.|$|E
500|$|Later, Vizzini {{represented}} the <b>Fronte</b> Democratico d’Ordine Siciliano, a satellite political {{organization of the}} separatist movement. The <b>Fronte</b> Democratico demonstrated the Mafia's hesitation to fully commit to the MIS. The <b>Fronte</b> was popular {{on the island and}} advocated independence of Sicily under American influence. Although the Americans strongly emphasized that the United States did not want Sicily as the 49th state, in late 1944, some claimed that the Fronte's ideas were the result of American propaganda that had encouraged separatism prior to the invasion. <b>Fronte</b> leaders spread rumours that they had the backing and protection of the United States. Many of its members were [...] "lieutenants in the high Mafia" [...] and Vizzini was considered its leader.|$|E
500|$|The Pont du Gard was {{constructed}} largely {{without the use}} of mortar or clamps. It contains an estimated 50,400 tons of limestone with a volume of some some of the individual blocks weigh up to 6 tons. Most of the stone was extracted from the local quarry of Estel located approximately [...] downstream, {{on the banks of the}} Gardon River. The coarse-grained soft reddish [...] shelly limestone, [...] known locally as [...] "Pierre de Vers", [...] lends itself very well to dimension stone production. The blocks were precisely cut to fit perfectly together by friction alone, eliminating the need for mortar. The builders also left inscriptions on the stonework conveying various messages and instructions. Many blocks were numbered and inscribed with the required locations, such as <b>fronte</b> dextra or <b>fronte</b> sinistra (front right or front left), to guide the builders.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1979 the <b>Fronte</b> 7-S was {{replaced}} by the new SS30/SS40 <b>Fronte.</b> The <b>Fronte</b> Hatch 55 was also discontinued, from now on the commercial versions all used the Alto name. Alto also came to be the name used in export markets. SS30S was the two-stroke engined version of the <b>Fronte</b> (539 cc, three cylinders, [...] T5B) while the SS40S received a newly developed, 543cc four-stroke three-cylinder engine, the F5A. This developed [...] and proved very popular, soon displacing the two-stroke entirely. The T5B would no longer be available in the <b>Fronte</b> after May 1981. The Alto light commercials received the SS30V/SS40V designation, and considerably lower gearing since it was mainly intended for short distance inner-city use. Both the Alto and <b>Fronte</b> had a claimed top speed of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Fronte</b> Coupé {{was simply}} {{referred}} to as the Suzuki LC10W in export markets, where it received a [...] 356cc engine. The <b>Fronte</b> Coupé was resurrected in a revised and larger form as the Suzuki Cervo in October 1977, after Kei car regulations were changed in January 1976.|$|E
2500|$|By November 1971, after a minor {{facelift}} {{including a}} new grille, the cars were called Suzuki <b>Fronte</b> 72. The sporty air-cooled engines were dropped as the more refined water-cooled units {{became more and more}} popular, except in the very lowest end of the market. In March 1972, water-cooled GD-W (deLuxe) and GU-W (standard) were added. In export markets, there was the Suzuki <b>Fronte</b> 500 with the 475cc LC50 engine, also marketed as the Suzuki LC50 (29PS, 115km/h). In October 1972 the <b>Fronte</b> 72 was replaced by the [...] "New Fronte" [...] (with a new fascia and bonnet). By this time, only the Standard model ("U") retained the air-cooled engine, with an available automatic clutch. The top-of-the-line [...] "GT-W Type II" [...] came equipped with front disc brakes, as does its sister model the <b>Fronte</b> Coupé GXCF.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1984 the new <b>Fronte</b> CB71 was introduced. Now {{only with}} the F5A {{four-stroke}} engine, it retained the suspension of the SS40 model (leaf sprung, beam axle). The <b>Fronte</b> was now a full five-door hatchback, on a wheelbase extended to [...] Only the 543cc F5A engine was available, with the power output back up to [...] at 6000rpm. The most expensive model, the FG, received front disc brakes (the lesser versions making do with drums all around) and a 5-speed manual transmission or 2-speed automatic. As before, the <b>Fronte</b> received higher gearing than the Alto, reflecting its intended usage. Top speed was , 2 more km/h than the Alto.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1988, the new CN11S <b>Fronte</b> debuted. The {{previous}} generation {{was not as}} roomy as the competition due to its comparably short wheelbase, but the new version addressed this issue by having it stretched out by [...] to [...] A sleeker looking body, with rear side windows that wrapped {{around the edge of}} the roof, also helped sales. Apart from the very cheapest variants, the <b>Fronte</b> got front disc brakes and 12inch radial tyres. The <b>Fronte</b> also received the 547cc 12-valve SOHC F5B engine from the Suzuki Cervo, developing [...] at a lively 7500rpm. There was no three-door version this time, but a 4WD variant (CP11) was available.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1972 the <b>Fronte</b> Van {{received}} the two-cylinder, two-stroke water-cooled 28hp L50 engine {{also used in}} the Suzuki Carry, becoming the LS20 in the process. A new grille gave away the changes underneath the skin, as did prominent [...] "Water Cooled" [...] badges on the rear. Aside from the engine, the most important change was that the rear lid was now once again a top-hinged single-piece unit. As before, Standard, DeLuxe, and Super DeLuxe versions were available. The <b>Fronte</b> Van was replaced in April 1973 by the strange-looking <b>Fronte</b> Hatch. Just under 28,000 of the LS20 Van {{were built in the}} thirteen months it was in production.|$|E
2500|$|A {{slightly}} longer and wider version (bigger bumpered), {{equipped with the}} same 796cc engine as the SS80, producing [...] was the export model.

The facelifted <b>Fronte</b> has also been produced (or still is being built) under license by many other manufacturers: ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1970 the Estate {{model was}} succeeded by the Suzuki <b>Fronte</b> Custom. The Custom {{had the same}} wagon body style but lacked a top opening at the rear. While it {{received}} a new grille it came with a downwards opening trunk lid only, possibly to please the private customer who found the luggage room in the rear-engined <b>Fronte</b> too small by disguising {{the fact that a}} wagon (not popular in Japan in those days) was involved. Thus, the <b>Fronte</b> Custom became one of only two wagons ever without a bottom to top back opening, the other being the 1941-42 Chrysler Town and Country (The Austin A40 Farina had a similar layout but was marketed as a sedan in that form). A more luxurious and powerful ( [...] , 110km/h) Hi-Custom version was added two months later, but the entire Custom range was deleted in 1971. Also in 1971 the <b>Fronte</b> Van received a minor facelift (called [...] "Fresh New <b>Fronte</b> Van" [...] in period marketing material), including a somewhat baroque new grille and a new, horizontally divided two-piece tailgate. The twin round taillights were also replaced by rectangular units. This version also featured Suzuki's new self-lubricating [...] "CCIS" [...] system (Cylinder Crank Injection and Selmix).|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} an export version {{introduced}} in January 1969, the Suzuki <b>Fronte</b> 500 with the engine enlarged to 475cc. This was only built in De Luxe trim.

The dashboard was modernized by two square gauges instead of a large oval one, the ignition key was moved from the dashboard to the steering column and the two-tone interior was changed to simply black. Externally, the decorative trim pieces in the front grille and on the air inlets at the rear were replaced by real grilles. First gear was also synchronized, unlike on earlier cars.
