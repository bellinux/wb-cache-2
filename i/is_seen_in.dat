The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E

40|$|Background: Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a {{dermatosis}} {{characterized by}} thickened, hyperpigmented plaques, typically on the intertriginous surfaces and neck. Common in some populations, its prevalence depends on race. Clinicians should recognize AN; it heralds disorders ranging from endocrinologic disturbances to malignancy. In this review, {{we discuss the}} pathogenesis of AN and its clinical implications and management. Materials and Methods: We selected 30 patients for the study. Diagnosis of associated disorders was established by history, physical examination, body mass index (BMI), hormone measurements by radioimmunoassays of thyroidnfunction tests, free testosterone, 17 (OH) progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), cortisol, gonadotropins, prolactin, immunoreactive insulin, and C-peptide levels. Results and Discussion: In our study, the flexural involvement (flexures of groins, knees and elbows) <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 40 % patients, lip involvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 6. 6 % patients, and dorsal involvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 3. 3 % patients each. Increased serum testosterone levels <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 13. 3 % patients and increased DHEAS levels <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 20 % patients. Regarding the types of AN, obesity induced AN or pseudo-AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> 70 % patients, syndromic AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 23. 35 % patients and malignant AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 6. 6 % patients. The commonest histopathological feature of patients with AN <b>was</b> hyperkeratosis, <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 100 % patients, papillomatosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 90 % patients, dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 60 % patients, horn pseudocysts <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 30 % patients, and irregular acanthosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 26. 6 % patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cicatrical {{alopecia}} {{occurs in}} otherwise healthy {{men and women}} of all ages and <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> worldwide Material and Methods: A study of 40 patients was conducted to study the clinical variants and histopathology of cicatricial alopecia. Results and Discussion: n our study, it <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> that maximum number of cases of cicatrical alopecia were of LPP (27. 5 %) followed by 25 % of DLE, 20 % patients had pseudopelade of Brocq, SLE <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 5 % cases followed by Scleroderma, dermatomyositis, Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans, aplasia cutis, kerion, follicular mucinosis, pemphigus, dissecting cellulitis of scalp/ pyogenic folliculitis and acne keloidalis nuchae in 2. 5 % cases each. Regarding the morphology of lesions,epidermal atrophy <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 90 % patients, erythema <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 55 % cases, follicular pluging <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 40 % patients, telangiectasias in 27. 5 % patients, diffuse scaling in 25 % patients and mottled hyperpigmentation <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 20 % patients.

5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results can be attributed to the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults.

Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained.

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> {{almost all}} organisms, {{it is not}} universal. However, the wide distribution of this modification {{and the fact that}} it is present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E
