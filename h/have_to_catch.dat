25|$|Outfielders field furthest {{from the}} bat, {{typically}} {{right on the}} boundary edge. Their main role is to prevent the ball from going over the boundary and scoring four or six runs. They need good footspeed {{to be able to}} get around the field quickly, and a strong arm to be able to make the 50–80-yard throw. Outfielders also often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> high hit balls that go over the infield.|$|E
25|$|Although several {{witnesses}} came to {{the conclusion}} that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect. Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey. The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock. The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the canine teeth, are to be expected since this is the only way that most land carnivores <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> their prey.|$|E
25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing {{all these}} little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E
50|$|From 1978 to 1986, the Cup {{was awarded}} after a one-game exhibition, {{that had no}} effect on the major league standings. The 1979 and 1985 games were {{abandoned}} as ties due to time constraints; in 1979 the Expos <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> an airplane flight, while in 1985 the Jays <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> a flight.|$|R

500|$|Adams {{campaigned for}} a further change in the rules of baseball, {{involving}} when outs were recorded. At the time, an out was allowed when the ball was caught by a fielder after one bounce; this {{was known as the}} [...] "bound rule". Adams supported a ban on such outs, calling his preferred rule [...] "the fly-game". Under the style of play he backed, when a fly ball was hit a fielder would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the ball before it touched the ground for an out to be made. This was similar to rules on catches in cricket, and would serve to increase the level of skill required from fielders. The Knickerbockers had enacted a rule mandating the [...] "fly-catch" [...] by 1857.|$|E
500|$|James Fox, {{journalist}} {{and author of the}} non-fiction book White Mischief: The Murder of Lord Erroll, was credited, along with Keith Richards, as co-author. He had previously interviewed Richards in 1973 and the pair had been friends since then. Reportedly, $7.3 million was paid for the work in 2007, [...] "on the basis of a 10-page excerpt". Fox spent [...] "hundreds of hours" [...] with Richards at his Caribbean home, and also in the United Kingdom, to gather material for the book. He interviewed Richards at length and also talked to many associates. Fox said of Richards, [...] "I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> him like a salmon." [...] The interviews were conducted seated at a table, but the two were not opposite each other. Richards always played music, so Fox provided him with a lapel microphone. [...] The subject matter was not handled chronologically; Fox allowed his subject to mentally [...] "dart about". [...] "Some sessions lasted hours and some, dealing with the more painful parts of Richards' life, lasted just minutes." [...] The project took five years to complete.|$|E
500|$|... "Back Up, Dancer" [...] {{was written}} by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 23, 2004. It was confirmed in mid-2004 that singer Janet Jackson would guest star as herself on the television series Will & Grace. She recorded her lines {{in front of a}} live audience on August 17. Jackson's role in the show had been her first television acting role in nearly two decades. Jackson's last prime-time role was on NBC's Fame. She also appeared in the television shows Diff'rent Strokes and Good Times. In addition, Jackson's appearance came nine months after the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. She told the entertainment news program Access Hollywood that she was a [...] "big fan" [...] of the show, and that she could not wait to join the cast for her stint. Also in this interview, she believed that Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was a decent dancer. [...] "I thought he studied dance. I really did, It's so funny. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> myself because I'm cracking up in rehearsals. It's just funny to watch [...]" [...] Jackson [...] "had a tough time" [...] on the set because she constantly messed up her lines. She admitted that it was not as easy as she had hoped it would be. [...] "I flubbed my lines and got so frustrated when I made those mistakes. I haven't done TV since Different Strokes, and it's not like Saturday Night Live where you can read cue cards. On Will & Grace, they're always rewriting, so you're always memorising." [...] Jackson, however, said that the dancing was the [...] "easy part of playing myself".|$|E

2500|$|Niven {{grew tired}} of the peacetime army. Though {{promoted}} to lieutenant on 1 January 1933, he saw no opportunity for further advancement. His ultimate decision to resign came after a lengthy lecture on machine guns, which was interfering with his plans for dinner with a particularly attractive young lady. At {{the end of the}} lecture, the speaker (a major general) asked if there were any questions. Showing the typical rebelliousness of his early years, Niven asked, [...] "Could you tell me the time, sir? I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> a train." ...|$|E

[...] The ranchers once again try to capture White Mane and fail. Folco asks the men if he can have the white horse.

2500|$|Brad Keselowski {{held off}} a hard-charging Ryan Newman and Matt Kenseth {{to win the}} GEICO 500. “I can’t believe it,” Keselowski said. “Talladega is such a wild card {{and to be able}} to win here you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> breaks and make your own breaks, a little of both. I can’t believe we won at Talladega. This race is the scariest of the three in the bracket. To be able to win here is really a privilege, it really is.” Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Kasey Kahne and Jimmie Johnson were the four drivers who were eliminated. [...] "We had a real good car most of the day," [...] Earnhardt said. [...] "Got real loose, kind of shuffled out. ... It's just hard racing. That's the way it goes at the end of these races. We weren't in good position." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emma {{emerges in}} the Enchanted Forest through the Vault of the Dark One, and finds herself {{haunted by the}} voice of the {{darkness}} inside of her, which has manifested as [...] personification of Rumplestiltskin. She struggles to resist, and vows not to hurt her family. Then, Emma runs up to a peddler, only to become consumed by Rumplestiltskin's guidance, [...] to the point of nearly using her dark magic to kill the peddler. The Dark One guides Emma through using a transportation spell, and she sees a will-o-the-wisp. The Dark One tells her that for the Wisp to answer her question, she will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> it. As she chases it, Emma comes upon a red-headed archer named Merida, who nabs the wisp and places it in her bag. Emma confronts Merida, accidentally using dark magic, and tries to convince her that she needs it to find Merlin. Merida is reluctant to trust Emma, but decides to go with her, keeping the wisp in her bag. Merida informs Emma that more wisps can are born at the Hill of Stones, so they head in that direction.|$|E
2500|$|Yearwood {{has found}} major {{influences}} {{in a variety}} of musical artists. She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice that made you believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how it makes me feel, even before I made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> ourselves if we begin to think about recording a song we don't believe in just because we think it might be a hit." [...] She also stated that even though she does not record any of her own material, she has written music that still has yet to be recorded.|$|E
