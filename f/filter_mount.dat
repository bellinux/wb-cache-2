50|$|Filter mounting: This mount is {{used for}} {{attaching}} filters to EF lenses. There are three types: front threaded mount, inner drop-in mount, and rear gelatin holders. Front threaded filters are used on most lenses, and are attached by threading and tightening the filter. Inner, drop-in filter mounts are used on super telephoto EF lenses. They are attached by first pressing the two buttons on the <b>filter</b> <b>mount,</b> and pulling it out. Then either a round threaded filter is attached, or one can use a gelatin filter. Rear gelatin filter holders are used by cutting out a sheet of gelatin, to the size shown {{on the back of}} the lens and then sliding it into the holder. Filter mounts are useful for all types of photography, and every EF lens has either one or two of the three types used.|$|E
40|$|A {{recurring}} {{challenge in}} bandpass thermal radiation measurement applications requiring {{a high degree}} of accuracy is the treatment of secondary radiation emitted from the filter itself. Considered is the important case of the short-wavelength channels implemented in CERES, RBI, and most other Earth radiation budget instruments. In these applications broadband radiation incident between 0. 2 and 100 μm traverses a low-pass filter whose cut-off wavelength is around 5 μm. The filter material of choice is fused silica, which filters by absorption. Ideally most of the heat absorbed beyond 5 μm is conducted to the <b>filter</b> <b>mount</b> so that the filter temperature remains essentially constant during a scan cycle. In practice, however, the filter temperature must vary to some extent, resulting in time-varying emission from both faces. Because of the relatively low temperature of the filter, around 300 K, its peak emission occurs at around 10 μm. Radiation emitted from the face nearest the detector inevitably leads to a phase-delayed time-varying noise component that adds to and is indistinguishable from the radiation passed by the filter. A common solution to this problem is to introduce a second filter in series with the primary filter which intercepts and absorbs the emitted noise component, as shown in the figure. Because space in the optical stack-up is often limited, it is desirable to optimally distribute the total available space between the two filters; i. e. to determine the optimum value of the ratio t 2 /(t 1 + t 2). A process is reported for accomplishing this based on a hybrid thermal diffusion/ray-trace model...|$|E

40|$|The {{main source}} of error in {{retrieving}} aerosol optical thicknesses using sun photometry comes from {{the determination of the}} TOA voltages. The degradation of interference filters is the most important source of the long-term changes in the cross-calibrations. Although major improvements {{have been made in the}} design of the filters (interference filters fabricated using ion-assisted deposition), the filters remain the principal factor limiting performance of the sun photometers. Degradation of filters necessitates frequent calibration of sun photometers and frequent measurements of the filter transmission or the relative system response. The degradation of the <b>filters</b> <b>mounted</b> on the CIMEL sun photometers have been monitored since 1993 by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) project. The decay reported by Holben et al. for the first two years of a CIMEL#s operation is between 1 and 5 %. Nevertheless, the <b>filters</b> <b>mounted</b> on CIMEL instruments are regularly replaced after two years of use. The cross-calibration technique consists of taking measurements concurrently with the uncalibrated and the reference sun photometers. While analyzing measurements, the quality of the calibration has to be checked, using the following considerations: (1) any cirrus clouds suspected to be masking the sun, during the calibration period, need to be reported and the corresponding data set removed; and (2) the stability of the day needs to be checked. This chapter will describe calibration techniques, facilities, and protocols used for calibrating sun photometers and sky radiometers...|$|R
