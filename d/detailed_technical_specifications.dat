50|$|A {{system which}} is cited {{as being the}} forerunner of the modern mobile phone, was first {{launched}} from the Peterloo telephone exchange in Manchester in 1959. Initially called the ‘Post Office South Lancashire Radiophone Service’, it was inaugurated on 28 October and along with South Lancs also covered North Cheshire and parts of The Wirral. The signals were operated through two antennas (one on Liverpool’s Lancaster House, and the other at Horwich on Winter Hill, with an in-fill for the City Centre on Manchester's Telephone House.).

50|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{unobstructed}} communication between the ANSPs, the European Air Navigation Planning Group (EANPG) of ICAO has defined 59 test cases in its EUR AMHS Manual (V5.0), 17/06/2010 (Appendix D, AMHS Conformance Tests), ASIA/PAC AMHS Manual (Annex B, AMHS Conformance and Compatibility Test, V2.0, 22/09/08) which {{have to be performed}} prior to establishment of bilateral links between the ANSPs.

50|$|With ALFA, 47 pointings {{are needed}} to cover one square degree, {{compared}} to about 330 pointings needed to cover one square degree with similar density with a single-pixel feed. Initially, the survey used the Wideband Arecibo Pulsar Processors (WAPPs) to detect the signal from ALFA's seven beams. These cover 100 MHz of band (with dual polarization capability), initially centered at 1420 MHz and now at 1440 MHz. For search purposes, 256-channel spectra are produced every 64 microseconds. In 2009, the survey transitioned to new and improved back-ends, the Mock polyphase filterbank spectrometers, which are capable of covering 300 MHz (from 1225 MHz to 1525 MHz, the bandwidth covered by ALFA) {{for each of the}} seven beams (see <b>detailed</b> <b>technical</b> <b>specifications</b> here). This has led to greatly increased search sensitivity and better means to deal with all the radio frequency interference.|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} a product that we buy at shops goes through many phases. The whole history is named product {{development}} process (PDP). Marketing experts are those who trigger the process: they perform research on consumer preferences and expectations aiming to find out new needs and motivations for a new product. Subsequently, a rough idea of the open space for the new product potentially available on the market is illustrated to the product designers, who start creating concepts representing the new product, including the definition of its shape, architecture, materials, functions, and also address some issues like ergonomics and usability. The typical subsequent step consists of the product designers and the marketing experts analyzing and evaluating the concepts together, and agreeing on the selection of one concept, {{which will be the}} future product, which is transferred to the engineering designers, who check the feasibility and costs, and transform the concept into <b>detailed</b> <b>technical</b> <b>specifications</b> [1].

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{discuss the}} reuse of process {{knowledge}} through conceptualized workflow patterns. Knowledge reuse in the life-cycle of projects {{has been widely}} studied, but most known solutions focus on communication issues, isolated from the processes themselves. Due to the huge potential benefits from the immediate reuse of communicated information (e. g. architectural, structural solutions, <b>details,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>specifications,</b> etc.) {{most of the attention}} has been given to information retrieval techniques and contextualization of the retrieved information. Actual processes, actors and tools that have led to results of work usually remained unrecorded, since this was considered technically impossible. Indeed, in contrast to intuitive ad-hoc reuse of parts of documents that fit into a given context, ad-hoc reuse of parts of actual processes together with metadescriptors is not so straightforward. In the paper we identify the methods and media in which processes were modeled and executed as the main problem to achieve this goal. Based on analysis of process modeling techniques, we suggest a novel methodological approach and a conceptual solution for a prototype collaboration system supported by active process models. ...|$|R

40|$|A recent Federal {{grant to}} the State of Hawaii and Office of Naval Research (ONR) {{will be used}} to design and {{construct}} two new clean-fuel technology ferries for transporting visitors to and from the USS ARIZONA Memorial. This paper will review possible study concerns and options, and will discuss emissions. A total of five ferries (two operate each day) carry people back and forth from shore to the USS ARIZONA (0. 5 mile distance) and have been in operation for over 20 years. Currently, the ferries run on diesel fuel. Revamping of the aging ferry system would spare the treasured USS ARIZONA facility from exposure to approximately 216, 000 gallons 1 of diesel fuel per year and would eliminate some or all vehicle pollution emissions. Out of all the possible clean-fuel alternatives for these ferries, hydrogen fuel cells {{have been the subject of}} a great deal of interest and research. A hydrogen fuel cell, like a conventional battery, produces electricity as the result of an electrochemical reaction. The only byproduct of this reaction is water, making it an environmentally friendly option. Although hydrogen is the fuel used in these cells, no combustion occurs, alleviating concerns of an explosion. This paper will discuss several technologies that are available for operating hydrogen fuel cells, including polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), which holds more promise for a viable option because of their relatively high power density.

40|$|The {{emission}} of acid compounds during {{the manufacture of}} ceramic tiles is strongly related {{to the presence of}} precursors in the raw materials and/or fuels used, with some exceptions such as the production of thermal NOX. The stages with the potential to produce significant emissions of these compounds have been identified as the suspension spray drying and tile firing stages. The monitoring of emission levels of acid pollutants in these stages has turned in a great importance issue from a regulatory and industrial aspect. The DREAM project ([URL] will tackle the regulation of acidic emissions focusing in the firing stage. The initial stages of the project have made it possible to identify the design requirements for the monitoring system. This will allow the control of acid pollutants emissions and other key parameters such as pressure, flow, temperature and humidity.
