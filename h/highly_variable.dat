5|$|The metal-rich {{white dwarf}} WD 1145+017 {{is the first}} white dwarf {{observed}} with a disintegrating minor planet which transits the star. The disintegration of the planetesimal generates a debris cloud which passes {{in front of the}} star every 4.5 hours, causing a 5-minute-long fade in the star's optical brightness. The depth of the transit is <b>highly</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia is a <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> species. It is {{most often}} {{encountered}} as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it may even be reduced to a small shrub.|$|E
30|$|Significant {{variables}} {{within an}} individual predictor group {{can be highly}} correlated {{with one or more}} variables from a different predictor group, a problem that is not automatically accounted for in the individual classification trees. We computed Pearson’s correlation coefficient among all of the significant variables resulting from the initial <b>variable</b> reduction procedure. <b>Highly</b> correlated <b>variables</b> (r > 0.7) were evaluated and excluded in order to avoid inclusion of <b>highly</b> correlated <b>variables</b> in the final BRT analysis.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{statistical}} properties of impulse response functions in structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) with a <b>highly</b> persistent <b>variable</b> as hours worked and long–run identifying restrictions. The <b>highly</b> persistent <b>variable</b> is specified as a nearly stationary persistent process. Such process appears particularly {{well suited to}} characterize the dynamics of hours worked because it implies a unit root in finite sample but is asymptotically stationary and persistent. This is typically the case for per capita hours worked which are included in SVARs. Theoretical results derived from this specification allow to explain most of the empirical findings from SVARs which include U. S. hours worked...|$|R
5|$|Banksia integrifolia, {{commonly}} known as coast banksia, is a species of tree that grows along {{the east coast of}} Australia. One of the most widely distributed Banksia species, it occurs between Victoria and Central Queensland in a broad range of habitats, from coastal dunes to mountains. It is <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82ft) in height. Its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescent {{tissue in}} the mature fruit body is {{restricted}} {{to the edge of}} the gills (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of the gills with the stem, and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of bioluminescence along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.|$|E
5|$|Coastal plants {{begin to}} flower at around {{five years from}} seed, but plants in the Stirling Range take much longer to mature. In one Stirling Range population, only 15% of plants had flowered after eight years. Flowering time is <b>highly</b> <b>variable,</b> but in general it occurs between March and August, with a peak around June. More flowers open during the day than at night.|$|E

5|$|During the Kimmeridgian, Europe {{was covered}} by the shallow inland Tethys Ocean, with exposed landmasses being a series of {{scattered}} archipelagos. <b>Highly</b> <b>variable</b> sea levels supported a highly diverse insular crocodilian fauna, with biodiversity (that of atoposaurids in particular) being driven strongly by allopatric speciation. The two species of Knoetschkesuchus were part of similar faunas, in both of which they functioned as small predators ecologically partitioned from the other contemporary crocodilians; {{it is likely that}} these faunas originated through dispersal over larger landmasses. A similar faunal exchange occurred with the Wessex-Weald Basin of England.|$|E
5|$|Snowfall is <b>highly</b> <b>variable.</b> When winter low {{pressure}} systems move from south west to north east the Malvern area is {{often on the}} northern flank, meaning heavy snowfall while areas further south and east receive rain or no precipitation at all. However, when snowfall arrives by means of convective showers driven by northerly, north westerly or north easterly winds the area tends {{to be one of}} the least snowy parts of the UK, owing to its sheltered positioning.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into {{the area of the}} hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes.

5|$|Average annual {{precipitation}} ranges from , {{though it is}} generally unpredictable. More than 85% of annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which constitutes the warm season. In contrast, the winter months are dry. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. Precipitation is <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> {{from year to year}} and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, causing moisture to flow towards this region; during dry years, these winds are weaker.|$|E
5|$|Because of its <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> color pattern, {{the leopard}} {{catshark}} {{has historically been}} known under a multitude of names. In an 1837 issue of Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, Scottish physician and zoologist Andrew Smith listed without descriptions the new genus Poroderma, containing the species P.africanum (the pyjama shark), P.pantherinum, P.submaculatum, and P.variegatum. German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle assigned these sharks to the genus Scyllium, and in their 18381841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen furnished descriptions for S.pantherinum and S.variegatum, and listed two more names without description, S.leopardinum and S.maeandrinum. In 1934, American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler described P.marleyi, characterized by large black spots.|$|E

5|$|Crawley {{lies within}} the Sussex Weald, {{an area of}} <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> terrain, so that many microclimates of frost hollows, sun traps and windswept hilltops will be {{encountered}} over a short distance. During calm, clear periods of weather this allows for some interesting temperature variations, {{although most of the}} time, when mobile westerly airstreams persist, the weather is typically Oceanic {{like the rest of the}} British Isles. Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, although more recently the Met Office has also published data for its nearby weather station at Charlwood. Both weather stations are about 3 miles north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} serious {{poisoning}} the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of {{central nervous system}} depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days. In {{the majority of cases}} recovery is complete within 12 to 24hours. The effect is <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.|$|E

5|$|Infant {{mortality}} is often high among ruffed lemurs, {{but can also}} be <b>highly</b> <b>variable.</b> In some seasons, as many as 65% are unable to reach three months of age, possibly due to falls and related injuries, although in some seasons infant {{mortality is}} as low as 0%. For those that do survive to adulthood, sexual maturity is attained at 18 to 20 months in females and 32 to 48 months in males. Sexual maturity may take longer to reach in the wild compared to captivity. For females, the inter-birth interval, or time between successive offspring, is typically one year, and in captivity, females can remain reproductively active {{until the age of}} 23. The life expectancy for both species of ruffed lemur is estimated at 36 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Lemur diets are <b>highly</b> <b>variable</b> and {{demonstrate}} {{a high degree}} of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans.
