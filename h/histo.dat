30|$|Subsequent to {{the thermal}} {{treatment}} all lamellas were conditioned for 7  days at standard climate and lap-joint tensile shear specimens were manufactured according to EN 302 - 1 (Fig.  1 f), resulting in 10 – 15 bonded specimens with dimensions of 150 [*]×[*] 20 [*]×[*] 10  mm 3 for each postcure parameter. From the tested tensile shear specimen nanoindentation samples were cut from intact parts, where no damage due to testing or clamping was visible.

40|$|In {{traditional}} cancer diagnosis, (<b>histo)</b> pathological {{images of}} biopsy samples are visually analysed by pathologists. However, this judgment is subjective {{and leads to}} variability among pathologists. Digital scanners may enable automated objective assessment, improved quality and reduced throughput time. Nucleus detection {{is seen as the}} corner stone for a range of applications in automated assessment of (<b>histo)</b> pathological images. In this paper, we propose an efficient nucleus detector designed with machine learning. We applied colour deconvolution to reconstruct each applied stain. Next, we constructed a large feature set and modified AdaBoost to create two detectors, focused on different characteristics in appearance of nuclei. The proposed modification of AdaBoost enables inclusion of the computational cost of each feature during selection, thus improving the computational efficiency of the resulting detectors. The outputs of the two detectors are merged by a globally optimal active contour algorithm to refine the border of the detected nuclei. With a detection rate of 95 % (on average 58 incorrectly found objects per field-of-view) based on 51 field-of-view images of Her 2 immunohistochemistry stained breast tissue and a complete analysis in 1 s per field-of-view, our nucleus detector shows good performance and could enable a range of applications in automated assessment of (<b>histo)</b> pathological images...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of a new high frequency echocardiographic technique for the quantitative assessment of coronary artery luminal and wall dimensions. In 32 open chest animals, high frequency echocardiographic measurements (echo) of luminal diameter correlated well with in vitro histologic measurements (<b>Histo)</b> (r = 0. 86; high frequency echo = 0. 89 <b>Histo</b> + 0. 79) (range 1. 7 to 5. 8 mm). Similar results were found in the evaluation of five human autopsy hearts studied in vitro. Coronary artery wall thickness measurements in human autopsy hearts showed a good correlation with high frequency echocardiographic measurements (r = 0. 86; high frequency echo = 0. 65 <b>Histo</b> + 0. 24) (range 0. 3 to 0. 8 mm). In eight open chest calves, high frequency echocardiographic measurements of total vessel diameter correlated well with sonomicrometer measurements (Sono) (r = 0. 94; high frequency echo = 1. 03 Sono + 0. 4) (range 2. 1 to 5. 3 mm). Inter- and intraobserver variability measurements of high frequency echocardiographic measurements demonstrated excellent reproducibility (r = 0. 95, interobserver variability for wall thickness; r = 0. 97, inter-observer variability for luminal diameter; n = 10 postmortem human coronary arteries). In conclusion, high frequency echocardiography is an accurate and reproducible method of measuring coronary luminal and wall geometry and may be a potentially useful tool for in vivo coronary artery evaluation in patients...|$|E

5|$|The dromons that Procopius {{describes}} were single-banked {{ships of}} probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger (parexeiresia), these extended {{directly from the}} hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (<b>histos</b> or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side.

Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms.

25|$|Belisarius's fleet {{during the}} Vandalic War, as {{described}} by Procopius of Caesarea, was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that {{by that time the}} lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation. These 6th-century dromons were single-banked ("monoreme") ships of probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger, these extended directly from the hull. In the later two-banked ("bireme") dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the ship's marines in boarding operations. The Greek scholar Christos Makrypoulias suggests an arrangement of 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers.

30|$|Some hybrid models {{makes use}} of {{integrating}} both personal experience trust and reputation. For instances, <b>Histos</b> [33, 34] was designed {{to respond to the}} lack of personalization in Sporas reputation values. The model can deal with direct information (although in a very simple way) and witness information. Yu and Singh [30, 31, 32] proposed a model to store values of the quality of direct interactions among agents and only consider the most recent experiences with each partner for computation. Esfandiari and Chandrasekharan [5] proposed two one-on-one trust acquisition mechanisms. The first one is based on observation and utilises Bayesian networks to perform the trust acquisition. Sen and Sajja’s [26] reputation model considers both types of direct experiences: direct interaction and observed interaction, while the main idea behind the reputation model presented by Carter et al. [4] is that the reputation of an agent is based on the degree of fulfilment of roles ascribed to it by the society. Ramchurn et al. [22] developed a trust model based on confidence and reputation. It {{makes use of}} fuzzy techniques to guide agents in evaluating past interactions and in establishing new contracts with one another. Huynh et al. [12, 13] described FIRE, which is a trust and reputation model. It integrates a number of information sources to produce a comprehensive assessment of an agent’s likely performance in open systems. Victor et al. [28] advocate the use of a trust model in which trust scores are (trust, distrust)-couples. Badica et al. [2] introduced a reputation model for agents engaged in e-business transactions. The model adds the forgiveness factor and uses the new sources of reputation information based on agents groups. Nguyen and Tran [17, 18, 19] introduced a computational model of trust, which is also combination of experience and reference trust using fuzzy computational techniques and weighted aggregation operators. The model is then extended to multi-subjects of trust [18] and then to the case there are some agents lying in sharing their personal trust [17]. Katz and Golbeck [14] introduces a definition of trust suitable for use in Web-based social networks with a discussion of the properties that will influence its use in computation. Hang et al. [8] describe a new algebraic approach, show some theoretical properties of it, and empirically evaluate it on two social network datasets. Guha et al. [7] develop a framework of trust propagation schemes, each of which may be appropriate in certain circumstances, and evaluate the schemes on a large trust network. Vogiatzis et al. [29] propose a probabilistic framework that models agent interactions as a hidden Markov model.|$|R

The world around us has changed significantly during this period bringing about a considerable change in our lifestyles and the way we live.
