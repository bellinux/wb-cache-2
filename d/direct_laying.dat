Radar target assignment (ZZR) requires an oral radio or telephone transmission to the Parallaxcomputer operator, who inputs the search data into the device.

50|$|Ossification (or osteogenesis) in bone {{remodeling}} is {{the process}} of laying down new bone material by cells called osteoblasts. It is synonymous with bone tissue formation. There are two processes resulting in the formation of normal, healthy bone tissue: Intramembranous ossification is the <b>direct</b> <b>laying</b> down of bone into the primitive connective tissue (mesenchyme), while endochondral ossification involves cartilage as a precursor. In fracture healing, endochondral osteogenesis is the most commonly occurring process, for example in fractures of long bones treated by plaster of Paris, whereas fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation with metal plates, screws, pins, rods and nails may heal by intramembranous osteogenesis.|$|E

40|$|Asphalt block {{pavement}} is {{an innovative}} alternative to asphalt pavements. This {{study investigated the}} performance of asphalt paving blocks {{with a number of}} variables: block thickness, bitumen types and joint width between blocks. The effect of dynamic and static loads and their transfer from one block to another on the behaviour of asphalt block pavements were studied. Asphalt blocks were laid on sand bedding, but <b>direct</b> <b>laying</b> on a base course was also investigated. The experiments conducted in the laboratory were push-in test, pull-out test, and accelerated trafficking test. Two types of bitumen were used as binder to produce asphalt blocks: normal bitumen (60 / 70) and modified bitumen (PG 76) and different block thicknesses: 70 mm, 80 mm, and 90 mm. Asphalt blocks were laid in stretcher bond with various joint widths: no joint spacing, 2 mm, and 3 mm. The instruments of the push-in test and pull-out test were constructed within a steel box of 1. 0 metre square; the push-in vertical load was increased from 0 to 30 kN on the samples of asphalt blocks. The accelerated trafficking loading test was conducted in a steel platform of 1. 0 m × 5. 0 m, the loaded wheel was moved over the pavement model and the deflection was taken at specific intervals. The results indicate that asphalt blocks have a great performance after being exposed to static load and dynamic load. The study shows that placing asphalt blocks directly on the base course resulted in uneven surface; therefore the bedding sand layer is a necessary component in the structure of asphalt block pavements. From the statistical results, the thickness of the block has insignificant impact on the structural performance. However, there is a trend that a change in block thickness from 70 to 90 mm decreases the deflection and displacement of asphalt block pavement which could be due to a greater frictional area and load transfer, thus increase the response of the pavement. The results also show the type of bitumen used in this study has insignificant impact on the structural performance. However, it has an impact on the compressive strength and density of the block. The finding reveals that placing blocks with no joint spacing is found to yield the best performance...|$|E

40|$|Churchwardens' {{accounts}} are fast threatening to oust wills from their {{position as the}} first port of call for historians seeking to recreate the religious and social experience of'ordinary' English people in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In a book brimming with graphs, tables and pie-charts, Beat Kiimin demonstrates how a systematic analysis of the income and expenditure described in surviving churchwardens' accounts (in particular those for ten sample parishes) {{can be used to}} substantiate the now increasingly familiar emphasis on the vitality of late medieval religious life. The seductive lore of these fascinating documents should not blind us to their limitations: little over 200 often incomplete sets survive from this period from nearly 9, 000 parishes, and this book is understandably not able to tell us whether any principle more dependable than happenstance accounts for the pattern of survival. Why, for example, do Devon and Somerset between them provide 16 per cent of all surviving sets? None the less, in analysing these sources more rigorously than any previous commentator, Kumin paints a compelling picture of how churchwardens (here convincingly demonstrated to have been drawn overwhelmingly from the broad middle swathe of parish society) were able to extract from their communities, and apply to communal purposes, very substantial sums of money, usually considerably more than the crown was able to raise from the same communities in <b>direct</b> <b>lay</b> taxation...|$|R

50|$|In {{anti-aircraft}} use {{the guns}} were normally operated {{in groups of}} four, controlled by the M7 or M9 Director or Kerrison Predictors. Radar direction was common, starting with the SCR-268 in 1941, which was not accurate enough to directly lay the guns, but provided accurate ranging throughout the engagement. For night-time use, a searchlight was slaved to the radar with a beam width set so that the target would be somewhere in the beam when it was turned on, {{at which point the}} engagement continued as in the day. In 1944, the system was upgraded with the addition of the SCR-584 microwave radar, which was accurate to about 0.06 degrees (1 mil) and also provided automatic tracking.

The many challenges associated with effective expert-lay health communication are further compounded in an EU context as written mandatory patient communication is translated into all EU languages.

In this paper, the structural behaviours of the glass–fibre composite strengthened concrete structures subjected to uni-axial compression and three point bending tests are discussed through experimental studies. Two types of concrete structure are used in present study, they are concrete cylinder and rectangular concrete beam. Discussion on the environmental effects of composite strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) structures is also addressed.
