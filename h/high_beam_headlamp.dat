40|$|The {{majority}} of traffic fatalities involving pedestrians occur {{at night and}} this is largely attributed to low illumination conditions. Yet, drivers tend to underuse their high beams despite the visibility benefits afforded to them. In the present study we report high beam usage rates during an open-road drive using a video camera-based method. Measurements of low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> illuminance were also taken for all vehicles used in this study. The results indicate that drivers, on average, used their high beams 48 % of the time possible. Furthermore, there was a moderately negative relationship between low beam output and high beam use indicating that drivers whose low beams produced less illumination tended to use their high beams more often. Future research should empirically investigate this relationship to lend further insight into the mechanism by which beam output influences beam usage. Research that improves our understanding of drivers’ knowledge and use of high beams {{is likely to be}} important as headlighting technologies continue to advance...|$|E
50|$|Lamps and reflectors: Front, side, {{and rear}} turn signals; brake lights, {{front and rear}} {{position}} lights, hazard warning lights, rear reflectors, low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> are all required. Sidemarker reflectors and lights and fog and driving lamps are permitted. All devices must function correctly and emit or reflect the required colours of light.|$|R
25|$|Some {{countries}} permit {{or require}} vehicles to {{be equipped with}} daytime running lamps (DRL). Depending on the regulations {{of the country for}} which the vehicle is built, these may be functionally dedicated lamps, or the function may be provided by the low <b>beam</b> or <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> the front turn signals, or the front fog lamps.|$|R
25|$|Auxiliary <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> lamps may {{be fitted}} to provide high {{intensity}} light {{to enable the}} driver to see at longer range than the vehicle's <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> may be fitted. Such lamps are most notably fitted on rallying cars, and are occasionally fitted to production vehicles derived from or imitating such cars. They are common in countries with large stretches of unlit roads, or in regions such as the Nordic countries where the period of daylight is short during winter.|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} daylight with 32 participants to determine whether left turning drivers’ gap acceptance in front of approaching motorcycles depends on the motorcycle’s forward lighting treatment. Five experimental lighting treatments including a modulated <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp,</b> or the low beam headlamp plus pairs of low-mounted auxiliary lamps, high-mounted auxiliary lamps, both high- and low-mounted auxiliary lamps, or low-mounted LED lamps were compared to a baseline treatment with only the low beam headlamp illuminated. Participants viewed the approaching traffic stream (including the motorcycle) on an active roadway and indicated {{when it would be}} safe (and not safe) to initiate a left turn across the opposing lanes. Participants also shared their attention with a secondary visual distraction task that took their eyes off the forward roadway. Participants did not know {{that the purpose of the}} study was to measure their responses to approaching motorcycles. Based on participants’ indications of the last safe moment to turn, the mean temporal safety margin provided to the approaching motorcycle did not differ significantly between any of the experimental lighting treatments and the baseline treatment. However, having either low-mounted auxiliary lamps or modulated high beam lamps on the motorcycle significantly reduced the probability of obtaining a potentially unsafe short safety margin as compared to the baseline lighting treatment. Overall, the results suggest that enhancing the frontal conspicuity of motorcycles with lighting treatments beyond an illuminated low beam headlamp may be an effective countermeasure for daytime crashes involving right-of-way violations...|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Ford Australia {{undertook}} a two-year project of importing and marketing the Mustang in Australia. $4million was allocated for {{the conversion of}} 250 units. The car was not designed for right-hand drive markets and for complying with Australian Design Rules. Tickford Engineering was contracted to engineer the conversion to the right-hand-drive and to meet Australian Design Rules, including the fitment of auxiliary <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> in the front bumper and side turn signal repeaters as well as taillamps with amber turn signal indicators. In total, just 377 Mustangs were sold in Australia between 2001-2003.|$|R
25|$|Though {{the systems}} based on photoresistors evolved, growing more compact and {{moving from the}} {{dashboard}} to a less conspicuous location behind the radiator grill, they were still unable to reliably discern headlamps from non-vehicular light sources such as streetlights. They also did not dip to low beam when the driver approached a vehicle from behind, and they would spuriously dip to low beam in response to road sign reflections of the vehicle's own <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b> American inventor Jacob Rabinow devised and refined a scanning automatic dimmer system impervious to streetlights and reflections, but no automaker purchased the rights, and the problematic photoresistor type remained on the market through the late 1980s.|$|R
25|$|The {{range of}} the beam can vary between 65 and 300 meters, {{depending}} on traffic conditions. In traffic, the low beam cutoff position is adjusted vertically to maximise seeing range while keeping glare out of leading and oncoming drivers' eyes. When no traffic is close enough for glare to be a problem, the system provides full <b>high</b> <b>beam.</b> <b>Headlamps</b> are adjusted every 40 milliseconds by a camera {{on the inside of}} the front windscreen which can determine distance to other vehicles. The S-Class, CLS-Class and C-Class also offer this technology. In the CLS, the adaptive <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> is realised with LED headlamps - the first vehicle producing all adaptive light functions with LEDs. Since 2010 some Audi models with Xenon headlamps are offering a similar system: adaptive light with variable headlight range control.|$|R
50|$|Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 {{requires}} DRLs on all {{new vehicles}} made or imported after January 1, 1990. Canada's proposed DRL regulation was essentially similar to regulations {{in place in}} Scandinavia, with an axial luminous intensity limit of 1,500 cd, but automakers claimed it was too expensive to add a new front lighting device, and would increase warranty costs (by dint of increased bulb replacements) to run the low beams. After a pitched regulatory battle, the standard was rewritten to {{permit the use of}} reduced-voltage <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> producing up to 7,000 axial candela, as well as permitting any light color from white to amber or selective yellow. These changes to the regulation permitted automakers to implement a less costly DRL, such as by connecting the <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> filaments in series to supply each filament with half its rated voltage, or by burning the front turn signals full-time except when they are actually flashing as turn indicators.|$|R
2500|$|Headlamps are {{generally}} {{required to produce}} white light, according to both ECE and SAE standards. ECE Regulation 48 currently requires new vehicles to be equipped with headlamps emitting white light. Different headlamp technologies produce different characteristic types of white light; the white specification is quite large and permits {{a wide range of}} apparent color from warm white (with a brown-orange-amber-yellow cast) to cold white (with a blue-violet cast). Previous ECE regulations also permitted selective yellow light, which from 1936 until 1993 was required on all vehicles registered in France. Selective yellow headlamps are no longer common, but are permitted in various countries throughout Europe as well as in non-European locales such as South Korea, [...] Japan and New Zealand. In Iceland, yellow headlamps are allowed and the vehicle regulations in Monaco still officially require selective yellow light from all vehicles' low <b>beam</b> and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> and fog lamps if present.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Canada {{mandated}} DRLs, General Motors, {{interested in}} reducing the build variations of cars for the North American market, petitioned the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1990 to permit (but not require) US vehicles to be equipped with DRLs like those in Canada. NHTSA objected on grounds {{of the potential for}} high-intensity DRLs to create problems with glare and turn signal masking, and issued a proposed rule in 1991 that specified a maximum intensity of 2,600 cd. Industry and safety watchdogs reacted to the proposed rule, and eventually the glare objections were set aside and most of the same types of DRLs allowed in Canada were permitted but not required effective with the 1995 model year. General Motors immediately equipped most (and, in following years, all) of its vehicles with DRLs beginning with the Chevrolet Corsica. Saab, Volkswagen, Volvo, Suzuki and Subaru gradually introduced DRLs in the U.S. market beginning in 1995. In recent years, Lexus has installed high-beam or turn signal based DRLs on US models. Some Toyota models come with DRLs as standard or optional equipment, and with a driver-controllable on/off switch. Starting in the 2006 model year, Honda began equipping their U.S. models with DRLs, mostly by reduced-intensity operation of the <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>High</b> <b>beam</b> (main beam, driving <b>beam,</b> full <b>beam)</b> <b>headlamps</b> {{provide a}} bright, center-weighted {{distribution}} of light with no particular control of light directed towards other road users' eyes. As such, {{they are only}} suitable for use when alone on the road, as the glare they produce will dazzle other drivers.|$|R
25|$|Technology {{moved forward}} {{in the rest of}} the world. The first halogen lamp for vehicle {{headlamp}} use, the H1, was introduced in 1962 by a European consortium of bulb and headlamp makers. Shortly thereafter, headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, both due to lighting effectiveness and vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. <b>High</b> <b>beam</b> peak intensity, capped at 140,000 candela per side of the car in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 candela on each side of the car until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> with internal halogen burners became available for use on 1979 models in the United States. Halogen sealed beams now dominate the sealed beam market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.|$|R

50|$|Sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were {{introduced}} in the United States in 1939, and became mandatory from the following year until the 1984 model year. Cars prior and subsequent to that date could {{have a variety of}} shapes of headlamps, using any {{of a wide variety of}} replaceable bulbs. Halogen sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> appeared on U.S. cars in 1978 to enable halogen technology under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which at the time required all headlamps to be of sealed beam construction; eventually halogen sealed beams came to dominate the sealed beam lamp market.|$|R
50|$|The {{limited range}} of {{standardized}} sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> sizes and shapes restricted styling options for automobiles. Replaceable-bulb headlamps provide the regulated light distributions while allowing greater design and engineering freedom.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, the law changed slightly, {{permitting}} Americans {{to possess}} vehicles with four 5.75 in round sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> and in 1974, these lights {{were permitted to}} be rectangular as well.|$|R
25|$|They are {{sometimes}} used {{in place of}} dipped-beam headlamps, reducing the glare-back from fog or falling snow, although the legality varies by jurisdiction of using front fog lamps without low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Forward {{illumination}} {{is provided}} by high- ("main", [...] "full", [...] "driving") and low- ("dip", [...] "dipped", [...] "passing") <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> which may be augmented by auxiliary fog lamps, driving lamps, or cornering lamps.|$|R
25|$|Dipped-beam (also called low, passing, or meeting <b>beam)</b> <b>headlamps</b> {{provide a}} light {{distribution}} to give adequate forward and lateral illumination without dazzling other road users with excessive glare. This beam is specified for use whenever other vehicles are present ahead.|$|R
50|$|Historically, one of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} differences between UN and US regulations was the design and performance of headlamps. The Citroën DS shown here illustrates the large differences in headlamps during the 1940-1983 era when US regulations required sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
25|$|US laws {{required}} sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> on all vehicles between 1940 and 1983, {{and other}} countries such as Japan, United Kingdom and Australia also made extensive use of sealed beams. In most other countries, and in the US since 1984, replaceable-bulb headlamps predominate.|$|R
2500|$|... "Dipping" [...] (low <b>beam)</b> <b>headlamps</b> were {{introduced}} in 1915 by the Guide Lamp Company, but the 1917 Cadillac system allowed the light to be dipped with a lever inside the car rather than requiring the driver to stop and get out. The 1924 Bilux bulb was the first modern unit, having the light for both low (dipped) and <b>high</b> (main) <b>beams</b> of a <b>headlamp</b> emitting from a single bulb. A similar design was introduced in 1925 by Guide Lamp called the [...] "Duplo". In 1927, the foot-operated dimmer switch or dip switch was introduced and became standard {{for much of the}} century. 1933–34 Packards were equipped with tri-beam headlamps, the bulbs having three filaments. From highest to lowest, the beams were called [...] "country passing", [...] "country driving" [...] and [...] "city driving". The 1934 Nash also used a three-beam system, although in this case, the bulbs were conventional two-filament type, and the intermediate beam combined low beam on the driver's side with <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> on the passenger's side, so as to maximise the view of the roadside while minimizing glare toward oncoming traffic. The last vehicle with a foot-operated dimmer switch were the 1991 Ford F-Series and E-Series [...] vans. Fog lamps were new for 1938 Cadillacs, and their 1954 [...] "Autronic Eye" [...] system automated the selection of <b>high</b> and low <b>beams.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Due to the American sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> {{requirement}} {{in place at}} the time, the USA models had a special front fascia with four round headlights instead of the two rectangular units it had in other markets. The [...] "US front" [...] then became an item for car customisers in Europe, and vice versa.|$|R
25|$|Complex-reflector {{technology}} {{in combination with}} new bulb designs such as H13 is enabling the creation of European-type low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> patterns {{without the use of}} a Graves Shield, while the 1992 US approval of the H4 bulb has made traditionally European 60% / 40% optical area divisions for low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> common in the US. Therefore, the difference in active optical area and overall beam light content no longer necessarily exists between US and ECE <b>beams.</b> Dual-beam HID <b>headlamps</b> employing reflector technology have been made using adaptations of both techniques.|$|R
2500|$|In 1940, a {{consortium}} of state motor vehicle administrators standardized upon a system of two [...] round sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> on all vehicles—the only system allowed for 17 years. A system of four round lamps, rather than two, one high/low and one high-beam [...] sealed beam {{on each side of}} the vehicle, introduced in 1957 by Cadillac, Chrysler, DeSoto and Nash on some of their car models in states that permitted the new system. Other American marques followed suit when all states permitted quad lamps in 1958. These lamps permitted more design flexibility. Auto stylists such as Virgil Exner carried out design studies with the low beams in their conventional outboard location, and the <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> vertically stacked at the center-line of the car. No such designs reached volume production; most cars had their headlights in pairs side by side {{on each side of the}} car, and some Oldsmobiles had a parking light in the middle of each pair.|$|R
25|$|Low beam (dipped beam, passing <b>beam,</b> meeting <b>beam)</b> <b>headlamps</b> {{provide a}} {{distribution}} of light {{designed to provide}} adequate forward and lateral illumination, with limits on light directed towards the eyes of other road users to control glare. This beam is intended for use whenever other vehicles are present ahead, whether oncoming or being overtaken.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the DRL mandate, {{countries}} requiring daytime lights permitted low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> {{to provide}} that function. National regulations in Canada, Sweden, Norway, Slovenia, Finland, Iceland, and Denmark require hardwired automatic DRL systems of varying specification. DRLs are permitted in many countries where they are required, but prohibited in other countries not requiring them.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s most serving SAR {{steam and}} {{electric}} locomotives had their original large round headlamps replaced by less attractive but more efficient double sealed-beam automobile headlamps.
