40|$|Seed masting and {{production}} of <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> have often been considered independently as different strategies to reduce seed predation by animals. Here, we integrate both phenomena within the whole assemblage of seed predators (both pre and post-dispersal) and in two contrasting microsites (open vs. sheltered) to improve {{our understanding of the}} factors controlling seed predation in a wind-dispersed tree (Ulmus laevis). In years with larger crop sizes more avian seed predators were attracted with an increase in the proportion of full seeds predated on the ground. However, for abundant crops, the presence of <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> decreased the proportion of full <b>seeds</b> predated. <b>Empty</b> <b>seeds</b> remained for a very long period in the tree, making location of full seeds more difficult for pre-dispersal predators and expanding the overall seed drop period at a very low cost (in dry biomass and allocation of C, N and P). Parthenocarpy (non-fertilized seeds) was the main cause of seed emptiness whereas seed abortion was produced in low quantity. These aborted seeds fell prematurely and, thus, could not work as deceptive seeds. A proportion of 50 % <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> significantly reduced ground seed predation by 26 %. However, a high rate of parthenocarpy (beyond 50 % <b>empty</b> <b>seeds)</b> did not significantly reduce seed predation in comparison to 50 % <b>empty</b> <b>seeds.</b> We also found a high variability and unpredictability in the production of <b>empty</b> <b>seeds,</b> both at tree and population level, making predator deception more effective. Open areas were especially important to facilitate seed survival since rodents (the main post-dispersal predators) consumed seeds mostly under shrub cover. In el...|$|R

Together with yield, oil content and quality, a main aim in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) breeding is {{the selection of}} genotypes with a low percentage of <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> even under cooler climates. We developed NIRS calibrations for seed oil content, oleic and linoleic acid content, the seed hull fraction {{and the percentage of}} <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> using seed meal and intact seeds. For the different calibrations 108 – 534 samples from a safflower breeding program with lines adapted to German conditions, were analyzed with reference analyses (Soxhlet, gas chromatography), and scanned by NIRS as intact seeds and seed meal. Calibration equations were developed and tested through cross validation. The coefficient of determination of the calibration (R 2) for intact seeds ranged from 0. 91 (oil content), 0. 90 (seed hull fraction), 0. 84 (<b>empty</b> <b>seeds),</b> 0. 73 (linoleic acid) to 0. 68 (oleic acid).

40|$|Many {{parasitic}} {{species of}} insects complete their entire development in seeds. They feed off storage reserves within the ovule. These reserves only normally accumulate in fertilized ovules. Consequently, female insects that oviposit their eggs {{directly into the}} plant ovule {{need to be able}} to select correctly, as unfertilized ovules of conifers normally become so-called <b>empty</b> <b>seed.</b> We provide clear evidence that in conifers, seed-parasitizing insects do not need to discriminate between fertilized and unfertilized plant ovules when ovipositing their eggs. A host-specific insect, the chalcid Megastigmus spermotrophus Wachtl (Hymenoptera: Torymidae), lays its eggs in ovules of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco) before fertilization has taken place in the plant. Oviposition not only prevents the expected degeneration and death of unfertilized ovules, but it induces energy reserve accumulation. Ovules that would otherwise develop as <b>empty</b> <b>seed</b> are redirected in their development by the insect to provide food for the developing larvae. Instead of the insect exploiting normal events during seed development, the insect manipulates seed development for its own reproductive advantage...|$|E

However, intense human pressure, adverse climatic conditions and overgrazing degrade Aleppo pine forest ecosystems and render the natural regeneration {{of this species}} difficult.

For these reasons, artificial regeneration may be {{required in order to}} render ecosystem restoration faster. Although P. halepensis is characterized by a high germination capacity and a constant temperature of 20 °C is considered optimal for germination, no research has dealt with the germination behaviour and early growth of seedlings under alternative temperature conditions similar to those dominating outdoors. Moreover, little research was conducted on seed quality characteristics of this species.

An incompatibility between genome B and plastome IV is expressed in the haplo- and diplophase: (1) B-IV pollen, though normally developed, is largely inactive. The extent of the inactivation varies between different strains and shows a seasonal fluctuation as determined by seed set in outcrossing and selfing experiments. (2) In most of the strains lethality of BB-IV embryos is the rule, leading to <b>empty</b> <b>seeds.</b> This can be ameliorated by including another plastome in the zygotes and developing embryos {{on account of the}} biparental plastid transmission in Oenothera. It can best be demonstrated in crosses with a seed parent having normal green plastids of plastome IV and mutated chlorophyll deficient plastids from a different plastome in the pollen parent, leading to variegated progeny as well as a remainder of <b>empty</b> <b>seeds.</b> (3) In about one-half of the strains the BB-IV plants exhibit a temporary bleaching of the virescens type.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Negative {{anthropogenic}} {{influence on}} the environment became visible in the 1980 s {{and the result was}} the emergence of forest degradation. Silver fir (Abies alba) is highly sensitive to atmospheric and pedospheric pollution and {{it is one of the}} most endangered tree species in the entire Europe. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of different levels of crown defoliation on the phenotypic variability between and within the populations of silver fir in the zone of Dinaric beech and fir forests. Material and Methods: Within the area of silver fir forests in the Forest Administrations of Delnice, Senj and Split, permanent experimental plots were established in order to monitor the influence of different levels of crown defoliation on some properties of seeds: germination capacity, the percentage of fresh ungerminated seeds, rotten and decayed <b>seeds,</b> <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> and 1000 seed weight. Statistical analysis was carried out by parametric and non-parametric. Various models of variance analysis were carried out in the analysis of the variability of traits. Results: The average germination capacity of silver fir seeds for the investigated area was 27. 9 %, and ranged from 16. 2 to 39. 3 %. CV was high and indicated a great heterogeneity between the provenances. Average values of fresh ungerminated seeds were 12. 6 %, and ranged from 9. 1 % to 19. 6 %. Average values of dead seeds were 16. 1 % and ranged from 8. 2 to 28. 5 %. The provenances from the area of Gorski kotar showed the largest portion of dead seeds, which was the area with the highest index of forest decline. The average value of <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> in the researched area was 43. 4 % and it ranged from 29. 9 % to 63. 0 %. CV ranged from 33. 9 % to 74. 0 % indicating a heterogeneity within the provenances.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{individual}} species of Larix MILL. are characterized by the extremely high percentage of produced non-vital <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> and therefore (despite the appreciable importance of this genus in forestry and landscape ecology) their breeding, seed management and artificial regeneration are complicated. Concurrently, the Larix species are characterized by large, heavy and wing-less (so-called non-saccate) pollen grains whose mobility is considered relatively low in most cases (DYLIS 1948; CHALUPA 1961, 1985, and others). Besides that, the re-ceptive period of female generative organs is relatively short (BARNER, CHRISTIANSEN 1960; VILLAR et al. 1984; SAID et al. 1991; OWENS et al. 1994) and the success of pollination is closely related to the amount of produced pollen and the existing meteorological conditions during its shedding (KRIŽO, SLOBODNÍK 1996). Concerning these weak links of the pollination process {{and the fact that the}} integument is able to transform into the normally developed testa in unfertilized larch ovules as well (unlike various species of Picea A. DIETR. and Pinus L.), the insufficient pollination could be regarded as a very impor-tant prezygotic factor markedly influencing the full seed production within this genus. According to the studied literature data, however, the chronically high percentage of produced <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> in Larix is not probably caused by a single reason but it is to be considered the result of numerous accidents and irregularities in various processes of the reproductive cycle (KOSIŃSKI 1986, 1987; SHIN, KARNOSKY 1995). In this context, the success of pollina-tion should be studied as one of several factors affecting the quality of the produced larch seeds and the actual importance of insufficient pollination should be assessed and quantified.

The most common agents are facultative parasites (Fusarium graminearum, Helminthosporium sativum, Septoria nodorum). They are believed to be extremely harmful since their influence on the essential seed functions are negative. The research was done on two wheat cultivars (Ţitarka and Demetra). Significant differences in micopopulation were registered at two points - immediately after harvesting and after seed storage - despite the used methods (filter paper, moist chamber, deep-freezing, germination in sand) and applied fungicides (Raxil 2 WS and Vitavax 200 FF). The most numerous micopopulation was established in non-treated seed after harvesting by freezing method. There were 9 fungi genera determined of which weretwo facultative parasites. All research done on treated seed showed that there was a smaller number of fungi species and the percentage of the infected seed was lower.

40|$|Suren (Toona sinensis) is a {{potential}} multipurpose species that is more cultivated at upland community forests, especially in Java and Sumatra islands. This research was aimed to assess the variation of fruit and seed morpho-physiological characters and to investigate the contribution of geoclimate and genetic factors on the fruit and seed morpho-physiological characters of suren. Seeds were collected from seven populations in West Sumatera, Jambi and West Java on March – May 2015. Morphological parameters measured were size and weight of fruits and seeds, while the physiological parameters measured were seed germination and storability. Analysis of variance revealed significant morpho-physiological differences among populations for all the morpho-physiological parameters studied. Cimalaka population provided the better seed quality compared to seed quality from the other populations, mainly for seed physiological parameters. Most of the parameters was not correlated with geo-climate factors, except for number of <b>empty</b> <b>seed</b> that negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and seed wing width negatively correlated with altitude. Genotypic variance and genotypic coefficient of variance for all fruit and seed parameters {{were found to be}} higher than corresponding environment variance and environment coefficient of variance, indicating that the genotype explained most of the variance for these parameters. In particular, high heritability values coupled with high genetic gain were found for germination capacity and germination speed. Principal component analysis of various parameters of fruit and seed revealed that most of the geographically distant populations are genetically close...|$|E
25|$|Seed {{viability}} is {{the ability}} of the embryo to germinate and is affected by a number of different conditions. Some plants do not produce seeds that have functional complete embryos, or the seed may have no embryo at all, often called <b>empty</b> <b>seeds.</b> Predators and pathogens can damage or kill the seed while it is still in the fruit or after it is dispersed. Environmental conditions like flooding or heat can kill the seed before or during germination. The age of the seed affects its health and germination ability: since the seed has a living embryo, over time cells die and cannot be replaced. Some seeds can live {{for a long time before}} germination, while others can only survive for a short period after dispersal before they die.|$|R
2500|$|Pinyon jays forage on {{the ground}} and in dead, fallen trees for insects and cached seeds. They also forage in the crevices of live trees for cached pinyon seeds, feed on the tips of ponderosa pine {{branches}} where new growth has occurred, and forage in the canopy for pinyon and ponderosa pine cones. If a cone is ripe but closed, the pinyon jay removes it to a place where it can be held open with the bird's feet. Then the bird hammers the cone open with its bill. Pinyon jays can differentiate between filled and <b>empty</b> <b>seeds</b> by a combination of color, weight, and sound produced by clicking seeds with their bills. Pinyon jays can hold up to 43 ponderosa pine seeds [...] and 56 pinyon seeds in their expandable esophagus.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{series of}} {{strains of the}} {{homozygous}} species Oenothera grandiflora (characterized by the genome BB and plastome III) were combined with plastome IV from O. parviflora (BC-IV) by means of appropriate crosses. An incompatibility between genome B and plastome IV is expressed in the haplo- and diplophase: (1) B-IV pollen, though normally developed, is largely inactive. The extent of the inactivation varies between different strains and shows a seasonal f uctuation as determined by seed set in outcrossing and selling experiments. (2) In most of the strains lethality of BB-IV embryos is the rule, leading to <b>empty</b> <b>seeds.</b> This can be ameliorated by including another plastome in the zygotes and developing embryos {{on account of the}} biparental plastid transmission i Oenothera. It can best be demonstrated in crosses with a seed parent havin...|$|R
