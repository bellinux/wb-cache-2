This article discusses and analyses the application of <b>kiosks</b> as a channel for in-store service delivery. For these <b>kiosks</b> a taxonomy that characterises <b>kiosks</b> by their function: inform, interact, transact and relate is proposed. Eight case study examples of in store <b>kiosks</b> are analysed in using a framework that includes environment, task, audience, and technology. Included are: <b>kiosks</b> used by Halifax, Daewoo, Argos, Ikea, Debenhams, GNER, Sainsbury’s. and Boots.

During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the <b>kiosk</b> as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E
5|$|Ben Youssef Mosque, {{distinguished}} by its green tiled roof and minaret, {{is located in}} the medina and is Marrakesh's oldest mosque. It was originally built in the 12th century by the Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in honor of Yusuf ibn Ali al-Sanhaji. When built it was the city's largest mosque but today it is half its original size. It was rebuilt in the 1560s by Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib, as the original had fallen into ruin. He also built a madrasa with a large library beside the mosque, but this also deteriorated over time, leaving only the 19th-century mosque intact. The Almoravid Koubba Ba’adiyn, a two-storied <b>kiosk,</b> was discovered in a sunken location on the mosque site in 1948. In the Moroccan architectural style, its arches are scalloped on the first floor, while those on the second floor bear a twin horseshoe shape embellished with a turban motif. The dome of the <b>kiosk</b> is framed by a battlement decorated with arches and seven-pointed stars. The interior of the octagonally arched dome is decorated with distinctive carvings bordered by a Kufic frieze inscribed with the name of its patron, Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. The quinches at the corners of the dome are covered with muqarnas. The <b>kiosk</b> has motifs of pine cones, palms and acanthus leaves which are also replicated in the Ben Youssef Madrasa.|$|E

30|$|Research {{suggests}} that consumers’ evaluations of electronic <b>kiosks</b> in consumer goods stores {{are influenced by}} a number of features. In particular, consumers prefer <b>kiosks</b> that provide information about product assortment, that allow them to place merchandise orders, and that offer multiple options for merchandise delivery (Koller and Kőnigsecker 2012). Although consumer goods retailers have traditionally used electronic <b>kiosks</b> in in-store settings, recently, some retailers have incorporated <b>kiosks</b> into their store exteriors, providing consumers with after-hours access to a variety of retail goods and services. For instance, in 2013 the Kate Spade Saturday concept store in New York City integrated electronic <b>kiosks</b> into its storefronts, allowing consumers to make product purchases and to schedule local deliveries within a one-hour timeframe (Brooke 2013). How consumers respond to “street-side” electronic <b>kiosks</b> at consumer goods retailers—or those that are part of a store’s exterior—is unknown; to date, research examining consumers’ evaluations of electronic <b>kiosks</b> for consumer goods retailers have focused upon in-store applications.|$|R
