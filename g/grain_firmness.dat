40|$|Palm oil {{replacement}} with a monoglyceride (MG) -sunflower oil-water gel {{was investigated}} {{to reduce the}} overall saturated fat content of white bread. Bread was prepared incorporating either palm oil, monoglyceride-palm oil-water gel (MG-PO-G) or monoglyceride-sunflower oil-water gel (MG-SO-G) keeping constant the total fat content. The substitution allowed a saturated fat reduction of 81 % in MG-SO-G containing bread. Samples were analyzed for volume, moisture, crumb <b>grain,</b> <b>firmness</b> and proton density/mobility using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of MG-SO-G allowed the saturated lipid content of bread to be reduced without modifying moisture, volume, crumb grain and firmness. The incorporation of MG gel promoted a peculiar system morphology characterized by lower proton mobility and more uniform fat distribution {{in comparison to the}} standard product. This system morphology was associated to a decrease in bread staling during storag...|$|E
40|$|The {{potentialities}} of monoglyceride (MG) organogel and hydrogel containing {{sunflower oil}} in replacing palm oil were studied in sweet breads. This substitution {{was addressed to}} reduce the total saturated fat content of the product. The effects of the palm oil substitution were determined by assessing bread specific volume, moisture, crumb <b>grain,</b> <b>firmness,</b> and proton density/mobility by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sweet bread prepared with hydrogel has quality characteristics {{comparable to that of}} control palm oil sample. This result was attributed to the capacity of MG crystallized lamellas to favor oil spreading over flour, replacing the typical functionality of triacylglycerol crystal networks. On the contrary, when oil was embedded in the organogel structure, less leavened and firmer bread with inhomogeneous lipid distribution was obtained. In this case, monoglycerides were probably engaged in oil networking and were less available to interact with other ingredients and exert their softening and anti-staling activities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|In this study, gluten free breads (GFBs) {{made from}} rice and carob flour in {{different}} proportions were investigated. Water added changed {{in response to}} the carob amount. Structural and textural parameters of the samples such as porosity, crumb <b>grain</b> characteristics, <b>firmness</b> and relative elasticity of crumb, were measured. Simple mathematical models were developed to correlate the measured properties with carob flour and water content. The simplest and most convenient mathematical model developed was a power model, indicating that water influence on GFBs characteristics was more pronounced than that of carob flour. Carob flour addition enhanced the protein, fiber and minerals amount of the produced samples, and improved their functional properties as well, when water amount used was adequate. GFBs with a ratio of carob flour/water 10 / 110, 15 / 130 and 15 / 140 presented higher quality, in terms of dough proofing, porosity, crumb firmness and viscoelasticity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
