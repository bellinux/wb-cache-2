5|$|Harry {{arranged}} for the future Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, to see them perform a lunchtime concert at the Cavern Club on 9 November 1961. Epstein subsequently asked Harry to create a national music paper, the Music Echo, but after disagreements with Epstein about editorial control, he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> P.R. agent; working for many solo artistes and groups, including Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and the Beach Boys, {{as well as many}} others.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{entering}} professional wrestling, Pigeon gained combat sport {{experience by}} studying judo. He {{worked for the}} Quebec Provincial Police until the mid-1960s, when he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> wrestler. His friend Paul LeDuc had competed as a professional wrestler in Mexico and wanted a tag team partner. He convinced Pigeon to train as a wrestler, and Pigeon trained under Stu Hart in Calgary, Alberta.|$|E
5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago and {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a dissertation {{on the history of}} Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E

25|$|Wingårdh studied economics, {{art history}} and {{architecture}} in the 1970s at Gothenburg University and Chalmers University of Technology, and has in interviews stated {{that it was a}} visit to the Pantheon, Rome, that made him <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> architect.

5|$|She <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> model {{when she}} was 18. She signed with a models agency that sent her to Japan, but after several failed auditions, she {{returned}} to Sydney. There, she was hired to work in advertising for a department store, that exposed her {{to the attention of}} Follow Me, a magazine which hired her as an assistant fashion editor. A casual invitation to participate in a drama workshop inspired Watts to quit her job and to pursue her acting ambitions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hastings returned, he had <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> barrister. There were various {{problems}} with this aim: in particular, he had no money, and the training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change of career, and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he chose this particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with the Bar, {{was a member of}} the Inner Temple), but the most likely explanation was that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a barrister were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of £100 when he was called to the Bar – £100 in 1901 would be worth approximately £ in 2015 – and Hastings was literally penniless.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1717, Stede Bonnet <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> pirate, despite having no {{knowledge}} of shipboard life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sixty-ton sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the Revenge. This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny or boarding, or else converted a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by his crew. In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. Royal Navy intelligence reported that he departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados under cover of darkness.|$|E

5|$|Henry Moore {{was born}} in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale {{colliery}} in Castleford. He was an autodidact {{with an interest in}} music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{was born}} on April 21, 1980, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, as the younger of fraternal twin girls and the second of three children. As a child, she {{originally}} dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Hoshino confessed she was not too interested in school, often making excuses to avoid taking classes. Additionally, she added that would often practise drawing {{in the middle of}} the classes which gave her doubts when she had to erase them. She drew her first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. She dreamed of bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006. After graduating from high school, Hoshino did not know what career should she follow as she was offered the work of joining video game companies. Ultimately, she <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> manga author despite her fears of the difficulty it takes.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, in {{preparation}} for independence, Nigeria's first university opened. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe obtained such high marks in the entrance examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine. It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After reading Joyce Cary's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons that he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> writer. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist {{as a sign of}} the author's cultural ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is shot.|$|E

5|$|In Gay's {{final year}} as an amateur athlete he started well, setting a {{personal}} best and school record of 6.55s in the 60m at the 2005 Championship Series. He helped the university team to another NCAA outdoor victory, setting a new personal best of 19.93s in the 200m qualifiers and placing third in the finals. Training partner and friend Wallace Spearmon took first place with 19.91s—his time and Gay's 19.93s were the second and third-fastest 200m times {{in the world that}} year. The pair teamed up for the 4 x 100m relay, along with Michael Grant and Omar Brown, and won with an Arkansas-record-breaking time of 38.49s. With the NCAA Championships behind him, in June 2005 Gay <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> professional athlete, setting his sights on a place in the US 200m team for the Helsinki World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{probably}} began {{fighting in}} June 1783, {{at the age}} of thirty-three, although Brailsford suggests it was 1781 or slightly earlier. Johnson had unintentionally slighted a carman (horse-drawn wagon driver) and fighter called Jack Jarvis, who then called for Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour. Johnson comprehensively battered the experienced Jarvis at Lock's Fields, and his name {{came to the attention of}} professional fighters. At that time Johnson had no intention of earning a living from the sport, but he became so goaded by a professional known as The Croydon Drover that a fight was arranged for March 1784, at Kennington Common. Johnson beat the Drover to a pulp in 27minutes and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> professional.|$|E
5|$|Little {{information}} was revealed about Armada of the Damned plot. Sterling had {{no connection with}} the film series' characters and story arcs. The game and the films shared the same universe, but the former was to take place before {{the events of the}} latter. Sterling, raised in a poor family, was a young adventurer with dreams of fame and fortune who <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> pirate. Although he was killed on his first voyage, Sterling was revived by supernatural forces which gave him a second chance. After these events, the player had the option to follow two paths: become either a Legendary or a Dreaded pirate. On the Legendary path, the player would be a well-respected pirate who acted in good faith. On the Dreaded path, the player would be mysterious and feared.|$|E

5|$|Mitsuda {{was born}} in Tokuyama, Japan, on January 21, 1972, and {{was raised in the}} Kumage District of Yamaguchi Prefecture. He took piano lessons {{beginning}} at the age of five, but was more interested in sports at the time and did not take music seriously, quitting by the age of six. For a while, he wanted to become a professional golfer. While in high school, Mitsuda rediscovered music, inspired by Vangelis' Blade Runner and Henry Mancini's The Pink Panther film scores. After watching Railman, he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> music composer. He became interested in PCs after his father bought him one, which was a rare item at the time. He started to program computer games and compose music for them, as well as take more technically oriented classes.|$|E
5|$|Recalling her {{inability}} to help the wounded people whom she saw during the Second World War, Hsu <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> nurse. As she was overaged at 47, she wrote a request to the chief matron of the Nursing Council in London. Touched by Hsu's sincerity and dedication, her application was accepted. She spent eight years in England doing nursing and another eight in Paraguay {{as a member of}} the German charity group Bruderhof, to start hospitals and homes for the aged there. In her mid-50s, she decided to return home to Penang to be with her mother. In Malaysia, she assisted her brother in starting the Assunta Foundation for the Poor in Ipoh.

Throughout 1988, she feuded with Sensational Sherri for the WWF Women's Championship.|$|E

5|$|Waller taught Sunday school {{while in}} his early teens. When he was 15, he {{attended}} Williams College, from which he graduated in 1834. At Williams College, he came near to being expelled after arguing with a teacher. After Williams College, he considered being a lawyer, businessman or government worker. His brother William advised against his becoming a government worker or businessman, so he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> minister. He attended the Princeton Theological Seminary starting in October 1834 and continuing for three years. Here he also came near to being expelled after a dispute with the teacher John Breckenridge. He graduated from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1837 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree. Waller moved to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1838.|$|E
5|$|Walter Krueger {{was born}} in Flatow, West Prussia, then part of the German Empire, but now part of Poland. He {{was the son of}} Julius Krüger, a Prussian {{landowner}} who had served as an officer in the Franco-Prussian War, and his wife, Anna, formerly Hasse. Following Julius's death, Anna and her three children emigrated to the United States to be near her uncle in St. Louis, Missouri. Walter was then eight years old. In St. Louis, Anna married Emil Carl Schmidt, a Lutheran minister. The family subsequently settled in Madison, Indiana. Krueger was educated at the Upper Seminary School in Madison, and the Cincinnati Technical High School in Cincinnati, Ohio.

That same year, Deguchi asked Ueshiba to become the group's martial arts instructor, and a dojo—the first of several that Ueshiba was to lead—was constructed on the centre's grounds. Ueshiba also taught Takeda's Daitō-ryū in neighbouring Hyōgo Prefecture during this period. His second son, Kuniharu, was born in 1920 in Ayabe, but died from illness the same year, along with three-year-old Takemori.|$|E
