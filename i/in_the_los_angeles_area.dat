5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s, California fought for its {{independence}} from Mexico in the Mexican–American War. The Santa Ana river played {{an important part in}} the victory of the Americans over the Mexican army. In 1847, one year after the Bear Flag Revolt, a Mexican military force set out northwards to attack a smaller American force <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>area.</b> However, the Santa Ana River flooded, preventing the Mexicans from crossing the river to attack the Americans. When the river's flow finally subsided, the American forces had been reinforced enough to drive the Mexicans out of the region.|$|E
5|$|State Route 47 (SR 47) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California, {{connecting}} Terminal Island to the mainland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>area.</b> From its south end at I-110 in San Pedro, it heads east across the Vincent Thomas Bridge to the island {{and the end of}} state maintenance.

5|$|The first {{champion}} was Gypsy Joe, who won {{the title}} on November 6, 1952. In 1957 the NWA stripped Frank Stojack of the title for lack of NWA-mandated title defenses, but Stojack kept the physical belt and defended the title {{for over a year}} until the NWA regained possession of the actual Championship belt. After Stojack was stripped of the title, the NWA Executive board decided to give Salvador Lutteroth and Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre control of the championship in 1958. The first champion under Lutteroth's authority was Dory Dixon, who had worked for EMLL for many years. During the late 1970s and early 1980s the title was also defended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>area</b> until that promotion closed in the early 1980s; from then on the title has only been defended in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The 15-year-long Lebanese Civil War {{that started}} in 1975 and the Iranian {{revolution}} of 1979 greatly contributed to the influx of Middle Eastern Armenians to the US. The Armenian communities in these Middle Eastern countries were well established and integrated, but not assimilated, into local populations. Armenians in Lebanon and Iran are represented in the parliaments as ethnic minorities. Many lived in luxury in their former countries, and more easily handled multilingualism, while retaining aspects of traditional Armenian culture. This wave of newcomers revitalized the Armenian American community, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>area,</b> where most second-wave Armenian immigrants settled. In 1970 about 65,000 Armenians resided in Southern California, and two decades later, in 1989, the number of Armenian Americans was estimated at 200,000. Although the 1980 US Census put the number of Armenians living in Los Angeles at 52,400, of which 71.9% were foreign born: 14.7% in Iran, 14.3% in the USSR, 11.5% in Lebanon, 9.7% in Turkey, 11.7% in other Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, etc.), and the rest {{in other parts of}} the world.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Chaplin {{received}} three awards {{from the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. At the first Academy Awards ceremony, held on 16 May 1929, he was originally nominated for Best Actor and Best Director for The Circus (1928). The Academy dropped his two nominations, {{and he won}} an honorary award for writing, directing, producing, and acting. In 1972, {{he returned to the}} United States after nearly two decades to receive another honorary award, this time for his overall achievements in cinema. The following year, Chaplin's score for Limelight received the Academy Award for Best Music. Although 20 years old by this time, Limelight had not been released <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>area</b> until 1972, and had not been eligible for Academy Award consideration before then. Chaplin also received Academy Award nominations in 1940 for Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay for The Great Dictator. In 1942, Chaplin released a new version of The Gold Rush, taking the original silent 1925 film and composing and recording a musical score which was not released in 1925. The Gold Rush was nominated for Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture). His last nomination was in 1947 for his screenplay of Monsieur Verdoux.|$|E

5|$|The {{moisture}} {{extended into}} southern California and produced moderate precipitation across the region. Bakersfield reported a one-day rainfall record on September 4 with 0.23inches (5.8mm) of precipitation, breaking {{the previous record}} of 0.17inches (4.3mm) set in 1963. Rainfall amounts at Frazier Park peaked at 1.53inches (39mm). Agricultural losses, primarily from vintners and raisin growers, rose up to $5million in damage (1998USD, $6.33million 2007USD), either directly due to rain or indirectly due to the additional steps to treat the increase in fungus activity on produce. Slick roads from the rain resulted in nearly 80traffic accidents in San Diego County, ranging from fender benders to moderate injuries. Thunderstorms from the remnants of Isis damaged a San Diego Gas & Electric substation at Kearny Mesa, leaving 10,000customers without power; the outage was short lived and completely restored within two hours. About 1,000homes and businesses were temporarily without power in Escondido, and another 2,700customers lost electricity in Rancho Bernardo. Rainfall in and around San Diego reached a maximum of 0.5inches (13mm) at La Mesa.
