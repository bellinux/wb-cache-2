5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was not identified. A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F. Repraesentin E showed the strongest <b>growth</b> <b>promotion</b> activity, 164% at 3.6µm, of the three compounds toward the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings.|$|E

25|$|Fungal endophytes {{which provide}} {{defensive}} services to their host plants may exert selective pressures favouring association through enhanced fitness relative to uninfected hosts. The fungus Neotyphodium spp. infects grasses and increases fitness under conditions {{with high levels}} of interspecific competition. It does this through a combination of benefits including anti-herbivore defenses and growth promoting factors. The customary assumption that plant <b>growth</b> <b>promotion</b> is the main way fungal mutualists improve fitness under attack from herbivores is changing; alteration of plant chemical composition and induced resistance are now recognized as factors of great importance in improving competitive ability and fecundity. Plants undefended by chemical or physical means at certain points in their life histories have higher survival rates when infected with beneficial endophytic fungi. The general trend of plants infected with mutualistic fungi outperforming uninfected plants under moderate to high herbivory exerts selection for higher levels of fungal association as herbivory levels increase. Unsurprisingly, low to moderate levels of herbivore damage also increases the levels of infection by beneficial endophytic fungi.|$|E
40|$|While {{it is well}} {{established}} that both promotions within firms and mobility across firms lead to significant earnings progression, {{little is known about}} the interaction between these types of mobility. Exploiting a large Danish panel data set and controlling for unobserved individual heterogeneity, we show that cross-firm moves at the non-executive level provide sizeable short-run gains (similar to the effect of a promotion), consistent with the existing literature. These gains, however, appear modest when compared with the persistent impact on earnings <b>growth</b> of <b>promotions</b> (either within or across firms) and subsequent mobility at a higher hierarchy level. earnings <b>growth,</b> <b>promotions,</b> dynamic panel data models, matched employer-employee data...|$|R

[...] Also, the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA) was enacted to eliminate the use of medically important antibiotics in livestock. [...] In 2015, the Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act (PARA) was passed with two components: requirement of drug companies to provide evidence that antibiotics that are approved for use in poultry, and that meat production does not add to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in humans.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the functional form for {{formal training in}} a wage equation and derive estimates of its rate of return. The cube root fits best in our two data sets. We show that if wages are not adjusted continuously, estimating the return to training requires one lag and one lead of training. Using the cube root and a semi-nonparametric estimator, estimated returns are 150 – 180 percent. Adjusting for heterogeneity in wage <b>growth,</b> <b>promotions,</b> and direct costs reduces the return to 40 – 50 percent. We find evidence of heterogeneity in returns. Our estimates can thus {{be regarded as the}} return to training for the trained, but cannot be extrapolated to the untrained. ...|$|R

40|$|Promotions and cross-firm {{mobility}} provide substantial {{gains in}} earnings – a well established finding based on gross income data. Yet, what matters for incentives {{is how much}} an individual can consume or save after taxation. We show that net and gross income growth patterns may differ substantially when a progressive tax system allows for deduction opportunities. Exploiting unique matched employer-employee data with information on tax payments and employee mobility, we find that gross income gains from promotions and cross-firm mobility do not translate into significantly higher net income growth, because employees adjust their tax-shielded consumption and savings (in particular, deductible private pension contributions and mortgage-financed housing) to maintain constant net income <b>growth.</b> earnings <b>growth,</b> <b>promotions,</b> mobility, taxable income, dynamic panel data models, matched employer-employee data...|$|R

30|$|Positive {{effects on}} plant growth and {{particularly}} on root development at low RZT were detected exclusively for seaweed extracts with high Zn/Mn contents and similar <b>growth</b> <b>promotions</b> were induced by Zn and Mn application in comparable amounts. This {{finding suggests that}} the selected seaweed extracts were mainly acting via improved Zn and Mn supply to the plants. It was essential that the cold-stress protectants were present during seed imbibition. The beneficial effect of Zn/Mn treatments and sea weed extracts was associated with increased superoxide dismutase activity in the root and leaf tissue, with key functions in antioxidative stress defense, depending on Zn, Mn, Cu, and Fe as enzymatic co-factors. Accordingly, leaf damage, shoot and root growth inhibition in cold-stressed plants {{was associated with a}} low Zn-nutritional status, mitigated by application of the cold-stress protectants.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{over the}} past two decades has demonstrated support for a curvilinear-shaped relationship between job performance and voluntary turnover, such that highest and lowest performers are most likely to quit while moderate level performers stay. The purpose of this study was to explore this curvilinear relationship and extend findings to the technology industry. Specifically, the U-shaped curvilinear relationship and moderators were tested, which included rewards variables (salary <b>growth,</b> <b>promotions,</b> and multi-level promotions) and economic-related variables (unemployment rates and salary in comparison to those in the external market). Consistent with our hypothesis, analyses revealed evidence of the U-shaped curvilinear performance-turnover relationship. There was no support found for moderator effects on the curvilinear relationship, contrary to our hypotheses. Results suggest factors assessed do not impact the curvilinear performance-turnover relationship, and moderating effects may depend on specific company contexts...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the relation between job performance and voluntary employee turnover for 5, 143 exempt employees in a single firm in the petroleum industry. As hypothesized, we found support for Jackofsky 2 ̆ 7 s (1984) curvilinear hypothesis as turnover was higher for low and high performers {{than it was for}} average performers. Three potential moderators of this curvilinearity were examined in an attempt to explain conflicting results in the performance turnover literature and contradictory predictions from turnover models. As predicted, pay <b>growth,</b> <b>promotions,</b> and labor demand each differentially influenced the turnover patterns of low, average, and high performers. Most notably, paying high performers according to their performance predicted substantial decrements in turnover. A utility analysis indicated that the benefits of paying high performers according to their performance more than offset the costs and that such an approach was a superior strategy when compared to a more egalitarian pay growth policy...|$|R
