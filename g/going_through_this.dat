Walker also claims his diet is made up mostly of soup, bread, and salads. Instead of lifting weights, he has a daily regimen of 750 to 1,500 push-ups and 2,000 sit-ups. He has been <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> same routine since high school.|$|E
25|$|The battles {{continued}} to rage behind the leading trio, as Grosjean started to attack 4th placed Webber. The Red Bull driver {{decided to make}} a second pitstop for new tyres and rejoined in 8th place, behind Rosberg and Pérez, but ahead of Räikkönen. Felipe Massa, who was unable to regain the places he lost due to his spin, was now back up to 5th place as he too attempted a one-stopper. That did not work out however, and Rosberg had closed right up to him by lap 55, and brought Pérez, Webber and Räikkönen along. Rosberg attacked Massa on the DRS zone, but overshot the last chicane and had to give the position back. Pérez took advantage of this and was right behind Massa, which meant that he too was able to get the jump on Rosberg when he handed the place back to Massa. He then passed Massa on the same lap, with Rosberg also <b>going</b> <b>through,</b> <b>this</b> time doing the job cleanly. The Brazilian had enough, and pitted for a new set of tyres and rejoined in 10th place, where he stayed till the end.|$|E

The alleged omission related to a question whereby Ms. Spears was asked if {{in the past five years}} she had had any surgery. Ms. Spears, in all prior circumstances, had indicated she had, but at the time she was <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> application she did answer 'no.' It had not been a full five years, but four years and eleven months since the surgery [...] and even if she had answered in the affirmative, our contention is that it makes no difference".|$|E

500|$|After {{their debut}} album Murmur (1983) {{received}} critical acclaim, R.E.M. quickly {{began work on}} their second album. The band wrote new material prodigiously; lead guitarist Peter Buck recalled, [...] "We were <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> streak where we were writing two good songs a week [...] We {{just wanted to do}} it; whenever we had a new batch of songs, it was time to record". Due to the number of new songs the band had, Buck unsuccessfully tried to convince everyone to make the next album a double album. In November 1983, the band recorded 22 songs during a session with Neil Young producer Elliot Mazer in San Francisco. While Mazer was briefly considered as a candidate to produce the band's next album, R.E.M. ultimately decided to team up again with Murmur producers Mitch Easter and Don Dixon.|$|E
500|$|Kiersten Warren also {{returned}} to the series as Nora Huntington after being introduced {{at the end of}} the second season. On her storyline, Warren commented, [...] "There's a lot of families who are <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this.</b> Not quite the surprise ooh, boo, child, but children from other marriages and trying to meld these families. I think a lot of people have to deal with it. I think it's fantastic that they’re doing this on the show." [...] Dougray Scott made his debut in this episode as Ian Hainsworth, Susan's romantic interest. Cherry opined that the character [...] "can legitimately rival Mike for [...] affections." [...] Daily commented on the storyline, saying: [...] "Talk about dark comedy — we're trying to find the humor in these two people bonding over the fact that they each have a partner in a coma." [...] Scott called his character [...] "bumbling at times," [...] adding, [...] "He kind of blossoms after he rediscovers his romantic juices with Susan." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{said that}} while {{producing}} the song, they attempted to find out [...] "how to make dance music" [...] without turning themselves into a dance act. Armstrong {{said it was the}} first time the band had written a dance song. Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound compared the song with the works of The Rapture and The Clash's 1982 album, Combat Rock; he said it was [...] "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere". According to Armstrong, the lyrics of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] can be considered as [...] "a sweeping political statement" [...] rather than being interpreted as [...] "a comment on electronic music figures". He told Rolling Stone the song is about [...] "static and noise...Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left—it doesn’t matter. It blows your mind and pisses you off. It’s a song about being drunk, <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> chaos, feeling fucked up and all you want to do is get more drunk".|$|E

500|$|In December 2011, Disney {{announced}} that the film would be converted to 3D. Said Whedon, [...] "I'm {{not a big fan}} of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years." [...] Whedon also said that [...] "there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D" [...] but [...] "The Avengers isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway". In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor.|$|E

[...] This was his seventh appearance {{on the cover of}} the magazine. The article interviewed Alfredsson, Fisher and Murray, and discussed the up-and-down play of the team, and its defensive play which has allowed more goals than previous seasons. Wayne Gretzky was quoted about the team: [...] "This might mature them as a team <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> tough patch." ...|$|E

2500|$|Every single {{thermodynamic}} system {{exists in a}} particular state. When a system is taken {{through a series of}} different states and finally returned to its initial state, a thermodynamic cycle is said to have occurred. In the process of <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a heat engine. A system undergoing a Carnot cycle is called a Carnot heat engine, although such a [...] "perfect" [...] engine is only a theoretical construct and cannot be built in practice. However, a microscopic Carnot heat engine has been designed and run.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{influence}} on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke highly praise to Richard Pryor, [...] "What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude. The fact that someone was able to open themselves wide-open like that. It's so hard to talk {{in front of people}} or to open yourself up to your closest friends. But to open yourself up for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot my car. And nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand. And when I was <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> thing this year, that is the example I would think to myself that gave me the courage to just go back on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|JR is {{eventually}} informed of Babe's one-night stand with Josh {{by her father}} (David Hayward). Not believing it, even when Josh confirms the encounter, viewers saw JR try {{to move on with}} his life and be happy with Babe. Once his suspicion gets the better of him, however, he confronts Babe about the matter. Babe tells the truth, and, in a dramatic fashion, JR later throws himself out a two-story window while drunk. While recovering, he insists that he no longer loves Babe. To add further conflict, Babe is written as thoroughly determined to win JR back; she undermines his wishes not to live with her. [...] "Babe is at the Chandler mansion. JR is home from the hospital and Babe isn't letting up," [...] said Havins. [...] "She's very dedicated to getting through to him. She's not saying, 'Let's get back together and forget anything ever happened.' It's more like, 'Let's try to move forward.' They aren't having an 'I love you' moment or anything like that, but she breaks the ice a little bit." [...] In addition, Babe's refusal to let JR go is happening during a serial killer arc, where Babe's life is in danger and one of her good friends (Erin Lavery) has just been murdered by the killer. In a moment where Babe confides to JR about this, viewers again witnessed the couple's star-crossed theme. [...] "He's sleeping and she is crying at his bedside and says, 'I need you so much.' Not only is she <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this,</b> but she doesn't have her rock and best friend to lean on," [...] stated Havins. [...] "It's a lonely place to be. He opens his eyes and almost makes the move to connect — but then he doesn't." ...|$|E

From 1977 through 1981, Jerry and Debbie performed as [...] "The Burgans", supported by bassist Paul Foti.|$|R
5000|$|Young Romes {{opinion of}} this album is that, [...] "Its far from what Immature did. Its more mature—more about my {{personal}} life and what Ive been through.

5000|$|The {{songs were}} {{recorded}} at different times, mostly in 2000 and 2001, but some {{dating back to}} 1990. [...] "What Would Jesus Do" [...] was recorded {{live in a small}} house in Kentucky by Sebadoh member Jason Loewenstein during rehearsals for the band's 1999 release, The Sebadoh, and was co-written by that album's drummer Russ Pollard, who also provided backup vocals.

Perforce, because he was born in our horde he stayed with us; but in actuality he was an atavism and his place was elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|Rollo here {{observed}} {{that there was}} an open gateway in front of the Horse Guards, and beyond it an arched passage, leading directly through the centre of the building to some place in the rear of it. There were a great many people coming and <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> passage way; so many, in fact, as to make it evident that it was a public thoroughfare. Rollo asked his uncle George where that passage way led to.|$|E
5000|$|The Northern Pacific Railway [...] "A line" [...] tracks once {{formed the}} {{southern}} {{boundary of the}} University of Minnesota East Bank campus. but as the University grew, the campus expanded southward around the railroad. The railroad noise, congestion, and pollution caused problems around the campus. In response, the Northern Pacific Railway built a new bridge that angled north of the campus, connecting with an existing railroad line <b>going</b> <b>through</b> Dinkytown. <b>This</b> enabled campus expansion and allowed the Northrop Mall to be built.|$|R
