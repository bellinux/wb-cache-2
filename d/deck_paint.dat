5000|$|The first {{documented}} tarot packs {{were recorded}} between 1430 and 1450 in Milan, Ferrara and Bologna when additional trump cards with allegorical illustrations {{were added to}} the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called carte da trionfi, triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as trionfi, which became [...] "trumps" [...] in English. These cards are documented in a written statement in the court records in Florence, in 1440. The oldest surviving tarot cards are from fifteen <b>decks</b> <b>painted</b> in the mid 15th century for the Visconti-Sforza family, the rulers of Milan. During the 16th-century, a new game played with a standard deck but sharing the same name (triomphe) was quickly becoming popular. This coincided with the older game being renamed tarocchi.|$|R

5|$|Japanese {{ships were}} {{generally}} not camouflaged. In special tactical situations, camouflage could be improvised, {{as when the}} battleships Yamato and Musashi had their decks blackened {{with a mixture of}} soot to help them hide while passing through the San Bernardino Strait at night in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. Japanese ships largely retained their pre-war dark gray paint scheme, although some major units like aircraft carriers changed to a dark sea green. Some aircraft carriers had their flight <b>decks</b> <b>painted</b> in a dazzle camouflage, but this seems to have been ineffective. By 1945, with the remnants of the Japanese Navy seeking to hide from American air power, its battleships were painted in a variety of camouflage measures. Haruna for example wore olive green overall, its turrets painted light green with gray stripes, whereas Ises olive dress was broken up with patches of gray, red-brown, yellow, and dark green.|$|R
50|$|The crew moved {{aboard and}} quickly made the ship their home by {{resealing}} <b>decks,</b> <b>painting,</b> and generally taking ownership. Along with this came {{a plethora of}} repairs and upgrades, which increased Pioneers material readiness. Pioneer then completed a successful CART II and N43 visit and {{made its way to}} Panama City, Florida for a Squadron 1 exercise. En route to this exercise, LCDR Samuel Norton relieved CDR Clay Harris as Commanding Officer of Pioneer. The crew remained focussed and performed admirably during the Mine Warfare Exercise. Following a brief port visit to Tampa, Florida, the ship returned to Ingleside, Texas to complete preparations for another mine warfare exercise (GOMEX 2000). Pioneer participated in the exercise off the coast of Corpus Christi, Texas and the ship and crew's performance was outstanding. With precision and polish, they led the way for mine countermeasures. Members of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 3's Detachment 15 aided Pioneer in this task.|$|R

40|$|The cooling {{of small}} {{buildings}} at night by radiation {{loss to the}} sky has been investigated by monitoring the thermal performance of two huts: one roofed with galvanised steel <b>decking</b> <b>painted</b> white, which acts as a [`]black body' for wavelengths greater than 3 [mu]m; the other with aluminium decking to which aluminised [`]Tedlar' sheet had been glued, the [`]Tedlar' acting as a selective surface absorbing and radiating mainly in the 8 - 13 [mu]m band. The hut with the painted roof was cooled marginally better than that with the [`]Tedlar' covered roof. Useful cooling powers of 22 Wm- 2 were achieved at a roof temperature of 5 Â°C, ambient 10 Â°C, and the gross cooling power probably exceeded 29 Wm- 2. Calculations based on a simple simulation of the sky radiation yield an upper limit of 40 Wm- 2 for the cooling power of the surfaces and suggest that an ideally selective surface operating under the best possible clear-sky conditions has little advantage over a black body radiator unless {{the temperature of the}} surfaces is significantly lower than the ambient air temperature. ...|$|R
50|$|Over the {{northern}} side nave {{there are three}} hipped rooves. The north side nave has a uniaxial western wall, the ground floor has a neo-Gothic portal with Kamil Hilbert´s initials dated 1906. The side northern facade is without buttresses and has four axial symmetry. The Gothic portal with profiled lining by Hilbert adds aedicula framing oval cartouche in the shield, {{it comes from the}} Baroque portal from the late 17th century. The cartridge is decorated with a baroque painting of St. Martin on horseback. The North side nave includes the oratory with star vault {{in the eastern part of}} the floor, completed with a circular bolt with a knight label. The corner consoles are in the shape of masks. The Chapel of St. Eligius under the oratory has a Baroque <b>decking</b> <b>painted</b> ceiling with ornamental, figural and animal motifs. The rest of the side nave is topped in a cross way with inter-vault ribs are also circular bolts. Next to the wall of the north side nave is the Renaissance tombstone of Milota of Dražice.|$|R
5000|$|Externally, Celebrity Solstice {{looks very}} {{different}} from previous Celebrity Cruises ships. Martin Francis of Francis Design was hired to design her exterior profile. In original exterior renderings, the hull was shown as all-white with powder blue funnels and blue glass upper decks. In a more recent update, the light blue color had been changed to Celebrity's normal dark blue color and the hull was shown having a resemblance to the current fleet's livery, with the promenade <b>deck</b> <b>painted</b> dark blue. Similarly, the large dark blue funnel with a white X {{that had been the}} trademark of Celebrity thus far has been replaced by two thin funnels, and it was planned to have the X logo of the company visible in the glass balcony railings on the ship's [...] "hump" [...] (The area of superstructure which extends outward farther {{than the rest of the}} balconies). Throughout her fitting out, sea trials, and launch, it was noted that the glass X, unless seen from certain angles, was not visible. Shortly after, the X was refinished to be darker, but still can be hard to see. An afterthought during the sea trials saw the addition of a white X onto the forward funnel, thus bringing Solstice more closely related to her fleetmates.|$|R
50|$|This card follows {{immediately}} after The Devil in all Tarots that contain it, and {{is associated with}} sudden, disruptive, revelation, and potentially destructive change. Some early, <b>painted</b> <b>decks,</b> such as the Visconti-Sforza tarot, do not contain it, and some Tarot variants used for game playing omit it.|$|R

25|$|The Homeric {{was built}} with a terraced forward and rear superstructure, with {{lifeboats}} placed fairly high. She had {{a relatively large}} funnel, with a large arch behind it to deflect some soot away from the rear decks. In original Home Lines livery she had a white hull and superstructure, with a blue decorative riband separating them. Her funnel and radar mast, the structures immediately below them and the cranes on her forward <b>deck</b> were <b>painted</b> yellow. The ship's name was painted in tall letters {{on the side of}} the superstructure below the radar mast.|$|R
50|$|Between October 1999 and August 2000, the Roads Service of the Department for Regional Development, in Phase I of a {{refurbishment}} project, {{concentrated on}} the refurbishment of the upper deck of the bridge to provide increased safety and to prolong the service life of the bridge. This included concrete and steelwork repairs, re-waterproofing of the deck to protect the steelwork from corrosion, resurfacing of both carriageway and footways. Later phases II and III concentrated on refurbishment of the lower <b>deck</b> and <b>painting</b> of the bridge. The total cost of refurbishing Craigavon Bridge was £4·2 million.|$|R

5000|$|Even {{when other}} cities were abandoning their tramways in the 1940s, Leeds {{continued}} to modernise its system. Two prototype modern single-deck trams (somewhat {{similar to those}} used in continental European cities) were built in the early 1950s, in particular a single <b>deck</b> tram <b>painted</b> purple for the coronation, was in operation on route 3 to Roundhay in 1953 - perhaps because this followed a segregated track along Roundhay Road to the popular attraction of Roundhay Park. This [...] "coronation" [...] tram still operates in the Beamish open-air museum at Stanley Co. Durham.|$|R
5000|$|After the war, Poland's Soviet-imposed {{communist}} government exiled {{all of the}} Polish fighter pilots who had flown with the RAF {{as part of a}} ploy to downplay Polish patriotism. As a result, S/L Żurakowski, among many other Polish war heroes, chose to stay in Britain. In 1944, he was posted to the Empire Test Pilots' School, graduating from No. 2 Course on 5 January 1945. From 1945 to 1947, Żurakowski worked as a test pilot with [...] "C" [...] Squadron of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) at RAF Boscombe Down, testing naval aircraft for the Air Ministry. Never having landed an aircraft on a carrier before, he practised landing on a <b>deck</b> <b>painted</b> on a runway at Naval Air Station East Haven. Following a brief training period, he proceeded to land the Supermarine Seafire, a navalised Spitfire, on the deck of HMS Ravager without incident. While still at Boscombe Down, Żurakowski flew over 30 different types of aircraft, including the Vampire, the de Havilland Hornet, and the Gloster Meteor. He never let pass [...] "an opportunity to give the staff a display that included single engine aerobatics." [...] Acknowledged {{as one of the best}} aerobatic pilots in the UK, he gave a spectacular display at the Farnborough Airshow in June 1946 with the Martin-Baker MB 5, a piston-engined fighter designed too late to enter war production.|$|R
5000|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} and vessels operating aircraft have a <b>deck</b> code <b>painted</b> {{on the flight}} deck to aid identification by aircraft attempting to land. This {{is in a position}} clearly visible on the approach path. The Royal Navy uses a single letter (typically the first letter of the ship's name) for aircraft {{carriers and}} large vessels operating aircraft, and pairs of letters (usually letters from the ship's name) for smaller vessels. The United States Navy, with its larger fleet, uses the numeric part of the hull classification number (a system analogous to pennant numbers). Deck codes used by contemporary major British naval warships include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Paint was a 2-pack Dulux Acran enamel {{and came}} in at least four known colours: [...] "Aquamarine Blue Metallic" [...] and a very light green (almost white) {{referred}} to as [...] "Marble White". There {{was at least one}} Enduro painted in [...] "Solar Red" [...] and a fourth in [...] "Acacia Green Metallic". The hood, side window frames and rear <b>deck</b> were <b>painted</b> in Dulux GT Satin Black. Large [...] "ENDURO" [...] stripes were emblazoned on the hood, the rear deck and along both sides at sill level, although not all vehicles were treated to the [...] "Enduro" [...] hood graphics.|$|R
5|$|The US Navy painted some ships sea blue overall for {{concealment}} from aircraft. During the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, ships painted completely blue {{came under}} attack less often than ships wearing two-color schemes. On the advice of United States aviators the blue color was darkened and used extensively in the western and southern Pacific from mid-1942 through 1945 to minimize detection and identification by enemy aircraft. Dark blue also proved effective under artificial illumination during night actions. Upper surfaces of aircraft operating from carrier <b>decks</b> were <b>painted</b> a similar shade of blue. Sailors were ordered to wear dungarees rather than white uniforms when topside.|$|R
500|$|Some two-color paint schemes {{attempted}} to harmonize with both sea and sky near the horizon. The US Navy painted some ships dark gray with white structures above bridge level. Both the US Navy and the Royal Navy painted ships dark gray on the hull and light gray on the superstructure and turrets. USN measure 12 was a graded system with sea blue {{low on the}} hull below the first continuous deck, with ocean gray above that. The top of the masts were painted haze gray. This measure was modified with ocean gray above navy blue low on the hull below the first continuous <b>deck</b> (<b>painted</b> parallel to the waterline rather than the main deck). [...] This bold contrast on a horizontal line near the horizon reduced visibility to surface observers and created the illusion of greater range. [...] This camouflage was considered most effective for gunnery engagements with surface units or shore batteries in areas where aerial observation was unlikely. It {{was used in the}} Atlantic and European coastal waters from the end of 1942 through the end of World War II. It was worn by shore bombardment ships in the Pacific from late 1944 after the destruction of Japanese naval aviation capability at the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Similar Admiralty standard schemes were applied beginning in 1944 when it was assumed enemy forces would have radar. Ships were painted light gray overall, except for a sea blue patch low on the hull, either between the main gun turrets or {{the entire length of the}} hull.|$|R
