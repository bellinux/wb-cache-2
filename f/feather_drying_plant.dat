40|$|Essential oils of Mentha longifolia from Senegal were {{extracted}} from fresh <b>plants</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>plants</b> {{in the shade}} for 7 days. The yields were of 0. 39 and 0. 32 % in the fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>plants</b> respectively. Analysis of the essential oils, floral waters and the assay of pulegone were carried out by GC/FID and GC/MS. The major compounds identified in the oils were pulegone (52. 0 and 42. 4 %), menthone (14. 3 and 21. 2 %), 1, 8 -cineole (13. 1 and 11. 4 %) and isomenthone (9. 0 and 13. 2 %) in the fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>plants,</b> respectively. Analyses revealed that floral waters were also characterized by the same major compounds as essential oils but at different rates. In these floral waters, pulegone constituted 60. 2 and 47. 0 %, 1, 8 - cineole 7. 9 and 19. 6 %, isomenthone 7. 2 and 10. 7 %, menthone 6. 4 and 9. 2 %, chrysanthenone 6. 4 and 3. 2 % and α-terpineol 3. 0 and 2. 7 % in the fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>plants,</b> respectively.

A linear positive relationship existed between the antioxidant activity, total phenolic compounds (r 2 = 0. 976) and reducing power of the tested olive pulp (r 2 = 0. 848).
