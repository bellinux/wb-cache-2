5|$|The most {{distinctive}} Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan. The dish {{is a symbol}} for Jordanian hospitality and {{is influenced by the}} Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used. Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef, a dish made specially for Ramadan. In Jordanian cuisine, <b>drinking</b> <b>coffee</b> and tea flavoured with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} caffeine contained in coffee on mineral metabolism, we measured urinary calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and urea excretions at 1 -hour intervals for 4 hours on five healthy young women fed a low calcium meal with various coffee content. The addition of some <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking</b> to the low calcium meal increased the amount of urinary calcium excretion, {{with the amount of}} excretion increasing with stronger <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking.</b> Urinary magnesium excretion showed a statistically significant increase for "normal and strong" <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking</b> over "weak" <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking.</b> However, <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking</b> had essentially no effect on urinary phosphorus or urea excretions. These results suggest that coffee is a potent facilitator of urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium. Paying attention to the intake not only of minerals, but also of caffeine would be important for improving the nutritional state of calcium and magnesium. 原著Original国立情報学研究所で電子...|$|R

5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen <b>drinking</b> <b>coffee</b> and reading the comic book in a coffee shop. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly winks at the woman from the page. His pencil-drawn hand reaches out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects look real on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E

40|$|In a {{residential}} research ward <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking</b> was studied in 9 volunteer human subjects with histories of heavy <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking.</b> A series of five experiments was undertaken to characterize adlibitum coffee consumption and {{to investigate the}} effects of manipulating coffee concentration, caffeine dose per cup, and caffeine preloads prior to <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking.</b> Manipulations were double-blind and scheduled in randomized sequences across days. When cups of coffee were freely available, <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking</b> tended to be rather regularly spaced during the day with intercup intervals becoming progressively longer throughout the day; experimental manipulations showed that this lengthening of intercup intervals was not due to accumulating caffeine levels. Number of cups of coffee consumed was an inverted U-shaped function of both coffee concentration and caffeine dose per cup; however, coffee-concentration and dose-per-cup manipulations did not produce similar effects on other measures of <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking</b> (intercup interval, time to drink a cup, within-day distribution of cups). Caffeine preload produced dose-related decreases in number of cups consumed. As a whole, these experiments provide some limited evidence for both the suppressive and the reinforcing effects of caffeine on coffee consumption. Examination of total daily coffee and caffeine intake across experiments, however, provides no evidence for precise regulation (i. e., titration) of coffee or caffeine intake...|$|R

500|$|The 18thcentury in {{the central}} {{highlands}} was characterized by increasing population density and consequent famines, aggravated by warring among the principalities of Imerina. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810) successfully united these fractious Merina groups under his rule, then used slaves and forced labor—exacted in lieu of taxes for those without means to offer material payment—to systematically work the irrigated rice fields around Antananarivo. In this way, he ensured regular grain surpluses that were sufficient to consistently feed the entire population and export products for trade with other regions of the island. Marketplaces were established across the island to serve as central trading points for designated commodities such as smoked and dried seafood and meats, dried maize, salt, dried cassava and various fruits. Rice cakes, including mofo gasy (...) and menakely (...) , were also sold by market vendors. By this period, coastal cuisine had likewise evolved: early 19thcentury voyagers reported eating dishes on Île Sainte-Marie prepared with curry powder (including a spiced rice resembling biryani) and <b>drinking</b> <b>coffee</b> and tea.|$|E

500|$|Mystery Train was {{the first}} American {{independent}} film to be financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC, and was produced on a budget – $2.8 million – that was considerable by Jarmusch's modest standards. The company was enthusiastic about underwriting the film despite the director insisting on retaining full creative control, {{and went on to}} fund his next three features. The substantial budget and time available gave Jarmusch the opportunity to shoot in color and to rehearse with the actors many scenes not in the script, including several from the courtship of Mitsuko and Jun. At a Memphis nightclub with the Japanese actors during production, the director had Masatoshi Nagase – who spoke little English but was an accomplished mimic – try chat-up lines on the female clientele as an acting exercise. Jarmusch took advantage of the production to make the second installment of his Coffee and Cigarettes series, a collection of short vignettes featuring acquaintances of the director sitting about <b>drinking</b> <b>coffee</b> and smoking cigarettes.

Later, at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, Dexter falls asleep and dreams about the death of his mother, Laura Moser (Katherine Kirkpatrick). In the dream, he enters the cargo {{container}} where she was killed, dressed in The Dark Defender's cloak, and beats his mother's murderers to the ground, saving her. When he tells his sponsor Lila about his dream, she tells him that he must confront them to seek closure. He and Lila travel to Naples, Florida where one of the three men, Santos Jimenez, is alive and running a tavern. Having been warned by his girlfriend Rita Bennett's mother Gail (JoBeth Williams) to leave Rita (Julie Benz) and her children alone, Dexter tells Rita that he is going away while Gail is visiting. Leaving Lila in their motel room, he goes to Jimenez's bar and waits until all of the patrons have left. Dexter tries to explain to Jimenez how he feels, but Jimenez takes out a baseball bat and threatens to beat him. In response, Dexter disarms and brutally beats him, revealing his past to Jimenez as one of the boys he left in his mother's blood. Jimenez tells Dexter that his mother was killed because she was not only a narcotics informant to Harry Morgan (James Remar)—Dexter's adoptive father and a police officer—but also his lover. Dexter punches Jimenez and is close to killing him when Lila phones and he tells her that he is about to [...] "use". Thinking that he is about to use drugs, she urges him not to go any further, because [...] "using" [...] will only leave him empty and alone inside. He returns to the motel, leaving Jimenez unconscious in the bar, and falls asleep in Lila's lap, distraught and completely drained.|$|E

40|$|Background Despite {{the amount}} of {{published}} studies on the subject, controversy still exists {{about the effect of}} <b>coffee</b> <b>drinking</b> on the occurrence of coronary heart disease. In general, epidemiological studies do not support the belief that it is a major risk factor. Design A community-based case–control study was conducted. Methods A random sample of men aged 40 years and over with no previous myocardial infarction was compared with patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on sociodemographic characteristics, personal and family medical history and lifestyles. Dietary data were obtained by a food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios were calculated by unconditional logistic regression. After exclusions, 290 cases and 364 controls were considered in the final analysis. Results <b>Coffee</b> <b>drinking</b> is a widespread habit in this population, and most individuals did not change their habit throughout life. Most participants reported the consumption of moderate amounts of coffee (< 25 % drank more than four cups a day) and espresso was by far the most commonly used brewing. The crude odds ratio for having ever drunk coffee regularly was 0. 5 (95 % confidence interval 0. 3 – 1. 1). However, there was a significant effect–measure modification by family history of AMI (P= 0. 02).
