The panels identified three such projects: 1) {{a study of the}} nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies; 2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3) a project to determine the Hubble constant within ten percent by reducing the errors, both external and internal, in the calibration of the distance scale.|$|E

25|$|The cell-first {{parallel}} {{projection of}} the 24-cell into 3-dimensional space has a cuboctahedral envelope. Two of the octahedral cells, the nearest and farther from the viewer along the W-axis, project onto an octahedron whose vertices lie {{at the center of}} the cuboctahedron's square faces. Surrounding this central octahedron lie the projections of 16 other cells, having 8 pairs that <b>each</b> <b>project</b> to one of the 8 volumes lying between a triangular face of the central octahedron and the closest triangular face of the cuboctahedron. The remaining 6 cells project onto the square faces of the cuboctahedron. This corresponds with the decomposition of the cuboctahedron into a regular octahedron and 8 irregular but equal octahedra, each of which is in the shape of the convex hull of a cube with two opposite vertices removed.|$|E
25|$|Some colonies, such as Virginia, {{were founded}} principally as {{business}} ventures. England's success at colonizing {{what would become}} the United States was {{due in large part to}} its use of charter companies. Charter companies were groups of stockholders (usually merchants and wealthy landowners) who sought personal economic gain and, perhaps, wanted also to advance England's national goals. While the private sector financed the companies, the king also provided <b>each</b> <b>project</b> with a charter or grant conferring economic rights as well as political and judicial authority. The colonies did not show profits, however, and the disappointed English investors often turned over their colonial charters to the settlers. The political implications, although not realized at the time, were enormous. The colonists were left to build their own governments and their own economy.|$|E

30|$|The Mortality Surface {{approach}} is relatively complex and involves {{a number of}} steps. In this study, it was implemented with a VBA subroutine, though {{it is possible to}} set out the calculations in a spreadsheet in a number of steps without any code. First, the national mortality surface was created using past and projected life table nLx values. Then, base period scaling factors of regional to national life expectancy at birth values by sex were calculated. Regional life expectancy forecasts were created by multiplying national life expectancy forecasts by the scaling factors. Appropriate nLx values were then picked out of the mortality surface corresponding to <b>each</b> <b>projected</b> life expectancy at birth value. This is the most complex part because Excel formulas must be created to select nLx values which correspond with <b>each</b> <b>projected</b> life expectancy at birth assumption. Period-cohort death rates can then be obtained from the interpolated nLx values.|$|R

Normally the students and teachers stayed in the Mariner Motel, now a Holiday Inn, conducting experiments and learning about the facility. Following the presidential mandate and budget cuts the entire NSIP program, SEM and Sub-SEM included, was shut down.|$|E
25|$|The {{section of}} NY9J between Muitzes Kill in Schodack and the Rensselaer city limits was {{improved}} to state highway standards {{as part of}} three separate projects {{carried out by the}} state of New York in the 1910s. <b>Each</b> <b>project</b> covered a different segment of the route, and all three parts of the highway were added to the state highway system in 1915. The portion within the town of Schodack was inventoried as State Highway1116 (SH1116) while the section in East Greenbush was listed as SH1115. Both state highway numbers are unsigned. The state assumed maintenance of the river road from Muitzes Kill south to Stuyvesant by 1926 and an extension of the road southeast to Columbiaville in the late 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the Columbiaville–Rensselaer riverside highway became part of NY9J, a new route continuing north over locally maintained streets to US9 and US20 in Rensselaer.|$|E

The sculptures she commissioned for the Valois chapel are lost, or scattered, often damaged or incomplete, in museums and churches.

500|$|Ferb {{comes from}} a blended family, a premise the creators {{considered}} underused in children's programming and which reflected Marsh's own upbringing. [...] Ferb's birth mother is never revealed, but the series shows that both Ferb and his father Lawrence hail from the United Kingdom. Lawrence married Ferb's stepmother Linda after meeting her at a 1990s concert by the (fictitious) band Love Händel. Marsh considers explaining the family background [...] "not important to the kids' lives. They are a great blended family and that's {{all we need to}} know." [...] Ferb and his family live in the fictional town of Danville, in a large, suburban neighborhood. Throughout their summer vacation, Ferb and Phineas conceive outrageous schemes to defeat boredom while sitting lazily beneath a tree in their backyard. Phineas mainly conceives <b>each</b> <b>project</b> while Ferb spearheads its construction. Their activities are usually beyond the capability of a typical child and have included toy design (in [...] "Toy to the World"); treasure-hunting (in [...] "The Ballad of Badbeard"); engineering (in [...] "It's About Time!"); and restaurant management (in [...] "Chez Platypus"). Ferb's stepsister, Candace, is always trying to get the two in trouble with their mother for their schemes, but is never able to. Ferb hardly ever speaks but he is shown to talk at random times with a British accent. Ferb had a long speech in the episode [...] " [...] The Lizard Whisperer".|$|E

I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz".
