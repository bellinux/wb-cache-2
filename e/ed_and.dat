25|$|Originally a {{city the}} {{industry}} of which focused mainly on manufacturing, {{in recent years}} Camden has shifted its focus to <b>eds</b> <b>and</b> meds (education and medicine) {{in an attempt to}} revitalize itself. Of the top employers in Camden, many are education and/or healthcare providers: Cooper University Hospital, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Rowan University, Rutgers University-Camden, Camden County College, Virtua, Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center, and CAMcare are all top employers. The <b>eds</b> <b>and</b> meds industry itself is the single largest source of jobs in the city: of the roughly 25,000 jobs in the city, 7,500 (30%) of them come from <b>eds</b> <b>and</b> meds institutions. The second largest source of jobs in Camden is the retail trade industry, which provides roughly 3,000 (12%) jobs. While already the largest employer in the city, the <b>eds</b> <b>and</b> meds industry in Camden is growing and is doing so despite falling population and total employment: From 2000 to 2014, population and total employment in Camden fell by 3% and 10% respectively, but <b>eds</b> <b>and</b> meds employment grew by 67%.|$|R

Natasha tries to apologise, but Ed insists that she and Andrew pay him for his help and then they can go their separate ways. <b>Ed</b> <b>and</b> Natasha eventually make up and she asks him out on a date. Andrew reveals that an offer as been made for the app, but Natasha refuses to sell it. During a car journey to the city with her friends, Natasha learns that Andrew faked her signature to sell the app behind her back and an argument breaks out. Andrew tries to stop Natasha from calling the police and he bumps Chris' arm, causing him to lose control of the car and crash.

40|$|Aims: Accumulating {{evidence}} for {{the influence of the}} gut microbiota on the bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis suggests a role of the gut microbiota in eating disorders (<b>EDs)</b> <b>and</b> alcohol and substance use disorders. The potential influence of altered gut microbiota (dysbiosis) on behaviors associated with such disorders may have implications for developing therapeutic interventions. Methods: A systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the gut microbiota, <b>EDs</b> <b>and</b> alcohol and substance use disorders was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science databases with the objective being to examine the role of the gut microbiota in behavioral correlates of these disorders. Original papers focused on the gut microbiota and potential behavioral implications were deemed eligible for consideration. Results: The resulting 12 publications were limited to gut microbiota studies related to <b>EDs</b> <b>and</b> alcohol and substance use disorders. Some studies suggest that dysbiosis and gut microbial byproducts may influence the pathophysiology of <b>EDs</b> via direct <b>and</b> indirect interference with peptide hormone signaling. Additionally, dysbiosis was shown to be correlated with alcohol use disorder-related symptoms, i. e. craving, depression and anxiety. Finally, a mouse study suggests that manipulations in the gut microbiota may affect cocaine-related behaviors. Conclusions: Promising, albeit preliminary, findings suggest a potential role of the gut microbiota in behavioral correlates of <b>EDs</b> <b>and</b> alcohol and substance use disorders. Short summary: Preliminary evidence exists supporting the role of the gut microbiota in eating disorders and alcohol and substance use disorders, although additional investigation is needed to determine what is causative versus epiphenomenological...|$|R
