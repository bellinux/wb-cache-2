40|$|National {{accounts}} are descriptors. They describe {{the state of}} an economy and form the raw material for both assessing its performance and prescribing policy. National accounts embody information essential for economic evaluation. The framework for national accounts currently in use throughout the world, however, suffers from extreme narrowness. Vast quantities of information relevant for economic evaluation do not appear in them. Some don’t because the appropriate data are difficult, even impossible, to collect; but others don’t because the {{theory and practice of}} economic evaluation haven’t asked for them. The widespread demand for “green ” national accounts has arisen in recent years because of a growing recognition that contemporary national {{accounts are}} an unsatisfactory basis for economic evaluation. The qualifier green signals that we should be especially concerned about the absence of information on society’s use of the natural environment. In recent years collaboration among a few economists has given rise to a comprehensive theory of national accounts based on primary normative principles. Attempts have also been made by these authors to put the theory to work on international data. 1 In this essay I review that theory in a non-technical manner and illustrate it with data from India. The theory I am reviewing here takes as its starting point the view that the ultimate purpose of economic evaluation is the protection and promotion of human well-being across the generations. It instructs governments and international agencies to go beyond even <b>green</b> <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> by reclassifying certain classes of goods and services and adding others that are currently missing. The theory goes on to show that the objective of economic evaluation should be a comprehensive notion of wealth (adjusted for population and the distribution of wealth in the economy), not gross domestic product (GDP) nor the many other ad hoc indicators of human well-being that have been advanced in recent years, such as the United Nations ’ Huma...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} one of {{the most}} serious problems of <b>green</b> <b>national</b> <b>accounting.</b> This is the lack of a methodology with which to estimate the correction to the national income of open economies that should be made for capital gains. We describe briefly the theoretical model on which the <b>green</b> <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> framework is based, and the two major criticisms that have been made of this framework. The first of these is the fact that it does not account for capital gains, and the second is that while it accounts for the value of depleted resources, it does not necessarily do so using prices that are compatible with sustainability, resulting in a possible overestimation of sustainable income. While the problem of capital gains has been highlighted in the theoretical literature, very little empirical analysis has been done, due to the fact that such analysis requires estimates of future paths of natural resource prices and patterns of trade. This paper proposes and applies a methodology with which this difficulty can be overcome.

Innovative solutions are developed (i) for the estimation of non-market values, such as recreation, where an attempt to determine exchange values has been made simulating markets, (ii) for timber, where standing timber valuation methods have been extended to cover uneven stands, and (iii) for carbon fixation valuation, where only permanently fixed carbon after 1990 has been taken into account. The methodology is applied to a multiple-use pinewood in the Guadarrama mountains, near Madrid (Spain). Timber, cattle grazing, hunting, recreation, carbon fixation and conservation values are measured and integrated in the accounting system, using primary microeconomic data from the case study.

Our analysis shows conflicting conclusions when studying the correlations between these indicators of sustainability and existing human development indicators, namely HDI, which emphasizes the need for further analysis to understand what “sustainable human development” means.

In particular, {{in order to avoid}} serious policy distortions, environmental policy needs a broad spectrum of indicators covering all relevant issues. Valuation projects that treat pollutants with sophisticated methodologies like Impact Pathway Analysis (GARP) or Avoidance Cost-based economic modelling (GreenStamp) face data availability problems which force them in practice to concentrate on selected pollutants, excluding all others; the result is policy distortion. The author proposes that valuation methodologies should focus on general patterns, like the dependence of Avoidance Costs from implementation speed, type of instruments, and level of analysis (i. e. company, sector, national economy, EU economy), instead of treating single pollutants with unnecessary precision while neglecting many others.

In this perspective, a "greened GDP" is a hypothetical measure of a performance potential, viz., an estimate of the level of output (or of consumption, or of national income, etc.) that a national economy would be able to achieve while simultaneously respecting specified environmental quality and resource husbandry requirements. The GREENSTAMP approach is modular, establishing linkages with different categories of data and analyses. First, information is organised in so-called satellite environmental accounts, which describe the state of the environment according to chosen categories and measures (largely non-monetary), and which establish links between economic activity sectors and environmental change in terms of the pressures acting on each environmental category. Second, cost information is obtained through various levels of analysis (firms and households, sectors and macro-economic aggregates) about the economic resource requirements – such as investments needed or consumption foregone – that would be necessary in order to reduce a specified environmental pressure. Environmental defensive expenditures, pollution avoidance cost curves, and macroeconomic comparative static and dynamic scenario modelling are among the applicable cost concepts and tools. In this cost-effectiveness perspective, the value of environmental assets and services is not estimated in monetary terms directly. Rather, estimates of the costs – at various scales of analysis and timeframes – of specified improvements in environmental performance are considered in relation to scientific, political and economic judgements {{about the importance of the}} environmental functions, services and assets in question. avoidance cost curves; cost-effectiveness; dynamic models; environmental standards; GREENSTAMP; national accounts; statistical methods; sustainable <b>national</b> income; <b>green</b> <b>accounting.</b> ...|$|R

The assessment of ecological capital is a new research area emerged from the challenge in the interdisciplinary research of ecology and social development. It is fundamental to establish a <b>green</b> <b>national</b> economy <b>accounting</b> system. Scientific evaluation of ecological capital is helpful for considering ecological cost in making the decision for economic development, and it is demanded for sustainable development. In this study, a quantitative assessment model of ecological property has been developed based on the analysis of per unit yield in the conventional ecology together with the utilization of remote sensing data from the Landsat TM, CBERS, MODIS, and NOAA database, land use and land cover data, and field measurements. The study area covers Changji Autonomous District, Xinjiang, China on the northern slope of Tianshan Mountain that is located in a typical arid area. Dynamic monitoring of ecological capital was performed using remote sensing techniques. Spatial distribution and temporal variation of ecological properties were characterized. The effects of land cover and land use as well as climate change on those variation and distribution were analyzed. The results show {{a significant increase in the}} ecological capital during 1990 - 2003. The spatial distribution of ecological properties is characterized by a negative gradient from higher altitudes to lower altitudes (plains) and from oases to deserts, which is consistent with the zonal distribution of vegetation in arid areas. Due to global warming, the climate in Xinjiang has been changed into a warmer and wetter environment during the last 50 years, which improves the plant growing conditions in the alpine regions, piedmont hilly regions, and the oases. On the other hand, the natural environment in the arid and semiarid regions in northwest China becomes more severe, and the stress to the natural ecosystems becomes more and more serious. Human activities affect the quality and the area of ecosystems and change the service functions of ecosystems. Consequently the fluctuation of ecological capital occurs. (22 refs. ...|$|R
