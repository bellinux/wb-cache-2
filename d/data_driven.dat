25|$|Project 720 was a {{high school}} reform program {{implemented}} for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth’s high schools. Teachers were expected to use <b>data</b> <b>driven</b> instructional practices and {{to meet the needs of}} diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High schools applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Lakeland School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $171,000 funding over three years. For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell. The grant program was discontinued effective with the 2011-12 state budget.|$|E

50|$|One way to {{implement}} a parity drive in a RAID array {{is to use the}} exclusive or, or XOR, function. XOR is a Boolean logic function which means 'one or the other, but not both'. The XOR of all of the <b>data</b> <b>drives</b> in the RAID array is written to the parity drive. If one of the <b>data</b> <b>drives</b> fails, the XOR of the remaining drives is identical to the data of the lost drive. Therefore, when a drive is lost, recovering the drive is as simple as copying the XOR of the remaining drives to a fresh <b>data</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Forward {{inference}} is a <b>data</b> <b>driven</b> {{method that}} uses patterns of brain activation {{to distinguish between}} competing cognitive theories. It shares characteristics with cognitive psychology’s dissociation logic and philosophy’s forward chaining. For example, Henson [...] discusses forward inference’s contribution to the [...] "single process theory vs. dual process theory" [...] debate with regard to recognition memory. Forward inference supports the dual process theory by demonstrating {{that there are two}} qualitatively different brain activation patterns when distinguishing between [...] "remember vs. know judgments". The main issue with forward inference {{is that it is a}} correlational method. Therefore, one cannot be completely confident that brain regions activated during cognitive process are completely necessary for that execution of those processes. In fact, there are many known cases that demonstrate just that. For example, the hippocampus has been shown to be activated during classical conditioning, however lesion studies have demonstrated that classical conditioning can occur without the hippocampus.|$|E

Such data-intensive scientific discovery is by some considered to be the fourth paradigm, after empiricism, theory and computer simulation.

As Krakauer et al. put it: [...] "machine learning is a powerful means of preprocessing data in preparation for mechanistic theory building, but should not be considered the final goal of a scientific inquiry." [...] In regard to cancer biology, Raspe et al. state: [...] "A better understanding of tumor biology is fundamental for extracting the relevant information from any high throughput data." [...] The journal Science chose cancer immunotherapy as the breakthrough of 2013. According to their explanation a lesson to be learned from the successes of cancer immunotherapy is that they emerged from decoding of basic biology.|$|E

This level was previously used by NetApp, but {{has now been}} largely replaced by a proprietary implementation of RAID 4 with two parity disks, called RAID-DP. The main advantage of RAID 4 over RAID 2 and 3 is I/O parallelism: in RAID 2 and 3, a single read/write I/O operation requires reading the whole group of <b>data</b> <b>drives,</b> while in RAID 4 one I/O read/write operation {{does not have to}} spread across all <b>data</b> <b>drives.</b> As a result, more I/O operations can be executed in parallel, improving the performance of small transfers.|$|R

50|$|A major {{criticism}} of <b>data</b> <b>driven</b> instruction {{is that it}} focuses too much on test scores, and that not enough attention {{is given to the}} results of classroom assessments. <b>Data</b> <b>driven</b> instruction should serve as a “road map through assessment” that helps “teachers plan instruction to meet students’ needs, leading to better achievement”. Summative assessments should not be used to inform the day-to-day teaching and learning that is supported by data-driven instruction. Additional problems associated with perceptions of <b>data</b> <b>driven</b> instruction include the limitations of quantitative data to represent student learning, not considering the social and emotional needs or the context of the data when making instructional decisions, and a hyperfocus on the core areas of literacy and mathematics while ignoring the encore, traditionally high-interest areas such as the arts and humanities.|$|E
