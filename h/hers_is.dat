25|$|One of {{the best}} known is Miguel Santiago, who sells about forty pieces a year. Some of these sales are {{individual}} pieces and others are multiple sets such as Frida Kalo surrounded by monkeys. Sets are usually sold to foreign buyers for between $300 and $800 USD and have been sent to Europe, Japan and the United States. Sets often take more than a month to make and his work is considered to be in {{the high end of the}} market. Santiago’s orders extend more than two years in advance. Santiago used to work with a brother and later with a nephew, but today he works mostly solo with his father to help. Another {{of the best}} known is one of the few female entrepreneurs in the market, Olga Santiago. She does not carve or paint, rather she hires others to do the work while she administrates. However, she signs all the pieces. Many of her carvers and painters are young men who leave quickly to form workshops of their own. While her workshop is not the only one run in this manner, <b>hers</b> <b>is</b> the newest and most successful. Olga’s client base is tourists, which are often brought to her by tour guides, taxi drivers and the like for a commission, and wholesalers.|$|E

The New York Times [...] commented, [...] "Miss Wong stirs in the spectator all the sympathy her part calls for and she never repels one by an excess of theatrical 'feeling'. She has a difficult role, a role that is botched {{nine times out of}} ten, but <b>hers</b> <b>is</b> the tenth performance. Completely unconscious of the camera, with a fine sense of proportion and remarkable pantomimic accuracy... She should be seen again and often on the screen." ...|$|E

500|$|Mutsu was {{initially}} {{fitted with a}} Type 13 fire-control system derived from Vickers equipment received during World War I, but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925.

A modified Type 14 fire-control system was tested aboard her sister ship [...] in 1935 and later approved for service as the Type 94.

500|$|In the film, {{similar to}} the Brothers Grimm story, the Evil Queen is cold, cruel, and {{extremely}} vain, and obsessively desires to remain the [...] "fairest in the land". She becomes madly envious over the beauty of her stepdaughter, Princess Snow White, {{as well as the}} attentions of the Prince from another land; such love triangle element is one of Disney's changes to the story. This leads her to plot the death of Snow White and ultimately on the path to her own demise, which in the film is indirectly caused by the Seven Dwarfs. The film's version of the Queen character uses her dark magic powers to actually transform herself into an old woman instead of just taking a disguise like in the Grimms' story; this appearance of <b>hers</b> <b>is</b> commonly referred to as the Wicked Witch or alternatively as the Old Hag or just the [...] Witch. The Queen dies in the film, but lives on in a variety of non-canonical Disney works.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a leading}} role {{opposite}} Aditya Pancholi and Saif Ali Khan in Sanjay Gupta's box office flop, the reincarnation romance Hameshaa, Kajol starred as an aspiring nun in Rajiv Menon's Tamil film – the romantic drama Minsaara Kanavu – opposite Arvind Swamy and Prabhu Deva. Kajol revealed that she found dancing alongside Prabhu Deva difficult and it [...] "took me 20 retakes and 30 rehearsals" [...] to get the steps right. Her performance met with appreciation with The Indian Express reviewing, [...] "Kajol is full of beans and fits into her character with commendable ease. <b>Hers</b> <b>is</b> {{perhaps one of the}} most expressive faces of the present." [...] The film was dubbed in Hindi as Sapnay and released in Northern India. The original Tamil version was a box office success, but the dubbed version emerged as a commercial failure. Her next release was Indra Kumar's romantic comedy Ishq alongside Aamir Khan, Juhi Chawla and Ajay Devgn, in which she played Kajal, a poor girl in love with a rich boy, played by Devgn. Upon release, the film emerged as a major commercial success, with critical praise directed to the performances of the four leads.|$|E

500|$|Several {{critics have}} called The Good Terrorists title an oxymoron. Robert Boschman {{suggested}} it {{is indicative of}} Alice's [...] "contradictory personality" [...] – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title [...] "hovers above the novel with... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the [...] "good terrorist", but that while {{she may be a}} good person, she is [...] "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that <b>hers</b> <b>is</b> [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... our sense of reality".|$|E
500|$|In 2004, the {{producers}} Ramesh Sharma and Pahlaj Nilani announced that Ranaut {{would make her}} film debut with the Deepak Shivdasani-directed I Love You Boss. The following year, an agent {{took her to the}} office of the producer Mahesh Bhatt, where she interacted with the director Anurag Basu and auditioned for the lead role in the romantic thriller Gangster. Bhatt felt that she was too young for the role and signed Chitrangada Singh instead. However, Singh was later unavailable to do the film and Ranaut was contracted as a replacement for Gangster, opting out of I Love You Boss. She was cast in the central role of Simran, an alcoholic woman caught in a romantic triangle between a notorious gangster (played by Shiney Ahuja) and a sympathetic friend (played by Emraan Hashmi). Ranaut was only seventeen while filming and said that she [...] "had difficulty first in understanding and then unwinding from the character", describing her craft as [...] "raw and immature". Released in 2006, Gangster emerged as a critical and commercial success and her performance was praised. Raja Sen of Rediff.com said that [...] "Kangana is a remarkable find, the actress coming across with great conviction. <b>Hers</b> <b>is</b> the pivotal character and an extremely difficult role to essay, but she manages it well [...] Kangana's nuances [...] are disconcertingly realistic." [...] She won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, along with various other debut awards.|$|E
500|$|The New York Daily Mirror critic wrote, [...] "Programmed as {{a musical}} play, South Pacific is just that. [...] It boasts no ballets and no hot hoofing.

[...] The review continued: [...] "Every number is so outstanding {{that it is difficult to}} decide which will be the most popular." [...] The review in New York World-Telegram found the show to be [...] "the ultimate modern blending of music and popular theatre to date, with the finest kind of balance between story and song, and hilarity and heartbreak." [...] Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times especially praised Pinza's performance: [...] "Mr. Pinza's bass voice is the most beautiful that has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two. He sings... with infinite delicacy of feeling and loveliness of tone." [...] He declared that [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", sung by Pinza, [...] "ought to become reasonably immortal." [...] Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Post focused on Mary Martin's performance, writing, [...] "nothing I have ever seen her do prepared me for the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush... who is so shocked to find her early racial prejudices cropping up. <b>Hers</b> <b>is</b> a completely irresistible performance." ...|$|E
