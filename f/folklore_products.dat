50|$|The village Penyige, with a {{long history}} (first mention in {{documents}} of the 12th century), is remotely situated near the Ukrainian border with Hungary, has a strong feeling of community belonging and a rich community life today. A perfect example is the retired village teacher who {{has been a source of}} creativity as to the preservation of the past. Thanks to her, a village museum was established, where old gadgets, documents, <b>folklore,</b> <b>products</b> and reminiscences of old times are exhibited.|$|E

He studied at the Académie Julian in Paris from 1894 where he was {{influenced}} by Mihály Munkácsy's art. He visited Germany and Italy in 1897, then returned to Hódmezővásárhely.He had hardly enough to keep body and soul together, and had a studio from 1903 only. He started to collect <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> together with Gyula Rudnay and Béla Endre and they founded a school in Hódmezővásárhely to save folk pottery. He lived in Mártély from the 1910s onwards where he painted a series of landscapes on the Great Plain. He moved to Budapest in 1919. He worked in Szentendre {{for a few months}} in 1933-34.|$|E
40|$|Folklore has a broad {{functional}} area. This {{function is}} also one of the first literary <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> is encountered in language teaching. <b>Folklore</b> <b>products,</b> due to having too many functions, language teaching can be used as both vehicle and purpose. While <b>folklore</b> <b>products,</b> until children have learned the language, used as tool, they can be used as both vehicle and purpose to people have learned the language. Because language learning occurs in different ways, such as individuals with language learning languages learn other things. Only language teaching can be done with a normal text; but many of <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> that belong to people who speak the language is transferred with with folk-arts text. There are products of folk culture, transfer of functions, regale, etc to give the values and moral education etc. Learning the language, the individual can obtain them. This transfer takes place in foreign language teaching as well as the teaching mother tongue. <b>Folklore</b> <b>products</b> can survive till now, and used in language teaching but they have become used more effectively in language teaching with transferring writing. Because these functions, as well as text to ensure the survival of <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> must be present in textbooks. Folklore and culture can perform these functions with the Turkish textbook as a tool. In this study, students' textbooks in different provinces across the different folklore and cultural content of the texts in Turkish textbooks, teaching a language as a tool in terms of functions are investigated...|$|E

2500|$|Antwerp {{is famous}} for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a {{showcase}} for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally [...] "Antwerp Hands". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and <b>folklore.</b> The local <b>products</b> are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{raises the}} issue of {{revitalization}} of small town tourism through the lenses of folklore-driven slow tourism. Folk art is slow by nature; it promotes traditional craftsmanship, human creativity, hostlocal relations and community cohesion. Therefore, it has similar characteristics to the slow movement, particularly ‘slow tourism’. In this paper 132 tourists were surveyed {{at the heart of}} the Matyó land, in Mezőkövesd, about the slow aspects of their holiday, their folklore consumption and their satisfaction with visit. The findings revealed: (1) visitors have some awareness of the slow movements; (2) respondents readily chose slower transport options; (3) A certain link could be established between more intensive consumption of <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> and longer stay; (4) Visitorshad a high satisfaction rate regarding the consumption of <b>folklore</b> <b>products.</b> Based on the results the author draws the conclusion that boosting the consumption of <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> in the context of ‘slow tourism’ might be one way of revitalizing tourism in small regional towns...|$|E
40|$|From {{folk songs}} to lullabies, from public beliefs to death traditions, from {{handicrafts}} to people‟s meteorologies, Folklore searches all {{the values that}} direct the folk‟s moral and material life as a big fan covering the people. Negative effects of communication instruments on our moral and material culture have been in progress by force of modern time. Cultural elements should be gathered together, protected, and searched scientifically {{even though they are}} the last remains among the people. <b>Folklore</b> <b>products</b> survive today and will survive tomorrow as they survived in the past and they will never die out. Çan, the district of Çanakkale Province, is a very rich and productive area in <b>Folklore</b> <b>products.</b> Çan has an important place in point of folk culture values. We can see that even today folklore productions keep their dynamism and still survive in the Çan villages which are the furthest settlements of Çan. Each of the folklore and popular culture elements which can be saved will build up to be the cultural heritage of the future. The circumcision and soldier farewell ceremonies, religious and national holidays, festivals, fairs and camel wrestling along with the practices regarding Hıdrellez and going to Ziyacı have been examined by evaluation. It has been seen that <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> of Çan region show similarities to the cultures of the people living in Caucasia and Central Asia although they are located distances. It also presents that Turkish societies living {{in various parts of the}} world take their nourishments from the same source...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the basic}} issues of {{philosophy}} of history is about the thesis either the past brighten to-day or to-day explains the past. The social institutions of today, language and folklore largely bear the imprint of the past. Then {{we can say that}} the history is a continuous interaction between the past and today. We are trying to explain this by studying on our <b>folklore</b> <b>products,</b> on some concepts of our language and proverbs. The folkloric materials are signs of history of a society at present. The epics, historical anecdotes and proverbs give clues of historical events. Even folk music‟s and names can help a researcher if the research has ability to evaluate them. As known, some times the statesmen evade some documents, which may contain unpleasant information, to be put on the shelves of archives. In this case, the folkloric material can be very vital source of documents for a researcher to find out a historical event...|$|E
40|$|Little {{has been}} written about new product and {{packaging}} development processes within the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. While often taking on the status of apocryphical <b>folklore,</b> branded FMCG <b>product</b> development failure rates as high as 90 % – 95 % have appeared in the popular and consultancy press. However, no rigorous study has addressed the commercial success/failure rates of private-label products in this context; an area in which the leading UK supermarket (grocery) retailers are acknowledged to excel. Using a case study-based approach that involved ASDA and six of its leading privatelabel suppliers, this paper details empirical findings of the operational and commercial performance of the focal ASDANPD(new product development) process, along with initial insights into the key determinants of this performance. It also produces the first description of the origin, composition and operation of a Supplier Association within the UK FMCG industry and details the new NPD process mapping method and tool that was developed to conduct this study...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the commodification of culture pertaining to re-imaginings of historical Québec, New France colonies, political rebellions, imagined communities, shared cultural traits, and romantic heroic associations {{as seen in}} beer product placement, advertisements and reenactments from theme-restaurants to organized community events. Because folklore {{is often used to}} sell products and tourism packages, these products become transmitters of the selected folk items whether they are legends, figures, or the knowledge of occupational folk trades, as seen and constructed by the population creating these products. While much of the folklore scholarship surrounding the uses and misuses of folklore in consumption focuses on concepts of “authenticity,” I focused the lens on how companies view utilizable items of folklore, from packaging to public relations, and how the selection and rejection of vernacular heritage is used for cultural pride and identity. This research challenges theories on legend dissemination in form as well as perceived “shared common traits” used in commodified objects. I conducted fieldwork using various methodologies, from individual session interviews to market focus groups and also included an online survey to examine the process of using <b>folklore</b> in selling <b>products</b> and how this influences and produces community events. These different approaches to collecting and analyzing data by combining the traditional one-on-one interviews in folklore with the focus group sessions and surveys found in marketing studies has proved not only useful but necessary when researching a hybrid form of folk-consumer studies. The outcomes of this research are relevant for business studies notably in how marketing models and their studied interpretations bring folklore perspectives in the use of targeted mass media planning...|$|R
40|$|Tourist {{destination}} {{image is}} important for strategic marketing and tourist choice. While many studies focus on images and their influencing factors, images are wrongly considered only for sale, compromising local authenticity and local life. With a critical review of development plans {{and the results of}} a questionnaire survey, this paper argues that images often stereotype and misplace tourist destination, in particularly for images brought about by structural forces. Islands are lands surrounded by ocean and often taken as full of marine and coastal resources and sceneries. In Penghu archipelago, marine environment {{is important for}} local livelihood and tourist destination. However, with the case of Erkan, we realize that, along with the evidence from interviews and surveys, most Erkan tourists do not come for its marine or natural resources. Erkan, as a fishing village, was turned into a tourism destination for tis vernacular architecture and <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> irrelevant to its marine environment. With structural endeavours and official makeover of places, places are stereotyped and often become out of place...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of Gramsci in post-war Italian anthropology has mainly concerned the redefinition of {{the sphere of}} popular culture {{in terms of the}} hegemony-subalternity relationship. The 1950 s “folklore debate”, as it was termed, revolving around the ideas of Gramsci and De Martino, completely redefined the tradition of positivistic folklore studies. In the 1960 s, then, a new discipline for the study of popular culture was founded on explicit Gramscian bases – “demology”. In this paper, I examine these moments of the scientific debate {{in the light of the}} problem of political and cultural “populism”: in other words, the problem of a certain degree of autonomy in the cultural productions of subaltern classes. I argue that demology, from its very beginnings, confused the autonomy of the subaltern with the autonomy of the academic discipline. Trying to isolate “real” <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> from hegemonic ones and from mass culture, demologists lost sight of the historical dimension prevailing in both Gramsci and De Martino. In a sense, the current crisis of demology has mainly to do with the inability to deal with the problem of populism and its changing historical faces...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} lands of {{peripheral}} settlements: peripheral settlements of cities, municipalities, {{or close to}} the country borders. Their genesis, position and connections are different, so that {{their role in the}} network of settlements is frequently marginalized, A general idea that these settlements are an encumbrance and that they are very often not arranged and rejected as important urban units has resulted in their significant degradation. This paper deals with their general categorization by position, size, economic and other features. For the purpose of their revitalization, programs are proposed - experimental pilot project which would be used for future considerations in creating development strategies. Even though the experiments are often Utopian and unrealistic, this paper suggests the projects which would be sustainable in terms of existing circumstances and resources. The point is to modernize the traditional values and economy and to introduce monitoring and development monitoring, to centralize and coordinate the experiment and have professionals of various specialties exchange their knowledge and experience. The focus of consideration is the development of contemporary livestock keeping and organic food oriented agriculture, as well as tourism, special services, crafts, <b>folklore</b> <b>products.</b> The basic concept is connecting the small capacities into middle sized and big systems, improvement of living conditions, specific and alternative advantages of living and working in small communities, reconstruction etc. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{profession}} that we named as "pedlar epic-seller" includes {{the work that}} done by the minstrels who print and copy the epic verse that they wrote about various issues and sell them in villages and especially in city centers {{as well as their}} doings in this process of selling, in a period that rapidly enables the products of oral culture to be converted in written forms thanks to wider usage of press. In Turkey, pedlar (mobile) epic-selling, started in Tanzimat period with litho and lasted until 1970 s creating a tradition just for one century. The profession enables an appropriate ground to bring controversial issues in folklore discipline up to discussion since the genre of "epic" does not refer to specific literature field, and the pedlar epic-selling is positioned in the intersection of oral, written and electronically oral cultures, and the epics can be written with material concerns on purpose or can be custom-made and lastly since the "pedlar epic-selling" also appears as a performative act. In this article, the particular position of the "pedlar epic-seller" will be analysed in an informative manner and the problems of text and genre relations within the folklore literature will be handed with resulted analysis. In this context, it will be pointed that during the idea production it is just the concepts which can be defined, not the genres thus in analysis of the <b>folklore</b> <b>products</b> the necessity to take especially the context into consideration will be discussed via examples...|$|E
