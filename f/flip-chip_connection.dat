40|$|A continuous-time shift-invariant {{cellular}} {{neural network}} (CNN) with hardware annealing capability, digitally programmable synaptic weights, and optical inputs/outputs has been developed. This electro-optical neurocomputing processor has great potential in solving many important scientific problems in signal processing and optimization. Advanced packaging for the proposed optoelectronic neurocomputing system is a thin-film silicon-substrate multichip module with <b>flip-chip</b> <b>connection</b> technologies. This paper presents two functional chips designed for the proposed electro-optical neurocomputing processor: a monolithic GaAs 2 -D array of optical receivers, and a VLSI CMOS 2 -D array of smart pixels based on the annealed CNN. Due to the multichip module integration of these chips in the same silicon substrate, a complete optoelectronics neurocomputing system can be realized in a very compact hardware...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a layer system, comprising {{a layer of}} carbon nanotubes oriented {{parallel to one another}} and a surface layer having metallic properties connected directly thereto, from which surface layer the carbon nanotubes have grown in tip growth. The layer system can also have a base layer and/or a substrate.; The layer system can be obtained by producing a structured layer comprising a first phase, which is composed of a metal that has no independent catalytic activity with respect to the production of CNTs from the gas phase, and a second phase, which is composed of a metal that catalyzes the production of CNTs from the gas phase, on a substrate or a base layer, wherein the first phase has a structure that is unevenly thick and/or folded and optionally interspersed with pores and the second phase is located in recesses and/or pores of the first phase {{in such a way that}} the two material phases are at least partially adjacent to one another in the lateral plane, on the substrate or the base layer located thereon.; Carbon is deposited on said structured layer from a gas atmosphere containing carbon, wherein carbon nanotubes are formed and said carbon nanotubes raise at least parts of the structured layer in a closed form. The substrate or the base layer can subsequently be removed. The layer system of the invention is suitable for use in a large number of components and electronic microsystems and nanosystems, <b>flip-chip</b> <b>connections,</b> sensors or actuators, in particular pressure sensors, contact sensors, optical sensors, mirrors, projectors, optical filters, nanopositioning systems, or interferometers, and, in a specific form, also in a super capacitor...|$|R

Kohl, Todd Spencer and Tyler Osborn {{from the}} School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering {{presented}} a lecture at the Nano@Tech Meeting on September 9, 2008 at 12 noon in room 102 of the MiRC building. Runtime: 61 : 09 minutesThe "off-chip" bandwidth {{is a major}} bottleneck causing system delays and limited throughput, especially {{in areas such as}} processor-to-memory bandwidth and processor-to-network. The ITRS cites off-chip signal bandwidth exceeding 60 GHz within 10 years. Organic substrates (i. e. chip packages or interposers) with <b>flip-chip</b> solder <b>connections</b> are the core of the first and second level of interconnect. Off-chip bandwidth is limited to several GHz due to frequency dependent attenuation, signal reflections, and crosstalk within the polymer dielectric, via structures, and I/O signal path transitions within the chip substrate and mother board. In this work, we have introduced advances in off-chip interconnect using air-isolated, coaxial links on substrates and boards to demonstrate ultra high-speed chip-to-chip and chip-to-network communications. New approaches have been found to fabricating high frequency I/O, air-and isolated coaxial links on the substrate. The materials, processes and electrical characteristics will be presented...|$|R
