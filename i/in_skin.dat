5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur.

2500|$|These {{sites have}} created a type of black market around CS:GO skins, {{generally}} unregulated by Valve. The exact monetary values processed by these skin gambling sites are difficult to measure due to the opaqueness of the ownership. Eilers and Narus estimated that $2.3 billion <b>in</b> <b>skins</b> were used to bet on eSports in 2015, $5 billion in 2016, and projected that over $20 billion <b>in</b> <b>skins</b> would be gambled by 2020 if the market was left unchecked. Of the $5 billion <b>in</b> <b>skins</b> during 2016, Eilers and Narus estimated that only $2 billion were used for eSports betting, while the rest was used on traditional games-of-chance. Some individuals are estimated to have a cumulative worth of {{tens of millions of}} dollars of <b>skins</b> <b>in</b> their inventories. The effect of CS:GO gambling is estimated by the Esports Betting Report as an [...] "eight figure" [...] number that feeds the overall area of professional eSports due to viewership and promotions related to the skin gambling.|$|R

5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis <b>in</b> <b>skin</b> cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E

5|$|In 1821 the Royal Academy {{accepted}} and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted {{a large number}} of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts <b>in</b> <b>skin</b> tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.|$|E

40|$|Human {{macrophage}} metalloelastase is {{a member}} of the matrix metalloproteinase family and is involved in degradation of elastin. We investigated the ultraviolet modulation of human macrophage metalloelastase <b>in</b> human <b>skin</b> <b>in</b> vivo. Ultraviolet induced human macrophage metalloelastase mRNA maximally (11. 9 -fold) within 16 h post-ultraviolet <b>in</b> human <b>skin.</b> This induction of human macrophage metalloelastase by ultraviolet was inhibited by pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cystein (20 %) and vitamin E (5 %) by an average of 54 % and 47 %, respectively, <b>in</b> human <b>skin</b> <b>in</b> vivo. Ultraviolet (30 mJ per cm 2) and phorbol ester (12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate, 50 nM) treatment increased expression of human macrophage metalloelastase mRNA and protein in the cultured human dermal fibroblasts, but not in the keratinocytes. Chronically sun-exposed human skin expressed significant amounts of human macrophage metalloelastase protein, which colocalized with the material of solar elastosis, whereas there was little expression <b>in</b> sun-protected <b>skin</b> of the same individuals. This study demonstrates that ultraviolet irradiation increases human macrophage metalloelastase expression <b>in</b> human <b>skin</b> <b>in</b> vivo, possibly in macrophages and fibroblasts, and ultraviolet-induced expression of human macrophage metalloelastase can be inhibited by antioxidant (N-acetyl cystein and vitamin E) pretreatment. Association of human macrophage metalloelastase with elastotic material suggests that it may play an important role in the development of solar elastosis, the hallmark of sun-induced damage <b>in</b> human <b>skin</b> <b>in</b> vivo...|$|R
