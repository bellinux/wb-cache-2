In this study we performed a systematic breast milk composition analysis of a mother on chronic hemodialysis (HD). Specimens of breast milk and blood were collected in regular intervals before and after HD from a 39 -year old woman starting on day 10 postpartum. Samples were analyzed for <b>electrolytes,</b> <b>retention</b> solutes, nutrients and other laboratory measurements. Breast milk samples from low-risk mothers matched for postpartum age were used as controls. Significantly higher levels of creatinine and urea were found in pre-HD breast milk when compared to post-HD. A similar post-dialytic decrease was only found for uric acid but not for any other investigated parameter. Conversely, sodium and chloride were significantly increased in post-HD samples. Compared to controls creatinine and urea were significantly higher in pre-HD samples while the difference remained only significant for post-HD creatinine. Phosphate was significantly lower in pre- and post-HD breast milk when compared to controls, whereas calcium showed no significant differences. In terms of nutrient components glucose levels showed a strong trend for a decrease, whereas protein, triglycerides and cholesterol did not differ. Similarly, {{no significant differences were}} found in iron, potassium and magnesium content. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on a breastfeeding mother on chronic dialysis. Although we found differences in creatinine, urea, sodium, chloride and phosphate, our general analysis showed high similarity of our patient's breast milk to samples from low-risk control mothers. Significant variations in breast milk composition between pre- and post-HD samples suggest that breastfeeding might be preferably performed after dialysis treatment.

A comprehensive set of retention data has been obtained on a C 18 column coated with the zwitterionic surfactant 3 -(N,N-dimethylmyristylammonio) propanesulfonate used with a range of mobile phases in which both the mobile-phase anion and cation have been varied systematically. Electro-osmotic flow measurements were also obtained on fused-silica capillaries coated with the zwitterion (and also some monofunctional surfactants) and were used to evaluate the nature of the surface charge on the layer of adsorbed surfactant in the presence of various background <b>electrolytes.</b> A new <b>retention</b> mechanism for EIC was developed {{on the basis of these}} data.

The magnitude and polarity of the charge on this membrane depends on the nature of the mobile-phase ions. The Donnan membrane exerts weak electrostatic repulsion or attraction effects on analyte anions. A second component of the retention mechanism is chaotropic interaction of the analyte anion with the quaternary ammonium functional group of the zwitterion.

A similar pattern of blood pressure decrement and potentiation was seen in genetically hypertensive rats when propranolol or saralasin treatment preceded hydralazine. Propranolol was demonstrated to block hydralazine-induced increases in serum renin activity in genetically hypertensive rats. We conclude that hypotensive potentiation of vasocilating drugs by propranolol in these animal models is mediated {{to a large extent}} by impairment of renin release. Persistence of hypotensive tachycardia after nephrectomy and after saralasin in normotensive rats suggests the irrelevance of angiotensin's central nervous system stimulation to this cardiac effect. Clinical studies are underway to quantify the potential importance of this beneficial drug interaction in man...|$|E
40|$|Nickel-cadmium (Ni/Cd) and nickel-hydrogen (Ni/H 2) {{secondary}} {{alkaline batteries}} {{are vital to}} aerospace applications. Battery performance and cycle life are significantly affected {{by the type of}} separators used in those batteries. A team from NASA Lewis Research Center's Electrochemical Technology Branch developed standardized testing procedures to characterize and evaluate new and existing separator materials to improve performance and cycle life of secondary alkaline batteries. Battery separators must function as good electronic insulators and as efficient electrolyte reservoirs. At present, new types of organic and inorganic separator materials are being developed for Ni/Cd and Ni/H 2 batteries. The separator material previously used in the NASA standard Ni/Cd was Pellon 2505, a 100 -percent nylon- 6 polymer that must be treated with zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) to bond the fibers. Because of stricter Environmental Protection Agency regulation of ZnCl 2 emissions, the battery community has been searching for new separators to replace Pellon 2505. As of today, two candidate separator materials have been identified; however, neither of the two materials have performed as well as Pellon 2505. The separator test procedures that were devised at Lewis are being implemented to expedite the search for new battery separators. The new test procedures, which are being carried out in the Separator Laboratory at Lewis, have been designed to guarantee accurate evaluations of the properties that are critical for sustaining proper battery operation. These properties include physical and chemical stability, chemical purity, gas permeability, <b>electrolyte</b> <b>retention</b> and distribution, uniformity, porosity, and area resistivity. A manual containing a detailed description of 12 separator test procedures has been drafted and will be used by the battery community to evaluate candidate separator materials for specific applications. These standardized procedures will allow for consistent, uniform, and reliable results that will ensure that separator materials have the desired properties for long life and good performance in secondary alkaline cells...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Chronic {{exposure}} to lead is associated with adverse effects on renal function in laboratory animals and man. There is controversy concerning the direction of change of renal function parameters following chronic lead intoxication. The renal effects of low-dose lead exposure, as opposed to acute and pharmacological doses, require further scrutiny. In {{order to determine the}} effect of prolonged low-dose lead exposure, male Sprague Dawley rats (initial weight, 150. 5 ± 17. 4 g; final weight, 300. 5 ± 17. 4 g; n= 10) administered lead acetate (100 p. p. m.) in drinking water over a period of 3 months, were investigated for renal function parameters. Treated rats had elevated blood pressures (114. 4 ± 4. 2 vs. 95. 7 ± 3. 5 mmHg; P< 0. 01). There {{was no significant difference in}} renal blood flow (3. 99 ± 0. 28 vs. 4. 19 ± 0. 63 ml/min; P=NS). GFR was comparable in the two groups (0. 77 ± 0. 05 vs. 0. 88 ± 0. 06 ml/min; P=NS). No significant difference in serum creatinine was observed (57. 8 ± 7. 5 vs. 49. 0 ± 2. 7 μmol/l; P=NS). Renal histology showed minimal interstitial changes in the experimental group. Interestingly, significant sodium (P< 0. 01); potassium (P< 0. 05) and chloride (P< 0. 05) retention were observed in the lead treated rats. Elevation of blood pressure occurred at a stage when low-level lead exposure did not alter renal function parameters appreciably. These results suggest that hypertension may be a forerunner of significant renal damage following chronic {{exposure to}} low-levels of lead and further underscore fluid and <b>electrolyte</b> <b>retention</b> as a significant mechanism responsible for elevated blood pressure in the chronic stages of lead exposure...|$|E
40|$|Aim: In the anaesthetized rat, uridine {{adenosine}} tetraphosphate (Up 4 A) is a circulating, endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor presumably {{operating as}} such in un-anaesthetized animals. The present {{study investigated the}} in vivo effects of Up 4 A in conscious mice and rats, and its direct vascular effects in the mouse aorta in vitro. Methods: In vivo, Up 4 A was given as step-up infusion at rates of 8 - 512 nmol min - 1 kg- 1 for 30 min periods in chronically catheterized rodents. In vitro, the effect of Up 4 A on rings of mouse aortae mounted in a myograph was tested. Results: High doses of Up 4 A (mice: 512 nmol min- 1 kg- 1; rats: 128 nmol min- 1 kg- 1) caused hypotension (99 ± 4 to 64 ± 7 mmHg and 114 ± 3 to 108 ± 3 mmHg, respectively, both P 75 % and potassium excretion by ∼ 60 % without significant changes in urine flow. Exposure of phenylephrine-contracted rings to increasing concentrations of Up 4 A elicited contraction at 10 - 7 and 10 - 6 mol L- 1 (18 ± 2 % and 76 ± 16 % respectively); unexpectedly, 10 - 5 mol L- 1 caused a biphasic response with a contraction (19 ± 6 %) followed by a relaxation (- 46 ± 6 %). No relaxation was observed when the concentration was increased further. Bolus exposure to 10 - 5 mol L- 1 of Up 4 A caused contraction (+ 80 ± 2 %). Added successively to untreated vessels, increasing concentrations of Up 4 A (10 - 7 - 10 - 5 mol L- 1) induced a biphasic response of contraction followed by relaxation. Conclusion: Up 4 A has direct biphasic effects on vascular smooth muscle of the mouse aorta but vasoconstriction dominates at low concentrations. In conscious rodents, step-up infusions of Up 4 A elicit hypotension and <b>electrolyte</b> <b>retention.</b> © 2010 Scandinavian Physiological Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
