500|$|The tale is {{followed}} immediately by two morals: [...] "one {{stresses the importance}} of possessing industrie and savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess." [...] The Italian translation by Carlo Collodi notes that the tale gives useful advice <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to be a cat or a Marquis of Carabas.|$|E
2500|$|I {{am sorry}} {{to say that in}} my mind is an {{absolute}} blank to the opening of The Criterion. I never saw Topseyturveydom. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to have a copy of it and could lend it to me for a few hours it might suggest some reminiscences: as it is I don't even know what the piece was about! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A truce to this farce, my lord," [...] she {{retorted}} impatiently. [...] "I {{were not}} here <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> {{to be my}} slave, and took commands from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, by the way, Jeanne, {{please call}} me Henri now; Harry is English, and people would notice {{directly}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> to say it while anyone is near." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear chap, they'd {{steal the}} gold filling {{out of your}} teeth, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> to yawn," [...] said Argyle. [...] "Why, have you left {{valuables}} in your overcoat?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Meno asks Socrates: [...] "And {{how will}} you inquire into a thing when you are wholly ignorant of what it is? Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to bump right into it, {{how will you}} know it is the thing you didn't know?" [...] Socrates rephrases the question, which has come to be the {{canonical}} statement of the paradox: [...] " [...] man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not know He cannot search for what he knows--since he knows it, {{there is no need to}} search--nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to look for." ...|$|E
2500|$|She is, however, {{at pains}} to stress the {{differences}} between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books {{you go into a}} world within a world that you can see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday world. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal." [...] New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until converted by Aslan.|$|E
2500|$|J. K. Rowling, {{author of}} the Harry Potter series, has {{said that she was}} a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the {{influence}} of The Chronicles on her work: [...] "I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross Stationâ€” it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts." [...] Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child.

6000|$|... "You could <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> to hit him," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "or the thing didn't jam. Really, I haven't {{much faith in}} an automatic. I have used them myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "H'm! I'm {{not so sure}} o' that, Little Bill. You're such a {{practical}} little chap that I do believe <b>if</b> <b>you</b> was put to it you'd be able to-- see, now. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> to want to marry a nice little gal, what would you do?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Ellmother looked wretchedly ill. Mrs. Ellmother {{had told}} Emily that her object, in {{returning}} to domestic service, {{was to try}} if change would relieve her from the oppression of her own thoughts. Mrs. Ellmother believed in vulgar superstitions which declared Friday to be an unlucky day; and which recommended throwing a pinch over your left shoulder, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> to spill the salt.|$|R

6000|$|... "But you forget," [...] {{returned}} the Woozy; [...] "my tremendous growl would also frighten you, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to have heart disease you might expire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You mustn't listen. Try {{and think}} you're {{a piece of}} furniture. See? And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do <b>happen</b> to overhear anything, you needn't go gassing about it. Follow?' ...|$|R
60|$|I heard a manly, Christian sermon last Sunday at the Foundling--with great satisfaction. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> should <b>happen</b> to {{know the}} preacher of it, pray thank him from me.|$|R
60|$|FRANK [rising] Anything {{to oblige}} <b>you,</b> Crofts--except church. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> should <b>happen</b> to want me, Vivvums, ring the gate bell. [He {{goes into the}} house with unruffled suavity].|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{mountain}} solitudes," [...] I remarked, [...] "are {{very attractive}} in fine weather. On a rainy day, especially <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to be {{past the age}} when--" ...|$|E
60|$|That was all, {{but quite}} enough {{foundation}} {{to build this}} present story on. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to like the story, give credit to my little friend's clever hint.|$|E
6000|$|I {{will take}} this {{occasion}} of recommending to you (<b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to have Daniel's poems) {{to read the}} epistle addressed to the Lady Margaret, Countess of Cumberland, beginning, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't {{have any}} regular hours for meeting," [...] Mr. Bunny said while first telling about the association. [...] "When 'Squire Owl or Professor Hawk have {{had such a}} big dinner that they forget to be hungry, we get {{together}} around the tree, {{those of us who}} belong to the fur section, with the associates of the feather department on the branches, and then it is that you might hear some rare stories <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> along that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Justice," [...] remarked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, [...] "is a {{dangerous}} thing to meddle with. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> hadn't <b>happened</b> to find the piglet, Eureka would surely have been executed." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hough {{turned to}} Neale. [...] "The girl's a favorite. You ruffled her vanity... you see. That's Benton. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had <b>happened</b> {{to be alone}} {{you would have had}} gunplay. Be careful after this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to be a cyclist, Captain--er--Graf; but if you'd like a {{practically}} new motorbike, {{only been}} used since last November, I can let you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] he said shortly. [...] "Mawson's {{looking for}} the other one everywhere. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> across it, I give you carte blanche to buy it for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] exclaimed Dirck, looking exultingly at Bulstrode; [...] "you see, gentlemen and ladies, {{that it is}} {{permitted}} to toast a person present, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to respect and esteem that person!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Listeners were {{encouraged}} to follow the clues, drawing their own conclusions, and match wits with the panel and the detective himself. Jim Harmon described the situation in his book, [...] "The Great Radio Heroes": [...] "Ellery Queen's show was the detective program that gave you, the listener, a chance to join in on the fun and games. You were given all the clues, and you could solve the mystery [...] - [...] <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> to be a deductive genius {{on the level of}} Ellery Queen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, sir,' {{interrupted}} Checco, {{speaking to}} me, 'you {{see how things}} stand: we are on thin ground, and the fire is raging beneath us. You must promise not to seek further quarrel with this countryman of yours, this Ercole Piacentini. He is one of Girolamo's chiefest favourites, {{and he would not}} bear to see him touched; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> to kill him, the Count would take the opportunity to have us all arrested, and we should suffer the fate of the Pazzi at Florence. Will you promise?' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{birds are}} also remarkably tame. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> {{to see one}} perched upon a branch within reach of your arm, and {{advanced}} towards it, it did not fly away immediately, but waited quietly looking at you, until you could almost touch it, and then took wing slowly, less alarmed at your presence, it would seem, than desirous of removing itself from your path. Had salt been less scarce in the valley than it was, this was the very place to have gone birding with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{a prairie}} fire," [...] he replied,--"very dangerous, though, these dry seasons. The flames move {{so quickly that}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> {{to be in a}} certain {{position}} you might easily get cut off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You should {{converse}} with Mr. Dodge on that subject, Master Saunders, {{and let the}} hardest fend off in the argument. May I inquire, sir, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to remember {{the day of the}} week?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Morrison. Novem-- You {{should have}} waited to get sober! [...] It {{comes on the}} 11th of October! [...] And that's to-morrow; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> down [...] Later, you'd better look for us in town.|$|E
60|$|Honora privately {{thought that}} {{building}} ugly, and {{it reminded her}} of a collection of huge yellow fungi sprawling over the ground. A few of the inevitable tortured cedars were around it. Between two of the larger buildings was wedged a room dedicated to the worship of Bacchus, to-day like a narrow river-gorge at flood time jammed with tree-trunks--some of them, let us say, water-logged--and all grinding together with an intolerable noise like a battle. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>happened</b> to be passing the windows, certain more or less intelligible sounds might separate themselves from the bedlam.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{regret that}} I have no card with me," [...] he said, [...] "but I have an office, {{a single room}} only, in number 8, Paper Buildings, Adelphi. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> should <b>happen</b> to come across--that document--" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. ROBERTS. I'm sure I can't tell. It's a {{great many}} years since he went out there, and I've never seen him in all that time. I thought <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did <b>happen</b> to know him--He's a lawyer.|$|R
