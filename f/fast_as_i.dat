This episode came in short, and to fill in time, the sequence was added. Burns has said commented the episode [...] "ended up being incredibly short because when you do an episode where there's really just one good side of an argument , you don't fill out {{as much time as}} you need to." [...] The opening sequence features a large number of allusions to popular culture, including references to The Natural (1984 film), Happy Days (television sitcom), and Men in Black (1997 film).|$|E

[...] "If I make the team ... that would be unbelievable. If I don’t make this team, I plan to still be a champion." [...] He entered the {{competition}} ranked fourth in the 100-meter butterfly, fifth in the 200-meter butterfly, and also qualified in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle. He chose to scratch the 100-meter freestyle {{to concentrate on the}} 200-meter butterfly and freestyle.

[...] He missed making the Olympic team by fourteen one-hundredths (0.14) of a second.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{involving}} the reptiles frequently {{proved to be}} hazardous. During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw me move as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> did {{to get out of the}} tank when I pulled the rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips at the back of the stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E
500|$|At the US National Championships he equaled his 100m best of 9.84s {{while running}} into the wind. This was a meeting record and the second fastest 100m time with a {{headwind}} after Maurice Greene's 9.82s run. He followed this with a new 200m personal best in the finals, again facing an impeding wind. His time of 19.62s was the second fastest ever; only Johnson's 19.32s run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was faster. Gay was happy with the achievement but noted that the competition was still strong: [...] "I wasn't thinking about any time. I {{was trying to get}} away from Spearmon as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could." [...] After noting that he was feeling worn out, Gay had a brief recuperation period in preparation for the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan. He returned to the track in Europe and, while weather conditions were poor, he won the 200m in Lausanne with 19.78s and had wins at 100m events in Sheffield and London. He relished the opportunity to face Powell at the World Championships: both sprinters were undefeated that year and Gay said that he felt ready for the challenge.|$|E

500|$|Posted to RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, Jones was put {{in charge}} of the Motor Transport Repair Section and made acting (later permanent) Officer Commanding Workshops. He was highly {{regarded}} for his technical and administrative ability but rated only [...] "average" [...] in command and dealing with personnel. In 1926 he took up flight instruction and within a year had been graded a 1A Flying Instructor. He was promoted to squadron leader on 31 March 1927 and given command of Flying Squadron at No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS). Jones spent two years in Britain from 1928, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and graduating top of his class at the RAF's Central Flying School. He later recalled of this posting, [...] "The social life was new to me, as was the etiquette... I learned as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could, but I have no doubt that I unwittingly committed many a social blunder." [...] As the RAAF's senior officer in the UK, Jones had expected to be invited to accompany the airship R101 on its maiden flight to India. Instead another Australian officer was nominated to make the trip, and Jones avoided the disaster which followed.|$|E
500|$|There {{was little}} advance {{excitement}} about the pending Warriors-Knicks game that Friday. Only five games {{remained in the}} regular season, with the Warriors (46–29) in second place—eleven games behind the Boston Celtics—and the Knicks in last place. Chamberlain {{had spent the night}} before the game in New York City, partying all night with a female companion before dropping her off at her home at 6am With no sleep and suffering from a hangover, he boarded the train to Philadelphia at 8am, met several friends at the Philadelphia train station, and had a long lunch with them, thus almost missing the team bus to Hershey. The other players were similarly bored. Warriors player York Larese said: [...] "The biggest thrill in my life was to see that. There was nothing exciting about the Knicks playing the Warriors in Hershey. Chocolate was more exciting." [...] The game was played at Hershey Sports Arena, an old drafty gym originally built for ice hockey. The league occasionally played games in remote towns to attract new fans. This was the Warriors' third [...] "home" [...] game of the season in Hershey, which was [...] from Philadelphia. [...] The Warriors' Tom Meschery called the arena [...] "god-forsaken place ...

2500|$|Several {{members of}} the staff, {{including}} The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, has stated that they were against the episode as they felt Barney being sober was not funny. After a long discussion about how the episode should end, the writers decided {{that they did not}} want Barney to return to being drunk {{at the end of the}} episode. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer/producer David Mirkin, who had friends that had stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee. For the episode, the animators gave Barney back-slicked hair to indicate his sobriety, a look which Barney maintained in subsequent episodes until he relapsed in [...] "I'm Spelling as <b>Fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> Can" [...] (2003).

George was particularly scathing about Payne's attempts at jazz/fusion, citing an instance when Payne jammed with Weather Report on a TV show and dropped [...] "into one of his 'Day at the Dog Races'.

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1966 however, {{multiple}} sources began to report progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure; Johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions. There was no shortage of peace initiatives; nevertheless, among protesters, English philosopher Bertrand Russell attacked Johnson's policy as [...] "a barbaric aggressive war of conquest" [...] and in June he initiated the International War Crimes Tribunal {{as a means to}} condemn the American effort. The gap with Hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces. In August, Johnson appointed Averell Harriman [...] "Ambassador for Peace" [...] to promote negotiations. Westmoreland and McNamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification; Johnson formally placed this effort under military control in October. Also in October 1966, to reassure and promote his war effort, Johnson initiated a meeting with allies in Manila—the South Vietnamese, Thais, South Koreans, Filipinos, Australians and New Zealanders. The conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in Vietnam and across Asia. For Johnson it was a fleeting public relations success—confirmed by a 63 percent Vietnam approval rating in November. Nevertheless, in December Johnson's Vietnam approval rating was again back down in the 40s; LBJ had become anxious to justify war casualties, and talked of the need for decisive victory, despite the unpopularity of the cause. In a discussion about the war with former President Dwight Eisenhower on October 3, 1966, Johnson said he was [...] "trying to win it just as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can in every way that I know how" [...] and later stated that he needed [...] "all the help I can get." ...|$|E

Even though the cutting wit of the first decade lost its edge a bit, I still find 'The Simpsons' an extremely enjoyable way to spend my time. There aren't many things that are better than sitting down with a new season of 'The Simpsons' on Blu-ray and watching every episode back to back as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> possibly can.

Imagine, then, my joy at being able to enjoy almost 22 episodes of factory-fresh Simpsons, even though they were made about a decade ago.

As always, this season of The Simpsons features a stellar line-up of guest stars. And, as always, there are some standout episodes. All in all, a more than decent season of this long, long-running show." [...] DIY wrote [...] "While Season 15 of The Simpsons may not be golden from start to finish it has a higher great to soggy episode ratio than more recent seasons.

BubbleBlabber rated it 9.0 out of 10, and concluded [...] "In terms of the content, Season 15 was a highly underrated season for The Simpsons and brought along a number of now well-known classics". DVDMg gave the season a B, and wrote [...] "Should viewers expect greatness from Season 15 of The Simpsons? No, as the year comes with some mediocre shows.
