40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental approach {{on how to}} evaluate the correlation between different force based road <b>grip</b> <b>sensors.</b> Road <b>grip</b> <b>sensors</b> are commonly used to evaluate road safety conditions, eliminating uncertainty for road maintenance. Today, different technologies {{have been developed to}} measure the interactions between tire and road to generate a friction value that describes the amount of grip a tire has on the measured surface. Different systems generates different friction values, thus depending on the measurement system, the road maintenance requirement specifications varies. A correlation between the systems is therefore important to enable specification translations for nations in the Nordic region. The Norwegian Public Road Administration, NPRA has three types of systems that use the technology of longitudinal slip to measure the friction value, with a pulse braking measurement tire. While Luleå University of Technology has a different system, RT 3 Curve, that use the technology of lateral slip, with two toe in set tires causing a slip-angle, forcing the measurement tires to slide continuously. Tests were executed in Røros, Norway for two days during winter conditions. The objectives were to investigate if there was any correlation between the systems and the main depending factors. The results showed that on compact snow and sand covered roads the NPRA systems measured approximately 70 % of the RT 3 's measured value. A linear regression showed that 77 % of the NPRA systems variations {{can be explained by the}} variations of the RT 3 system. The main depending factors are the different measurement tires and the sample-rates. Future studies are necessary to cover more different road surfaces.

As {{the first step toward}} understanding those functions in simple invertebrate microbrains, we tested whether operant conditioning could be applied to train American lobster Homarus americanus that has been extensively adopted as an animal model for neurophysiological analyses of nervous system functions and behavioral control. The animal was trained by food rewarding for <b>gripping</b> of a <b>sensor</b> bar as the operant behavior. Lobsters were first reinforced when they acted on the bar with a stronger grip than a pre-set value. After this reinforcement, the animal learnt to grip the bar for food pellets. The yoked control experiment in which the animal received action-independent reinforcement excluded the possibility of pseudoconditioning that the food simply drove the animal to frequent <b>gripping</b> of the <b>sensor</b> bar. The association of the bar grip with food was extinguished by rewarding nothing to the operant behavior, and was restored by repeating the reinforcement process as before. In addition, lobsters successfully carried out differential reinforcement regarding the gripping force: their gripping force changed depending on the increased force threshold for food reward. These data demonstrate that lobsters can be trained by operant conditioning paradigms involving acquisition and extinction procedures with the precise claw gripping even under the force control...|$|R

The device is based on the Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton (WREX), a passive, mobile arm support developed for children with arm weakness caused by a debilitative condition. Previously, we scaled WREX for use by adults, instrumented it with potentiometers, and incorporated a simple <b>grip</b> strength <b>sensor.</b> The resulting passive device (Training WREX or “T-WREX”) allows individuals with severe motor impairment to practice functional movements (reaching, eating, and washing) in a simple virtual reality environment called Java Therapy 2. 0. However, the device is limited since it can only apply a fixed pattern of assistive forces to the arm. In addition, its gravity balance function does not restore full range of motion. Therefore, we are also developing a robotic version of WREX named Pneu-WREX, which can apply a wide range of forces to the arm during naturalistic movements. Pneu-WREX uses pneumatic actuators, non-linear force control, and passive counter-balancing to allow application {{of a wide range of}} forces during naturalistic upper extremity movements. Besides a detailed description of the mechanical design and kinematics of Pneu-WREX, we present results from a survey of 29 therapists on the use of such a robotic device. I...|$|R

For the current purpose, we newly developed a PC-controlled operant chamber that allowed the animal under a body-fixed condition to perform operant reward learning with claw gripping. Lobsters were first reinforced when they <b>gripped</b> the <b>sensor</b> bar upon presentation of a light cue.

In these training procedures, the operant behavior occurred more frequently in response to the rewarded cue than to the non-rewarded one. The action latency for the reinforced stimuli showed a significant decrease in the course of training. These data demonstrate that lobsters can be trained with the light cues of different intensity as discriminative stimuli under a restrained condition that would allow application of electrophysiological techniques to the behaving subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of the grip force and the 3 D push-pull force (push and pull force in the three dimension space) from the electromyogram (EMG) signal is of great importance in the dexterous control of the EMG prosthetic hand. In this paper, an action force estimation method {{which is based on}} the eight channels of the surface EMG (sEMG) and the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is proposed to meet the requirements of the force control of the intelligent EMG prosthetic hand. Firstly, the experimental platform, the acquisition of the sEMG, the feature extraction of the sEMG and the construction of GRNN are described. Then, the multi-channels of the sEMG when the hand is moving are captured by the EMG sensors attached on eight different positions of the arm skin surface. Meanwhile, a <b>grip</b> force <b>sensor</b> and a three dimension force sensor are adopted to measure the output force of the human's hand. The characteristic matrix of the sEMG and the force signals are used to construct the GRNN. The mean absolute value and the root mean square of the estimation errors, the correlation coefficients between the actual force and the estimated force are employed to assess the accuracy of the estimation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is also employed to test the difference of the force estimation. The experiments are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method and the results show that the output force of the human's hand can be correctly estimated by using sEMG and GRNN method...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel tactile sensor, which {{is useful for}} dextrous {{grasping}} with a simple robot gripper. The novel part consists of an array of capacitive sensors, which couple to the object by means of little brushes of fibers. These sensor elements are very sensitive (with a threshold of about 5 mN) but robust enough not to be damaged during grasping. They yield two types of dynamical tactile information corresponding roughly to two types of tactile sensors in the human skin. The complete sensor consists of a foil-based static force sensor, which yields the total force {{and the center of}} the two-dimensional force distribution and is surrounded by an array of the dynamical sensor elements. One such sensor has been mounted on each of the two gripper jaws of our humanoid robot and equipped with the necessary read-out electronics and a CAN bus interface. As first applications we describe experiments to evaluate the quality of a <b>grip</b> using the <b>sensor</b> measurements and a utility that allows to [...] ...|$|R
