5|$|Xenon is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional <b>distillation</b> in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional <b>distillation,</b> the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto silica gel or by <b>distillation.</b> Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further <b>distillation.</b> Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for xenon, 1€/L for krypton, and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.|$|E

5|$|The purest metal is {{obtained}} from nickel oxide by the Mond process, which achieves a purity of greater than 99.99%. The process was patented by Ludwig Mond {{and has been}} in industrial use since before the beginning of the 20th century. In this process, nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide {{in the presence of a}} sulfur catalyst at around 40–80°C to form nickel carbonyl. Iron gives iron pentacarbonyl, too, but this reaction is slow. If necessary, the nickel may be separated by <b>distillation.</b> Dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in nickel <b>distillation</b> as a by-product, but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non-volatile solid.|$|E

5|$|Argon {{constitutes}} 0.934% {{by volume}} and 1.288% by {{mass of the}} Earth's atmosphere, and air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products.

40|$|The {{separation}} {{of the members of}} the paraffin series is the analysis of natural gas presents many difficulties. Chemical methods are of negligible value because of the close series relationship of the compounds. Combustion methods are fairly satisfactory for determining a mixture of two hydrocarbons, and theoretically can be used to determine a ternary mixture, but in the latter case it is impossible to attain an accuracy of any useful significance. Fractional combustion is of limited value: it permits the determination of H 2, CH 4, and C 2 H 6, but cannot separate the higher hydrocarbons. The use of physical properties, such as density, viscosity, and optical constants, is also limited to the determination of a mixture of two gases. The only methods of analysis in this field capable of making comprehensive and accurate determinations have depended upon some physical method of isolating the constituents and measuring them separately. Fractional <b>distillations</b> making use of the differences in boiling point between the members of the paraffin series require the use of temperatures low enough to liquefy the compounds to be separated. This suggests the advantageous procedure of employing temperatures at which the vapor pressures in question are very small, since the ratio between the vapor pressures of the successive paraffins increases as the pressures are reduced, increasing the degree of fractionation possible. In this manner Lebeau and Damiens fractionated natural gas into groups of two compounds, using single <b>distillations.</b> Later Burrell employed low temperatures obtained with liquid air to make analytical separations of natural gas into constituents as high as butane, making multiple <b>distillations</b> with recombination of fractions. His method was very slow, requiring as much as a week of pumping with a Toepler pump. Shepherd and Porter improved Burrell’s procedure in point of speed, reducing the pumping necessary by making <b>distillations</b> between three bulbs in series. Through the use of an evacuated apparatus entirely of glass with mercury filled gas lines they were able to separate natural gas with three <b>distillations</b> into (CH 4, N 2, H), C 2 H 6, C 3 H 6, C 3 H 8, C 4 H 10 and higher fraction to an accuracy of approximately 0. 1...|$|R
