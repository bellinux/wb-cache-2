He regarded it as a matter of duty, however unpleasant and unforeseen; and if, as they said, he had been a pioneer, education and a knowledge of railroads and the world had helped him. Whereupon, adding tactfully that he desired the evening to himself to prepare for the battle of the morrow (of which he foresaw he was to bear the burden), he extricated himself from his admirers and made his way unostentatiously out of a side door into his sleigh. For the man who had kindled a fire--the blaze of which was to mark an epoch--he was exceptionally calm. Not so the only visitor whom Waters had instructions to admit that evening.|$|R

25|$|The Gipuzkoan command was {{temporarily}} assumed by junta’s vice-president, Luis Zuazola, but the Carlist king did not appoint a new jefe. In the early 1960s Arrúe remained {{the soul of}} provincial Traditionalism, apparently driving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> though also assuming one-day prestigious ceremonial roles. When the claimant decided to compete with Basque nationalism by setting up an inter-regional Vasco-Navarrese council named Junta Foral Superior in 1961, Arrúe was considered an obvious representative of Gipuzkoa and a leading candidate to head the entire body. His opponents considered Arrúe a power-hungry Carlist version of Aguirre, keen to build his Vascongadas fiefdom, and as there were no suitable counter-candidates, the idea of Junta Foral was eventually abandoned. In 1962 José Aramburu was formally appointed jefe provincial.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{milestone}} came in 1961-62. First, in {{a symbolic}} gesture Don Javier declared Hugues [...] "duque de San Jaime", a historic title borne by Alfonso Carlos; then, he instructed {{his followers to}} perceive the prince as embodiment of [...] "a king". Hugues, styling himself as Carlos Hugo, settled in Madrid and set up his Secretariat, a personal advisory body. For {{the first time in}} history, a Carlist heir officially lived in the capital and openly pursued his own politics. From this moment onwards, Don Javier was increasingly perceived as ceding daily business to his son and merely providing general supervision <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> Carlos Hugo was gradually taking control of communication channels with his father, replacing him also as a key person representing the house of Bourbon-Parma in Spain. Moreover, three daughters of Don Javier, all in their 20s, with apparent consent of their father engaged themselves in campaigns intended to enhance the standing of their brother in the Spanish public ambience; the younger son of Don Javier, Sixte, soon followed suit.|$|E

60|$|Poor bewildered Honeyman! {{it was a}} sad day for you, {{when you}} {{appeared}} in your neat pulpit with your fragrant pocket-handkerchief (and your sermon likewise all millefleurs), in a trim, prim, freshly mangled surplice, which you thought became you! How did you look aghast, and pass your jewelled hand through your curls, as you saw Mrs. Newcome, who had been as good as five-and-twenty pounds a year to you, look up from her pew, seize hold of Mr. Newcome, fling open the pew-door, drive out with her parasol her little flock of children, bewildered but not ill-pleased to get away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sermon, and summon John <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> to bring away the bag of prayer-books! Many a good dinner did Charles Honeyman lose by assuming that unlucky ephod. Why did the high-priest of his diocese order him to put it on? It was delightful to view him afterwards, and the airs of martyrdom which he assumed. Had they been going to tear him to pieces with wild beasts next day, he could scarcely have looked more meek, or resigned himself more pathetically to the persecutors. But I am advancing matters. At this early time of which I write, a period not twenty years since, surplices were not even thought of in conjunction with sermons: clerical gentlemen have appeared in them, and under the heavy hand of persecution have sunk down in their pulpits again, as Jack pops back into his box. Charles Honeyman's elegant discourses were at this time preached in a rich silk Master of Arts' gown, presented to him, along with a teapot full of sovereigns, by his affectionate congregation at Leatherhead.|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} in detail {{an arrangement of}} trough-shaped wheel ramps and telescoping articulating control rods intended to allow a wheelchair-bound paraplegic to quickly ascend and descend single steps or curbs as high as 8 in. Data on testing of the system with trained and untrained able-bodied male and female subjects is reported; very limited testing with paraplegics suggests that their performance may almost equal that of the able-bodied. Advantages claimed include simplicity, light weight (8 !b) 'and low cost. Required modification of a standard wheelchair is limited to welding a simple bracket to the outer end of each extended main wheel axle. With ramps and control rods mounted ready for prompt use, chair width is increased {{by a total of}} 6 in. When the chair is used indoors or no curbs are expected, a paraplegic occupant, unaided, can dismount the ramps and rods and store them all in a canvas bag hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>back.</b> In this configuration the chair is only 1 in wider than its originul unmodified width.
