25|$|Fassbinder's second film, Katzelmacher (1969), (Bavarian pejorative slang {{term for}} a foreign worker from the Mediterranean), was {{received}} more positively, garnering five prizes after its debut at Mannheim.

25|$|From the pre-Hispanic {{period to}} the present, {{religion}} has pervaded {{the life of}} people in this region. Since it was imposed in the early 16th century, the Catholic religion has permeated and molded popular culture. Like in other parts of Mexico, indigenous ideas and practices, such as those of the Xochimilca, were not completely eradicated. Instead, many were integrated and readapted to Catholicism. One example of this is the building of churches over former temples and other sacred sites. These churches' decoration often have indigenous elements to them as well. Despite the fact that 91% of the population self identifies as Catholic, there are still many indigenous and traditions related to the agricultural cycle. A more important syncretism has been the many religious festivals that occur through the year, and the means by which these festivals are sponsored and organized. Much of religious practice in the borough is through symbolic processes that work to produce a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> cohesion.

With the production of bioenergy in rural areas, practices within agriculture are transformed, requiring new ways of organizing production processes.

40|$|Learning, {{work and}} {{participatory}} practices To understand further how learning through work occurs {{and can be}} best organised, necessitates setting aside some assumptions embedded in the current workplace learning discourse. It is proposed that workplaces and educational institutions merely represent different instances <b>of</b> <b>social</b> practices in which learning occurs through participation. Learning in both <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> practice can be understood {{through a consideration of}} their respective participatory practices. Therefore, to distinguish between the two in terms <b>of</b> formalisms <b>of</b> <b>social</b> practice (i. e. that one is formalised and the other informal) and propose some general consequences for learning arising from these bases is not helpful. Both these <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> practices are constituted historically, culturally and situationally (Billett 1998), and share a common concern with continuity of practice. The need for workplaces and educational institutions and other <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> institutions and practices have evolved over time and are constituted as the product of particular cultural needs (see Scribner 1985). The manifestation <b>of</b> the particular <b>social</b> practice (e. g. a particular workplace or school) is shaped by a complex of cultural needs and situational factors such as local needs, the individuals involved, and the locally-negotiated goals for the activities including bases for judgments about performance (se...|$|R
