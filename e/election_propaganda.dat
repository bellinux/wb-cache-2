50|$|During the 1990s {{the voting}} of the {{immigrants}} in the elections was confronted, {{in that it was}} always against the present authority. In reality, the immigrants had a considerable part in the falls of the governments of Yitzhak Shamir, Shimon Peres, Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak. With the start of the Second Intifada, {{a big part of the}} soviet immigrants tended towards the right-wing of the political spectrum in their opinions concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict and held hawkish positions in the issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and counter-terrorism. Although most of the Soviet immigrants supported the liberal polices in the subjects of religion and state, because this immigration wave was secular in its majority, they avoided support for the Israeli left-wing parties which consisted of similar positions, as a result of their compromising positions in regard of the Palestinians and their identification of left-wing with the soviet communism. So, for example, the <b>elections</b> <b>propaganda</b> for Ehud Barak based on a distribution of a Russian book which described him as a war hero of Israel. Many political commentators claimed after the elections, that this book had a decisive effect in the victory of Barak in the elections. Likewise, also the big sympathy of Soviet immigrants to Ariel Sharon was in his extravagant militaristic record and in his aggressive image.|$|R

In 1988, the party passed a resolution at its annual conference indicating when to use the full-form and short-form names: [...] the full-form name was to be retained as the official name for use on legal documents and publication credits, and the short form was to be used for most other purposes, including <b>election</b> ballots and <b>propaganda.</b> (This is analogous to how the Conservative and Unionist Party publicises itself as [...] "The Conservative Party".)

50|$|The Nazi Machtergreifung in Germany on 30 January 1933, when President Paul von Hindenburg {{appointed}} Adolf Hitler chancellor, gave {{an enormous}} boost to Austrian Nazis. When the Austrian chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß obstructed further sessions of the National Council parliament on 4 March 1933, the Nazis responded with {{demands for a}} new <b>election,</b> massive <b>propaganda</b> and a wave of bomb terror. Dollfuß responded to these actions with authoritarian measures such as house searches and arrests. The situation was exacerbated by the Bavarian Minister of Justice, the Nazi lawyer Hans Frank, who in a public speech on March 8 threatened the Austrian government with an armed intervention by NSDAP forces. Nevertheless, the right-wing Dollfuss government initially concentrated on the ban of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Republikanischer Schutzbund paramilitary organisation. When Hans Frank, together with his party fellows Hanns Kerrl and Roland Freisler, on 13 May 1933, personally entered the country to speak in Vienna (where he behaved himself) as well as Graz (where he openly spoke against Dollfuß regime and addressed Austrian Germans encouraging civic disobedience), after a two-day tour, on 15 May 1933, he was allegedly deported and the Austrian Nazi Party banned on 19 June 1933. Many Nazis fled to Germany and joined the Austrian Legion, while others remained in Austria and continued their actions illegally. Hitler's government reacted with harsh economic sanctions aimed at Austrian tourism.|$|R

At an event arranged by the Nazi Party in January 1931, Ulbricht was allowed by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Party's Gauleiter of Berlin and Brandenburg, to give a speech. Subsequently, Goebbels delivered his own speech. The attempt at a friendly discussion turned hostile, and a struggle between Nazis and Communists began: police officers divided them. Both sides had tried to use this event for their <b>election</b> <b>propaganda.</b>|$|E

The total number of votes far exceeded the number of registered voters by over 380,000—further evidence that the referendum was heavily rigged. For example, only 450,000 voters were registered in Saigon, but 605,025 were said to have voted for a republic.|$|R

In 1687, Pope Innocent XI divided England into four ecclesiastical districts, and allowed James to nominate persons to govern them. Accordingly, Giffard was appointed the first vicar-apostolic of the midland district by <b>propaganda</b> <b>election</b> on 12 Jan. (N.S.) 1687-8. His briefs for the vicariate and the see of Madaura, in partibus, were dated 30 Jan. 1687-8, and he was consecrated in the banqueting hall at Whitehall on Low Sunday, 22 April (O.S.) 1688, by Ferdinando d'Adda, Archbishop of Amasia, in partibus, and nuncio apostolic in England.

50|$|In the 1910s Carlism was {{increasingly}} paralyzed by internal crisis related to {{conflict between the}} claimant Don Jaime and the key party theorist, Juan Vázquez de Mella; both factions competed to control the Madrid-based semi-official Carlist daily, El Correo Español. Larramendi remained fully loyal to his king; moreover, as a lawyer he helped to transfer the newspaper ownership to marqués de Valldespina and to purge the editorial board from dissenters like Peñaflor. He confirmed his image of a loyal subject also during the 1914 <b>elections.</b> With <b>propaganda</b> campaign already in full swing, the party candidate in Vitoria, Esteban Bilbao, balked at the official plan and fielded his candidature in Durango; as emergency measure Larramendi was asked to replace him. It turned out he had little chance standing against the Conservative leader, Eduardo Dato, though following defeat he {{did not hesitate to}} appeal administrative pressure. In the late 1910s Larramendi was already recognized as an important figure in the party, though he did not rise to executive structures either nationwide or on the regional Castilian basis and was rather considered a young man for the future. The setting changed dramatically when following the end of World War One the claimant was released from his confinement in Austria and early 1919 arrived in Paris to reclaim party leadership from the Mellistas. The conflict exploded in expulsion of de Mella and massive defections of his supporters, many of them occupying key positions in Carlist structures; command chain of the party was decimated. Political delegate of the king in Spain, marqués de Cerralbo, resigned; he was only provisionally replaced by Pascual Comín, who upon appointment declared he was not prepared to stay at the helm longer than provisionally.|$|R

In <b>election</b> posters and <b>propaganda,</b> the HDP has been accused of scaremongering and using the PKK to coerce voters into voting for them, stating that there would be more violence if the HDP failed to pass the election threshold. In contrast, HDP politicians also accused the AKP of scaremongering when they claimed that their affiliation to the PKK made them unfit for parliamentary representation. PKK militants have also been accused of raiding local shops and cafes in the south-east of Turkey and demanding votes for the HDP, with one civilian being wounded when a group of PKK youth militants raided a cafe in Silvan. Selahattin Demirtaş has denied having an 'organic relationship' with the PKK and claimed that the allegations of PKK militants demanding votes for the HDP from voters was untrue.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} have traced {{the origins of}} Thatcherism in post-war British politics. The historian Ewen Green claimed there was resentment of the inflation, taxation and the constraints imposed by the labour movement, which {{was associated with the}} so-called Buttskellite consensus in the decades before Thatcher came to prominence. Although the Conservative leadership accommodated itself to the Attlee government's post-war reforms, there was continuous right-wing opposition in the lower ranks of the party, in right-wing pressure groups like the Middle Class Alliance and the People's League for the Defence of Freedom, and later in think tanks like the Centre for Policy Studies. For example, in 1945 the Conservative Party chairman Ralph Assheton had wanted 12,000 abridged copies of The Road to Serfdom (a book by the anti-socialist economist Friedrich Hayek later closely associated with Thatcherism), taking up one-and-a-half tons of the party's paper ration, distributed as <b>election</b> <b>propaganda.</b> The historian Dr. Christopher Cooper has also traced the formation of the monetarist economics at the heart of Thatcherism back to the resignation of Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft in 1958.|$|E
50|$|In 1929 {{he volunteered}} to assist Liberal Party {{headquarters}} in London with <b>election</b> <b>propaganda.</b> At the eleventh hour {{he was selected}} as Liberal candidate for his home constituency of Hereford at the 1929 General Election.

Upon taking his seat in the House of Commons he became the Baby of the House (the youngest member of the House of Commons). In 1931, when Liberal Party leader David Lloyd George decided to leave the National Government, Owen was the only Liberal MP who was not related to Lloyd George to remain loyal to his leader. Owen fought the 1931 General Election therefore as an official Liberal candidate opposed to the National government. He was comfortably defeated;He stepped away from politics to concentrate on his journalistic career. He wrote a sympathetic biography of his former leader Lloyd George, Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George His Life and Times (Hutchinson of London; 1954). After a break of 24 years he again fought the Hereford seat in 1955. The Liberal party was very weak at the time, but he managed to achieve one of their better results, significantly pushing Labour into third place;His Conservative opponent was then elevated to the House of Lords causing a vacancy. Owen was chosen again as Liberal candidate for the Hereford by-election, 1956. The Liberal campaign was able to present him as the main challenger, having won second place in 1955. This helped him increase his vote and come to within 2,000 votes of the Tory candidate;After this attempt, he declined to stand for parliament again. He was replaced as Hereford Liberal candidate by Robin Day.|$|E

The findings show that the change in the ruling party did make differences in terms of both parties' projection of immigrant women in <b>election</b> <b>propaganda</b> and citizenship legislation.

40|$|In {{his presidential}} {{address to the}} Southern Historical Association in 1960, William Hesseltine commented on the role myths have played in American history 1. A myth is the handing down of statements, beliefs, legends, and customs from one {{generation}} to the next. He stated historians have often ignored the role myths have played in American development. One of the four myths he discussed was the yeoman tradition. The term yeoman referred to plain honest men in England and the term was used commonly in colonial America. The “ agrarian myth ” refers to a nation of yeoman farmers who worked to produce abundance rather than to make money. The intent of this paper is to address the role the agrarian myth has played in forming agricultural policy. The independent farmer as the backbone of democracy is an oft-repeated supposition. It has been the basis for countless government policies ranging from land tenure to food assistance programs. Historians have pursued this topic in all its themes ranging from presidential <b>election</b> <b>propaganda</b> to income support programs for farmers.

Furthermore, is the propaganda to viewed as included in the ”Classical populism”, the ”New populism”, both, or none of the above genres? With a theoretical approach deriving from earlier works on the subject Classical/New populism from a number of writers, the study uses empirical and qualitative text analysis to study the parties propaganda. For each of the two genres of populism an ideal type is set up, which is used to define their core elements. The empirical material is then put in relation to these two ideal types as a reference point, so that it can be examined systematically. The main result of the study concludes that none of the two ideal types matches the information that can be read out from the party ”Socialdemokraterna”´s <b>election</b> <b>propaganda,</b> and that it therefore is to be regarded as neither ”Classical” nor ”New” populism. ”Sverigedemokraterna”´s propaganda on the other hand, displays all of the characteristics that are defined by the theory used in the study as ”New populism”...|$|E
