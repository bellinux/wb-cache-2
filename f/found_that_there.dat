He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a lot of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Generalizing this problem, one can ask {{how many}} lines {{can be drawn}} on a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, {{such as the one}} {{illustrated}} above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician Hermann Schubert, who <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.|$|E

Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to find out}} whether social status is an {{important}} factor for buying consumer electronics (laptops and mobile phones to be specific) and if consumer electronics is therefore affected by conspicuous consumption. Main conclusions of this thesis were achieved by statistical and regression analysis of data acquired from a survey among 290 students of University of Economics. I <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are big differences among how different brands of consumer electronics are perceived from social status and it's signaling value point of view. I also <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is strong dependency between price of products of a given brand and it's social status signaling value. I also <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is not strong connection between price of a mobile phone or laptop and it's functionality, therefore functionality doesn't have strong influence on consumer choices considering buying these products...|$|R

5|$|The {{operation}} was criticised for its poor planning and execution, insufficient preparation, reconnaissance and training, and inappropriate {{command and control}} methods applied by the Sisak Operational Group {{in charge of the}} offensive.

Afterwards, Croatian military authorities investigated the offensive, but <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was very little written documentation, including written unit-level orders, pertaining to the operation. That led Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo to conclude that the offensive was not formally authorised. The formal investigation did not specifically charge anyone with the failures, simply specifying the problems observed instead.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2011 study {{conducted}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium {{should not be}} a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries (about 10kg of lithium per car) could be built with current reserves, as estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are sufficient lithium resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread use of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. The study estimated global lithium reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.|$|E
5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust.

While a parliamentary inquiry <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> has been no evidence of wrongdoing, {{it was felt that}} any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E
