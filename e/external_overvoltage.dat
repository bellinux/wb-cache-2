40|$|Electricity is a {{necessity}} of the modern life due to its everywhere usage. Its proper continuity depends on {{the reliability of the}} equipments used in power system. The transformer is one of the basic components which are commonly used in the power system, generation, transmission or distribution. Its high cost and difficult maintenance highlights its importance in power system. Proper protection is necessary to protect this costly equipment from any damage. Therefore, surge arresters are installed near to the transformer to protect from high voltages. However, during lightning and switching of circuit breakers, re-strikes and pre-strikes during opening and closing of a circuit breaker may lead to a broad band frequency spectrum of overvoltages. Such overvoltages may have an oscillating character and lower amplitude at the transformer terminals. In addition they may arrive at the transformer input without any changes in amplitude and waveform so the surge arrestor will not able to detect any overvoltages near the terminals {{as well as at the}} input sides.. If the oscillating frequency component of the <b>external</b> <b>overvoltage</b> is equal to the natural frequency of the windings, then the magnitude of the internal resonance overvoltage has its maximum value. Therefore, overvoltages generated in transients and switching stages in electrical power equipment may be dangerous for the insulating system despite the applied overvoltage protection. The resonance frequencies for transformer winding have been experimentally determined. The frequency band taken into account was between 10 Hz and 10 MHz, in addition the band has been divided into lower frequency band (10 Hz- 200 KHz) and higher frequency band (200 KHz- 10 MHz). Then applying sinusoidal waves with the resonance frequencies, voltage stresses on different nodes along the winding have been located. From these voltages stressed nodes it was concluded that the stressed nodes are shifting from centre of the winding towards the upper part of the winding as from lower to higher resonance frequencies. After that the voltage distribution at different resonance frequencies was analyzed. At lower frequency band, the voltage stress between turn to ground in terms of standing wave was observed whereas at higher frequency band inter layer stress was the concluded result. Voltage stress on different nodes under wider frequency was also investigated where the same behavior was seen. Step responses were also applied at the input to investigate the resonance frequencies and their voltage stressed along the length of the windings. Finally the results for sinusoidal wave and step response were compared...|$|E
40|$|<b>External</b> <b>overvoltages</b> {{can cause}} several damages to a HV/MV substation, leading to {{insulation}} breakdowns. The appropriate {{protection of the}} substation against <b>external</b> <b>overvoltages</b> is critical, {{in order to ensure}} the efficient, reliable and safe operation of the system. Shielding wires, mast and surge arresters are the main parts of a lightning protection system. The current PhD project deals with the effective lightning protection of HV/MV substations, examining the impact of various factors on the magnitude of the developed overvoltages at different positions of the system. The influence of the equivalent circuit model of the various components to the calculated overvoltages is also examined. Moreover, the substation outage rate due to lightning strokes is calculated, considering shielding failures and back-flashovers. In addition, special issues are discussed, i. e. induced overvoltages and installation of arresters in parallel. In comparison with other studies, main contribution of the thesis is that does not focus only {{on the role of the}} grounding resistance, but examines the dominant influence of other parameters; the improvement of the lightning performance of the substation can be achieved by the appropriate adjustment of various factors of the system. The current work highlights also the advantages and drawbacks of each equivalent circuit model, providing a guide to other researchers in order to select the appropriate models. As far as the risk assessment analysis is concerned, innovation of the performed study constitutes the inclusion of the arresters‟ failure rate to the total substation failure rate, since their possible failure results in malfunction of the nominal operation of the system. The induced overvoltages arriving at the entrance of the substation are also calculated, examining the role of the lightning hit position, the waveform of the lightning current, emphasizing to the role of the installation position of the arresters. Finally, the need for good matching of the voltage – current characteristics of the arresters is revealed, otherwise, the expected equal sharing of the injected lightning current will not be achieved. The current Thesis indicates that the combination of the arresters in parallel does not influence the expected overvoltages, but has to do mainly with the absorbed energy by the arresters...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a reliable, {{versatile}} and rigorous method for {{high frequency power}} transformer modeling is searched and established. The purpose is to apply this model to sensitivity analysis of FRA (Frequency Response Analysis) which is a quite new diagnostic method for assessing the mechanical integrity of power transformer windings on-site. The method should be versatile {{in terms of being}} able to estimate internal and <b>external</b> <b>overvoltages</b> and resonances. Another important aspect is that the method chosen is suitable for real transformer geometries. In order to verify the suitability of the model for real transformers, a specific test-object is used. This is a 20 MVA transformer, and details are given in chapter 1. 4. The high frequency power transformer model is established from geometrical and constructional information from the manufacturer, together with available material characteristics. All circuit parameters in the lumped circuit representation is calculated based on these data. No empirical modifications need to be performed. Comparison shows capability of reasonable accuracy in the range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz utilizing a disc-to-disc representation. A compromise between accuracy of model due to discretisation and complexity of the model in a turn-to-turn representation is inevitable. The importance of the iron core is emphasized through a comparison of representations with/without the core included. Frequency-dependent phenomena are accurately represented using an isotropic equivalent for windings and core, even with a coarse mesh for the FEM-model. This is achieved through a frequency-dependent complex permeability representation of the materials. This permeability is deduced from an analytical solution of the frequency-dependent magnetic field inside the conductors and the core. The importance of dielectric losses in a transformer model is also assessed. Since published data on the high frequency properties of pressboard are limited, some initial measurements are done on impregnated pressboard at different temperatures and moisture-levels. Tanδ is found to be twice the corresponding value for impregnated paper at frequencies from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. Moisture has a minor effect on the losses when frequency approaches 1 MHz. Service-aged paper (impregnated) is also tested in order to investigate other ageing-effects than produced water, but the test show the same decreasing influence at higher frequencies as impregnated pressboard with moisture added. The following main conclusions were drawn from this work: • A simple, analytical approach cannot be used to build a versatile high frequency power transformer model. The reason being mainly the lack of a proper representation of the iron core, since a FEM-representation without the core did not increase coherence to measurements significantly. • A proper representation of the iron core is very important for the calculation of inductances. Losses mainly originate from the core at intermediate frequencies (10 - 200 kHz), and not only from eddy currents in the windings as traditionally assumed. The permeability seem to be of less importance {{as long as it is}} well above permeability for oil, since the internal resonances mainly depends on the leakage inductances. The core leg equivalent is important for the leakage field and determines the leakage inductances and winding losses. • Using a frequency-dependent complex permeability in a FEM-simulation makes possible an accurate representation of core and windings using a coarse mesh. If coating resistivity is sufficiently low to create interlaminar currents/ losses, the iron laminates should be represented by a 2 -dimensional complex permeability. Coating parameters are seldom available. • Dielectric properties of power transformer insulating materials depend on frequency, temperature, moisture, ageing and pressure. Temperature has minor influence on FRA-signatures, other parameters have practically no influence. • Impulse- and resonant overvoltages both internally and on terminals can be analysed using this method with sufficient accuracy, provided the discretisation of the winding is sufficiently refined regarding the frequencies involved. Since terminal behaviour is given by the internal geometry and material parameters, it is assumed that internal behaviour is related to the accuracy of the terminal behaviour. • FRA sensitivity to axial displacement is 1. 2 % of total axial height. The sensitivity to radial deformation (forced buckling) is found to be a buckling depth of 9 % of the radius of the winding. Turn-to-turn short-circuits could not be modeled correctly since the lumped elements includes several turns. Disc-todisc short circuits are easily detected. Axial bending is not detectable. Detection of loose windings and aged insulation is improbable and will be dependent on the available sensitivity (mainly related to the repeatability of the measurements and the reference utilized for comparison). The contributions in this work relates to different topics such as; Frequency-dependent iron core representation in FEM, study of interlaminar currents and its effect on the internal magnetic field, characterization of high frequency dielectric properties of impregnated pressboard and service-aged impregnated paper, procedure for evaluation of internal/external overvoltages, and finally sensitivity guidelines for the application of FRA to mechanical deformations. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
