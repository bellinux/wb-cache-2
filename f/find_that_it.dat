With help from Menion, Balinor escapes and confronts both Palance and Stenmin. Practically cornered, Stenmin stabs Palance as a distraction and flees.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{are called}} in to investigate, as the victim's {{description}} seems {{similar to those of}} other victims of a lonely hearts killer still at large. Scully attempts to perform an autopsy on Lauren's body, only to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has liquified with only a skeleton remaining. Scully later discerns that the substance coating the body was a concentrated digestive enzyme, and that the remains are lacking in body fat.|$|E

The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} a shōnen comedy {{that takes place in}} the Kanagawa Prefecture, and centers on Keitarō Urashima and his {{attempts}} to fulfill a childhood promise that he made with a girl to enter Tokyo University together. However, he has forgotten the name of the girl he made the promise to and hopes to be accepted into Tokyo University in order to find her. Having failed the entrance exam twice and with his parents no longer willing to support him, he goes to stay at his grandmother's hotel, only to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has been converted into a female-only apartment. The tenants are about to kick him out when his aunt appears and announces that his grandmother has given him the title to the apartments. Much to their dismay Keitarō becomes the new manager of the family-owned girls' dorm Hinata House and must now balance his new responsibilities in addition to studying for the university entrance exam.|$|E
5|$|Timex {{produced}} a second {{version of the}} ZX81 {{in the form of}} the TS1500, essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983. It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum, incorporating 16 KB of on-board memory. It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum. However, it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after-effects of Timex's botched marketing of the TS1000. Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success, Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS1000. Consumers would take the machine home, plug it in and <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory.|$|E

5|$|In the TARDIS, the Doctor {{agrees to}} take Rose {{to the day}} her father died {{so that she can}} be there when it happens. Upon their arrival in London on Saturday 7 November 1987, they witness the {{accident}}, but Rose is unable to move when the Doctor tells her to go comfort her dying father. Rose asks the Doctor if she can try again, and the Doctor allows it but warns Rose to not run until their former selves have left to prevent a paradox. As the accident is about to happen, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish. Rose and the Doctor fight about her actions, with the Doctor rebuking her for potentially damaging the timeline. The Doctor takes Rose's TARDIS key back and storms off without her. Rose decides to go with Pete to the wedding, while the Doctor walks back to the TARDIS only to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is now an empty shell. Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{runs into}} {{the wreck of the}} Oberon and Leo runs after him, {{followed}} by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at {{what appears to be the}} Lincoln Memorial, only to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is now a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E
5|$|The British {{expedition}} {{was led by}} Vice-Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone {{and sailed}} in April 1795, arriving off Simon's Town at the cape in June. Attempts were made to negotiate a settlement with the colony, but talks achieved nothing and an amphibious landing was made on 7 August. A short battle was fought at Muizenberg, and skirmishing between British and Dutch forces continued until September when a larger military force landed. With Cape Town under threat, Dutch governor, Abraham Josias Sluysken, surrendered the colony. Elphinstone subsequently strengthened the garrison against counterattack and stationed a Royal Navy squadron off the port. Almost a year later a Dutch reinforcement convoy reached the colony only to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was badly outnumbered, and surrendered without a fight. The British occupation continued until the Peace of Amiens in 1802 when it was returned to the Dutch. In 1806, during the Napoleonic Wars, a second British invasion reoccupied the colony after the Battle of Blaauwberg and it remained a British colony until {{the establishment of the}} Union of South Africa in 1910.|$|E

5|$|The contingents from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900. Arriving in Tientsin, the Australians {{provided}} 300 men to an 8,000-strong {{multinational force}} tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at Pei Tang, which dominated a key railway. They arrived {{too late to}} take part in the battle, but were involved in the attack on the fortress at Pao-ting Fu, where the Chinese government was believed to have found asylum after Peking was captured by western forces. The Victorians joined a force of 7,500 men on a ten-day march to the fort, once again only to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had already surrendered. The Victorians then garrisoned Tientsin and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in Peking. HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey, transport, and courier duties in the Gulf of Chihli, before departing in November. The naval brigades remained during the winter, unhappily performing policing and guard duties, as well as working as railwaymen and fire-fighters. They left China in March 1901, having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order. Six Australians died from sickness and injury, but none were killed as a result of enemy action.|$|E

25|$|While it {{is unclear}} what the {{composition}} of the monoliths is, they clearly have mass, which is about the only observation that can be made. In the novel 2010, the crewmen of the spaceship Alexei Leonov measure the mass of TMA-2 and they <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has a density slightly higher than that of air. The masses of TMA-0 and TMA-1 are never revealed by Clarke.|$|E
25|$|GHB {{is often}} taken because users <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> enhances their {{experiences}} {{of being in}} a club, party, or rave; small doses of GHB can act as a stimulant and aphrodisiac. GHB is sometimes referred to as liquid ecstasy, lollipops, liquid X or liquid E due to its tendency to produce euphoria and sociability and its use in the dance party scene. Despite these nicknames, GHB and MDMA (ecstasy) have entirely separate chemical and pharmacological modes of action.|$|E
25|$|The {{penitent}} is {{the subject}} rather than the object of this discourse. Contrition {{is not something that}} happens to the penitent but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on the weeping voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and this moment is surely an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs—by its affectivity, in other words—we should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> works just as well.|$|E

50|$|The {{approach}} is cultural rather than etymological.

25|$|Buckland Windmill {{was built}} by William Cooper, the Henfield millwright, {{sometime}} in the 1860s or 1870s. It stands in the grounds of a house that was lived in by the carpenters of the Buckland Court Estate. The windmill was discovered in 1995, with a mature yew tree standing very close to it. When the owners contacted the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings for advice, they were surprised to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> existed, because the mill had been missed by Ken Farries and Martin Mason, and omitted from their comprehensive work on windmills in the county.|$|E
25|$|Years {{pass and}} Kamin grows old, outliving his wife. Kamin and his {{daughter}} Meribor continue their study of the drought. They <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not temporary; extinction of all life on the planet is inevitable. Ultimately, Kamin confronts a government official who privately admits {{to him that the}} government already knows this but wishes to keep it a secret to avoid a panic. The official gravely points out to Kamin that they only just recently managed to successfully launch artificial satellites using primitive rockets: their race simply does not possess the technology level needed to evacuate even a small colony's worth of people before their planet is rendered uninhabitable.|$|E
25|$|Reluctantly, the Baudelaire orphans go to {{the shack}} and <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is {{crawling}} with crabs and has dripping fungus and horrible wallpaper.

The Quagmires are in a similar situation to that of the Baudelaire orphansthey are triplets, but their brother, Quigley Quagmire, died in a fire along with their parents. They, like the Baudelaire orphans, were left an enormous fortune in the form of sapphires. Duncan would like to be a journalist, and Isadora is a poet (who writes couplets). They both have notebooks, or commonplace books, which they use to write down observations and notions.|$|E
