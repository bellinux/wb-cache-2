5|$|Curium-244 decays into 240Pu by {{emission}} of alpha particle, {{but it also}} absorbs neutrons resulting in {{a small amount of}} heavier curium isotopes. Among those, 247Cm and 248Cm are popular in scientific research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of 247Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it is prone to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons. Synthesis of 250Cm via neutron absorption is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> 249Cm (64 min), which converts by β− decay to the berkelium isotope 249Bk.|$|E
5|$|Twenty nine {{isotopes}} of protactinium {{are known}} with mass numbers 212–240 {{as well as}} three excited isomeric states. Only 231Pa and 234Pa {{have been found in}} nature.

The most important isotopes are 231Pa and 233Pa, which is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> in obtaining uranium-233 and is the most affordable among artificial isotopes of protactinium. 233Pa has convenient half-life and energy of γ-radiation, and thus was used in most studies of protactinium chemistry.

5|$|The longest-lived {{and most}} {{abundant}} (nearly 100%) naturally occurring isotope of protactinium, protactinium-231, has a half-life of 32,760 {{years and is}} a decay product of uranium-235. Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of uranium-238.

25|$|In some thorium {{breeding}} scenarios, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> protactinium-233 {{would be}} removed from the reactor and allowed to decay into highly pure uranium-233, an attractive bomb-making material. More modern designs propose to use a lower specific power or a separate large thorium breeding blanket. This dilutes the protactinium {{to such an extent that}} few protactinium atoms absorb a second neutron or, via a (n, 2n) reaction (in which an incident neutron is not absorbed but instead knocks a neutron out of the nucleus), generate uranium-232. Because U-232 has a short half-life and its decay chain contains hard gamma emitters, it makes the isotopic mix of uranium less attractive for bomb-making. This benefit would come with the added expense of a larger fissile inventory or a 2-fluid design with a large quantity of blanket salt.|$|E
25|$|Dimethyltryptamine is an indole {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid L-tryptophan is produced endogenously where in animals L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid coming from diet. No matter the source of L-tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Tryptamine transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown ex vivo {{to be among the}} most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.|$|E

500|$|Uric acid {{is by far}} {{the highest}} {{concentration}} antioxidant in human blood. [...] Uric acid (UA) is an antioxidant oxypurine produced from xanthine by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, and is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> of purine metabolism. In almost all land animals, urate oxidase further catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin, but in humans and most higher primates, the urate oxidase gene is nonfunctional, so that UA is not further broken down. The evolutionary reasons for this loss of urate conversion to allantoin remain the topic of active speculation. The antioxidant effects of uric acid have led researchers to suggest this mutation was beneficial to early primates and humans. Studies of high altitude acclimatization support the hypothesis that urate acts as an antioxidant by mitigating the oxidative stress caused by high-altitude hypoxia.|$|E
