25|$|It is {{difficult}} to detect most gases {{that are likely to}} be present in diving cylinders because they are colourless, odourless and tasteless. Electronic sensors exist for some gases, such as oxygen analysers, helium analyser, carbon monoxide detectors and carbon dioxide detectors. Oxygen analysers are commonly found underwater in rebreathers. Oxygen and helium analysers are often used on the surface during gas blending to determine the percentage of oxygen or helium in a breathing gas mix. Chemical and other types of <b>gas</b> <b>detection</b> methods are not often used in recreational diving, but are used for periodical quality testing of compressed breathing air from diving air compressors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have {{recently}} been applied in various monitoring applications including hazardous <b>gases</b> <b>detection.</b> However, being a major power consumer of a sensor node, off-the-shelf gas sensors sig-nificantly constrain its lifetime. In this paper we present a WSN for hazardous <b>gases</b> <b>detection</b> with a special focus on the power consumption of the sensor node. The sensor node is designed {{on the basis of}} a planar catalytic sensor with improved power consumption characteristics. The power supply of the node is divided into digital and analogue parts. This is done to guarantee digital remote control of the device even when the analogue power source has already been depleted by the sensing circuit. In addition, we propose a differential gas measurement approach along with specific heating pulses for the sensor to se-cure substantial energy saving. The resulting average power consumption is 1. 45 and 2. 64 mW for the gas sensor and the sensor node respectively. With our techniques, the sensor node lifetime improves from 187 days up to 641 days...|$|R
2500|$|Hemoproteins have diverse {{biological}} functions {{including the}} transportation of diatomic gases, chemical catalysis, diatomic <b>gas</b> <b>detection,</b> and electron transfer. [...] The heme iron {{serves as a}} source or sink of electrons during electron transfer or redox chemistry. [...] In peroxidase reactions, the porphyrin molecule also serves as an electron source. [...] In the transportation or detection of diatomic gases, the gas binds to the heme iron. [...] During the detection of diatomic gases, the binding of the gas ligand to the heme iron induces conformational changes in the surrounding protein. In general, diatomic gases only bind to the reduced heme, as ferrous Fe(II) while most peroxidases cycle between Fe(III) and Fe(IV) and hemeproteins involved in mitochondrial redox, oxidation-reduction, cycle between Fe(II) and Fe(III).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{application of}} the wireless sensor network (WSN) technology for long-duration and large-scale <b>gas</b> leakage <b>detection</b> and it’s monitoring. A WSN based microcontroller equipped with a gas sensor was used for <b>gas</b> leakage <b>detection.</b> The proposed design includes: an Arduino microcontroller, gas Sensors (MQ- 2), and X-Bee. The key purpose of this dynamic system is to avoid damages and hazards associated with the gas leakage. The sensor node collects the gas leakage data thereby locating the specific area of the sensor node. The collected information was further sent to the monitoring section or server to update the data. A specific Lab VIEW programme was created to configure and supervise the operation and the sensing measurements on the network used. X-Bee sends the data information from gas sensor to the data monitoring system that is displayed on LabVIEW. The reliability and productivity of the system are key concerns and influence the design choices for the system hardware and software. We conclude {{with a discussion of}} long-term challenges for WSN technology in <b>gas</b> leakage <b>detection</b> era and outlined our future vision...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{observations}} of dusty debris discs, including {{a growing number}} of <b>gas</b> <b>detections</b> in these systems, to test our understanding of the origin and evolution of this gaseous component. It is assumed that all debris discs with icy planetesimals create second generation CO, C and O gas at some level, and the aim {{of this paper is to}} predict that level and assess its observability. We present a new semi-analytical equivalent of the numerical model of Kral et al. (2016) allowing application to large numbers of systems. That model assumes CO is produced from volatile-rich solid bodies at a rate that can be predicted from the debris disc's fractional luminosity. CO photodissociates rapidly into C and O that then evolve by viscous spreading. This model provides a good qualitative explanation of all current observations, with a few exceptional systems that likely have primordial gas. The radial location of the debris and stellar luminosity explain some non-detections, e. g. close-in debris (like HD 172555) is too warm to retain CO, while high stellar luminosities (like η Tel) result in short CO lifetimes. We list the most promising targets for <b>gas</b> <b>detections,</b> predicting > 15 CO detections and > 30 CI detections with ALMA, and tens of CII and OI detections with future far-IR missions. We find that CO, CI, CII and OI gas should be modelled in non-LTE for most stars, and that CO, CI and OI lines will be optically thick for the most gas-rich systems. Finally, we find that radiation pressure, which can blow out CI around early-type stars, can be suppressed by self-shielding. Comment: Paper in press, MNRAS, 34 page...|$|R

5000|$|The {{technical}} report provides two primary guidance efforts. The {{first is the}} development of a lifecycle for the performance based design on Fire and Gas systems. This safety lifecycle includes the steps required to design a functionally safe fire and gas system, along with establishing the requirements of each of the steps. The {{technical report}} also defines the two metrics that define the effectiveness of fire and gas systems (as opposed to the single metric of safety integrity level (SIL) that is employed for safety instrumented systems (SIS)). These two metrics are coverage and safety availability.The coverage of a fire and <b>gas</b> <b>detection</b> array is defined in two ways. Geographic coverage and scenario coverage. The geographic coverage is the fraction of the area of given elevation of interest where if a fire or a gas release were to occur (i.e., be centered) the fire or gas release would be detected by the fire and <b>gas</b> <b>detection</b> array. Geographic coverage is only concerned with the location and performance attributes of detection equipment and obstructions to the [...] "view" [...] of the equipment. Scenario coverage, on the other hand, is defined as the fraction of fire or gas release scenarios that if they were to occur, would be detected by the fire and <b>gas</b> <b>detection</b> array. Scenario coverage considers not only the location and attributes of the fire and <b>gas</b> <b>detection</b> equipment, but also considers the location, frequency, and dimensions of the fires and gas releases that can occur in a process facility. While scenario coverage provides a richer understanding of the performance of a fire and <b>gas</b> <b>detection</b> system, it also is more resource consuming to calculate.|$|E
