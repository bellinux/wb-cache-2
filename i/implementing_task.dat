Gradually, the remaining colleges at C. Padilla, Cebu City were transferred to the new site. The new campus soon housed the administrative staff, college academic buildings, college library, engineering and science laboratories, and provided sprawling grounds for parking, athletics, and drill purposes.

40|$|Abstract Background Tanzania is {{experiencing}} acute shortages of Health Workers (HWs), a situation which has forced health managers, {{especially in the}} underserved districts, to hastily cope with health workers’ shortages by adopting task shifting. This has however been due to limited options {{for dealing with the}} crisis of health personnel. There are on-going discussions in the country on whether to scale up task shifting as one of the strategies for addressing health personnel crisis. However, these discussions are not backed up by rigorous scientific evidence. The aim of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, to describe the current situation of <b>implementing</b> <b>task</b> shifting in the context of acute shortages of health workers and, secondly, to provide a descriptive account of the potential opportunities or benefits and the likely challenges which might ensue as a result of <b>implementing</b> <b>task</b> shifting. Methods We employed in-depth interviews with informants at the district level and supplemented the information with additional interviews with informants at the national level. Interviews focussed on the informants’ practical experiences of <b>implementing</b> <b>task</b> shifting in their respective health facilities (district level) and their opinions regarding opportunities and challenges which might be associated with implementation of task shifting practices. At the national level, the main focus was on policy issues related to management of health personnel in the context of implementation of task shifting, in addition to seeking their opinions and perceptions regarding opportunities and challenges of <b>implementing</b> <b>task</b> shifting if formally adopted. Results Task shifting has been in practice for many years in Tanzania and has been perceived as an inevitable coping mechanism due to limited options for addressing health personnel shortages in the country. Majority of informants had the concern that quality of services is likely to be affected if appropriate policy infrastructures are not in place before formalising tasks shifting. There was also a perception that implementation of task shifting has ensured access to services especially in underserved remote areas. Professional discontent and challenges related to the management of health personnel policies were also perceived as important issues to consider when <b>implementing</b> <b>task</b> shifting practices. Additional resources for additional training and supervisory tasks were also considered important in the implementation of task shifting {{in order to make it}} deliver much the same way as it is for conventional modalities of delivering care. Conclusions Task shifting implementation occurs as an ad hoc coping mechanism to the existing shortages of health workers in many undeserved areas of the country, not just in the study site whose findings are reported in this paper. It is recommended that the most important thing to do now is not to determine whether task shifting is possible or effective but to define the limits of task shifting so as to reach a consensus on where it can have the strongest and most sustainable impact in the delivery of quality health services.

Task buffers reorder tasks with various priorities and routes them to appropriate virtual machines. Scheduler monitors the task buffering and hardware load status, and decides the optimal number of active physical and virtual machines. In addition, we designed a mechanism wherein tasks with fast executing are routed in fast and high energy consumption machines and slow tasks to slow and low energy consumption machines. As a result, our approach efficiently can shape workloads and manage the optimal number of active virtual machines and physical machines, in terms of energy consumption. To evaluate our approach, we generated synthetic workload data and evaluated it both in simulating and actual cloud environment. Our experimental results demonstrate our approach outperforms in terms of energy consumption to when not using no workload shaping methodology...|$|E

Starting from the first satellite IRS- 1 A, all IRS series of satellites, have been provided with a sub-sampled mode of image display at all IRS data reception stations. Initially the image extraction from the baseband data and the sub-sampled display was realized through a customized hardware processor. Later on the total real time quick look data processing and display of sub-sampled image data functionality has been shifted to software. With a need for variation in the scope for the application like only data acquisition, data acquisition & quick look display at full resolution /subsampled with quick geometric and radiometric correction, deployment based application re-configurability has become a requirement.

40|$|The {{ability to}} link {{variables}} {{is critical to}} many high-order cognitive functions, including reasoning. It has been proposed that limits in relating variables depend critically on relational complexity, defined formally {{as the number of}} variables to be related in solving a problem. In humans, the prefrontal cortex is known to be important for reasoning, but recent studies have suggested that such processes are likely to involve widespread functional brain networks. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a classic measure of deductive reasoning to examine changes in brain networks as a function of relational complexity. As expected, behavioral performance declined as the number of variables to be related increased. Likewise, increments in relational complexity were associated with proportional enhancements in brain activity and task-based connectivity within and between 2 cognitive control networks: A cingulo-opercular network for maintaining task set, and a fronto-parietal network for implementing trial-by-trial control. Changes in effective connectivity as a function of increased relational complexity suggested a key role for the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in integrating and <b>implementing</b> <b>task</b> set in a trial-by-trial manner. Our findings show that limits in relational processing are manifested in the brain as complexity-dependent modulations of large-scale networks. No Full Tex...|$|E
