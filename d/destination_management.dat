40|$|The paper {{deals with}} quality {{management}} in the sector of Tourist Information Centres (TIC) in the Czech Republic {{and the development of}} the quality management systems in the sector as part of the national quality management system in tourism. Since the TICs perform a prominent role in <b>destination</b> marketing <b>management,</b> the quality of their services seems to be of high importance. To set the particular quality criteria and to include the TIC segment in the national quality management system, an analysis and extensive research among visitors to TICs, employees and founders of TICs in the Czech Republic has been accomplished. Another analysis focused on twelve selected national quality management systems abroad using secondary research and on-line interviews with selected specialists on TIC quality. The analysis abroad comprised personal consultations with TIC specialists in England. The observed results implied the conclusion to use the SERVQUAL model and to integrate quality management systems in TICs into the national system based on the principles of the three-level Swiss quality management system.

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} and commercialisation of the volunteer tourism {{sector and the}} potential for negative impacts on host communities have put the sector under increasing scrutiny. Monitoring and evaluation are key aspects of sustainable tourism planning and management, and play important roles in the project planning and implementation cycles of volunteer tourism organisations and <b>destination</b> <b>managements.</b> However, they can be both value-laden and politically charged, making an understanding of context, purpose and various approaches to monitoring and evaluation important. Drawing from evaluation and critical management studies, this conceptual paper reviews the literature, presenting an analytical framework aimed at improving the quality of monitoring and evaluation. The paper is positioned within the adaptancy platform and focuses on qualitative, critical approaches to evaluation. The framework highlights the important influence of context (the issue the volunteer tourism programme is addressing, the nature of the intervention, the setting, the evaluation context and the decision-making context), and identifies four dimensions of volunteer tourism (stakeholders, organisations, markets and programmes) which may influence monitoring and evaluation practices. The analytical framework presented is useful for practitioners developing monitoring and evaluation processes, and for researchers interested in empirical studies which seek to evaluate monitoring and evaluation practices...|$|R

40|$|Visitor loyalty {{with respect}} to {{national}} parks has been under-researched, especially for iconic or ‘once in a lifetime’ tourism destinations. This study reports on results from a survey of 529 visitors to the remote and iconic Purnululu National Park, Australia. An investigation {{of the relationships between}} loyalty, satisfaction and service quality indicates loyalty has multiple dimensions, including word of mouth recommendations and intention to revisit, with each having a different relationship with satisfaction and service quality. These findings, plus the weak correlation between revisiting and positive word of mouth intentions, suggests a need to reconceptualise loyalty in relation to ‘once in a lifetime’ destinations. For these tourism destinations, there may be other ways for visitors to demonstrate loyalty and the associated means for measuring it, rather than intention to revisit. Loyalty may be a transferred concept, with loyalty to one iconic destination resulting in visitation to other, similar <b>destinations.</b> <b>Management</b> implications Traditional measures of visitor loyalty may not be applicable to iconic or ‘once in a lifetime’ tourism destinations. Managers of these types of tourism destinations may be best served measuring word of mouth recommendations or intentions of visitors to engage in positive communications about the destination as a means of determining visitor loyalty. Although potentially difficult to influence, a focus on visitor satisfaction rather than service quality would be beneficial. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
