40|$|People {{often fail}} to {{exercise}} the self-control required to tackle their goals and improve their performance. However, many feel that we have opportunities throughout our lives to <b>start</b> <b>fresh</b> with a clean slate (e. g., around New Year 2 ̆ 7 s Day, after a Catholic confession). Although the notion of 2 ̆ 2 <b>fresh</b> <b>starts</b> 2 ̆ 2 has long been endorsed by our culture, researchers have not systematically explored the implications of <b>fresh</b> <b>starts</b> for people 2 ̆ 7 s motivation to exert effort in goal-directed activities. Across three chapters, I examine (a) how and why <b>fresh</b> <b>starts</b> affect individuals 2 ̆ 7 ability to exert the self-control needed to achieve their aspirations and (b) when <b>fresh</b> <b>starts</b> may adversely influence individuals 2 ̆ 7 motivation to improve their performance. ^ In Chapter 1, three archival field studies demonstrate that people engage in aspirational behaviors (e. g., exercising, creating a goal commitment contract) more frequently {{at the start of}} new time periods that are initiated by temporal landmarks (e. g., {{the beginning of a new}} week/month/year/school semester, or immediately following a holiday, a school break, or a birthday). In Chapter 2, five laboratory studies show that meaningful temporal landmarks—dates imbued with meaning due to their identity-relevance or rarity—are more likely to spur goal pursuit than (a) ordinary days or (b) objectively identical but psychologically less meaningful landmarks. Further, I provide evidence for one mechanism underlying these findings: temporal landmarks (particularly meaningful landmarks) relegate past imperfections to a previous period, making the current self feel more capable of pursuing aspirations. Chapter 3 investigates the impact on individuals 2 ̆ 7 future performance of tracking their performance without incorporating records of their past performance (a phenomenon I refer to as a performance reset). I propose that when individuals believe their past performance was poor, a performance reset will improve their performance by boosting self-efficacy and commitment. However, I expect resets to hurt performance by decreasing commitment without increasing self-efficacy when individuals believe their past performance was strong. One archival field study and four laboratory experiments support this hypothesized relationship between performance resets, past performance, and future performance; these studies also provide preliminary evidence that self-efficacy mediates this relationship. Chapter 4 discusses directions for future research. ...|$|R

Hodder did receive the script for Freddy vs. Jason, and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to Hodder, New Line failed to provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized the outcry among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.|$|E

In his appearances in The Amazing Spider-Man, Brock blames Spider-Man for ending his career by debunking one of his stories. He bonds with the Venom symbiote, a sentient alien that had previously bonded with (and been rejected by) Spider-Man. Together, Brock and the symbiote become Venom. In The Amazing Spider-Man #375, Brock makes peace with Spider-Man after he saves Brock's wife (Ann Weying) from death.

5|$|A <b>Fresh</b> <b>Start</b> is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film {{is the story of}} Jim, a chauffeur, who is fired from his job for drunkenness. Jim becomes a tramp, but decides to reform after a little girl orders her butler to give him food. He encounters her again at the zoo and notices that two men are following the girl and her parents. Jim uncovers a plot to kidnap her and takes the place of their chauffeur. Jim then drives the kidnappers to the police station and secures a new position as the family's chauffeur. According to a trade review, the actual kidnapping scene and where Jim overpowers the villain's chauffeur is not actually depicted. The reviewer also stated the strength of the production is not in the plot, but in the staging and photography. The film was released on September 2, 1910, and it likely had a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} season, Gilchrist made a {{comeback}} for his final IPL stint. He stated the reason {{as being the}} Kings XI management's decision to renew his contract for another season. An interesting change in the team staff was the induction of Darren Lehmann as the new Kings XI coach. This brought together the duo of Gilchrist and Lehmann who had guided their previous franchise, the Deccan Chargers to its 2009 IPL victory. Some good performances by the players led the Kings XI Punjab team eyeing for the fourth spot in the play-offs and a possible maiden win under Gilchrist's leadership.

30|$|Together {{with this}} idea of {{forgiveness}} and <b>fresh</b> <b>starts,</b> {{in this paper we}} also consider the issue of compensating individuals who are endowed with different traits. The most relevant theories of fairness and responsibility argue that inequalities in agents’ outcomes may contain elements for which those agents are responsible, but also other elements they should not be held responsible for. The aim of such theories is to reduce only the outcome differences that originate in factors for which individuals cannot be held responsible (e.g., Rawls 1971; Dworkin 1981 a, b; Arneson 1989; Cohen 1989; and Roemer 1998).|$|R

5|$|The Heath {{ministry}} {{continued to}} experience difficulties with oil embargoes and union demands for wage increases in 1973, subsequently losing the February 1974 general election. Labour formed a minority government {{and went on}} to win a narrow majority in the October 1974 general election. Heath's leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt. Thatcher was not initially seen as the obvious replacement, but she eventually became the main challenger, promising a <b>fresh</b> <b>start.</b> Her main support came from the parliamentary 1922 Committee and The Spectator, but Thatcher's time in office gave her the reputation of a pragmatist rather than that of an ideologue. She defeated Heath on the first ballot and he resigned the leadership. In the second ballot she defeated Whitelaw, Heath's preferred successor. The vote polarised along right–left lines, with the region, experience and education of the MP also having their effects. Thatcher's support was stronger among MPs on the right, those from southern England, and those who had not attended public schools or Oxbridge.|$|E
