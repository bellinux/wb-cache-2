25|$|The Roadsport {{is now the}} second-level {{offering}} from Caterham. It {{is available}} in both S3 and SV chassis sizes, and {{is more or less}} the former Classic with a more powerful engine and a few more extras as standard: heater; hood; spare wheel/carrier; carpets. The engine options are based around the Ford Sigma 1.6 (125bhp, 140bhp) and the Ford Duratec 2.0 (175bhp). Suspension is double-wishbone and anti-roll bar at the front; <b>de</b> <b>dion</b> <b>axle</b> located by an A-frame at the rear, where the old Classic specification had a live-axle set-up.|$|E
50|$|The 770 was {{substantially}} revised in 1938, {{resulting in}} the new internal designation of W150. The all-new chassis was made with oval section tubes and was suspended from coil springs all around, with independent suspension at front and a <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> <b>axle</b> at the rear.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the earlier}} Disco Volante, the 2000 Sportiva uses a tubular space frame chassis covered by an all-aluminium body, and a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Front {{suspension}} was by double wishbones, {{while at the}} rear there was a <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> <b>axle.</b> Brakes were diagonally finned drums, the rears mounted inboard.|$|E
50|$|Swing axles were supplanted {{in general}} use by <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> tube <b>axles</b> {{in the late}} 1960s, though live axles {{remained}} the most common. Most rear suspensions {{have been replaced by}} more modern independent suspensions in recent years, and both swing and deDion types are virtually unused today.|$|R
5000|$|The 250F principally {{used the}} SSG 220 bhp (@ 7400 rpm) 2.5-litre Maserati A6 straight-six engine, ribbed 13.4" [...] drum brakes, {{wishbone}} {{independent front suspension}} and a <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> tube <b>axle.</b> It was built by Gioacchino Colombo, Vittorio Bellentani and Alberto Massimino; the tubular work was by Valerio Colotti.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} and Variomatic was completely redesigned, learning from DAF's experience in Formula Three racing. The Variomatic {{was much more}} robust and now incorporated a differential for smoother low speed maneuvering. The unpredictable swing axle {{rear suspension}} of the 44 and 55 was changed to a leaf sprung <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> tube <b>axle,</b> which greatly improved handling and comfort.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the car's design is the {{geometry}} of the rear axle. Two degrees of negative camber on the rear <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> <b>axle</b> produces a similar stabilising effect as the expensive and complex Weissach axle launched by Porsche {{a year after the}} launch of the Volvo 343. The inherent stability of this design made the car popular with caravan owners, being voted Tow Car of the Year in 1985.|$|E

50|$|The {{front wheels}} of the Iso Rivolta 300 are {{suspended}} by linkages of uneven length with a sway bar. The rear wheels are attached with twin trailing arms using a <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> <b>axle</b> with a Watt's linkage. Coil springs and telescopic hydraulic shock absorbers are fitted to all four wheels. The recirculating ball steering system needs five turns from lock to lock: the turning circle is unusually large at approximately 12.5 meters. With a 7 Â° 30 ' caster angle, straight-line stability is excellent even at 200 km/h (124 mph).|$|E
50|$|The ninth-generation Carry {{received}} a facelift with modish round headlights in 1993 {{and continued to}} be built until 1999. Most export markets continued to receive the previous generation Carry, with bigger engines and most commonly with van bodywork. The older Super Carry is generally more rugged than the DE/DF51, which was fitted with a coil sprung <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle</b> not as suitable for carrying heavy loads. In those rather few foreign markets where the ninth-generation Carry was available, it was sold as the SK306. In late 1997 the retro-styled Suzuki Every C arrived.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 Chapman {{was using}} <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axles</b> for his Lotus racing cars {{and also the}} Vanwall. These had {{initially}} used transverse leaf springs, but later changed to coilover shock absorbers. Chapman had identified some of the de Dion's disadvantages as including its high unsprung weight, the need for sliding splines in the rear driveshafts, and also (a typical Chapman fixation) its insensitivity to changes in weight as fuel is consumed. The first Lotus Twelve Formula 2 cars used the same system, although the de Dion's mass was a drawback for a lightweight single-seater racing car.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950 {{the first}} single-seaters, the Formula 2 [...] "A" [...] types, used an engine that was {{developed}} by Connaught from the Lea-Francis engine used in their [...] "L" [...] type sports cars. The engine was extensively re-engineered and therefore is truly a Connaught engine. The cars were of conventional construction for the time with drive through a preselector gearbox to a <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle.</b> In 1952 and 1953 the races counting towards the World Championship were to Formula 2 rules so drivers of these cars could take part in those events as the table below shows.|$|R
50|$|The ladder-type chassis used 2 in tubing for {{the front}} and rear sub-structures. Front {{suspension}} was by equal-length upper and lower A-arms. The early tubular steel arms were replaced by forged aluminum in later cars. At the rear were two trailing links per side and a <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> <b>axle</b> with a 3.73:1 ratio Salisbury differential that received a finned aluminum cover made by Devin. A Woodhead-Monroe coil-over-shock-absorber at each wheel handled springing and damping. Brakes were by Girling, with 12 in disks at the front and 11 in disks mounted inboard at the rear. Dunlop tires were mounted on Dunlop knock-off wire wheels. Steering was by a BMC rack-and-pinion unit with 2.5 turns lock-to-lock. The interior had two bucket seats and was trimmed in carpet. The dash, designed for either left- or right-hand drive builds, had Stewart-Warner gauges, including a 200 mile-per-hour speedometer and a 10,000 RPM tachometer.|$|E
5000|$|April 1967 saw a restyle of the bodywork, and all Prince {{vehicles}} were {{now known as}} Nissan (but the A30 Gloria was officially registered as [...] "Prince" [...] to the Government). The former Prince company, now integrated into Nissan operations, was given the task of designing the Nissan Prince Royal, {{to be used by}} the Imperial Household, and thus presented a special version of the Gloria which had a similar appearance to the previous Prince Royal. The styling of this generation appears to be influenced by Cadillacs during the same time period. Vehicles designated as the Super Deluxe, the Super 6 and Van Deluxe had the 6-cylinder engine, whereas the Standard and Van Standard used the 4-cylinder engine. Later the Super Deluxe GL became the top trim level. Due to the Gloria and Cedric being combined to save on production costs, the <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> <b>axle</b> previously used by the Prince Gloria was downgraded to a solid rear axle with leaf springs.|$|E
50|$|The Maserati Tipo 151 {{marked a}} return to more {{traditional}} concepts of car design and used a frame comprising a trellis of both round and oval large tubes, an independent front suspension and a <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> <b>axle</b> which had many similarities to that used on the Type 64 completed {{a month or so}} before. The engine was derived from the 450S with a reduced displacement of just under 4.0 Litres. Giulio Alfieri designed the body shape and refined it using a wind tunnel at Milan University. The body was reminiscent of the Frank Costin designed Zagato bodied 450S, but with an accentuated Kamm tail. The mandatory doors opened halfway up the side due to the longitudinal tubes of the frame and the lateral fuel tanks. At Le Mans in 1962 the Johnny Simone car was in the Maserati France colours of red body with a tri-stripe whilst the Cunningham team cars had a white body with two blue stripes. At race end the Cunningham cars went back to the US.|$|E
50|$|The Tipo 61 was {{the most}} well known model but Giulio Alfieri {{designed}} 5 different models, all based on an intricate multi-tubular frame concept. This multi-tubular construction produced a light weight and rigid chassis that was a significant competitive advantage for a racing car. All models included independent front suspension, 4-wheel disc brakes and 5-speed transmission. A <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> type rear <b>axle</b> was used on the Tipo 60 and 61.|$|R
5000|$|The 300 {{series was}} unusual in having the gearbox mounted to the <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> tube rear <b>axle</b> as a transaxle, with the 2 liter models having the {{driveshaft}} enclosed in a [...] "torque tube". The rear-mounted gearbox helped with weight distribution but {{resulted in an}} unusually large transmission tunnel, especially by comparison with then-contemporary front wheel drive competitors such as the Mk. III Ford Escort and the Opel Kadett E/Mk. II Vauxhall Astra.|$|R
5000|$|The 1956 Elva MK II works prototype, {{registered}} KDY 68, {{was fitted}} with a Falcon all-enveloping fibreglass bodyshell. Nichols developed the Elva Mk II from lessons learnt in racing the prototype: [...] "That car was driven in 1956 races by Archie Scott Brown, Stuart Lewis-Evans and others." [...] The Elva Mk II appeared in 1957: [...] "Main differences from the Mark I are {{in the use of}} a <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle</b> as on the prototype, but with new location, inboard rear brakes, lengthened wheelbase, and lighter chassis frame." [...] The car was offered as standard with 1,100 cc Coventry-Climax engine. This went through various changes up to the Mark IV of 1958.|$|R
50|$|In March 1969, Opel {{introduced}} {{a new line of}} KAD models with new bodies and a more sophisticated chassis with a <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> tube rear <b>axle.</b> These cars were slightly smaller than their predecessors. While the lesser models (Opel KapitÃ¤n and Admiral) were also available with a carburetted 2.8 l-inline six, the Diplomat could be had with either a fuel-injected version of this engine (Diplomat E) or with ChevroletÂ´s 327-V8 (Diplomat V8), now coupled to a 3-speed Turbo-Hydramatic.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1954, {{company manager}} and racing driver Brian Lister {{brought out the}} first in a series of sports cars from a Cambridge iron works. Inspired by Cooper, he used a tubular ladder chassis, <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle,</b> and inboard drum brakes. Like others, he used a tuned MG engine and stock gearbox. It made its debut at the British Empire Trophy at Oulton Park in 1954, with former MG pilot Archie Scott Brown at the wheel. Later, Lister swapped in a Moore-tuned Bristol two-litre engine and knockoff wire wheels in place of the MG's discs to improve performance. For the sports car race {{supporting}} the 1954 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Scott Brown won the two-litre class and placed fifth overall behind only works Aston Martins.|$|R
50|$|After Aston Martin {{rejected}} {{proposals for}} a replacement for its DB5 from Touring of Milan, {{the decision was made}} to focus on their own development car, registered 4 YMC. Wind tunnel testing, begun in February 1965, showed development was necessary to counteract a tendency toward aerodynamic lift result of the fastback styling causing reduced rear-wheel traction at high speed. Final development phases relied upon DB5 chassis, suitably lengthened and titled MP 219, with rear lip-spoiler and abbreviated Kammback tail Aston Martin previously incorporated in sports-racing prototypes. The decision was made to produce MP 219 as the Aston Martin DB6 although the prototype <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle</b> was rejected, Aston's soldiering on with its well-located live-axle configuration reducing time to market, cost and complexity.|$|R
50|$|The DAF 46 was carpeted {{throughout}} {{and equipped}} with cloth covered reclining seats. It {{also had a}} redesigned gear lever and additional dash mounted warning lights. Out {{of sight of the}} driver was a <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle,</b> which DAF had fitted two years earlier to their more powerful model when replacing the 55 with the DAF 66: the car retained its defining variomatic transmission, but this was now coupled with a conventional differential which was said to improve noise levels and extend drive-belt life. Reports suggest that the DAF 46 had safer handling than its predecessor, but acceleration was nonetheless considerably slower, {{at a time when most}} European manufacturers were improving top speed and acceleration when they introduced model upgrades.|$|R
50|$|The Eleven was {{designed}} by Colin Chapman and fitted with a sleek body designed by aerodynamicist Frank Costin in California for Laguna Seca. Its top version, dubbed Le Mans, was generally fitted with a 1100 cc (67ci) Coventry Climax FWA engine and occasionally with a 1500 cc (92ci) Coventry Climax FWB engine mounted {{in the front of}} a tubular space frame and featured a <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle</b> and Girling disc brakes. Fully loaded, the car weighed only about 1000 lb. Versions for a 1100 cc (67ci) Climax engine (Club) and a 1172 cc (72ci) Ford engine (Sport) were also produced; both featured a live rear axle and drum brakes. Several cars were fitted with alternative engines by their owners, these included Coventry Climax 1500cc (92ci) FWB and FPF and 1200 cc (73ci) FWE, Maserati 150S 1500cc (92ci), DKW 1000cc (61ci) SAAB 850cc (52ci) and 750cc (46ci) engines. There were two main body styles: one with a headrest and the other with no headrest, just two small fins. Some cars were later fitted with a closed body with gullwing doors to meet GT specifications.|$|R
50|$|In 1964 the Marcos 1800 GT was introduced, {{using the}} four-cylinder Volvo 1800 cc unit with {{overdrive}} gearbox and <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle.</b> This {{was to be}} the design that would become familiar to sports car enthusiasts for more than 30 years, even though the original plywood chassis would later be replaced by a steel chassis. A variety of other engines, mostly from Ford, but also from Triumph and Volvo became available over the years. In 1966 the GT was changed to Ford engines of originally 1500 cc, later 1650 and 1600 cc, and a coil-sprung live rear axle. In 1968 the Ford Essex V6 engine from the Capri Mk1 was added. In 1969 the plywood chassis was replaced by steel, which shortened production time and saved on cost, and the Ford Essex V4 engine replaced the earlier inline-fours. In 1971 a few cars with the Triumph 2.5-litre straight-six were built, to use up engines from the slow selling Mantis. As the bonnet was a close fit over the engine, this variety of engines resulted in a corresponding variation in the bonnet design, particularly as regards changes designed to clear engine air intakes, often the only external sign of the type of engine fitted.|$|R
5000|$|The 3.0-litre (approx [...] at 6200 rpm) {{engine was}} based on the Straight-6 design of the Maserati 250F and {{incorporated}} a lengthened stroke developed by Vittorio Bellentani to increase the capacity from the original 2.5-litres. The compression ratio was reduced from 12:1 to 9.5:1, partly due to the FIA regulations requiring the engine to be run on road car fuel.It used three Weber carburettors, initially 42DCO3, later 45DCO3.A trellis structure was used instead of the tubular one of the 250F, and the aluminium body was by Medardo Fantuzzi. The brakes were the same as the 250F, precisely machined alloy drums with extensive fining. The suspension was also of the same design as the 250F but with some strengthening to cope with the rougher tracks and road surfaces encountered in WSC racing. New features for the 300S included the incorporation of a <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> type rear <b>axle,</b> a transverse four-speed gearbox and two chain driven camshafts.|$|R
50|$|In 1964 the glassfibre-bodied Marcos 1800 GT was introduced, {{using the}} {{cast-iron}} four-cylinder Volvo 1778 cc B18 unit with overdrive gearbox and <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle.</b> It was a sensation when first {{shown at the}} 1964 Racing Car Show. This {{was to be the}} design that would become familiar to sports car enthusiasts for more than 30 years, even though the original plywood chassis would later be replaced by a steel chassis and the futuristic scalloped dashboard also vanished after a few years. The plywood chassis was glued together from 386 separate pieces and was not only light and strong, but also required a minimum up front investment to construct. The extremely low Marcos required a nearly supine driving position and fixed seats, mounted lower than the floor of the car. In return, the entire pedal set could be moved fore and aft with a knob on the dashboard. If this proved not to be enough Marcos also offered optional booster pillows. This setup, with the fixed seats, remained until the end of Marcos production in late 2007. The original Marcos 1800 had a two-spoke steering wheel and a novel dash with a prominent center console, a rather expensive design which did not survive onto the Ford-engined cars. The entire nose portion, of a long and tapered design, was hinged at the front and was held down by latches behind the front wheelwells.|$|R
5000|$|The new 1956 cars {{designed}} by Chapman (along with the aerodynamicist Frank Costin) were of space frame construction, the <b>De</b> <b>Dion</b> rear <b>axle's</b> unsprung weight reduced and front torsion bar added. (None {{of these ideas}} were revolutionary, but Chapman was happy simply to be meticulous.) Furthermore, a fifth gear and Porsche synchromesh {{were added to the}} transmission. The driving seat was placed above this and could not be reduced below 13 in above the road, making the height very problematic (the top of the driver's helmet was fully 50 in from the road surface, while the vertically mounted engine made a reduction impractical in any case), and the handling was suspect despite Chapman's best efforts. The solution which today is obvious, mounting the engine behind the driver, would take two more years to be accepted. Costin made the most of it, and produced a car [...] "much faster in a straight line than any of its rivals". [...] The new car showed early promise in 1956 by winning the non-championship F1 race at Silverstone against strong opposition. It set the lap record at Syracuse Stirling Moss drove the car to victory in what was his only drive for Vanwall that year, as he was still contracted to drive for Maserati in F1. Talented drivers Harry Schell and Maurice Trintignant were the full-timers for the season. However, neither of them had much success although the car showed obvious potential.|$|R
5000|$|Sydney Allard soon saw the {{potential}} of the economically more vibrant - but sports car starved - US market and developed a special competition model to tap it, the J2. The new roadster was a potent combination of a lightweight, hand-formed aluminium body fitted with independent front suspension and <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> type rear <b>axle,</b> inboard rear brakes, and designed for a Ford [...] "flathead" [...] V8. Allard's distinctive front suspension was produced by splitting the I-beam front axle in two to make swing axles, with long radius rods and a new feature, for their day, of inclined telescopic shock absorbers. Importing American engines just to ship them back across the Atlantic proved problematic, so US-bound Allards were soon shipped engineless and fitted out in the States variously with newer overhead valve engines by Cadillac, Chrysler, Buick, and Oldsmobile. In that form, the J2 proved a highly competitive international race car for 1950, most frequently powered by 331-cubic-inch Cadillac engines. Domestic versions for England came equipped with Ford or Mercury flatheads. Russian-American engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov, formerly of Ardun (named after founders Yura and Zora ARkus-DUNtov) where he designed and developed aluminium overhead valve hemi heads for flathead Fords, worked for Allard from 1950 to 1952 and raced for the factory Allard team at Le Mans in 1952 and 1953.|$|R

50|$|The <b>de</b> <b>Dion</b> tube {{was named}} after Comte Jules-Albert <b>de</b> <b>Dion,</b> founder of French {{automobile}} manufacturer De Dion-Bouton. The tube, however, was invented around 1894 by co-founder Charles TrÃ©pardoux for use on the company's steam tricycles.|$|R
