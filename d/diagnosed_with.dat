5|$|The 2012 {{national}} {{report of}} the First Nations Regional Health Study found that of respondents who attended residential schools {{were more likely than}} those who did not to have been <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> at least one chronic medical condition.

40|$|The set of diagnoses is {{commonly}} calculated in consistency based diagnosis, where a diagnosis includes {{a set of}} faulty components. In some applications, the search for diagnoses is reduced to the set of <b>diagnoses</b> <b>with</b> minimal cardinality. In distributed systems, local diagnoses are calculated in each agent, and global diagnoses are calculated for the complete system. The key contribution in the present paper is an algorithm that synchronizes the local diagnoses in each agent such that these represent the global <b>diagnoses</b> <b>with</b> minimal cardinality. The resulting diagnoses only include faulty components used by the specific agent, {{and are therefore a}} condensed local representation of the global <b>diagnoses</b> <b>with</b> minimal cardinality. ...|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} President Reagan {{had given his}} first speech on the epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> AIDS and 20,849 had died of it.
