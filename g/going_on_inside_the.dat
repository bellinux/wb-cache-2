5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E

Naila, the wife of Uthman, threw herself on his body to protect him and raised her hand to deflect a sword. She had her fingers chopped off and was pushed aside. The next blow killed Uthman. Some of Uthman's slaves counter-attacked, one of whom killed the assassin and was in turn killed by the rebels.|$|E
500|$|Brad Wheeler, {{writing for}} The Globe and Mail, {{wondered}} if the eponymous title was an allusion to the Atlantic Records contractual dispute. He went on to remark on the music's combination of 90s era [...] "guitar flash and crunch" [...] and The Beatles. Wheeler did not think the album moved the band or its sound forward, calling it [...] "a quasi-comeback album that neither defiles nor builds upon the band's legend." [...] Amirose Eisenbach of IGN wrote that the music was not [...] "anything especially unique". Eisenbach analyzed several tracks, observing that some songs [...] "start off promising" [...] only to result in [...] "uninspired, generic hooks," [...] while other songs struggle with their musical direction. Despite this, Eisenbach felt the album had [...] "enough <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> album's 41 minutes that it's worth a listen." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first 63 {{issues of}} Animal Man {{featuring}} Bolland's artwork covered the tenures of writers Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Tom Veitch and Jamie Delano, with Bolland's images maintaining a continuity {{of style and}} imagery while the interior work underwent several changes of style and storyline. Initially, he recalls that his cover images derived directly from the script. He would [...] "go through and find a scene {{that looked as if}} it would make a good cover," [...] or [...] "find a particular hook that cleverly summed up what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> book." [...] This included the incorporation of photographs into the later covers of Morrison's tale of metafiction and deus ex machina author-input. With the (post-Morrison) move of Animal Man to DC's new 'Mature Readers' imprint Vertigo, Bolland notes that the covers moved to [...] "full color painted covers" [...] with issue No. 57. These of his covers were [...] "a mixture of ink linework, color washes, airbrush and then, eventually, areas painted in poster color by my wife, Rachel," [...] which ultimately saw her have significant input on some covers, with Bolland acknowledging that [...] "some of the last Animal Man covers were more her than me." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{reason is}} that it puts the {{entities}} about which we require knowledge behind a [...] "veil of perception", an occult field of [...] "appearance" [...] which leaves us ignorant of the reality presumed to be beyond it. He is convinced that such uncertainty propels into the dangerous regions of relativism and solipsism: relativism sees all truth {{as determined by the}} single observer; solipsism, in which the single observer is the only creator of and legislator for his or her own universe, carries the assumption that no one else exists. These accusations constitute a powerful ethical argument against qualia being something going on in the brain, and these implications are probably largely responsible for {{the fact that in the}} 20th century it was regarded as not only freakish, but also dangerously misguided to uphold the notion of sensations as <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> head. The argument was usually strengthened with mockery at the very idea of [...] "redness" [...] being in the brain: the question was—and still is—"How can there be red neurons in the brain?" [...] which strikes one as a justifiable appeal to common sense.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Charles Thomson wrote a {{piece for}} The Huffington Post, [...] "One of the Most Shameful Episodes in Journalistic History", in which he {{detailed}} the story, as he saw it, of why [...] "the trial that was relayed to us didn't even resemble the trial that was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> courtroom." [...] Luka Neskovic also wrote an article for The Huffington Post, [...] "How The Media Shattered The Man in the Mirror" [...] in which he said, [...] "...Except for this trial was declared a [...] "trial of the century" [...] and displayed media at their worst. Sensationalism, exclusivity, negativity, excentricism, chaos, and hysteria {{were some of the}} features. After all, that was the thing that interested them and us the most (and unfortunately there are few who do not fit into stated majority)." [...] During the trial, Matt Drudge accused the media of largely ignoring testimony and evidence that exonerated Jackson and said, [...] "Out here...Michael Jackson is being literally crucified...I think if you did a pulse poll, of people listening to these local talk shows, they would say 95% that Michael Jackson did all this...because it's based on the coverage." [...] Court TV hired tabloid journalist Diane Dimond to cover the trial even though Dimond had previously been sued by Jackson and evaded the suit with the help of prosecutor Sneddon.|$|E
2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved to know what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back." ...|$|E
