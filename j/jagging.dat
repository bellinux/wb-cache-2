On the basis of gene expression profiling of a panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, we found that the predominant Notch ligands were <b>JAG</b> 1, <b>JAG</b> 2, DLL 1, and DLL 3. Given that Notch ligands reportedly have overlapping receptor binding specificities, we postulated that they have redundant biological roles. Arguing against this hypothesis, we found that <b>JAG</b> 1 and <b>JAG</b> 2 were differentially regulated; <b>JAG</b> 1 expression was dependent upon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation in HCC 827 cells, which require EGFR for survival, whereas <b>JAG</b> 2 expression was EGFR-independent in these cells. Furthermore, HCC 827 cells underwent apoptosis following depletion of <b>JAG</b> 1 but not <b>JAG</b> 2, whereas co-culture experiments revealed that depletion of <b>JAG</b> 2, but not <b>JAG</b> 1, enhanced the ability of HCC 827 cells to chemoattract THP- 1 human monocytes. <b>JAG</b> 2 -depleted HCC 827 cells expressed high levels of inflammation-related genes, including interleukin 1 (IL 1) and a broad range of IL 1 -regulated cytokines, which was attenuated by inhibition of IL 1 receptor (IL 1 R).

40|$|Abstract:- Image zooming, {{the process}} of {{enlarging}} the image is a direct application of image interpolation procedures. Image interpolation is {{the process of}} determining the unknown values of an image at positions lying between some known values. The existing system used the PDE-based curvature interpolation method for image zooming by edge-detection. The proposed work also includes the neighborhood regions. The basic interpolation technique i. e. Proximal or nearest-neighbor interpolation is applied. In this technique, the output pixel is assigned the value of the pixel that the point falls within and no other pixels are considered. This is achieved using the advanced neighborhood algorithm for image zooming. Here the input image can be a grayscale, RGB, or binary image. This algorithm computes each output pixel by taking the value of each input pixel and distributes it to the corresponding output pixel's 3 -by- 3 neighborhood. The proposed algorithm performs median filtering for the image matrix using the 3 -by- 3 neighborhood as a smoothing procedure to reduce the artifacts like blurring, <b>jagging</b> and ghosting. The proposed zooming algorithm works with different image types. Keywords:- Curvature interpolation method, Edge-detection, Image zooming, Median filtering, Proximal interpolation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn recent years, the {{application}} of plasma actuators in different engineering fields was considered particularly interesting. It was successfully applied for the cold flow control in aero engines and turbo-devices. One important application concerns the use of non-equilibrium plasma for plasma-assisted ignition and combustion control. The reduction of nitric oxides (NOx) in aircraft engines, gas turbines, or internal combustion engines {{has become a major}} issue in the development of combustion systems. A way to reduce the NOx emissions is to burn under homogenous lean conditions. However, in these regimes the flame becomes unstable and it leads to incomplete combustion or even extinction. Thus, the major issue becomes to stabilize the flame under lean conditions. In this context the present work aims to demonstrate the possibility to increase the combustion efficiency of a lean flame through the use of nanosecond repetitively pulsed plasma (NRPP). A NRPP produced by electric pulses with amplitude up to 40 kV, pulse rise time lower than 4 ns and repetition rate up to 3. 5 kHz has been used to stabilize and improve the efficiency of a lean non premixed methane/air flame in a non-premixed Bunsen-type burner. The burner is optically accessible permitting the imaging acquisitions of the flame region. The flame behavior was acquired using a high rate CCD camera in order to capture the differences between the baseline conditions and the actuated cases. Moreover a post-processing technique showing the <b>jagging</b> of the flame in different conditions was applied to evaluate the changes occurring in presence of plasma actuation in term of flame area weighted respect to the luminosity intensity. It was shown that the plasma significantly allows stabilizing the flame under lean conditions where it would not exist without plasma...|$|E
