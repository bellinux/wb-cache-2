40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} oral Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{on the success of}} eradication therapy against gastric H. pylori. METHODS: A total of 391 patients with dyspepsia were examined for H. pylori using the saliva H. pylori antigen test (HPS), 13 C-urea breath test (UBT), gastroscopy, and gastric mucosal histopathological detection. Another 40 volunteers without discomfort were subjected to HPS and 13 C-UBT, and served as the control group. The 233 patients who were 13 C-UBT+ were enrolled in this study and divided into 4 groups. Patients who were HPS- and 13 C-UBT+ (n = 53) received triple therapy alone. Those who were both HPS+ and 13 C-UBT+ (n = 180) were randomly divided into 3 groups: (1) the O+G+t group which received triple therapy alone (n = 53); (2) the O+G+tm group which received both triple therapy and mouthrinse treatment (n = 65); and (3) the O+G+tmp group which received triple therapy, mouthrinse, and periodontal treatment (n = 62). The HPS and 13 C-UBT were continued for 4 wk after completion of treatment, and the eradication rate of gastric H. pylori and the prevalence of oral H. pylori in the 4 groups were then compared. RESULTS: The eradication rates of gastric H. pylori in the O-G+t group, the O+G+tm group, and the O+G+tmp group were 93. 3 %, 90. 0 %, and 94. 7 % respectively; all of these rates were higher than that of the O+G+t group (78. 4 %) [O-G+t <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 039); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 092); O+G+tmp <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 012); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O-G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 546); O+G+tmp <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O-G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 765); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+tmp <b>group</b> (P = 0. 924) ]. The eradication of gastric H. pylori was significantly improved using the combination of triple therapy, mouthrinse, and periodontal treatment. The eradication rates of gastric H. pylori in the peptic ulcer group, chronic atrophic gastritis group and control group were higher than in the duodenitis group and the superficial gastritis group. The prevalence rates of oral H. pylori in the O-G+t group, O+G+t group, O+G+tm group and O+G+tmp group following treatment were 0 %, 76. 5 %, 53. 3 %, and 50. 9 %, respectively [O-G+t <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P < 0. 0001); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 011); O+G+tmp <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O+G+t <b>group</b> (P = 0. 006); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O-G+t <b>group</b> (P < 0. 0001); O+G+tmp <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> O-G+t <b>group</b> (P < 0. 0001); O+G+tm <b>group</b> <b>vs</b> the O+G+tmp <b>group</b> (P = 0. 790) ]. Both mouthrinse and periodontal treatment significantly reduced the prevalence of oral H. pylori. CONCLUSION: Mouthrinse treatment alone or combined with periodontal treatment can, to some extent, reduce the prevalence of oral H. pylori and improve the eradication rate of gastric H. pylori...|$|R
40|$|Phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) hydrolyzes the sn- 2 {{position}} of cell membrane phospholipids to release fatty acids and lysophospholipids. We have previously reported that <b>group</b> <b>V</b> secretory PLA 2 (sPLA 2) translocates from the Golgi and recycling endosomes of mouse peritoneal macrophages to newly formed phagosomes and regulates the phagocytosis of zymosan, suggesting {{a role in}} innate immunity. Here we report that in macrophages lacking <b>group</b> <b>V</b> sPLA 2, phagosome maturation was reduced 50 – 60 % at early time points while the binding of zymosan was unimpaired. The ability of <b>group</b> <b>V</b> sPLA 2 to regulate phagocytosis extended to phago-cytosis of IgG- and complement-opsonized sheep RBC. Moreover, macrophages lacking <b>group</b> <b>V</b> sPLA 2 had delays in phagocy-tosis, phagosome maturation, and killing of Candida albicans. Cytokine production and eicosanoid generation were not impaired {{by the lack of}} <b>group</b> <b>V</b> sPLA 2. Furthermore, in a model of systemic candidiasis, mice lacking <b>group</b> <b>V</b> sPLA 2 had an increased fungal burden in the kidney, liver, and spleen at day 7 postinfection and increased mortality. Thus, <b>group</b> <b>V</b> sPLA 2 regulates phagocytosis through major phagocytic receptors and contributes to the innate immune response against C. albicans by regulating phagocytosis and killing through a mechanism that is likely dependent on phagolysosome fusion. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 182 : 4891 – 4898. P hagocytosis, the process whereby phagocytic cells inter-nalize large particles, is a key component of innate immu-nity (1). The mechanisms of phagocytosis depend on sev-eral variables, including the type of phagocytic cell, the nature of the stimulus, the number and types of receptors involved, and th...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} and mechanical properties of five different layered structure types of laminated moso bamboo (Phyllosachys edulis) flooring (LBF) were investigated in this study. In addition, the dynamic {{modulus of elasticity}} (DMOE) calculated from ultrasonic wave velocity was also investigated. A good correlation between the DMOE and modulus of rupture (MOR) values of the LBF was found (R- 2 = 0. 92, p < 0. 01). Results indicated that the DMOE can be a predictor of the bending properties of LBF. The mean linear length expansion value of the cross-laminated layered structure type LBF (<b>group</b> <b>V)</b> was {{higher than those of}} the other types. Overall, the mean thickness swelling, water absorption, linear width, and thickness expansion values obtained from <b>group</b> <b>V</b> were smaller than those from the other <b>groups.</b> Thus, <b>group</b> <b>V</b> should be of a better quality than the other groups from the viewpoint of its dimensional stability. The cross-laminated type (<b>group</b> <b>V)</b> of a layered structural design affected the MOE and MOR values significantly less than those of the other groups. However, the mean bending strength (87. 5 MPa) of <b>group</b> <b>V</b> was suitable for flooring purposes, in addition, concerned to the orthotropic bending properties of <b>group</b> <b>V.</b> defined as the ratio of bending properties parallel to fiber direction (MOE(para), MOR(para)) to those perpendicular to fiber direction (MOE(perp), MOR(perp)) were 1. 28 for MOE(para) to MOE(perp) and 1. 20 for MOR(para) to MOR(perp), respectively. The results suggest that it is feasible to evaluate the bending properties of LBF using the DMOE, and <b>group</b> <b>V</b> should be a better choice than the other groups to meet the basic necessities for flooring purposes.
