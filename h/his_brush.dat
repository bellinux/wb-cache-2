5|$|Much of {{the painted}} {{production}} of Verrocchio's workshop {{was done by}} his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ, painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe {{in a manner that}} was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> and never painted again, although this is believed to be apocryphal. Close examination reveals areas that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera using the new technique of oil paint; the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the figure of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo. Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the Archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.|$|E

25|$|Michel {{attended}} college and in 1933 married a fellow student. He {{went on to}} earn a doctorate and became a professor of philosophy.

25|$|Vasari praised Michelangelo's {{seemingly}} infinite {{powers of}} invention in creating postures for the figures. Raphael, who {{was given a}} preview by Bramante after Michelangelo had downed <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> and stormed off to Bologna in a temper, painted at least two figures in imitation of Michelangelo's prophets, one at the church of Sant' Agostino {{and the other in}} the Vatican, his portrait of Michelangelo himself in The School of Athens.|$|E
25|$|The bitter trainband {{controversy}} {{dragged on}} for several years, culminating in stiff fines. Eventually a weary Eames, who was in his mid-fifties when the controversy began and who had served Hingham as first militia captain, a selectman, and Deputy in the General Court, threw in the towel and moved to nearby Marshfield where he again served as Deputy and emerged as a leading citizen, despite <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> with the Hingham powers-that-be.|$|E
25|$|This {{striving for}} {{perfection}} is very {{evident in his}} portrait drawings, where he searches with <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> {{for just the right}} line for the sitter's profile. The critical faculty in making this choice and his perception of its potency in communicating decisively the sitter's character is a true measure of Holbein's supreme greatness as a portrait painter. Nobody has ever surpassed the revealing profile and stance in his portraits: through their telling use, Holbein still conveys across the centuries the character and likeness of his sitters with an unrivalled mastery.|$|E

25|$|For {{some years}} Beverly {{continued}} to work for other theatres at the same time. At Christmas 1855 he provided almost all the scenery both at Drury Lane and at Covent Garden. In December 1862 <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> was employed to excellent advantage on the Princess's Theatre pantomime of Riquet with the Tuft. At Drury Lane {{during the next few}} years he designs some major Shakespeare revivals, and an elaborate production of Comus. From 1868 to 1879 he apparently worked exclusively for Drury Lane. In October 1868 he painted views of London in Jacobean times for Andrew Halliday's King o' Scots.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in 1846 Beverly {{had been}} engaged by John Medex Maddox as {{principal}} artist at the Princess's Theatre, London. In July the scenery for {{the revival of}} James Robinson Planché's Sleeping Beauty was from <b>his</b> <b>brush,</b> as were the backgrounds in the Christmas pantomime The Enchanted Beauties of the Golden Castle. In Easter 1847 he provided ingenious transformations for a revival of A Midsummer Night's Dream. While still continuing his association with the Princess's, Beverly worked for the Lyceum Theatre under Lucia Elizabeth Vestris and Charles James Mathews (1847–55), where Planché compared him with the stage mechanician William Bradwell. His outstanding success was in The Island of Jewels of December 1849, when building {{on the work of}} Bradwell, he pioneered the transformation scene. His scenery at the Lyceum for Planché's Good Woman in a Wood (Christmas 1852), and for Once upon a time there were two Kings (Christmas 1853), was praised by G. H. Lewes and Henry Morley.|$|E
500|$|Hunter {{particularly}} {{strove to}} capture {{in his paintings}} the effects of light, and would repeatedly paint the same objects or locations under a range of lighting conditions. <b>His</b> <b>brush</b> style {{was influenced by the}} French avant garde and, especially in his later work, is described by art critics as '"open and free" [...] and [...] "energetic".|$|E

500|$|In February 1814, {{after the}} final {{expulsion}} of the French, Goya approached the provisional government with a request to [...] "perpetuate by means of <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> the most notable and heroic actions of our glorious insurrection against the Tyrant of Europe". His proposal accepted, Goya began work on The Third of May. It is not known whether he had personally witnessed either the rebellion or the reprisals, despite many later attempts to place him at the events of either day.|$|E
500|$|The {{panel is}} {{one of a number of}} Bacon's {{treatments}} of the biblical crucifixion scene. He also incorporates Greek legend, notably the tale of Aeschylus and the Eumenides—or Furies—found in the Oresteia, suggested by the broad wings of the chimera. Bacon's imagery became less extreme and more imbued with pathos as he got older, and fewer of his canvases contain the sensational imagery that made him famous in the mid-1940s. He admitted that, [...] "When I was younger, I needed extreme subject-matter. Now I don't." [...] According to John Russell, Bacon found it more effective to reflect violence in <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> strokes and colourisation, rather than [...] "in the thing portrayed".|$|E
500|$|As an art critic, Shen {{criticized the}} {{paintings}} of Li Cheng (919–967) for failing to observe the principle of [...] "seeing the small {{from the viewpoint of}} the large" [...] in portraying buildings and the like. He praised the works of Dong Yuan (c. 934–c. 962); he noted that although a close-up view of Dong's work would create the impression that <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> techniques were cursory, seen from afar his landscape paintings would give the impression of grand, resplendent, and realistic scenery. In addition, Shen's writing on Dong's artworks represents the earliest known reference to the Jiangnan style of painting. In his [...] "Song on Painting" [...] and in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen praised the creative artworks of the Tang painter Wang Wei (701–761); Shen noted that Wang was unique in that he [...] "penetrated into the mysterious reason and depth of creative activity," [...] but was criticized by others for not conforming his paintings to reality, such as his painting with a banana tree growing in a snowy, wintry landscape.|$|E

60|$|His best {{award is}} in the {{judgments}} of the unsophisticated heart. A painter who does not burn incense to his palette and worship <b>his</b> <b>brushes,</b> who reverences ideas above mechanism, will have all manner of evil spoken against him by artists, but the human heart will always accept him.|$|R
500|$|Mercator never {{committed}} any of {{his prison}} experiences to paper; all he would say {{was that he had}} suffered an [...] "unjust persecution". For the rest of his time in Leuven his religious thoughts were kept to himself and he turned back to his work. <b>His</b> <b>brush</b> with the Inquisition did not affect his relationship with the court and Nicholas Perrenot recommended him to the emperor as a maker of superb instruments. The outcome was an Imperial order for globes, compasses, astrolabe and astronomical rings. They were ready in 1545 and the Emperor granted the royal seal of approval to his workshop. Sadly they were soon destroyed {{in the course of the}} Emperor's military ventures and Mercator had to construct a second set, now lost. He also returned to his work on a large up-to-date and highly detailed wall map of Europe which was, he had already claimed on his 1538 world map, very well advanced. It proved to be a vast task and he, perfectionist that he was, seemed unable to cut short his ever-expanding researches and publish: as a result it was to be another ten years before the map appeared.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the {{guidance}} of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: [...] "Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster [...] "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the [...] "Reds" [...] (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the [...] "Whites" [...] (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: [...] "The artist constructs a new symbol with <b>his</b> <b>brush.</b> This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world– it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of Potter's tales {{appealed to}} girls, but Mr. Tod {{had a strong}} {{following}} among boys, due perhaps to the lengthy fight {{at the end of}} the book accompanied by [...] "dreadful bad language". Six-year-old Harold Botcherby wrote to Potter asking if the fight between Tod and Brock was still raging. Potter replied; describing the end of the battle and the injuries to the combatants:I am sorry to tell you they are still quarreling. Mr. Tod has been living in the willow till he was flooded out; at present he is in the stick house with a bad cold in his head. As for the end of the fight [...] Mr. Tod had nearly half his hair pulled out of <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> [...] and five bad bites, especially one ear, which is scrumpled up (like you sometimes see nasty old Tom Cat's ears). the only misfortune to Tommy Brock [...] he had his jacket torn and lost one of his boots. So for a long time he went about with one of his feet bundled up in dirty rags, like an old beggar man. Then he found the boot in the quarry. There was a beetle in the boot and several slugs. Tommy Brock ate them. He is a nasty person. He will go on living in Mr. Tod's comfortable house till springtime [...] then he will move off into the woods & live out doors [...] and Mr. Tod will come back very, very cautiously [...] & there will need to be a big spring cleaning!" ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{entry in}} the Dictionary of Art (1996 vol 7, p569), by Geoffrey Ashton, refers to the invisibility of <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> strokes as a [...] "rather unexciting and flat use of paint" [...] but {{contrasts}} that with [...] "Collier's strong and surprising sense of colour" [...] which [...] "created a disconcerting verisimilitude in both mood and appearance".|$|E
2500|$|Joseph McKenzie, an American Thomistic theologian specialising in aesthetics, said in Taki's Magazine {{that the}} {{portrait}} revealed not only Paul Emsley's systemic limitations, but the fundamental crisis of Modernism itself. McKenzie criticises [...] "a false, modernist concept of realism" [...] in art, saying, [...] "Instead of a portrait, Emsley has produced an overblown mug shot." [...] He compares Emsley to a [...] "photocopier" [...] while <b>his</b> <b>brush</b> becomes a [...] "toner cartridge", {{as if to}} underline Emsley's lack of artistic imagination.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1863, Wright was {{run down}} by a mule team but {{recovered}} from his wounds. [...] He {{was shot in the}} left arm during the Battle of Cold Harbor on June 2, 1864.
