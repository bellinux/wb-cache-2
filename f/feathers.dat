5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight <b>feathers</b> at once, {{temporarily}} becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail <b>feathers</b> are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail <b>feathers</b> are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail <b>feathers</b> of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of <b>feathers</b> and finishes with the central pair of <b>feathers</b> so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing <b>feathers</b> close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|Adult Eurasian rock pipits have a {{complete}} moult in August–September, at which time juveniles replace their body and some wing covert <b>feathers,</b> giving them an appearance very like the adults. From late January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and wing covert <b>feathers,</b> and sometimes the central tail <b>feathers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day.

50|$|The pin <b>feather</b> looks {{somewhat}} like a <b>feather</b> shaft. However, unlike a fully developed <b>feather,</b> the pin <b>feather</b> has a blood supply flowing through it. As such, if the pin <b>feather</b> is damaged, a bird can bleed heavily.|$|R
5|$|<b>Feathers</b> are {{a feature}} {{characteristic}} of birds (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. There are several types of <b>feathers,</b> each serving {{its own set of}} purposes. <b>Feathers</b> are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of <b>feathers</b> on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feathers</b> {{have been}} {{important}} and colourful items of clothing and fashion from before the birth of civilisation. Elaborate, brightly-coloured headdresses containing <b>feathers</b> are worn by indigenous peoples of the Americas such as the Bororo of the Mato Grosso. In Polynesia, sega ula lory bird <b>feathers</b> were major trade items, used to decorate high quality mats in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} eleven fossils include {{impressions}} of <b>feathers.</b> Because these <b>feathers</b> are of an advanced form (flight <b>feathers),</b> these fossils are {{evidence that the}} evolution of <b>feathers</b> began before the Late Jurassic. The type specimen of Archaeopteryx was discovered just two years after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. Archaeopteryx seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of evolution.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present new {{insights}} and promising directions for future research on <b>feather</b> pecking in laying hens. Our starting point was a multidisciplinary research program on <b>feather</b> pecking in The Netherlands, in which ethological, physiological, ontogenetic and genetic approaches were combined. The four topics addressed in this paper are: (1) the relation between gentle and severe <b>feather</b> pecking, (2) <b>feather</b> pecking and coping strategy, (3) causation of <b>feather</b> pecking, and (4) the possibility to solve the problem of <b>feather</b> pecking through genetic selection. When the relationship between gentle and severe <b>feather</b> pecking was studied, it was found that both forms of <b>feather</b> pecking are related at the same age. Gentle <b>feather</b> pecking at young age, however, could not be used as a predictor of <b>feather</b> pecking at adult age. Birds from high and low <b>feather</b> pecking lines that showed differences in <b>feather</b> pecking also differed in other behavioural and physiological characteristics. This may reflect line differences in coping strategy. Relating coping strategy with <b>feather</b> pecking may help us to better understand the motivations and characteristics underlying the development of <b>feather</b> pecking. On the causation of <b>feather</b> pecking, there is some evidence that it is redirected ground pecking, deriving either from a foraging or a dustbathing background. However, evidence was found that early <b>feather</b> pecking could also be interpreted as social exploration. Finally, the use of molecular genetics to help solving the problem of <b>feather</b> pecking seems promising. <b>Feather</b> pecking has been shown to be heritable and the first genetic regions (QTL) involved in <b>feather</b> pecking have been identified. To search for a solution for the <b>feather</b> pecking problem it is of importance to identify the mechanisms involved in the development of <b>feather</b> pecking. In this paper, we have combined approaches from different disciplines in order to study <b>feather</b> pecking. The results indicate that combined efforts of multidisciplinary research can be very useful in looking for possible ways to reduce <b>feather</b> pecking in practic...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal behaviours, such as <b>feather</b> pecking, {{can become}} an even greater problem if they spread through the flock. Domestic hens are a social species {{and it has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>feather</b> pecking behaviour can be socially transmitted from few <b>feather</b> pecking individuals to many. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether <b>feather</b> pecking is transmitted from an experimental strain of high <b>feather</b> peckers to an experimental strain of low <b>feather</b> peckers when housed together. The effects of environment and age were also investigated. Four hundred and twenty chicks were housed in either cages or pens in one of three treatment groups; all high <b>feather</b> peckers, all low <b>feather</b> peckers, and a mixed group of half high <b>feather</b> peckers and half low <b>feather</b> peckers. During the rearing phase, severe and gentle <b>feather</b> pecks were recorded at 13 – 15 weeks and <b>feather</b> plumage scored at 12 and 17 weeks. At 17 weeks of age, the groups of mixed hens were removed from the study and the remaining hens resorted into the same three treatment groups. During the laying phase, severe and gentle <b>feather</b> pecks were recorded at 30 – 32 weeks of age and <b>feather</b> plumage was scored at 29 weeks of age. There was significantly less <b>feather</b> pecking and plumage damage in the pens than in the cages. There was no evidence of severe <b>feather</b> pecking spreading from <b>feather</b> peckers to non-feather peckers, even when actual rates of <b>feather</b> pecking were examined rather than only considering the strain of hen. There was some evidence that gentle <b>feather</b> pecking was transmitted in laying hens housed in cages. However, as gentle <b>feather</b> pecking does not lead to plumage damage, this is less relevant to commercial practice...|$|R
40|$|Characterizing <b>feather</b> peckers seems {{a viable}} {{approach}} towards {{a better understanding}} of the problem of <b>feather</b> pecking. With our current state of knowledge on the causation of <b>feather</b> peckinq, the environmental factors that influence the development of <b>feather</b> pecking and the characteristics of <b>feather</b> peckers and non-feather peckers, it should be possible to achieve more control over the problem of <b>feather</b> pecking in European flock...|$|R
5|$|Ruffs of {{both sexes}} have an {{additional}} moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the bar-tailed godwit. Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped <b>feathers.</b> Females also develop a mix of winter and striped <b>feathers</b> before reaching their summer appearance. The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both winter and striped <b>feathers,</b> but the female retains the striped <b>feathers</b> and replaces only the winter <b>feathers</b> to reach her summer plumage. The striped prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial <b>feathers</b> evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures.|$|E
5|$|Specimens of Archaeopteryx {{were most}} notable for their {{well-developed}} flight <b>feathers.</b> They were markedly asymmetrical {{and showed the}} structure of flight <b>feathers</b> in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a barb-barbule-barbicel arrangement. The tail <b>feathers</b> were less asymmetrical, again {{in line with the}} situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The thumb did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of stiff <b>feathers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with <b>feathers</b> {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The <b>feathers</b> of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The <b>feathers</b> of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the <b>feathers</b> on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these <b>feathers</b> have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular <b>feathers,</b> vague and dark on the primary <b>feathers.</b> The underside of the wings is black with browner flight <b>feathers,</b> which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Feather</b> pecking is a {{major problem}} in laying hens. Frustration, i. e. the {{omission}} of expected reward, {{may play a role in}} the development of <b>feather</b> pecking. In two experiments, we studied if <b>feather</b> pecking could be facilitated by short-term frustration in birds with a high <b>feather</b> pecking phenotype and victims of <b>feather</b> pecking (experiment 1), and in birds with a high or low <b>feather</b> pecking genotype (experiment 2). Furthermore, the motivation to peck a key for a food reward was assessed in birds with a high or low <b>feather</b> pecking genotype in experiment 3, as birds that have a stronger motivation may also react stronger to the omission of a reward. We trained birds to peck a key for a food reward in an automated Skinnerbox and tested them in control and frustration sessions. During frustration, the feeder was covered with Perspex. Frustration did not facilitate <b>feather</b> pecking in either experiment. In experiment 1, birds with a high <b>feather</b> pecking phenotype did show more gentle <b>feather</b> pecking and aggressive pecking than victims of <b>feather</b> pecking during some of the control sessions. Furthermore, victims of <b>feather</b> pecking vocalised more than birds with a high <b>feather</b> pecking phenotype. In experiment 2, birds with a high <b>feather</b> pecking genotype scratched more than birds with a low <b>feather</b> pecking genotype, indicating differences in motivation for foraging or dust-bathing behaviour, which shows a relation to <b>feather</b> pecking. Birds with a low <b>feather</b> pecking genotype also had a stronger motivation to peck at a key for a food reward than birds with a high <b>feather</b> pecking genotype. No evidence was found that <b>feather</b> pecking could be facilitated by short-term frustration in a Skinnerbox. However, differences in reaction to frustration and in motivation to peck a key for a food reward in birds with a high or low <b>feather</b> pecking phenotype or genotype indicate that frustration may still play a role in the development of <b>feather</b> pecking...|$|R

5|$|The <b>feathers</b> of Archaeopteryx were asymmetrical. This {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as evidence {{that it was a}} flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical <b>feathers.</b> Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their <b>feathers,</b> and that the <b>feathers</b> of Archaeopteryx fall into this range. The degree of asymmetry seen in Archaeopteryx is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} dromaeosaurid with {{definitive}} evidence of <b>feathers</b> was Sinornithosaurus, reported from China by Xu et al. in 1999.

While direct feather impressions are only possible in fine-grained sediments, some fossils found in coarser rocks show evidence of <b>feathers</b> {{by the presence of}} quill knobs, the attachment points for wing <b>feathers</b> possessed by some birds. The dromaeosaurids Rahonavis and Velociraptor have both been found with quill knobs, showing that these forms had <b>feathers</b> despite no impressions having been found. In light of this, it is most likely that even the larger ground-dwelling dromaeosaurids bore <b>feathers,</b> since even flightless birds today retain most of their plumage, and relatively large dromaeosaurids, like Velociraptor, are known to have retained pennaceous <b>feathers.</b> Though some scientists had suggested that the larger dromaeosaurids lost some or all of their insulatory covering, the discovery of <b>feathers</b> in Velociraptor specimens has been cited as evidence that all members of the family retained <b>feathers.</b>|$|E

40|$|TThe pecking {{behavior}} (severe <b>feather,</b> gentle <b>feather,</b> {{and aggressive}} pecks) of individual White Shaver non-cage laying hens (n = 300) was examined at 21, 24, 27, 32, and 37 wk. Hens were housed in 30 groups of 10 hens each and on 3 cm litter {{with access to}} a feeder, perch, and two nest boxes. The number of severe <b>feather</b> pecks given and received was used to categorize hens as <b>feather</b> peckers (P), victims (V), neutrals (N), or <b>feather</b> pecker-victims (PV) at each age. Hens categorized as PV exhibited pecking behaviors similar to P and received pecks similar to V. Severe <b>feather</b> pecks (SFP) given were correlated with aggressive pecks given, but not with gentle <b>feather</b> pecks given throughout the study. State transition plot maps illustrated that 22. 5 % of P remained P, while 44 % of PV remained PV throughout {{the duration of the}} study. Lifetime behavioral categories identified hens as a consistent <b>feather</b> pecker (5 %), consistent neutral (3. 9 %), consistent victim (7. 9 %), consistent <b>feather</b> pecker-victim (29. 4 %), or inconsistent (53. 8 %) in their behavioral patterns throughout their life. Consistent <b>feather</b> peckers performed more SFP than hens of other categories, and consistent neutral hens received fewer gentle <b>feather</b> pecks than consistent <b>feather</b> pecker-victims. No differences in corticosterone or whole blood serotonin levels were observed among the categories. Approximately half of the population was classified as a <b>feather</b> pecker at least once during the study, while the remainder was never categorized as a <b>feather</b> pecker. Therefore, even if the development and cause of <b>feather</b> pecking may be multi-factorial, once the behavior has been developed, some hens may persist in <b>feather</b> pecking. However, as some hens were observed to never receive or perform severe <b>feather</b> pecks, emphasis should be made to select for these hens in future breeding practices...|$|R
