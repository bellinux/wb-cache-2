5000|$|... 3NMT(Special): Fitted as a {{navigation}} trainer personnel transport. First navigation training position retained, {{slightly modified}} ie: removal of air position indicator {{and replaced with}} radio <b>compass</b> and <b>indicator</b> from removed second navigation position; in addition, three reclining-type chairs fitted; 19 built ...|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} flight simulators, Battlehawks has a cockpit view, {{switchable}} with the keypad {{for a look}} around the aircraft. Instruments are few: airspeed, altimeter, bank and pitch, fuel, rate-of-climb, RPM, <b>compass</b> and <b>indicators</b> for fuel and engine/airframe damage. The cockpit also had levers for landing gear, speed brakes (if equipped) and flaps.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is composed}} of a laminated-wood-sheathed pod containing an enclosed cabin, the engine and two lateral laminated-wood-sheathed boom joining the wing with the directional and diving rudder. The fuselage pod is hexagonal. The instrument panel is fitted with an airspeed indicator, altimeter and vertical speed <b>indicator,</b> a magnetic <b>compass,</b> turn <b>indicator,</b> ignition switch and fuel pump. The cabin also features an air throttle valve and decompressor, a fuel gauge and fuel valve. The motor glider is steered by a stick and rudder bar. The pilot's seat is made to accommodate a backpack parachute.|$|R
50|$|Ill {{health and}} {{increasing}} blindness forced his resignation in 1852 {{and he and}} his second wife returned to England where he died at Clevedon, Somerset in October 1871. During his last years he continued his interest in nautical science inventing an <b>Indicator</b> <b>Compass</b> and the Pelorus for measuring the local magnetism in iron ships.|$|R
50|$|It is {{referenced}} {{by using}} either the magnetic <b>compass</b> or heading <b>indicator,</b> two instruments that most aircraft have as standard. Using standard instrumentation, {{it is in}} reference to the local magnetic north direction. True heading is in relation to the lines of meridian (north-south lines). The units are degrees from north in a clockwise direction. North is 0째, east is 90째, south is 180째, and west is 270째.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{features}} include air conditioning with tri-zone climate controls, tilt leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio controls, cruise control, leather upholstery, heated {{front and rear}} seats, 8-way power front seats, dual memory system, BOSE premium sound system, 6-disc CD changer, outside-temperature <b>indicator,</b> <b>compass,</b> rear radio controls, independent front torsion bar suspension, rear 5-link coil spring suspension specially created for the H2, oversized tires with HUMMER rims, universal garage door opener and remote engine start (2008-2009).|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized <b>compass</b> (or heading <b>indicator)</b> is {{to read the}} magnetic compass only while in straight and level unaccelerated flight. This reading is then used to set the gyro-stabilized compass. The gyro compass will read correctly in a turn, whereas the magnetic compass can't be read properly while turning. Thus the pilot will always ignore the magnetic compass while turning, but periodically check it in straight and level unaccelerated flight.|$|R
5|$|During the war RAF Uxbridge was {{tasked with}} {{despatching}} personnel {{to and from}} training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised formation flying on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with radios, <b>compasses</b> and speed <b>indicators.</b> British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|R
6000|$|After Rob {{had put on}} {{his shoes}} he {{unfolded}} the map, which was plainly visible by the starlight, and marked the direction he must take to cross the Atlantic and reach London, his first stopping place. Then he consulted his <b>compass,</b> put the <b>indicator</b> of his traveling machine to the word [...] "up," [...] and shot swiftly into the air. When he had reached a sufficient height he placed the indicator to a point north of east and, with a steady and remarkably swift flight, began his journey.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the efforts}} of Lt. Colonel Joseph Duckworth, the Columbus Army Flying School {{developed}} and perfected two systems of training, which was adopted by the command. The first was the Flying Evaluation Board. This board instituted tough new criteria to evaluate an instructor's proficiency. The second was the [...] "full panel" [...] attitude system of instrument flying, which is credited with revolutionizing training in blind flying. In addition to the three instruments already used, students were taught to use two gyro instruments, the magnetic <b>compass,</b> the rate-of-climb <b>indicator,</b> and the clock.|$|R
500|$|Northolt {{became an}} active base during the Second World War for Royal Air Force and Polish Air Force squadrons in their defence of the United Kingdom. It {{was the first}} RAF station to operate the Hawker Hurricane, with No.111 Squadron {{receiving}} the first four aircraft in December 1937, and reaching its full complement by February 1938. In the lead-up to war, the RAF implemented a policy of adding concrete runways to important airfields. As a result, by 1939 Northolt had a new [...] concrete runway. Later in 1939 RAF Hendon became one of its satellite airfields. Polish pilots were taught English at RAF Uxbridge, where they also practised formation flying using tricycles with radios, <b>compasses</b> and speed <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
50|$|The flying {{crew were}} {{seated in a}} spacious cockpit, also {{referred}} to as the bridge; the captain and copilot were seated side-by-side while the radio operator sat facing rearwards behind the captain. The flight deck was relatively well equipped for the era, including features such as an autopilot; the flying instrumentation included a Hughes-built turn <b>indicator,</b> <b>compass,</b> and variometer, a Sperry Corporation-built artificial horizon and heading indicator, a Kollsman-built sensitive altimeter, a Marconi-built radio direction finder, a Smiths-built chronometer, and an attitude indicator. The radio operator was furnished with Marconi-built shock-proof radio sets for receiving and transmitting across the radio spectrum; the retractable loop antenna could be repositioned for visual or aural homing.|$|R
