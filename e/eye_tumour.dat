40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{diagnose}} cancer, huge biomedical machines such as PET-CT machines are used. Image fusion is an efficient {{image processing method}} for detecting different types of tumours. In this paper an image analysis system for the <b>eye</b> <b>tumour</b> detection will be designed. In this system, different image processing methods are used to extract the tumour and mark it on the original image. The images are first smoothed using median filtering. The background of the image is subtracted, to be then added to the original, results in a brighter area of interest or tumor area. The experimental {{results show that the}} suggested system based on image fusion, is capable of detecting tumour in the eye.

40|$|Purpose To {{improve and}} {{accelerate}} patient positioning during proton treatment of <b>eye</b> <b>tumours</b> using an automated monitoring procedure Methods and Materials Proton therapy of <b>eye</b> <b>tumours</b> requires positioning in the sub millimetre range. For this purpose, small tantalum clips sutured {{to the eye}} globe serve as landmarks. While the patient is immobilised in the treatment chair and keeps looking at a fixation light, clip and eye positions can be determined with a digital X amp; 64979;ray system providing orthogonal images. The clip projections derived from the treatment plan are superimposed with the present X ray images for position control. By the correction of chair and fixation light coordinates the patient is repositioned until both actual and target clip projections match with each other. In order to avoid a time consuming trial and error correction approach, a novel procedure has been implemented in the image processing software that compares both projections with each other. By automatically calculating the necessary corrections of chair and light coordinates it is aimed to facilitate adjustment to the final treatment position. Results Perpendicular X ray views provided precise patient positioning with an accuracy of below 0. 3 mm. By use of the automated procedure, the mean positioning time could be reduced. Discussion and Conclusions To date, the installation of an on amp; 64979;site digital X ray system for patient positioning is unique in proton therapy.

40|$|The use of {{low-energy}} photon emitters for brachytherapy applications, as in {{the treatment}} of the prostate or of <b>eye</b> <b>tumours,</b> has drastically increased in the last few years. New seed models for 103 Pd and 125 I have recently been introduced. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine recommends that measurements are made to obtain the dose rate constant, the radial dose function and the anisotropy function. These results must then be compared with Monte Carlo calculations to finally obtain the dosimetric parameters in liquid water. We have used the results obtained during the characterization of the new InterSource (furnished by IBt, Seneffe, Belgium) palladium and iodine sources to compare two Monte Carlo codes against experiment for these low energies. The measurements have been performed in three different media: two solid water plastics, WT 1 and RW 1, and polymethylmetacrylate. The Monte Carlo calculations were made using two different codes: MCNP 4 C and EGSnrc. These codes use photon cross-section data of a different origin. Differences were observed between both sets of input data below 100 keV, especially for the photoelectric effect. We obtained differences in the radial dose functions calculated with each code, which {{can be explained by the}} difference between the input data. New cross-section data were then tested for both codes. The agreement between the calculations using these new libraries is excellent.

40|$|Summary In an {{analysis}} of mutations in the RB 1 gene in three patients, selected at random, who had a positive family history of tumours, we identified mutations, in constitutional cells, involving exons 3, 13 and 17 of the RB 1 gene. We used SSCP and PCR sequencing to screen affected individuals {{and other members of}} their families. In two cases the mutations were 2 bp and I bp deletions identified in exons 3 and 17 respectively. The third mutation was a 1 bp insertion in exon 13. All three mutations lead to the generation of downstream premature stop codons as a result of frameshift changes, although the mutation in exon 3 possibly affects the splicing mechanism. The sites within the RBI gene where these mutations occur contain interspersed repetitive DNA sequences, direct and inverted repeat sequences and/or dyad symmetrical elements suggesting that these areas promote the appropriate local sequence environment for the generation of deletions and insertions in the RB 1 gene.

The energy spectra of the primary protons were chosen to get the possibly best agreement between the measured relative depth-dose distributions along the central-axis of the proton beam in a water phantom and that derived from the Monte Carlo calculations separately for the both tested codes. The local depth-dose differences between results from the calculations and the measurements were mostly less than 5 % (the mean value of 2. 1 % and 3. 6 % for the MCNPX and GEANT 4 calculations). In {{the case of the}} MCNPX calculations, the best fit to the experimental data was obtained for the spectrum with maximum at 60. 8 MeV (more probable energy), FWHM of the spectrum of 0. 4 MeV and the energy cut at 60. 85 MeV whereas in the GEANT 4 calculations more probable energy was 60. 5 MeV, FWHM of 0. 5 MeV, the energy cut at 60. 7 MeV. Thus, one can say that the results obtained by means of the both considered Monte Carlo codes are similar but they are not the same.

40|$|Background: Retinoblastoma is an <b>eye</b> <b>tumour</b> of {{childhood}} {{that occurs in}} heritable and non-heritable forms. In the heritable form, there is a predisposition {{to the development of}} non-ocular subsequent primary tumours (SPTs). Methods: This study included 1927 retinoblastoma patients diagnosed in Britain from 1951 to 2004. Ascertainment was through the (UK) National Registry of Childhood Tumours; cases were followed-up for the occurrence of SPTs. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated. Results: We identified 169 SPTs in 152 patients. The SIR analysis included 145 SPTs with cancer registrations from the years 1971 to 2009. These tumours occurred in 132 patients: 112 of the 781 heritable and 20 of the 1075 (presumed) non-heritable cases under surveillance at the start of this period developed at least one registered SPT. The SIRs for all tumours combined were 13. 7 (95 % confidence interval 11. 3 - 16. 5) in heritable cases and 1. 5 (0. 9 - 2. 3) in non-heritable cases. The main types of SPT in the heritable cases were leiomyosarcoma, (31 cases; SIR 1018. 7 (692. 2 - 1446. 0)), osteosarcoma (26 cases; SIR 444. 6 (290. 4 - 651. 4)), and skin melanoma (12 cases; SIR 18. 6 (9. 6 - 32. 4)). Conclusion: The risk of SPTs in heritable retinoblastoma is extremely high.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} review is to give new {{insights}} into the pathogenesis of retinoblastoma, by applying the principles of Epigenetics to the analysis of clinical, epidemiological, and biological data concerning the disease. As an emerging new scientific approach linking the genome to the environment, Epigenetics, as applied to the interpretation of clinical, epidemiological and biological data in retinoblastoma, can not only explain the inconsistencies of the mutational (“two hit”) model, but also open new outstanding scenarios in the fields of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of this <b>eye</b> <b>tumour.</b> This review is both a collection of literature data arguing against the role of the mutational (“two hit”) model in the genesis of retinoblastoma, and a documented evaluation of how the Epigenetic, rather than the genetic model fit the variegated phenotypic expression of the disease. The epigenetic model in the genesis of retinoblastoma, proposed herein, emphasizes the role of environment and the interaction of the environment with the genome, in generating reti-noblastoma in young children. Environmental toxicants, including radiations, wrong diets, and infectious diseases, among others, all {{play a major role in}} conditioning the degree of DNA methylation in embryos and foetuses during pregnancy, thus leading to stable, functional alterations of the genome, which, on the other hand, can be also transmit-ted from generation to generation, thus mimicking a hereditary disease. An accurate analysis of the currently available literature on both retinoblastoma and Epigenetics, coupled with the knowledge of the variegated phenotypic expression of the disease, can easily lead to the conclusion that retinoblastoma is an epigenetic, rather than a genetic disease...|$|E

A comprehensive reference range was established, giving a median Do value of 98. 5 cGy with an interquartile range of 86. 5 - 110. 5 cGy. Cells from 3 retinoblastoma family pedigrees were studied and the cell survival after exposure to X-rays was compared between affected (11 samples) and unaffected (26 samples) family members. No {{significant differences in}} response to ionising radiation {{were found between the}} controls, the affected and the unaffected members of the 3 families. The affected members had a median Do of 97. 5 cGy range 87. 5 - 107. 5 cGy) and the unaffected members had a median Do of 102 cGy (interquartile (interquartile range 93 - 111 cGy). Thus radiosensitivity is not a useful marker for the detection of the retinoblastoma gene. Retinoblastoma is a malignant <b>eye</b> <b>tumour</b> that can occur both sporadically and in genetically predisposed individuals. Children with hereditary retinoblastoma have an increased risk of developing other tumours later in life, particularly osteosarcomas, at sites distant from the eye. They also have a high incidence of radiation induced tumours around the eye. Whether or not these patients or their cultured cells are usually sensitive to the effects of x-irradiation has been a matter of controversy with some research groups showing an increased sensitivity (Weichselbaum et al., 1980, Arlett & Harcourt, 1980, Weichselbaum et al., 1985) whilst others have shown it to be normal (Kossakowska et al., 1982...|$|E
