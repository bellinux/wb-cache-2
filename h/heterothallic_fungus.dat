Here, we provide evidence for mating, fruiting body development, and asco-sporogenesis accompanied by genetic recombination between unrelated, clinical isolates of A. fumigatus, and this evidence demonstrates the generality and reproducibility of this long-time-undisclosed phase in the life cycle of this <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungus.</b> Successful mating requires the presence of both mating-type idiomorphs MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2, as does expression of genes encoding factors presumably involved in this process. Moreover, analysis of an A. fumigatus mutant deleted for the nsdD gene suggests a role of this conserved regulator of cleistothecium development in hyphal fusion and hence heterokaryon formation.

40|$|Almost {{all stages}} of a plant {{pathogen}} life cycle are potentially density dependent. At small scales and short time spans appropriate to a single-pathogen individual, density dependence can be extremely strong, mediated both by simple resource use, changes in the host due to defence reactions and signals between fungal individuals. In most cases, the consequences are a rise in reproductive rate as the pathogen becomes rarer, and consequently stabilisation of the population dynamics; however, at very low density reproduction may become inefficient, either because it is co-operative or because <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungi</b> do not form sexual spores. The consequence will be historically determined distributions. On a medium scale, appropriate for example to several generations of a host plant, the factors already mentioned remain important but specialist natural enemies may also start to affect the dynamics detectably. This could in theory lead to complex (e. g. chaotic) dynamics, but in practice heterogeneity of habitat and host is likely to smooth the extreme relationships and make for more stable, though still very variable, dynamics.

To investigate this unusual phenotype we obtained a draft genomic sequence of a H. werneckii strain isolated from hypersaline water of solar saltern. Two {{of its most}} striking characteristics that {{may be associated with}} a halotolerant lifestyle are the large genetic redundancy and the expansion of genes encoding metal cation transporters. Although no sexual state of H. werneckii has yet been described, a mating locus with characteristics of <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungi</b> was found. The total assembly size of the genome is 51. 6 Mb, larger than most phylogenetically related fungi, coding for almost twice the usual number of predicted genes (23333). The genome appears to have experienced a relatively recent whole genome duplication, and contains two highly identical gene copies of almost every protein. This is consistent with some previous studies that reported increases in genomic DNA content triggered by exposure to salt stress. In hypersaline conditions transmembrane ion transport is of utmost importance.

However, genetic data {{have shown the}} AIDS-associated pathogen Penicillium marneffei to have extensive spatial genetic structure at local and regional scales, and {{although there has been}} some genetic evidence that a sexual cycle is possible, this haploid fungus is thought to be genetically, as well as morphologically, asexual in nature because of its highly clonal population structure. Here we use comparative genomics, experimental mixed-genotype infections, and population genetic data to elucidate the role of recombination in natural populations of P. marneffei. Genome wide comparisons reveal that all the genes required for meiosis are present in P. marneffei, mating type genes are arranged in a similar manner to that found in other <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungi,</b> and there is evidence of a putatively meiosis-specific mutational process. Experiments suggest that recombination between isolates of compatible mating types may occur during mammal infection. Population genetic data from 34 isolates from bamboo rats in India, Thailand and Vietnam, and 273 isolates from humans in China, India, Thailand, and Vietnam show that recombination is most likely to occur across spatially and genetically limited distances in natural populations resulting in highly clonal population structure yet sexually reproducing populations.

Compatible sexual {{recombination}} which occurs between two M. oryzae strains of different mating types, can enhance genetic variability. Assessment of mating type alleles is used as a marker to measure population diversity. Forty six isolates of M. oryzae were collected from infected rice leaves from various ecosystems of coastal Odisha, India, and the mating type analysis using molecular markers was carried out. MAT 1 - 1 mating type was dominating in all the ecosystems and MAT 1 - 2 was found to be present in uplands as well as in irrigated fields. Both mating types could be found in the same field in irrigated ecosystem. The disease spread was very fast vertically as well as horizontally in those fields resulting in blast lesions looking as ‘green islands (gi) produced in senescence leaves’, and MAT 1 - 2 was found to be associated with all gi lesions. Consequently, the management of the disease in those plots was very difficult.

To analyze the molecular basis of homothallism and to elucidate the role of mating-products during fruiting body development, we cloned and sequenced the entire S. macrospora mating-type locus. Comparison of the Sordaria mating-type locus with mating-type idiomorphs from the heterothallic ascomycetes Neurospora crassa and Podospora anserina revealed that sequences from both idiomorphs (A/a and mat-/mat+, respectively) are contiguous in S. macrospora. DNA sequencing of the S. macrospora mating-type region allowed the identification of four open reading frames (ORFs), which were termed Smt-a 1, SmtA- 1, SmtA- 2 and SmtA- 3. While Smt-a 1, SmtA- 1, and SmtA- 2 show strong sequence similarities with the corresponding N. crassa mating-type ORFs, SmtA- 3 has a chimeric character. It comprises sequences {{that are similar to}} the A and a mating-type idiomorph from N. crassa. To determine functionality of the S. macrospora mating-type genes, we show that all ORFs are transcriptionally expressed. Furthermore, we transformed the S. macrospora mating-type genes into mat- and mat+ strains of the closely related <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungus</b> P. anserina.

In a {{homothallic}} or self-fertile fungus, a number of fruiting bod-ies or cleistothecia are formed in a thallus grown from a single haploid conidia or ascospores. Genome-sequencing project revealed that two mating genes (MAT) encoding the regulatory proteins that are necessary for controlling partner recognition in <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungi</b> were conserved in most aspergilli. The MAT gene products in some self-fertile species were not required for recognition of mating partner at pheromone-signaling stage but required at later stages of sexual development. Various environmental factors such as nutritional status, culture conditions and several stresses, influence the decision or progression of sexual reproduction. A large number of genes {{are expected to be}} involved in sexual development of Emericella nidulans (anamorph: Aspergillus nidulans), a genetic and biological model organism in aspergilli. The sexual development process can be grouped into several development stages, including the decision of sexual reproductive cycle, mating process, growth of fruiting body, karyogamy followed by meiosis, and sporulation process. Complicated regulatory networks, such as signal transduction pathways and gene expression controls, may work in each stage and stage-to-stage linkages. In this review, the components joining in the regulatory pathways of sexual development, although they constitute {{only a small part of}} the whole regulatory networks, are briefly mentioned. Some of them control sexual development positively and some do negatively. Regarding the difficulties for studying sexual differentiation compare to asexual one, recent progresses in molecular genetics of E. nidulans enlarge the boundaries of understanding sexual development in the non-fertile species as well as in fertile fungi...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in filamentous ascomycetes {{is controlled}} by the mating type (MAT) locus, including two idiomorphs MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2. Understanding the MAT locus can provide clues for unveiling the sexual development and virulence factors for fungal pathogens. The genus Valsa (Sordariomycetes, Diaporthales) contains many tree pathogens responsible for destructive canker diseases. The sexual stage of these ascomycetes is occasionally observed in nature, and no MAT locus has been reported to date. Here, we identified the MAT locus of the apple canker pathogen Valsa mali, which causes extensive damage, and even death, to trees. V. mali is heterothallic in that each isolate carries either the MAT 1 - 1 or MAT 1 - 2 idiomorph. However, the MAT structure is distinct from that of many other <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungi</b> in the Sordariomycetes. Two flanking genes, COX 13 and APN 2, were coopted into the MAT locus, possibly by intrachromosomal rearrangement. After the acquisition of foreign genes, unequal recombination occurred between MAT 1 - 1 / 2 idiomorphs, resulting in a reverse insertion in the MAT 1 - 2 idiomorph. Evolutionary analysis showed that the three complete MAT 1 - 1 - 2, COX 13, and APN 2 genes in this region diverged independently due to different selection pressure. Null hypothesis tests of a 1 : 1 MAT ratio of 86 V. mali isolates from four different provinces showed a relatively balanced distribution of the two idiomorphs in the fields.

Previous phylogenetic work showing common ancestry led us to analyze the mating-type loci of these Mycosphaerella species occurring on banana. We reasoned that this might provide better insight into the evolutionary history of these species. PCR and chromosome-walking approaches were used to clone the mating-type loci of M. musicola and M. eumusae. Sequences were compared to the published mating-type loci of M. fijiensis and other Mycosphaerella spp., and a novel organization of the MAT loci was found. The mating-type loci of the examined Mycosphaerella species are expanded, containing two additional Mycosphaerella-specific genes in a unique genomic organization. The proteins encoded by these novel genes show a higher interspecies than intraspecies homology. Moreover, M. fijiensis, M. musicola, and M. eumusae contain two additional mating-type-like loci, containing parts of both MAT 1 - 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 - 1. The data indicate that M. fijiensis, M. musicola, and M. eumusae share an ancestor in which a fusion event occurred between MAT 1 - 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 - 1 sequences and in which additional genes became incorporated into the idiomorph. The new genes incorporated have since then evolved independently in the MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 loci.

To achieve labeling of peroxisomes, DsRed was fused to a serine-lysine-leucine tag (SKL). Expression of the DsRed-SKL fusion gene {{under the control of}} the Aspergillus nidulans gpd-promoter led to protein import of DsRed into peroxisomes. In this study, we describe our results concerning the construction as well as the application of vector pDsRed-SKL. The green fluorescent protein GFP from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria and other fluorescent proteins have become standard tools for the investigation of a variety of cellular activities (Prasher 2005). Proteins with different spectral properties and the fusion of fluorescent proteins with specific organelle-targeting signals are preconditions to analyze the sub-cellular localization of a given protein. In filamentous fungi, beside GFP and its variants, engineered derivatives of the Discosoma red fluorescent protein DsRed have been applied for dual-color experiments (Freitag and Selker 2005; Mikkelsen et al. 2003; Pöggeler et al. 2003; Toewes et al. 2004). A standard procedure to localize a given protein within a fungal cell is the expression of its GFP-tagged version and its co-localization with either stained cell compartments or fluorescent tagged marker proteins targeted to defined organelles.

40|$|Background: Mating-type loci in yeasts and ascomycotan {{filamentous}} fungi (Pezizomycotina) encode master transcriptional {{factors that}} {{play a critical}} role in sexual development. Genome-wide analyses of mating-type-specification circuits and mating-type target genes are available in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe; however, no such analyses have been performed in heterothallic (self-incompatible) Pezizomycotina. The <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungus</b> Podospora anserina serves as a model for understanding the basic features of mating-type control. Its mat+ and mat 2 mating types are determined by dissimilar allelic sequences. The mat 2 sequence contains three genes, designated FMR 1, SMR 1 and SMR 2, while the mat+ sequence contains one gene, FPR 1. FMR 1 and FPR 1 are the major regulators of fertilization, and this study presents a genome-wide view of their target genes and analyzes their target gene regulation. Methodology/Principal Findings: The transcriptomic profiles of the mat+ and mat 2 strains revealed 157 differentially transcribed genes, and transcriptomic analysis of fmr 12 and fpr 12 mutant strains was used to determine the regulatory actions exerted by FMR 1 and FPR 1 on these differentially transcribed genes. All possible combinations of transcription repression and/or activation by FMR 1 and/or FPR 1 were observed. Furthermore, 10 additional mating-type target genes were identified that were up- or down-regulated to the same level in mat+ and mat 2 strains.

40|$|To {{understand}} the invasion {{history of the}} grape powdery mildew fungus, Erysiphe necator, I investigated the evolutionary relationships between introduced populations of Europe, Australia and the western US and populations in the eastern US. Additionally, I tested the hypothesis that populations of E. necator in the eastern US are structured based on geography and Vitis host species. Multilocus sequencing analysis of three nuclear gene regions from 146 isolates of E. necator {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that introduced populations are derived from two separate introductions from the eastern US. The invasion history of E. necator follows a pattern consistent with plant-mediated dispersal. E. necator shows geographic structure, but no genetic structure across Vitis host species, except with respect to V. rotundifolia. In ascomycetes, mating compatibility is regulated by the mating-type locus, MAT 1. I identified and sequenced genes at the MAT 1 locus in Erysiphe necator and developed a PCR-based marker for determining mating type. I designed degenerate primers that amplify conserved regions of MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 in other powdery mildew fungi. The mating-type genes in E. necator {{are similar to those of}} other Leotiomycetes; however, the structure of the MAT 1 locus in E. necator, like the MAT 1 - 2 idiomorph of Blumeria graminis, is markedly different from other ascomycetes in that it is greatly expanded and may contain a large amount of repetitive DNA. Random mating and recombination in <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungi</b> should result in high genotypic diversity, 1 : 1 mating-type ratios, and random associations of alleles at different loci, i. e., linkage equilibrium. I sampled isolates from vineyards in Burdett, NY and Winchester, VA. Isolates were genotyped for mating type and 11 SSR markers. After clone correction, mating-type ratios in the three populations did not deviate from 1 : 1. Genotypic diversity was high, but even with clone correction, I detected significant linkage disequilibrium in all populations. Vineyard populations were spatially structured, which likely results from short dispersal distances. Overall, these results suggest that selection for clonal genotypes and spatial genetic aggregation during the asexual phase of the epidemic contribute to persistent linkage disequilibrium even though populations undergo an annual sexual cycle...|$|R

We report here the cloning of an allele of the a locus (a 1) from U. hordei and the discovery that physical linkage of the a and b loci in this bipolar fungus accounts for the distinct mating system.

Further development requires a recognition between mat+ and mat- nuclei before migration of the mat+/mat- pairs into specialized hyphae in which karyogamy, meiosis, and ascospore formation take place. FPR 1, FMR 1, and SMR 2 control this internuclear recognition step. Initial development of the dikaryotic stage is supposed to require SMR 1; disruption of SMR 1 results in barren perithecia. In a systematic search for suppressors restoring fertility, we isolated 15 suppressors-all of them mutations in the mating-type genes. These fmr 1, smr 2, and fpr 1 mutants, as well as the strains disrupted for FMR 1, SMR 2, and FPR 1, are weakly self-fertile. They are able to act as the male partner on a strain of the same mating type and give a mixture of biparental and uniparental progeny when crossed with a wild-type strain of opposite mating type.

Same-sex mating (a-a) also occurs in nature as evidenced by the existence of natural diploid aADa hybrids that arose by fusion between two a cells of different serotypes (A and D). How significantly this novel sexual style contributes to genetic diversity of the Cryptococcus population was unknown. In this study,, 500 natural C. neoformans isolates were tested for ploidy and close to 8 % were found to be diploid by fluorescence flow cytometry analysis. The majority of these diploids were serotype A isolates with two copies of the a MAT locus allele. Among those, several are intra-varietal allodiploid hybrids produced by fusion of two genetically distinct a cells through same-sex mating. The majority, however, are autodiploids that harbor two seemingly identical copies of the genome and arose via either endoreplication or clonal mating. The diploids identified were isolated from different geographic locations and varied genotypically and phenotypically, indicating independent non-clonal origins. The present study demonstrates that unisexual mating produces diploid isolates of C. neoformans in nature, giving rise to populations of hybrids and mixed ploidy. Our findings underscore the importance o...|$|E
40|$|The all-trans-β-carotene is {{a natural}} pigment used in various {{industrial}} fields (food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, etc) and possesses the higher provitamin A activity, in respect to other carotenoids. All-trans-β-carotene is produced industrially by chemical and biotechnological means. For β-carotene biotechnological production in industrial scale mated cultures of Blakeslea trispora, a <b>heterothallic</b> <b>fungus,</b> are mainly used. Despite the intense research for β-carotene production by B. trispora, natural substrate utilization has not been extensively studied. Solid agro-food wastes such as cabbage, watermelon husk and peach peels from northern Greece as main carbon source into submerged B. trispora cultures for carotenoids production, was examined. The media containing only the agro-food waste (2 - 4) gave a biomass accumulation 7. 77 ± 0. 4 g/L, while a reference medium 1 with glucose (10 g/L) gave 4. 65 ± 0. 21 g/L. In another experiments series agro-food wastes were used with corn steep liquor and thiamine (media 6 - 8), giving a biomass accumulation and total carotenoid volumetric production 10. 2 ± 2. 41 g/L and 230. 49 ± 22. 97 mg/L, respectively. These are the higher values reported for solid wastes so far in respect to those obtained from a synthetic medium, with higher glucose concentration of 50 g/L where the correspondent values were 9. 41 ± 1. 18 g/L and 45. 63 mg/L respectively. The results support that B. trispora is able to utilize, almost equivalently, different origin agrofood wastes for carotenoids production. Furthermore, β-carotene percentage in all examined cases was over 76 %, as it was estimated by HPLC analysis, suggesting that these agro food wastes {{may be used for}} high purity, large scale β carotene production. © by Pawel Pomorski and Polish Biochemical Society 2009...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>heterothallic</b> {{filamentous}} <b>fungus</b> Podospora anserina, four mating-type genes encoding transcriptional {{factors have}} been characterized: FPR 1 in the mat+ sequence and FMR 1, SMR 1, and SMR 2 in the alternative mat- sequence. Fertilization is controlled by FPR 1 and FMR 1. After fertilization, male and female nuclei, which have divided in the same cell, form mat+/mat- pairs during migration into the ascogenous hyphae. Previous data indicate that the formation of mat+/mat- pairs is controlled by FPR 1, FMR 1, and SMR 2. SMR 1 was postulated to be necessary for initial development of ascogenous hyphae. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional control of the mat genes by seeking mat transcripts during the vegetative and sexual phase and fusing their promoter to a reporter gene. The data indicate that FMR 1 and FPR 1 are expressed in both mycelia and perithecia, whereas SMR 1 and SMR 2 are transcribed in perithecia. Increased or induced vegetative expression of the four mat genes has no effect when the recombined gene is solely in the wild-type strain. However, the combination of resident FPR 1 with deregulated SMR 2 and overexpressed FMR 1 in the same nucleus is lethal. This lethality is suppressed by the expression of SMR 1, confirming that SMR 1 operates downstream of the other mat genes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{disturbance}} on symbiotic organisms such as lichens is particularly severe. In case of <b>heterothallic</b> lichen-forming <b>fungi,</b> disturbances {{may lead to}} unbalanced gene frequency and patchy distribution of mating types, thus inhibiting sexual reproduction and imposing clonality. The impact of disturbance on reproductive strategies and genetic diversity of clonal systems has so far received little attention. To infer the effects of disturbances on mating-type allele frequencies and population structure, we selected three populations in the Parc Jurassien Vaudois (Switzerland), which were affected by uneven-aged forestry, intensive logging and fire, respectively. We used microsatellite markers to infer genetic diversity, allelic richness and clonal diversity of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria and used L. pulmonaria-specific MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 markers to analyse the frequency and distribution of mating types of 889 individuals. Our study shows that stand-replacing disturbances affect the mating-type frequency and distribution, thus compromising the potential for sexual reproduction. The fire-disturbed area had a significantly lower genetic and genotypic diversity and a higher clonality. Furthermore, the majority of compatible mating pairs in this area were beyond the effective vegetative dispersal range of the species. We conclude that stand-replacing disturbances lead to lower chances of sex and symbiont reshuffling and thus have long-lasting negative consequences on the reproductive strategies and adaptive potential of epiphytic lichen symbiose...|$|R
40|$|In basidiomycetes, the monokaryons in a mating {{simultaneously}} exhibit two clearly distinct {{behaviors that}} {{can be considered as}} female and male roles, respectively: the acceptance of a nucleus, and the donation of a nucleus. However, since each monokaryon is a hermaphrodite, these two behaviors are difficult to distinguish. Here, I describe a simple method to select for the male role. A nucleus is serially passed through a non-evolving monokaryon, utilizing the ‘Buller phenomenon’. I describe some theoretical predictions {{that can be}} tested with this method. Sexual reproduction in basidiomycetes starts with hyphal fusion between two monokaryons (haploid mycelia arising after spore germination; c. f. Casselton and Economou, 1985; Raper 1966). Subsequently, haploid nuclei are exchanged and reciprocally migrate throughout the existing mycelia to give rise to a dikaryon (Figure 1 a). Figure 1. A. The standard life cycle of a <b>heterothallic</b> basidiomycete <b>fungus.</b> Sexual spores germinate (upper left) give rise to a haploid monokaryon. Two compatible monokaryons can fuse, upon which they reciprocally exchange nuclei, without cytoplasmic mixing (down left). This leads to the formation of the dikaryon (grey, right), all cells of which have two different nuclei, and which is a cytoplasmic mosaic. The dikaryon can produce mushrooms (schematically drawn on the grey dikaryon), the sexual fruiting bodies, where a short diploid stage is immediately followed by meiosis and sexual spore formation. The insert shows how the two nuclei in a dikaryotic cell are distributed over cells during cell division via the formation of clamp connections. B. The monokaryons exhibit two clearly distinct behaviors in a mating, accepting a nucleus, and donating...|$|R
