5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned,</b> was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{collaborated with}} writer Don McGregor on the {{critically}} lauded [...] "Black Panther" [...] series {{that ran in}} Jungle Action #6–24 (Sept. 1973–Nov. 1976), becoming the series' regular penciler with issue #11 (Sept. 1974) and leaving after penciling the first five pages of issue #22 (July 1976). Bob Almond, inker {{for much of the}} run of The Black Panther vol. 3, dedicated his work in memoriam to Graham in an introductory note to issue #17 (April 2000). The pseudonymous Buzz Maverik wrote in Ain't It Cool News, [...] "I know the [...] artist, Billy Graham, was black. His cool Marvel Bullpen name was 'The Irreverent' Billy Graham. For me, even though <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that Jack Kirby created the Panther, Graham will always be the definitive Panther artist. His art, even more than McGregor's writing, made T'Challa one of what I call the 'grown men' of the Marvel Universe, the others being Daredevil and Iron Man. Those three seemed like the kind of adult I aspired to be, with cool jobs, cool hobbies (superheroing), and cool chicks." [...] In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked McGregor and Graham's run on Jungle Action third on its list of the [...] "Top 10 1970s Marvels".|$|E
5000|$|... « So, {{sixty years}} <b>later</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> {{something}} about my rescuer. Sadly, I also discovered that our paths had crossed, without any awareness {{on either side of}} the bond between us.|$|R

60|$|We {{had gone}} perhaps ten miles when the ground {{began to rise}} very rapidly. We were, as <b>I</b> was <b>later</b> to <b>learn,</b> nearing the edge of one of Mars' long-dead seas, {{in the bottom of}} which my {{encounter}} with the Martians had taken place.|$|R
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned,</b> {{a copy of}} my {{personal}} credit report– with detailed information about my bank accounts, home mortgage, credit-card payments, home address and Social Security number– had been illegally retrieved from a national credit bureau called Trans Union. The sham company that received it, [...] "Educational Funding Services" [...] of Los Angeles, gave as its address a mail drop {{a few blocks from}} Scientology's headquarters. The owner of the mail drop is a private eye named Fred Wolfson, who admits that an Ingram associate retained him to retrieve credit reports on several individuals. Wolfson says he was told that Scientology's attorneys [...] "had judgments against these people and were trying to collect on them." [...] He says now, [...] "These are vicious people. These are vipers." [...] Ingram, through a lawyer, denies any involvement in the scam. … [...] After that, however, an attorney subpoenaed me, while another falsely suggested that I might own shares in a company I was reporting about that had been taken over by Scientologists (he also threatened to contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). [...] A close friend in Los Angeles received a disturbing telephone call from a Scientology staff member seeking data about me– an indication that the cult may have illegally obtained {{my personal}} phone records. [...] Two detectives contacted me, posing as a friend and a relative of a so-called cult victim, to elicit negative statements from me about Scientology. Some of my conversations with them were taped, transcribed and presented by the church in affidavits to TIME's lawyers as [...] "proof" [...] of my bias against Scientology.|$|E
2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick {{to put you in}} your place. She doesn't sit and ponder about stuff, where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. But every now and then I like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which Jackson says every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. For years I didn't. Now I love being called Jo. I've come to the point where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that has happened to me. I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Oliver Weir (born 1950, County Monaghan, Republic of Ireland) — {{an officer}} in the RUC Special Patrol Group (an [...] "anti-terrorist" [...] unit) and UVF volunteer. Weir {{was the son of a}} {{gamekeeper}} and was brought up on an estate near Castleblaney. He attended a Protestant boarding school in Dublin. After joining the RUC in 1970, he worked at Strandtown RUC station in Belfast. In 1972, he was transferred to Armagh where he was recruited by the SPG on 1 August 1973. Following the IRA killing of two members of the security forces in 1974 and 1975, he was sent for his own safety to the SPG unit in Castlereagh, Belfast. On an unspecified date between January 1975 and September 1976, he joined the Glenanne gang. Weir then spent six weeks at the Lisanelly Army base in Omagh; in 1976 he was promoted to the rank of sergeant and transferred to Newry RUC barracks. He claimed to have been directly involved in the bomb attack at Tully's Bar in Belleek, the attempted bombing of Renaghan's Bar, Clontibret, County Monaghan, and to have visited the Glenanne farm regularly during the autumn of 1976. In November 1977, he was sent to Newtownhamilton RUC barracks. In 1980, he left the RUC upon his conviction for the 1977 killing of William Strathearn, a Catholic chemist. He was released from prison in 1992. During and after his imprisonment he made a number of allegations incriminating his former associates in the Glenanne gang. His 1999 affidavit was published in the 2003 Barron Report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Weir also implicated Chief Inspector Harry Breen in having direct knowledge of the gang's activities in his Affidavit of 3 January 1999. Among other claims, he stated [...] "In summary, Down Orange Welfare was using RUC officers in Newry RUC station - McBride, Breen, myself - and another RUC officer, Sergeant Monty Alexander from Forkhill RUC station - to supply weapons to the UVF in Portadown. <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that these weapons were being manufactured by Samuel McCoubrey in Spa, Co. Down." ...|$|E
60|$|He dived out of {{the galley}} door, or glided rather, with a {{swiftness}} and smoothness of gait that struck me as being not so much cat-like as oily. In fact, this oiliness, or greasiness, as <b>I</b> was <b>later</b> to <b>learn,</b> {{was probably the most}} salient expression of his personality.|$|R
60|$|My {{threat was}} unfortunate and {{resulted}} in {{more harm than good}} to Dejah Thoris, for, as <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>later,</b> men do not kill women upon Mars, nor women, men. So Sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed to hatch up deviltries against us.|$|R
50|$|George thanked Ron, quaffed down a good pint {{and then}} we all began to talk. <b>Later</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> this was the Hell's Angel biker Chocolate George. I also learned that the milk carton {{contained}} only half chocolate milk {{and the other half}} some unspecified hard stuff.|$|R
60|$|A roar of {{approval}} went up {{from those of}} the other prisoners and the Sagoths who had witnessed the brief drama; not, as <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned,</b> because I had championed the girl, but for the neat and, to them, astounding method by which I had bested Hooja.|$|E
6000|$|Across {{the mesa}} we went, {{to stop at}} last before a large pile of rocks in which an opening appeared. Here my guards set me upon my feet and called out a word which sounded like [...] "Gr-gr-gr!" [...] and which <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> {{was the name of}} their king.|$|E
60|$|He {{directed}} that I {{remove his}} body to Virginia without embalming, and that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had had constructed and which, as <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned,</b> was well ventilated. The instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that this was carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{can attest}} to the creakiness and the air of mystery in these ancient abodes. But youngsters often see {{this sort of thing}} as fun— never realizing that someone might be watching. We never met a ghost, but as <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>later,</b> not {{everyone}} can say that." ...|$|R
60|$|He tried a {{dozen times}} to express his {{gratitude}} to me, but his voice choked with emotion {{and he could not}} speak, and yet he had, as <b>I</b> was to <b>later</b> <b>learn,</b> a reputation for ferocity and fearlessness as a fighter that was remarkable even upon warlike Barsoom. In common with all Helium he worshiped his daughter, nor could he think of what she had escaped without deep emotion.|$|R
6000|$|... "First spoil {{in my new}} life," [...] he went on {{with harsh}} joviality. [...] "The dodge of {{carrying}} it down there <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>later.</b> <b>I</b> carried it stuck in my belt that day. No, I hadn't much stomach for the job; but when you work with a gentleman of the real right sort you may depend on your feelings being seen through your skin. Says the governor suddenly: ...|$|R
60|$|After {{our return}} to the dead city I passed several days in {{comparative}} idleness. On the day following our return all the warriors had ridden forth {{early in the morning}} and had not returned until just before darkness fell. As <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned,</b> they had been to the subterranean vaults in which the eggs were kept and had transported them to the incubator, which they had then walled up for another five years, and which, in all probability, would not be visited again during that period.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me think}} about it," [...] I parried, and To-jo {{said that he would}} wait until night. He would give me a day to think it over; then he left, and the women left--the men for the hunt, and the women, as <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> from So-ta, for the warm pool where they {{immersed}} their bodies as did the shes of the Sto-lu. [...] "Ata," [...] explained So-ta, when I questioned her as to the purpose of this matutinal rite; but that was later.|$|E
60|$|Their {{arms and}} necks were encircled by many {{ornaments}} of metal--silver predominating--and on their tunics were sewn {{the heads of}} tiny reptiles in odd and rather artistic designs. They talked among themselves as they marched along {{on either side of}} us, but in a language which I perceived differed from that employed by our fellow prisoners. When they addressed the latter they used {{what appeared to be a}} third language, and which <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> is a mongrel tongue rather analogous to the Pidgin-English of the Chinese coolie.|$|E
60|$|<b>Later</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> from Ghak, who {{had finally}} come to his tribesmen and {{returned}} with a party to rescue me, that the ryth, as it is called, pursued the Sagoths until it had exterminated the entire band. Ghak was, of course, positive that I had fallen prey to the terrible creature, which, within Pellucidar, is truly the king of beasts.|$|R
5000|$|The musketry {{fire was}} very heavy & the {{artillery}} fire was simply terrible. I sent word, many times, to our artillery {{on the right}} of Falmouth that they were firing into us & tearing our own men to pieces. I thought they had made a mistake in the range. But <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> that the fire came from the guns of the enemy on their extreme left.|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{then there}} were only two of us left--the chief and myself. I do not need to tell you what the valley was, for you found it {{in much the same way}} as I did. So quickly were we {{captured}} that it seemed they must have been waiting for us, and <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> that such was the case, just as they were waiting for you.|$|R
60|$|As {{the meat}} roasted above the fire, Ajor and I tried {{once again to}} talk; but though copiously filled with incentive, {{gestures}} and sounds, the conversation did not flourish notably. And then Ajor took up in earnest the task of teaching me her language. She commenced, as <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned,</b> with the simplest form of speech known to Caspak {{or for that matter}} to the world--that employed by the Bo-lu. I found it far from difficult, and {{even though it was a}} great handicap upon my instructor that she could not speak my language, she did remarkably well and demonstrated that she possessed ingenuity and intelligence of a high order.|$|E
6000|$|The steward was a jewel. In {{ten minutes}} he served {{me with a}} perfect cup of coffee. I read on until daylight, and half-past eight found me, breakfast in bed finished, dressed and shaved, and on deck. We were still towing, but all sails were set to a light favouring breeze from the north. In the chart-room Captain West and the pilot were smoking cigars. At the wheel I noted what I decided at once was an efficient. He was not a large man; if {{anything}} he was undersized. But his countenance was broad-browed and intelligently formed. Tom, <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned,</b> was his name--Tom Spink, an Englishman. He was blue-eyed, fair-skinned, well- grizzled, and, to the eye, a hale fifty years of age. His reply of [...] "Good morning, sir" [...] was cheery, and he smiled as he uttered the simple phrase. He did not look sailor-like, as did Henry, the training-ship boy; and yet I felt at once {{that he was a}} sailor, and an able one.|$|E
60|$|Up to {{this time}} the {{excitement}} had kept us both up; but now the tiresome monotony of the long march across the sun-baked plain brought on all the agonies consequent to a long-denied sleep. On and on we stumbled beneath that hateful noonday sun. If we fell we were prodded with a sharp point. Our companions in chains did not stumble. They strode along proudly erect. Occasionally they would exchange words {{with one another in}} a monosyllabic language. They were a noble-appearing race with well-formed heads and perfect physiques. The men were heavily bearded, tall and muscular; the women, smaller and more gracefully molded, with great masses of raven hair caught into loose knots upon their heads. The features of both sexes were well proportioned--there was not a face among them that would have been called even plain if judged by earthly standards. They wore no ornaments; but this <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> was {{due to the fact that}} their captors had stripped them of everything of value. As garmenture the women possessed a single robe of some light-colored, spotted hide, rather similar in appearance to a leopard's skin. This they wore either supported entirely about the waist by a leathern thong, so that it hung partially below the knee on one side, or possibly looped gracefully across one shoulder. Their feet were shod with skin sandals. The men wore loin cloths of the hide of some shaggy beast, long ends of which depended before and behind nearly to the ground. In some instances these ends were finished with the strong talons of the beast from which the hides had been taken.|$|E
60|$|Behind {{this first}} {{charging}} demon trailed nineteen others, similar in all respects, but, as <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>later,</b> bearing individual characteristics peculiar to themselves; precisely as no {{two of us}} are identical although we are all cast in a similar mold. This picture, or rather materialized nightmare, which I have described at length, made but one terrible and swift impression on me as I turned to meet it.|$|R
60|$|Then, in {{the midst}} of the five {{thousand}} horsemen, we moved down upon the ford. As we reached its brink I noted that the two divisions of tribesmen were already entering the stream half a mile to the right and left of us. Of what befell them I can tell nothing from observation, although <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> that they forced it after great slaughter on both sides.|$|R
60|$|I couldn't {{imagine how}} it had happened; but it had. <b>Later</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> that they had first {{overpowered}} Benson, who was asleep in his bunk, and taken his pistol from him, and then had found it an easy matter to disarm the cook and the remaining two Englishmen below. After {{that it had been}} comparatively simple to stand {{at the foot of the}} ladder and arrest each individual as he descended.|$|R
5000|$|Among other claims, {{he stated}} [...] "In summary, Down Orange Welfare was using RUC {{officers}} in Newry RUC station - McBride, Breen, myself - and another RUC officer, Sergeant Monty Alexander from Forkhill RUC station - to supply {{weapons to the}} UVF in Portadown. <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> that these weapons were being manufactured by Samuel McCoubrey in Spa, Co.

50|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as <b>I</b> <b>later</b> <b>learned,</b> was a little praise.

50|$|Later {{that month}} Marseille {{was invited to}} another party function, despite his earlier stunt. Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff, of Personal Staff Reichsführer-SS, {{confirmed}} that during his visit Marseille overheard a conversation which mentioned crimes against the Jews and other people. He stated:Globocnik and I were talking about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect following Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz).

5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Dönitz {{received}} only 10 years, Kranzbühler was bothered by the ultimate verdict. Remarking on the conviction, he noted that [...] "This conviction {{was born out of}} the dilemma to take the Grand Admiral into prison for political reasons". According to Kranzbühler years <b>later</b> [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> on, an American law advisor made the proposal to the Allied control office to nullify the verdict." ...|$|R
60|$|You see, Hutchins was a cur at heart, or a {{creature}} {{who had once}} been a man, but who had been broken on the wheel. He possessed ten or twelve thousand dollars, and his freedom was in sight if he obeyed orders. <b>Later,</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> that there was a girl who had remained true to him, and who was even then waiting for him. The woman factor explains many things of men.|$|R
6000|$|... "No one {{believed}} {{a word of}} my story, and who can wonder? And who can imagine my grief when, arriving at my home in Frankfort two months <b>later,</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> that Judge Veigh had never been heard of since that night? I then regretted bitterly the pride which since {{the first few days}} after the recovery of my reason had forbidden me to repeat my discredited story and insist upon its truth.|$|R
