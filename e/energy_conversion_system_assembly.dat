40|$|Graduation date: 1996 With {{the rapid}} {{increase}} of the world energy demand and consumption, the method and techniques to analyze, improve and optimize <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> have to deal not only with direct fuel exergy (energy) consumption, but also with other resources, which have associated exergy consumptions, and with environmental impacts, such as global warming. A general method for <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>system</b> analysis is presented in this thesis. This method uses exergy as a measure to compare and analyze the natural resource consumption (both fuels and materials) and the global warming impact of different <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> for their life-time. The method, which adds the fuel production exergy and material exergy into consideration, allows more complete exergy analyses to be conducted. The global warming impact due to the chemical emissions and impact associated with direct exergy consumption (fuel consumption) as well as system equipment materials consumption of the <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>system</b> are considered together in this thesis. Based {{on the concept of}} exergy, the Total Equivalent Resource Exergy (TERE), which includes both direct resource exergy consumption and resource exergy needed to recover the total equivalent global warming gases of the <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>system,</b> is proposed in this thesis. TERE uses exergy as a criterion to compare the <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> and providing information of how effective a system is regarding the use of natural resources. The calculation of TERE values for the selected <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>systems</b> indicates that the resource exergy and the environmental impact exergy are both substantial impacts and should be compared together. This concept of TERE can be used as the objective function for energy system design and optimization...|$|R
