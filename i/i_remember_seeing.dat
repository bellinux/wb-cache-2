5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
500|$|The flag {{being so}} very large, mother {{was obliged to}} obtain {{permission}} from the proprietors of Claggetts [...] brewery which was in our neighborhood, to spread it out in their malt house; and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> my mother down on the floor, placing the stars: {{after the completion of}} the flag, she superintended the topping of it, having it fastened in the most secure manner to prevent its being torn away by (cannon) balls: the wisdom of her precaution was shown during the engagement: many shots piercing it, but it still remained firm to the staff. Your father (Col. Armistead) declared that no one but the maker of the flag should mend it, and requested that the rents should merely be bound around.|$|E
60|$|I turned around, {{and it was}} a girl. She was {{standing}} there with a gentleman,--her father, I soon found out,--and I don't know how long they had been watching us. She was about thirteen years old, and came over with her father in a sail-boat. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>seeing</b> them cruising around as we were sailing over.|$|R

500|$|Santiago and Thompson {{shared a}} room {{at the start of the}} second semester. Santiago soon {{introduced}} his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: [...] "Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> Black Flag and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music... He'd write 'em , and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar." [...] In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words [...] "We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams"; Santiago replied, saying [...] "Yes, now's the time." [...] Upon receiving this reply, Thompson decided to return to Amherst to start a rock band with Santiago.|$|E

60|$|I {{had already}} read two books loaned {{to me by}} Max, to whose share they had fallen, in {{dividing}} {{the effects of the}} sailor who had jumped overboard. One was an account of Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea, and the other was a large black volume, with Delirium Tremens in great gilt letters on the back. This proved to be a popular treatise on the subject of that disease; and <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>seeing</b> several copies in the sailor book-stalls about Fulton Market, and along South-street, in New York.|$|R

2500|$|Cruyff was a multilingual, as British {{football}} writer Brian Glanville described, “his intelligence off {{the field}} {{as well as on}} it was quite remarkable. How well <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> Cruyff surrounded by journalists {{from all over the world}} in 1978 to whose questions he replied almost casually in a multiplicity of languages. Not only Dutch, but English, French, Spanish and German.” ...|$|E

I went to Olympic Trials that year (2004) with Kyla [...] <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> the gymnasts on the floor and I loved all of their leotards. I thought they were so little and so amazing. I thought, how am I going to stay this little? I was worried that I was going to be really tall because my dad is 6'3" [...] and my mom is 5'2", so I didn’t know which one I was going to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gavin Friday {{reworked}} {{the song}} for the 2011 tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. He said, [...] "The Edge rang me up and said, 'Nobody wants to do The Fly – they're all afraid of it.' I think it's because {{it has its own}} essence, sonically. It was the lead single and the point of reinvention. U2 said it best: it was the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> them working on Achtung Baby in its early stages. I just put a rocket up their asses and said, 'Go for it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{dividing}} wall was removed by parish members on 7March 1995, while others started clearing the truss. The institute called the police, OMON, for help. The following day, more {{conflict with the}} police occurred and several parish members, among them a nun, were injured. Others were arrested, including a priest and a seminarian, but were released the next day. After these events, the Apostolic Administrator, Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, wrote {{an open letter to}} the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, on 9March 1995, requesting his intervention: [...] "It seems that persecution of the church was history. Is that the case? <b>I</b> can't <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> a priest arrested, and <b>I</b> can't <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> a nun beaten up." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next time}} we came back more cautiously, and we avoided the glowing coals. We fell to imitating the Fire-Men. We squatted down by the fire, and with heads bent forward on our knees, made believe to sleep. Then we mimicked their speech, {{talking to each other}} in their fashion and making a great gibberish. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>seeing</b> the wizened old hunter poke the fire with a stick. I poked the fire with a stick, turning up masses of live coals and clouds of white ashes. This was great sport, and soon we were coated white with the ashes.|$|R
5000|$|Richards {{speaking}} on the history books he read in grade school: [...] "Usually the pictures told much more about American history than the text. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>seeing</b> {{at a very early}} age a glowing photo of Custer and a few pages after (of) an elderly man, who looked like my own grandfather, lying dead in the snow. He was alone, and without care. I later found out his name was Miniconjou chief Spotted Elk (Bigfoot) and he was part of the massacre at Wounded Knee. That photo has always stuck with me. I knew something was not right, and the text which was alongside it was not giving the full story." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} legal hearings, residents testified how: [...] "If {{you walked}} {{right behind the}} factory it was like cotton. It was in {{the cracks in the}} pavement behind the factory;" [...] and: [...] "It used to be blue-white. We used to sweep this blue dust up. It was blue fluffy stuff... I used {{to get up in the}} morning and the other side of the street always had a layer of fine dust with footmarks on it from the early morning workers." [...] Of the conditions in the nearby school one said: [...] "The dust was always there while I was at school, lying on walls or window ledges if it had been damp. It was like snow fall." [...] Describing the loading bay, to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: [...] "Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust." [...] During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward to explain the enduring appeal of the target girl. These range from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the hero's ordeal, in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril. [...] Jim Steinmeyer, a noted illusion designer who has written well-regarded books {{on the history of}} magic, has identified a fashion for female peril as entertainment in the post-First World War period. Steinmeyer has written that P. T. Selbit's stage debut of the Sawing Through A Woman illusion in 1921 marked the beginning of a trend for women as the victims of choice for acts simulating danger or torture. While Steinmeyer focuses on stage magic and attributes some of the trend to practical factors, he also points to a broader pattern in entertainment generally, which he links to social trends. He concludes that: [...] "...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment". A further view on historical trends is provided by performer and blogger Ula the Painproof Rubbergirl, who has acted as a target girl for New York-based knife thrower The Great Throwdini. In an extensive article on her experiences and philosophical approach to the art she notes: [...] "Knife throwing is an old act. So is high wire. And rodeo. And stone throwing, witch burning, beheading, Roman gladiators, jousting, dog fights,you name it - we, humans, love it. And we love a vulnerable woman. Isn't there something oddly attractive about the woman in danger? <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> lots of soundless black and white movies with a girl tied to the railroad tracks or a girl tied to a sawmill by some evil perverted landlord." ...|$|E

50|$|When Charles W. Cook first {{viewed the}} canyon after {{traveling}} west from the Lamar Valley on September 20, 1869, he subsequently wrote these words in his journal:I was riding ahead, the two pack animals following, and then Mr. Folsom and Mr. Peterson on their saddle horses. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>seeing</b> {{what appeared to}} be an opening in the forest ahead, which I presumed to be a park, or open country. While my attention was attracted by the pack animals, which had stopped to eat grass, my saddle horse suddenly stopped. I turned and looked forward from the brink of the great canyon, at a point just across from what is now called Inspiration Point. I sat there in amazement, while my companions came up, and after that, {{it seemed to me that}} it was five minutes before anyone spoke.|$|R
60|$|I was {{so small}} that, in order to {{negotiate}} the pail, I sat down and gathered it into my lap. First I sipped the foam. I was disappointed. The preciousness evaded me. Evidently it did not reside in the foam. Besides, the taste was not good. Then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>seeing</b> the grown-ups blow the foam away before they drank. I buried {{my face in the}} foam and lapped the solid liquid beneath. It wasn't good at all. But still I drank. The grown-ups knew what they were about. Considering my diminutiveness, the size of the pail in my lap, and my drinking out of it my breath held and my face buried to the ears in foam, it was rather difficult to estimate how much I drank. Also, I was gulping it down like medicine, in nauseous haste to get the ordeal over.|$|R
60|$|Wildly I {{looked about}} {{me for a}} line which I might throw. Cordage there was in abundance, but it was broken or {{fastened}} to something, or too heavy to handle. <b>I</b> <b>remembered,</b> however, <b>seeing</b> a coil of small rope below, and hastening down, I brought it on deck, took the coil in my right hand, and stood ready to hurl it when the proper moment should come.|$|R

She {{was literally}} torn apart, ripped wide open, beaten into a pulp, smashed into kindling wood, annihilated. When I came to I was in the water, swimming automatically, though I was about two-thirds drowned. How I got there I had no recollection. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>seeing</b> the Petite Jeanne fly to pieces at what must have been the instant that my own consciousness was buffetted out of me. But there I was, with nothing to do but make the best of it, and in that best there was little promise. The wind was blowing again, the sea was much smaller and more regular, and I knew that I had passed through the centre. Fortunately, there were no sharks about. The hurricane had dissipated the ravenous horde that had surrounded the death ship and fed off the dead.|$|R
