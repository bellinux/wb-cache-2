5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The article {{contains}} definitions of constant, increasing, decreasing, non decreasing, non increasing sequences, {{the definition of}} a subsequence and their basic properties. MML Identifier: SEQM 3. The articles [2], [4], [3], [1], and [5] provide the terminology and notation for this paper. We adopt the following convention: n, m, k will be natural numbers, r will be a real number, and seq, seq 1, seq 2 will be sequences of real numbers. We now define five new predicates. Let us consider seq. We say that seq is increasing <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> if: <b>for</b> every n holds seq(n) < seq(n + 1). We say that seq is decreasing <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> if: <b>for</b> every n holds seq(n + 1) < seq(n). We say that seq is non-decreasing <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> if: <b>for</b> every n holds seq(n) ≤ seq(n + 1). We say that seq is non-increasing <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> if: <b>for</b> every n holds seq(n + 1) ≤ seq(n). We say that seq is constant <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> if: there exists r such that for every n holds seq(n) = r. Let us consider seq. We say that seq is monotone <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> if: seq is non-decreasing or seq is non-increasing. We now state a number of propositions: (1) seq is increasing <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> every n holds seq(n) < seq(n + 1). (2) seq is decreasing <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> every n holds seq(n + 1) < seq(n). (3) seq is non-decreasing <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> every n holds seq(n) ≤ seq(n+ 1). (4) seq is non-increasing <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>for</b> every n holds seq(n+ 1) ≤ seq(n) ...|$|R

25|$|It {{appears that}} for the first few years in which the Sydenhams owned the house, they were content with the way it was when they {{purchased}} it from d'Evercy heirs. However, considerations of privacy and comfort that spread in English domestic architercture from the mid-15th century began to be applied, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> the immediate family of the head of the household. These ideals are reflected at Brympton d'Evercy in the first major building works of the Sydenhams in 1460.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{meetings}} to adjust command structure were nearly a daily event in Alexander's army. They created an ongoing expectation among the Hetairoi of receiving {{an important and}} powerful command, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> a short term. At the moment of Alexander's death, all possibilities were suddenly suspended. The Hetairoi vanished with Alexander, to be replaced instantaneously by the Diadochi, men who knew where they had stood, but not where they would stand now. As {{there had been no}} definite ranks or positions of Hetairoi, there were no ranks of Diadochi. They expected appointments, but without Alexander they would have to make their own.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} {{used to refer}} to any person who holds a general power of attorney to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, is such an attorney. Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general, anyone who comes to represent the state in the same way may, in the past, be referred to as such, even <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> a particular case. Today, however, in most jurisdictions the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state, sovereign or other member of the royal family.|$|E

25|$|Like many of Butler’s strong female African-American characters, Anyanwu {{is put in}} {{conflict}} with a male character, Doro, who is just as powerful as her. Butler uses this type of mis-match to display how differently males and females demonstrate their power and values. Since Anyanwu’s way, J. Andrew Deman notes, “is {{the way of the}} healer” rather than of the killer, she does not need violence to demonstrate her true strength or power. As Gant-Britton states, Anyanwu’s true power is shown many times during the story but it is definitely displayed when she threatens to commit suicide if Doro does not stop using her to create new species, making Doro submissive “to her will in the name of love,” <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> a moment.|$|E
25|$|Patients with MDR-TB {{should be}} {{isolated}} in negative-pressure rooms, if possible. Patients with MDR-TB {{should not be}} accommodated on the same ward as immunosuppressed patients (HIV infected patients, or patients on immunosuppressive drugs). Careful monitoring of compliance with treatment {{is crucial to the}} management of MDR-TB (and some physicians insist on hospitalisation <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> this reason). Some physicians will insist that these patients are isolated until their sputum is smear negative, or even culture negative (which may take many months, or even years). Keeping these patients in hospital for weeks (or months) on end may be a practical or physical impossibility and the final decision depends on the clinical judgement of the physician treating that patient. The attending physician should make full use of therapeutic drug monitoring (particularly of the aminoglycosides) both to monitor compliance and to avoid toxic effects.|$|E
25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> a moment, that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E

25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> that reason.|$|E
25|$|Attestations of Old Dutch {{sentences}} {{are extremely}} rare. The language is mostly recorded on fragmentary relics, and words have been reconstructed from Middle Dutch and loan words from Old Dutch in other languages. The oldest recorded {{is found in}} the Salic law. In this Frankish document written around 510 the oldest Dutch sentence has been identified: Maltho thi afrio lito ("I say to you, I free you, serf") used to free a serf. Another old fragment of Dutch is Visc flot aftar themo uuatare ("A fish was swimming in the water"). The oldest conserved larger Dutch text is the Utrecht baptismal vow (776–800) starting with Forsachistu diobolae... ec forsacho diabolae ("Do you forsake the devil?... I forsake the devil"). <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> its poetic content, the most famous Old Dutch sentence is probably Hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan, hinase hic enda tu, wat unbidan we nu ("All birds have started making nests, except me and you, what are we waiting for"), is dated to around the year 1100, written by a Flemish monk in a convent in Rochester, England. Since the sentence speaks to the imagination, it is often erroneously stated as the oldest Dutch sentence.|$|E
