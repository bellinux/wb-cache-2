25|$|In December 2013 in a blog {{article for}} The Spectator website {{published}} shortly after Nelson Mandela died, Rod Liddle wrote of BBC coverage: But for Christ's sake BBC, {{give it a}} bloody break for five minutes, will you? It's as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let's re-run {{the entire history of}} South Africa. That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E

Bruno and Phil came up with the chorus, and then Needlz sent us the files and we replaced a bunch of sounds with our sounds and I programmed drums in the MPC, and we wrote the rest of the song. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Needlz or Walton".|$|E
500|$|Winehouse's {{greatest}} {{love was}} 1960s girl groups. Her stylist, Alex Foden, borrowed her [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] beehive hairdo (a weave) and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from The Ronettes. Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: [...] "Ronnie Spector—who, {{it could be}} argued, all but invented Winehouse's style {{in the first place}} when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that she exclaimed, [...] "I don't know her, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> her, and when I saw that pic, I thought, 'That's me!' But then I found out, no, it's Amy! I didn't have on my glasses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Contemporary use of {{the phrase}} [...] "the L word" [...] as an alias for lesbian dates to at least the 1981 play My Blue Heaven by Jane Chambers, in which a {{character}} stammers out: [...] "You're really...?

2500|$|When I die, my epitaph, or {{whatever}} you call those signs on gravestones, is going to read: [...] "I joked about every prominent man of my time, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> a man I dident [...] like." [...] I am so proud of that, I can hardly wait to die {{so it can be}} carved.|$|E

2500|$|Gary Garth, {{the outdoor}} editor of The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Kentucky, relates {{that he became}} [...] "addicted" [...] to duck hunting as a child, based on the {{encouragement}} of Grits Gresham columns. [...] "Through my work I've {{had the opportunity to}} meet, hunt, and fish with a few of the giants in my business. But <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Grits. It's just as well. Some pedestals should remain untouched," [...] Garth said in his tribute to the legendary outdoorsman.|$|E
2500|$|Hopper's {{portraits and}} self-portraits were {{relatively}} few after his student years. Hopper did produce a commissioned [...] "portrait" [...] of a house, The MacArthurs' Home (1939), where he faithfully details the Victorian {{architecture of the}} home of actress Helen Hayes. She reported later, [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> a more misanthropic, grumpy individual in my life." [...] Hopper grumbled throughout the project and never again accepted a commission. Hopper also painted Portrait of Orleans (1950), a [...] "portrait" [...] of the Cape Cod town from its main street.|$|E
2500|$|At Columbia University in 1971, Borges further {{elaborated}} on the story's creation, [...] "I {{tried to}} imagine what a real Nazi might be like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy for its own sake. Then I thought that this archetype of the Nazis wouldn't mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't meant to be a political tract. It was meant to stand for {{the fact that there was}} something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> one. They were all feeling sorry for themselves and wanted me to feel sorry for them as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|His third {{stint in}} prison was after Pakistani President Iskandar Mirza was ousted in a {{military}} coup by General Ayub Khan. The new military regime sought to purge political opponents, which led to Khan {{and hundreds of other}} politicians being disqualified from participating in politics. Wali Khan commented about his imprisonment to Ayub Khan's Information secretary in 1969 shortly after the Democratic Action Committee's conference with Ayub Khan had finished. Gauhar writes that, [...] "Wali Khan narrated how Khawaja Shahabuddin asked him on three occasions during the conference, 'how is it that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> a bright and able person like you when I was Governor of NWFP for three years.' Wali Khan let it pass on the first two occasions but on the third occasion he could not restrain himself and rejoined, 'Because all those three years you kept me in prison!'" [...] This was followed by another brief arrest in 1969 after another military ruler, Yahya Khan, assumed power after Ayub Khan resigned.|$|E

On this occasion the Secretary was accompanied by Governor Brough of Ohio, whom <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>met,</b> though he and my father had been old acquaintances. Mr. Stanton dismissed the special train that had brought him to Indianapolis, and accompanied me to Louisville.|$|R
