5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing {{processes in}} dynamic systems. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view of chemistry, a spiral {{can be generated}} by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> {{view that}} the goal of {{mathematics}} is to classify and characterize, the representation theory of the Lorentz group is since 1947 a finished chapter.

A letter from the defeated Tz'utujil Maya nobility of Santiago Atitlán to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; {{the face of}} star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism {{as the basis for}} its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent {{in the context of a}} putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E
30|$|In general, d-Confidence {{improves}} {{the performance of}} its baseline criteria both <b>from</b> <b>the</b> exploration <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view—finding unknown classes faster—and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> exploitation <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view—improving, although marginally, the accuracy—when applied to tabular, low-dimensional data.|$|R

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} {{is related to}} Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
