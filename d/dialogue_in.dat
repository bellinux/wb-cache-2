5|$|The Galileo {{affair was}} largely {{forgotten}} after Galileo's death, {{and the controversy}} subsided. The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned <b>Dialogue)</b> <b>in</b> Florence. In 1741, Pope Benedict XIV authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works which included a mildly censored version of the <b>Dialogue.</b> <b>In</b> 1758, the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism {{was removed from the}} Index of prohibited books, although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the Dialogue and Copernicus's De Revolutionibus remained. All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 13th century, {{women of}} the court were {{expected}} to be able to sing, play instruments, and write jocs partis, or partimen (a debate or <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> the form of a poem). The cultivation of these womanly skills may have led to the writings of the trobairitz.|$|E
5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} believable simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, obesity, and global catastrophic risk. It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|However, {{through the}} written <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> his diary, Choe did express slight {{differences}} between the cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese asked him {{whether or not the}} Korean education system offered degrees for specialists who dealt with only one of the Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one of the Classics and not all five of them was doomed to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a full-fledged Confucian scholar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E

East's <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> the film is redubbed by Christopher Reeve for the final cut.|$|E

5|$|Lynn Alton de Silva (16 June 1919 – 22 May 1982) was a Sri Lankan theologian and Methodist minister. He was {{the founder}} and editor {{of one of the}} first {{theological}} journals on Buddhist-Christian encounter called Dialogue (1961–1981), chief translator for the revision of the Old Testament of the Sinhalese Bible published as New Sinhala Bible (1973–1982), and director of the Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue (EISD) in Sri Lanka (1962–1982). Lynn de Silva is widely {{regarded as one of the}} foremost Christian practitioners of Buddhist-Christian <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> Sri Lanka, and also as one of the pioneers in this dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> which the words are as important as the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the series' songs have been officially uploaded to YouTube. On the DVD release they can be heard, along with visuals and without <b>dialogue,</b> <b>in</b> a special feature known as the Composer's Cut. An extended version of the soundtrack, featuring 32 tracks and totaling around 44 minutes in length, was released {{in the form of}} a 180 gram vinyl record by Mondo in August 2016. The extended soundtrack debuted at the San Diego Comic-Con, with a limited 1,000 copies, featuring a cover designed by Sam Wolfe Connelly. The extended vinyl is also available as a webstore exclusive from Mondo.|$|E

5|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for {{the second}} of three Easter feast days included the narration of the Road to Emmaus. The cantata was Bach's first composition for Easter as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. He derived it from his earlier Serenata, which had a similar celebratory mood. An unknown librettist solved the problem that Bach's congratulatory cantata was a dialogue of tenor and alto by retaining a <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> three movements, assigned to Hope and Fear. They represent different attitudes to {{the news of the}} Resurrection of Jesus, which may be found in the two disciples, discussing the events on their walk, but also within the listener of the cantata.|$|E
5|$|When Captain Scarlet was {{repeated}} by Central Television {{in the latter}} half of the decade, changes were made to the episode's opening sequence to remove <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> which the Mysterons allude to surveillance equipment that is being rotated to facilitate inspection of the Martian Exploration Vehicle. Since the imaging device resembles a missile battery (as the Zero X astronauts mistake it for), this re-edited version inadvertently gives an impression of stronger hostility on the part of the Mysterons.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> order to acquire clues which {{may lead to the}} murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire clues to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E

5|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{the team}} encountered was converting all game elements into a fully-3D world, including {{the sound and}} radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world; producer Dan Houser {{said that there was}} about 8,000 lines of recorded <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> the game, while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000. The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model. Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.|$|E
5|$|After {{developing}} Gunstar Heroes, Treasure {{was divided}} into four teams to work on four separate projects: Alien Soldier, Light Crusader, , and Dynamite Headdy. Masato Maegawa, president of Treasure, served as head programmer on Dynamite Headdy. After deciding to publish a localized version for overseas markets, Maegawa was told by Sega of America to make the game more difficult. This was because Sega did not want customers completing the game too easily on rental. Maegawa happily obliged, and the North American release was made about twice as difficult. In addition to changes in difficulty, most of the <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> the game was removed, {{and several of the}} character and boss sprites were changed.|$|E
5|$|Although Tenebrae was an Italian production, most of {{the cast}} spoke their <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> English to {{increase}} the film's chances of success in United States. For domestic audiences, the film was dubbed into Italian. The English-language dub retained Franciosa's, Saxon's and Steiner's natural voices. However, Nicolodi's voice was dubbed by Theresa Russell, Giuliano Gemma's was dubbed by David Graham, and {{most of the}} female voices were dubbed by Adrienne Posta. Michele Soavi – frequent Argento collaborator, second assistant director on Tenebrae and later a noted director in his own right – acted alongside Robin's in the second flashback scene. Another of Argento's collaborators, Fulvio Mingozzi cameoed as a hotel porter. In common with several other Argento films, close-ups of the killer's gloved hands were Argento's own. In the film's Italian-language dub, Argento also provided the opening voice-over, reading aloud descriptions of murderous actions from Neal's fictitious novel, Tenebrae.|$|E

5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty papyrus. However, A {{man and his}} Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, although they are unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of <b>dialogue.</b> <b>In</b> Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either {{as a warning to}} kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In A man and his Ba, a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E
5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive <b>dialogue</b> <b>in</b> her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E
5|$|At the Opéra-Comique, {{after its}} 1883 revival, Carmen was always {{presented}} in the dialogue version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, {{the year of the}} 50th anniversary of Bizet's birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the Carl Rosa Opera Company's 1947 London production, and Walter Felsenstein's 1949 staging at the Berlin Komische Oper, are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used other than in France. Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken <b>dialogue,</b> <b>in</b> Colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate.|$|E
