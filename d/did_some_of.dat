25|$|In Thackeray's own day some commentators, such as Anthony Trollope, ranked his History of Henry Esmond as his {{greatest}} work, {{perhaps because it}} expressed Victorian values of duty and earnestness, as <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his other later novels.

25|$|Unlike Rupert, Cromwell had {{roughly half}} of his wing uncommitted, as only {{the front line of}} Cromwell's wing had taken part in the defeat of Langdale. He sent only four {{divisions}} (roughly two regiments) after Langdale, and turned his reserves against the left flank and rear of the Royalist centre. At about the same time, Okey's dragoons mounted their horses and charged from the Sulby Hedges against {{the right wing of the}} Royalist infantry, as <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Ireton's regiments which had partly rallied.|$|E

25|$|Hearst was {{personally}} {{dedicated to the}} cause of the Cuban rebels, and the Journal <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most important and courageous reporting on the conflict—as {{well as some of the}} most sensationalized. In fact, their stories on the Cuban rebellion and Spain's atrocities on the island—many of which turned out to be untrue—were motivated primarily by outrage at Spain's brutal policies on the island, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Cubans. The most well-known story involved the imprisonment and release of Cuban prisoner Evangelina Cisneros.|$|E
25|$|Prior to his {{departure}} on 12 December, Porter placed Seringapatam, Sir Andrew Hammond, and Greenwich under the guns of Fort Madisonville, which Porter had had erected. He further left a small {{force on the}} island {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Gamble. Many of the prisoners from the captured ships were Americans and they volunteered for service, as <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the British captives. There were also six British prisoners of war. Soon after Porter sailed away, the local inhabitants became so troublesome that Gamble was forced to land a detachment of men to restore order.|$|E

25|$|Proteus, {{like the}} other inner {{satellites}} of Neptune, {{is unlikely to be}} an original body that formed with it, and is more likely to have accreted from the rubble that was produced after Triton's capture. Triton's orbit upon capture would have been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic perturbations in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the rubble disc re-accrete into the present-day satellites.|$|E

His relations with the young king also remained good for a time. The Serbian pro-Democratic opposition was blamed him for the increasingly authoritarian rule of the young King, {{and a member of}} Radical Party, attempted to kill him on 6 July 1899, (24 June OS), on the Orthodox holiday of Ivanjdan (Birth of St. John the Baptist).|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} {{revolution is}} a convenient boundary between ancient thought and classical physics. Nicolaus Copernicus revived the heliocentric {{model of the}} solar system described by Aristarchus of Samos. This was followed by the first known model of planetary motion given by Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century, which proposed that the planets follow elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. Galileo ("Father of Modern Physics") also made use of experiments to validate physical theories, a key element of the scientific method. William Gilbert <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the earliest experiments with electricity and magnetism, establishing that the Earth itself is magnetic.|$|E

25|$|As Nahuatl, {{carried by}} the Toltec and later the Aztec culture, became a lingua franca {{throughout}} Mesoamerica even some Mayan states such as the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj adopted Nahuatl as a prestige language. In Oaxaca Zapotec and Mixtec peoples expanded their territories displacing speakers of the Tequistlatecan languages slightly. During this time the Purépecha (Tarascans) consolidated their state based at Tzintzuntzan. They were resistant to other states of Mesoamerica and had little contact {{with the rest of}} Mesoamerica. Probably {{as a result of their}} isolationist policy the Purépecha language is the only language of Mesoamerica to not show any of the traits associated with the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. In Guerrero the Tlapanecs of Yopitzinco speaking the Oto-Manguean Tlapanec language remained independent of the Aztec empire as <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Oaxacan cultures such as the Mixtecs of Tututepec and the Zapotec of Zaachila. In the late postclassic around 1400 CE Zapotecs of Zaachila moved into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec creating a wedge of Zapotec speaking settlements between the former neighbors the Mixe and the Huave who were pushed into their current territories on the edges of the Isthmus.|$|E

Charlotte and Anning became lifelong friends and correspondents. Charlotte, who travelled widely and met many prominent geologists through her work with her husband, helped Anning build her network of customers throughout Europe, and Anning stayed with the Murchisons when she visited London in 1829.|$|E
