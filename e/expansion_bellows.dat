40|$|The {{history of}} {{particle}} colliders {{begins in the}} early 60 's when an idea previously patented by R. Wideroe in 1953 is constructed. The design of the vacuum chamber in their experimental area became essential {{as it was the}} rst physical barrier that the particles to be detected needed to traverse. The interaction of the products of the collisions with the vacuum chamber structural materials, hindered the identification of the significative events. This Thesis analyses the historical evolution of the experimental vacuum chambers and summarizes the technical criteria that are to be fulfilled. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) presently under construction at CERN is the last generation of particle colliders. Four big experiments will be in operation (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb) in the LHC with diferent physics objectives. In particular, LHCb will be devoted to the study of CP violation and the design of its vacuum chamber is the scope of this Thesis. Physics simulations with an initial design consisting of a conical aluminium vacuum chamber with stainless steel flanges and <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> joints, foresaw redundancies in the experiment detection channels that would make it inefficient. The reduction of the radiation background generated after the interactions of the products of the proton collisions with the vacuum chamber materials became essential. Berillium became the ideal candidate as structural material for the vacuum chamber due to its excellent mechanical properties and high transparency to radiation. Nonetheless, its toxicity, difficult machining and complicated weld hampers its use. TIG welding of beryllium to beryllium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications as per ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. On the other hand, beryllium high price led to consider beryllium-aluminium composites for the fabrication of the LHCb vacuum chamber. The mechanical characterization of the berylliumaluminium HIP AlBeMet AM 162 at the required bakeout temperatures of 200 °C and 250 °C was completed. In turn, the electron beam welding of beryllium-aluminium to beryllium-aluminium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications following ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. Once characterized mechanically the materials and demonstrated the feasibility of the welding, nite element analysis were performed to design the vacuum chamber; as well as to design other special components integrated in it. The fabrication and thorough tests conducted with prototypes is described; in particular, an aluminium AA 6061 OD 860 mm window 2 mm thick that UHV seals one of the detectors, two <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> joint aluminium fabricated in AA 2219 and two optimized aluminium AA 2219 UHV anges. The final design consisting of a TIG welded conical structure 12 m long fabricated in berillium with thickness ranging between 1 and 2. 4 mm, implementing the validated aluminium window, optimized flanges and <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> joints, will allow a factor 5 reduction of the radiation background generated by the initial vacuum chamber allowing the study of the physics that the LHCb experiment is designed for...|$|R

However theoretical modelling suggested that the <b>expansion</b> of the <b>bellows</b> as a result of squirm would lead to a significant amount of work being done on them by the reactor contents, and there would be considerable shock loading on the bellows when they reached the end of their travel. If the bellows were 'stiff' (resistant to squirm), the shock loading could cause the bellows to tear at pressures below the safety valve setting; it was not impossible that this could occur at pressures experienced during start-up, when pressure was less tightly controlled. (Plant pressures {{at the time of the}} accident were unknown since all relevant instruments and records had been destroyed, and all relevant operators killed).The Inquiry concluded that this ("the 20-inch hypothesis") was 'a probability' but one 'which would readily be displaced if some greater probability' could be found.|$|R
40|$|A {{majority}} of the thin-walled components subjected to intensive plastic straining at cryogenic temperatures are made of stainless steels. The examples of such components {{can be found in}} the interconnections of particle accelerators, containing the superconducting magnets, where the thermal contraction is absorbed by thin-walled, axisymetric shells called <b>bellows</b> <b>expansion</b> joints. The stainless steels show three main phenomena induced by plastic strains at cryogenic temperatures: serrated (discontinuous) yielding, gamma->alpha' phase transformation and anisotropic ductile damage. In the present paper, a coupled constitutive model of gamma->alpha' phase transformation and orthotropic ductile damage is presented. A kinetic law of phase transformation, and a kinetic law of evolution of orthotropic damage are presented. The model is extended to anisotropic plasticity comprising a constant anisotropy (texture effect), which can be classically taken into account by the Hill yield surface, and plastic strain induced anisotropy. For such a model the shape of the yield surface in the stress space varies as a function of the plastic strains. The constitutive model creates a bridge between material science (experiments) and structural analysis.

40|$|The Fe-Cr-Ni {{stainless}} steels {{are well known}} for their ductile behaviour at cryogenic temperatures. This implies development and evolution of plastic strain fields in the stainless steel components subjected to thermo-mechanical loads at low temperatures. The evolution of plastic strain fields is usually associated with two phenomena: ductile damage and strain induced martensitic transformation. Ductile damage is described by the kinetic law of damage evolution. Here, the assumption of isotropic distribution of damage (microcracks and microvoids) in the Representative Volume Element (RVE) is made. Formation of the plastic strain induced martensite (irreversible process) leads {{to the presence of}} quasi-rigid inclusions of martensite in the austenitic matrix. The amount of martensite platelets in the RVE depends on the intensity of the plastic strain fields and on the temperature. The evolution of the volume fraction of martensite is governed by a kinetic law based on the accumulated plastic strain. Both of these irreversible phenomena, associated with the dissipation of plastic power, are included into the constitutive model of {{stainless steels}} at cryogenic temperatures.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on {{constitutive}} modelling and identification of parameters of the relevant model of plastic strain- induced martensitic transformation in austenitic stainless steels at low temperatures. The model {{used to describe the}} FCCrightward arrow BCC phase transformation in austenitic stainless steels {{is based on the assumption}} of linearization of the most intensive part of the transformation curve. The kinetics of phase transformation is described by three parameters: transformation threshold (p/sub xi/), slope (A) and saturation level (xi/sub L/). It is assumed that the phase transformation is driven by the accumulated plastic strain p. In addition, the intensity of plastic deformation is strongly coupled to the phase transformation via the description of mixed kinematic /isotropic linear plastic hardening based on the Mori-Tanaka homogenization. The theory of small strains is applied. Small strain fields, corresponding to phase transformation, are decomposed into the volumic and the shear parts. The grade AISI 316 L, stainless steel often used in cryogenic applications, has been chosen as a good example of the austenitic structure. The magnetic permeability of fine gauge stainless steel sheets (thickness 0. 15 - 0. 25 mm) subjected to monotonic straining was measured as a function of strain. The detailed methodology of relevant measurements is presented in the paper. Tuning of the constitutive model is described and the relevant parameters are identified.

In the present application bellows are located in ducts supplying liquid oxygen to large rocket engine combustors and must accommodate the differential motion isolating the space vehicle from vibrations of the engine and the engine angulation required for thrustvector control. Because of the high pressure levels in the oxygen ducts a tension restraint center linkage is used in each bellows, consistiing of two oppositely directed interlocking tripods attached to the rigid external support rings that join the bellows to the duct ends. Bellows with an internal restraint linkage made of Inconel 718 have failed in the center of the linkage. The tripod design was remodified by changing the hub thickness at the critical center notch location, yet two modified restraint links failed again. The reasons for failure of this interim strut modification, which was indicated by theoretical analysis to be significantly superior to the original design, are considered in this thesis. The results of strain gage experiments on a third interim design and the analysis of the microstructure of the failure area of a restraint joints showed that the major cause for failure was residual stress.
