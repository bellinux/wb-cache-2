500|$|According to Steve Turner, one of Van Morrison's biographers, Irish painter Cecil McCartney {{influenced}} the titling of Astral Weeks. [...] Morrison related how [...] "A {{friend of mine}} had drawings in his flat of astral projection. I was at his house when I {{was working on a}} song which began, 'If I venture down the slipstream' and that's why <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> 'Astral Weeks'." [...] "It was a painting," [...] McCartney corrects. [...] "There were several paintings in the studio at the time. Van looked at the painting and it suggested astral travelling to him." [...] The album cover photograph of Van Morrison was taken by Joel Brodsky, best known for his [...] "Young Lions" [...] photoshoot with [...] Jim Morrison. The squared circle in the cover photo is described as portraying [...] "the mystic symbol of the union of opposites; the sacred marriage of heaven and earth".|$|E

And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "Isaac" [...] It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis.

We said, [...] "We're just going to record you. We don't know what we're going to do with it." [...] He's flawless. One take, no bad notes. He doesn't even need a microphone. We took one of the songs he did and I said to Stuart, [...] "Let's sample these bits. We'll create a chorus and then I'll write lyrics around it." [...] That's how we constructed it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Experimenting {{with the}} use of {{negative}} space and organic forms in the late 1940s, by the mid-1950s Alston began creating notably modernist style paintings. Woman with Flowers (1949) {{has been described as a}} tribute to Modigliani and African art makes another strong appearance in Ceremonial (1950). Untitled works during the era show his use of color overlay using muted colors to create simple layered abstracts of still live. Symbol (1953) relates to Picasso's Guernica, which was a favorite work of Alston's. His final work of the 1950s, Walking, was inspired by the Montgomery Bus Boycott and has come to represent [...] "the surge of energy among African Americans to organize in their struggle for full equality." [...] About the artwork, Alston is quoted [...] "The idea of a march was growing....It was in the air...and this painting just came. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Walking on purpose. It wasn't the militancy that you saw later. It was a very definite walk-not going back, no hesitation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lennon's {{inspiration}} for the song came when his son, Julian, showed him a nursery school drawing he called [...] "Lucy—in the Sky with Diamonds", depicting his classmate Lucy O'Donnell (later Lucy Vodden). Julian Lennon said, [...] "I don't know why <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> that or why it stood out from all my other drawings, but I obviously had an affection for Lucy at that age. I used to show Dad everything I'd built or painted at school, and this one sparked off the idea..." [...] Vodden, in a BBC radio interview in 2007, said, [...] "I remember Julian and I both doing pictures on a double-sided easel, throwing paint at each other, much to {{the horror of the}} classroom attendant... Julian had painted a picture and on that particular day his father turned up with the chauffeur to pick him up from school." [...] O'Donnell died in 2009 at age 46 after suffering from lupus.|$|E
