40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to correlate, the apgar score of the new-borns from {{induction}} of labour (IL) with Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) <b>endocervical</b> <b>gel,</b> and the oxidative environment of the pregnant woman during labour, studying biochemical markers of the erythrocytes. PGE 2 {{is responsible for the}} regulation of the vascular response in pregnancy, namely for the vasoconstriction caused by Angitensin II. The production of Prostaglandins in vivo depends on mechanisms related to free radicals of oxygen (FRO). The production of FRO is enhanced in normal pregnancy. We have studied two erythrocytic enzymes and plasmatic concentration of PGE 2 before and after the IL. Those enzymes are oxireductases-the transmembrane reductase (RTM) and the metahemoglobin reductase (MHR). Their function is to prevent the effects of the FRO on cellular biomolecules namely the endothelium and the red blood cells. This prevention of oxidative stress can facilitate the deformability of the erythrocytes, so these cells can easily transpose the small vessels and bind the oxygen to the tissues. The activity of those enzymes can be modulated by PGE 2 used in the IL. We have not found significant variations on the activity of RTM after IL. The activity of MHR was enhanced with statistical significance, 30 minutes after the induction. This enhancement of activity can be a mechanism to prevent the oxidative stress of the induction of labour.
