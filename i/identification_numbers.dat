5|$|Unlike most breeds, {{there is}} a set naming system {{that is used to}} {{identify}} individuals based on the registration format employed by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation. First comes the prefix, the farm or breeding establishment of which the foal was born into, followed by the sire's name, and lastly the given name for the foal. Each year a different letter is assigned to begin the given name for the foal, and it is by the year's letter that the foal is named. Some older horses do not fall under this naming strategy, but it is now mandatory in naming registered offspring coming from purebred Canadian lines. Originally, horses were tattooed with <b>identification</b> <b>numbers,</b> but now microchipping is the identification technology chosen by the breed registry.|$|E

One regiment, the 101st Grenadiers, formed a second battalion by dividing itself into two with two experienced and two new companies in each battalion.

40|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} worldwide have unique aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> on the rooves {{for ease}} of identification for aerial support, particularly if the individuals crewing the vehicle need exigent assistance. Drawing on an actual event from the 2013 Blue Mountains Wildfire, this paper highlights how aerial support from a water bombing aircraft was unable to read the existing black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> of a fire appliance because the black <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> coalesced with the black plumes of smoke emitted by the wildfire. Given the extensive technological development {{in the application of}} high visibility markings over the past twenty-one years, the current black and aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> used by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service on their fire appliances is far from adequate, doing little to provide optimum safety for fire ground crews in a wildfire. This paper concludes that the current black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> should be replaced with high visibility aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> markings because these have greater visibility for aerial support in a wildfire particularly in the colours of red, lime, yellow, orange or blue. 15 page(s...|$|R
