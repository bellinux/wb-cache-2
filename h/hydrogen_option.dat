40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{integrated}} knowledge on the transition to a sustainable energy system. The paper focuses on the relationship between technologies and institutions in the field of hydrogen from the perspective of political theory. The paper unfolds four paradigms of governance: 'Governance by policy networking', Governance by government', 'Governance by corporate business', and 'Governance by challenge', and looks into the major line of argument in support of these paradigms and into their possible bias with respect to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>options.</b> Each of these paradigms reveals an institutional bias in that it articulates specific opportunities for collaboration and competition in order to stimulate the transition to a sustainable hydrogen economy. The paper makes the observation that there is a compelling need to reframe fashionable discourse such as the necessary shift from government to governance or from government to market. Instead, specific questions with respect to the impact of guiding policy frameworks on innovation will highlight that neither 'neutral' nor 'optimal' frameworks for policy making exist, where competing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>options</b> are at stake. The identification of paradigms of governance maybe considered a methodological device for (participator) policy analysis. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear {{technologies}} have important distinctions and potential advantages for large-scale generation of hydrogen for U. S. energy services. Nuclear hydrogen requires no imported fossil fuels, results in lower greenhouse-gas emissions and other pollutants, {{lends itself to}} large-scale production, and is sustainable. The technical uncertainties in nuclear hydrogen processes and the reactor technologies needed to enable these processes, as well waste, proliferation, and economic issues must be successfully addressed before nuclear energy can be {{a major contributor to}} the nation's energy future. In order to address technical issues in the time frame needed to provide optimized hydrogen production choices, the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI) must examine a wide range of new technologies, make the best use of research funding, and make early decisions on which technology options to pursue. For these reasons, it is important that system integration studies be performed to help guide the decisions made in the NHI. In framing the scope of system integration analyses, there is a hierarchy of questions that should be addressed: What hydrogen markets will exist and what are their characteristics? Which markets are most consistent with nuclear hydrogen? What nuclear power and production process configurations are optimal? What requirements are placed on the nuclear hydrogen system? The intent of the NHI system studies is {{to gain a better understanding}} of nuclear power's potential role in a hydrogen economy and what hydrogen production technologies show the most promise. This work couples with system studies sponsored by DOE-EE and other agencies that provide a basis for evaluating and selecting future hydrogen production technologies. This assessment includes identifying commercial hydrogen applications and their requirements, comparing the characteristics of nuclear hydrogen systems to those market requirements, evaluating nuclear <b>hydrogen</b> configuration <b>options</b> within a given market, and identifying the key drivers and thresholds for market viability of nuclear <b>hydrogen</b> <b>options...</b>|$|R

This study focuses on constructing a hydrogen infrastructure in Europe by 2030. Several hydrogen technologies and their integration into an infrastructure system, including the production, transport and distribution of hydrogen, are analysed on the basis of energy chain calculations and expert judgements and consistent scenarios are developed. It can be shown that under economic and CO 2 -reduction objectives, the steam reforming of gas, followed by coal gasification and, to a limited extent, the electrolysis of electricity from renewable energy carriers are the most promising <b>hydrogen</b> production <b>options</b> in this first phase for developing a <b>hydrogen</b> infrastructure.

On-demand hydrogen generation via fuel reforming offers a convenient alternative to hydrogen storage, but the concomitant CO generation is deleterious to {{the fuel cell}} catalyst.

The devices are manufactured using bulk micromachining techniques including photolithography, plasma, and wet etching. They are operated at pressures up to 2 atm with a correspondingly enhanced hydrogen flux. In particular, thin (200 nm) palladium–silver membrane yield high permeation rates of up to 50 mol/m²/s at 350 ◦C.

40|$|The {{results of}} recent {{investigation}} of fullerenefullerene hydride {{system as a}} potential high capacity <b>hydrogen</b> storage <b>option</b> are presented. Theoretically, C 60 fullerenes can reversibly store up to 7. 7 wt. % hydrogen by forming fullerene hydride C 60 Hx. However, high temperature and pressure are currently required to enable hydrogen exchange in this system. For example, direct hydrogenation of fullerenes {{in the presence of}} gaseous hydrogen at ~ 450 °C and ~ 3 MPa yields fullerene hydride with ~ 6. 1 wt. % hydrogen content. Over the past years, MER has been searching for practical ways to facilitate hydrogen storage on fullerenes at milder conditions. The main focus of the research was concentrated on optimizing catalytic system including transition-metal liquid state catalysts, as well as modifying electronic structure of fullerenes by doping them with electron-donating elements (for example, alkali metals). As a result of this investigation, certain progress was made in lowering the temperature and pressure required for hydrogenation.

40|$|The {{search for}} a sustainable, CO 2 -free massive {{hydrogen}} production route is a strong need, if one {{takes into account the}} world-wide increasing energy demand, the deterioration of fossil fuel reserves and in particular the increasing CO 2 concentration leading to global warming.

This assessment includes identifying commercial hydrogen applications and their requirements, comparing the characteristics of nuclear hydrogen systems to those market requirements, evaluating nuclear <b>hydrogen</b> configuration <b>options</b> within a given market, and identifying the key drivers and thresholds for market viability of nuclear <b>hydrogen</b> <b>options.</b> One of the objectives of the current analysis phase is to determine how nuclear hydrogen technologies could evolve under a number of different futures. The outputs of our work will eventually be used in a larger hydrogen infrastructure and market analysis conducted for DOE-EE using a system-level market simulation tool now underway. This report expands on our previous work by moving beyond simple levelized cost calculations and looking at profitability, risk, and uncertainty from an investor's perspective. We analyze a number of technologies and quantify the value of certain technology and operating characteristics. Our model to assess the profitability of the above technologies is based on Real Options Theory and calculates the discounted profits from investing in each of the production facilities. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to represent the uncertainty in hydrogen and electricity prices. The model computes both the expected value and the distribution of discounted profits from a production plant. We also quantify the value of the option to switch between hydrogen and electricity production in order to maximize investor profits. Uncertainty in electricity and hydrogen prices can be represented with two different stochastic processes: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and Mean Reversion (MR). Our analysis finds that the flexibility to switch between hydrogen and electricity leads to significantly different results in regards to the relative profitability of the different technologies and configurations. This is the case both with a deterministic and a stochastic analysis, as shown in the tables below. The flexibility in output products clearly adds substantial value to the HPE-ALWR and HTE-HTGR plants. In fact, under the GBM assumption for prices, the HTE-HTGR plant becomes more profitable than the SI-HTGR configuration, although SI-HTGR has a much lower levelized cost. For the HTE-HTGR plant it is also profitable to invest in additional electric turbine capacity (Case b) in order to fully utilize the heat from the nuclear reactor for electricity production when this is more profitable than producing hydrogen. The technologies are all at the research and development stage, so there are significant uncertainties regarding the technology cost and performance assumptions used in this analysis. As the technologies advance, the designers need to refine the cost and performance evaluation to provide a more reliable set of input for a more rigorous analysis. In addition, the durability of the catalytic activity of the materials at the hydrogen plant during repetitive price cycling is of prime importance concerning the flexibility of switching from hydrogen to electricity production. However, given the potential significant economic benefit that can be brought from cogeneration with the flexibility to quickly react to market signals, DOE should consider R&D efforts towards developing durable materials and processes that can enable this type of operation. Our future work will focus on analyzing a range of hydrogen production technologies associated with an extension of the financial analysis framework presented here. We are planning to address a variety of additional risks and options, such as the value of modular expansion in addition to the co-generation capability (i. e., a modular increase in the hydrogen production capacity of a plant in a given market with rising hydrogen demand), and contrast that with economies-of-scale of large-unit designs...|$|R

Geostorage options being considered are salt caverns, depleted oil/gas reservoirs, aquifers and potentially hard rock cavrns.

40|$|As proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cell technology advances, {{the need for}} hydrogen storage intensifies. Metal hydride alloys offer one potential solution. However, for metal hydride tanks to become a viable <b>hydrogen</b> storage <b>option,</b> the dynamic performance of different tank geometries and configurations must be evaluated. In an effort to relate tank performance to geometry and operating conditions, a dynamic, two-dimensional, multi-nodal metal hydride tank model has been created in Matlab-Simulink®. Following the original work of Mayer, Groll, and Supper 1 and the more recent paper from Aldas, Mat, and Kaplan 2, this model employs first principle heat transfer and fluid flow mechanisms together with empirically derived reaction kinetics. Energy and mass balances are solved in cylindrical polar coordinates for a cylindrically shaped tank. The model tank temperature, heat release, and storage volume have been correlated to an actual metal hydride tank for static and transient adsorption and desorption processes. The dynamic model is found to accurately predict observed hardware performance characteristics portending a capability to well simulate the dynamic performance of more complex tank geometries and configurations.

40|$|Hydrogen holds a {{prominent}} role as renewable energy carrier of the future due to its high gravimetric energy density. However, the most urgent technological challenge—especially concerning mobile applications in fuel cell vehicles—is the development of appropriate <b>hydrogen</b> storage <b>options.</b> In this context, metal hydrides are promising candidates in terms of development potential and increasing storage density. Our research outlines the so-far neglected influence of raw material prices on the decision which metal hydride is to date the most capable option to pursue. Using scenario analysis, we picture the impact of possible price developments depending on diffusion speed of fuel cell technologies into the automotive market, further applications of the corresponding raw materials, and other external influence factors. The main practical implication of our approach consists in enhancing the understanding of constantly changing market conditions—in our case scarcity and prices of the needed raw materials—and their impact on technology assessment in {{an early stage of}} the innovation process. In a superior context, our results in terms of metal hydrides can be adapted to other technologies and thus contribute to design a general model illustrating the influence of raw material prices on the development of energy technologies...|$|R
40|$|We have {{assessed}} the transportation of hydrogen as a metal hydride slurry through pipelines over {{a short distance}} from a neighborhood hydrogen production facility to local points of use.

The concept was compared to a compressed gaseous <b>hydrogen</b> mini-grid <b>option</b> and to a stand-alone hydrogen fueling station. Based on our analysis results we have concluded that the metal hydride slurry concept has potential to provide significant reductions in overall energy use compared to liquid or chemical hydride delivery, but only modest reductions in overall energy use, hydrogen cost, and GHG emissions compared to a compressed gaseous hydrogen delivery. However, given the inherent (and perceived) safety and reasonable cost/efficiency of the metal hydride slurry systems, additional research and analysis is warranted.

The concept of using solar energy to drive the conversion of water into hydrogen and oxygen has been examined, from the standpoints of potential and ideal efficiencies, measurement of (and how to calculate) solar hydrogen production efficiencies, {{a survey of the}} state-of-the-art, and a technological assessment of various solar <b>hydrogen</b> <b>options.</b> The analysis demonstrates that the ideal limit of the conversion efficiency for 1 sun irradiance is {approximately} 31 % for a single photosystem scheme and {approximately} 42 % for a dual photosystem scheme. However, practical considerations indicate that real efficiencies will not likely exceed {approximately} 10 % and {approximately} 16 % for single and dual photosystem schemes, respectively. Four types of solar photochemical hydrogen systems have been identified: photochemical systems, semiconductor systems, photobiological systems, and hybrid and other systems. A survey of the state-of-the-art of these four types is presented. The four types (and their subtypes) have also been examined in a technological assessment, where each has been examined as to efficiency, potential for improvement, and long-term functionality. Four solar hydrogen systems have been selected as showing sufficient promise for further research and development: (1) Photovoltaic cells plus an electrolyzer; (2) Photoelectrochemical cells with one or more semiconductor electrodes; (3) Photobiological systems; and (4) Photodegradation systems. The following recommendations were presented for consideration of the IEA: (1) Define and measure solar hydrogen conversion efficiencies as the ratio of the rate of generation of Gibbs energy of dry hydrogen gas (with appropriate corrections for any bias power) to the incident solar power (solar irradiance times the irradiated area); (2) Expand support for pilot-plant studies of the PV cells plus electrolyzer option with a view to improving the overall efficiency and long-term stability of the system. Consideration should be given, at an appropriate time, to a full-scale installation as part of a solar hydrogen-based model community; (3) Accelerate support, at a more fundamental level for the development of photoelectrochemical cells, with a view to improving efficiency, long-term performance and multi-cell systems for non-biased solar water splitting; (4) Maintain and increase support for fundamental photobiological research with the aim of improving long-term stability, increasing efficiencies and engineering genetic changes to allow operation at normal solar irradiances; and (5) Initiate a research program to examine the feasibility of coupling hydrogen evolution to the photodegradation of waste or polluting organic substances...|$|R

These assessments represent prospective, i. e. ’ex-ante’ studies on the production of caprolactam by an improved catalyst and on different <b>hydrogen</b> storage <b>options</b> (i. e. compressed and liquefied hydrogen, storage in metal hydrides and storage in a metal organic framework). The pilot sustainability assessments followed the principles of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), thereby focusing on non-renewable energy use (NREU) and climate change (GWP 100). It was found that caprolactam with the novel catalyst has lower impacts than petrochemical caprolactam production from benzene but higher impacts than bio-based caprolactam produced via fermentation. Regarding hydrogen storage, {{it was found that}} compressed and liquid hydrogen have the highest impacts. The impacts of the metal hydrides and the metal organic frameworks show by far the lowest environmental impacts.

Refueling stations are sited based on the location of demand and the trade-off between convenience and costs. We use engineering/ economic models to describe a variety of possible <b>hydrogen</b> supply <b>options.</b> Both onsite and central production technologies including biomass gasification, coal gasification, natural gas reforming, and water electrolysis are investigated. For central production routes, several delivery modes are analyzed including liquid and compressed gas trucks, and gas pipelines.

At each time step over a specified transition period, the model uses a dynamic programming algorithm to select the best strategy for building up the infrastructure. We find that 1) hydrogen could be cost competitive based on region-specific spatial optimization; 2) the best buildup strategy for Southern California could be industry hydrogen in early stage, bridged by onsite natural SMR and followed by biomass central gasification and then coal gasification with carbon capture and sequestration; 3) the feasibility of CCS is critical in CO 2 emissions mitigation. eScholarship provides open access, scholarly publishing services to the University of California and delivers a dynamic research platform to scholars worldwide.

However, for metal hydride tanks to become a viable <b>hydrogen</b> storage <b>option,</b> the dynamic performance of practical tank geometries and configurations must be understood and incorporated into fuel cell system analyses. A dynamic, axially-symmetric, multi-nodal metal hydride tank model has been created in Matlab-Simulink ® as an initial means of providing insight and analysis capabilities for the dynamic performance of commercially available metal hydride systems. Following the original work of Mayer et al. [Mayer U, Groll M, Supper W. Heat and mass transfer in metal hydride reaction beds: experimental and theoretical results.

The model tank temperature, heat release, and storage volume have been correlated to an actual metal hydride tank for static and transient absorption and desorption processes. A sensitivity analysis of the model was accomplished to identify governing physics and to identify techniques to lessen the computational burden for ease of use in a larger system model. The sensitivity analysis reveals the basis and justification for model simplifications that are selected.

40|$|Presented at the National Hydrogen Association Annual Hydrogen Conference (NHA 2005), Washington, DC, March 29 - April 1, 2005 The use of {{hydrogen}} as a light-duty transportation fuel requires {{the development of}} a widespread regional hydrogen infrastructure, including production facilities, a distribution network, and refueling stations. In the case of fossil-based hydrogen production with carbon capture and sequestration, additional infrastructure is needed for CO 2 disposal. If construction of this infrastructure is to proceed, it is necessary to identify strategies for minimizing the cost while maximizing the utility during the transition. We have developed an infrastructure model that identifies the major parameters that determine infrastructure cost and uses a geographic information system (GIS) to apply these parameters to optimize infrastructure design for a given region. In this paper, the model is applied to a regional case study of a potential coalbased hydrogen economy in Ohio with CO 2 capture and sequestration. The objective is to model the optimal hydrogen infrastructure design for the entire state under different market penetration scenarios. GIS facilitates this analysis by allowing one to use existing spatially-referenced data, such as population distribution, coal resources, existing infrastructure, and CO 2 sequestration sites, to calculate the location and magnitude {{of hydrogen}} demand and optimize the placement of production facilities and pipeline networks for transporting hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Engineering/economic models that identify the costs and technical performance of infrastructure components allow for the calculation of the costs, energy usage and emissions of different <b>hydrogen</b> infrastructure <b>options.</b> Based on these parameters, it is possible to identify the lowest cost infrastructure design for supplying hydrogen to users under multiple scenarios.

We assume that {{hydrogen fuel cell vehicles}} are introduced in a specific region, Sacramento County, California. We consider two levels of market penetration where 9 % or 20 % of the light duty fleet are hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The following three natural gas to hydrogen supply pathways are assessed in detail and compared in terms of emissions and the resulting changes in ambient air quality: (1) onsite hydrogen production; (2) centralized hydrogen production with gaseous hydrogen pipeline delivery systems; and (3) centralized hydrogen production with liquid hydrogen truck delivery systems. All the pathways examined use steam methane reforming (SMR) of natural gas to produce hydrogen. The source contributions to incremental air pollution are estimated and compared among hydrogen pathways. All of the hydrogen pathways result in extremely low contributions to ambient air concentrations of NOx, CO, particulates, and SOx, typically less than 0. 1 % of the current ambient pollution for both levels of market penetration. Among the <b>hydrogen</b> supply <b>options,</b> it is found that the central SMR with pipeline delivery systems is the lowest pollution option available provided the plant is located to avoid transport of pollutants into the city via prevailing winds. The onsite hydrogen pathway is comparable to the central hydrogen pathway with pipeline systems in terms of the resulting air pollution. The pathway with liquid hydrogen trucks has a greater impact on air quality relative to the other pathways due to emissions associated with diesel trucks and electricity consumption to liquefy hydrogen. However, all three hydrogen pathways result in negligible air pollution in the region. UCD-ITS-RP- 07 - 29, Civil Engineering...|$|R
40|$|A {{fuel cell}} is {{a device that}} {{directly}} converts the chemical energy of reactants (a fuel and an oxidant) into low d. c. electricity [1]. Used {{in conjunction with other}} sustainable energy <b>options,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and fuel cell technology can provide a realistic alternative to fossil fuels. Although research is continuing in many areas we are no closer now to commercialisation than ten to twenty years ago. This is due to a number of key reasons, some of which include efficiency, scale, accessories and power output. This paper outlines the benefits that could be derived from switching to a hydrogen based economy and the commercialisation of hydrogen fuel cells as a clean and environmentally friendly alternative. It looks in general at the fuel cell, outlines its origin, how it operates, and the wide range of fuel cells available. The paper also compares the alkaline fuel cell (AFC) with the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as options for low temperature applications. In particular, the paper focuses on the research being conducted by the Dublin Institute of Technology into alkaline fuel cell technology and outlines the systems capabilities and limitations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe UK has an {{extensive}} natural {{gas pipeline network}} supplying 84 % of homes. Previous studies of decarbonisation pathways using the UK MARKAL energy system model {{have concluded that the}} low-pressure gas networks should be mostly abandoned by 2050, yet most of the iron pipes near buildings are currently being replaced early for safety reasons. Our study suggests that this programme will not lock-in the use of gas in the long-term. We examine potential future uses of the gas network in the UK energy system using an improved version of UK MARKAL that introduces a number of decarbonisation options for the gas network including bio-methane, hydrogen injection to the natural gas and conversion of the network to deliver hydrogen. We conclude that hydrogen conversion is the only gas decarbonisation option that might enable the gas networks to continue supplying energy to most buildings in the long-term, from a cost-optimal perspective. There is an opportunity for the government to adopt a long-term strategy for the gas distribution networks that either curtails the iron mains replacement programme or alters it to prepare the network for <b>hydrogen</b> conversion; both <b>options</b> could substantially reduce the long-term cost of supplying heat to UK buildings...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen is {{an energy}} carrier {{able to be}} {{produced}} from domestic, zero-carbon sources and consumed by zero-pollution devices. A transition to a hydrogen-based economy could therefore potentially respond to climate, air quality, and energy security concerns. In a hydrogen economy, both mobile and stationary energy needs could be met through the reaction of hydrogen (H 2) with oxygen (O 2). This study applies a full fuel cycle approach to quantify the energy, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), and cost implications associated with a large transition to hydrogen in the United States. It explores a national and four metropolitan area transitions in two contrasting policy contexts: a "business-as-usual" (BAU) context with continued reliance on fossil fuels, and a "GHG-constrained" context with policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A transition in either policy context faces serious challenges, foremost among them from the highly inertial investments {{over the past century}} or so in technology and infrastructure based on petroleum, natural gas, and coal. A hydrogen transition in the USA could contribute to an effective response to climate change by helping to achieve deep reductions in GHG emissions by mid-century across all sectors of the economy; however, these reductions depend on the use of hydrogen to exploit clean, zero-carbon energy supply <b>options.</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> Greenhouse gases Energy...|$|R
40|$|The debate-taking {{place at}} present about a future European energy system focuses on {{hydrogen}} {{as a potential}} future energy carrier. Hydrogen corridors offer, among other things, the possibilities of coping with the energy resource limitations for hydrogen production in the EU 25 and improving energy supply security. This study deals with the assessment of economically optimal hydrogen corridors between the EU 25 and neighbouring countries using consistent hydrogen scenarios, cost and potential calculations, the identification of barriers and policy recommendations. The analysis shows that specific hydrogen corridors (e. g. Norway, Iceland) could play a role for supplying renewable hydrogen in or shortly after the introduction phase of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the EU. Subsequently, with an increasing demand for hydrogen in the EU 25, other large-scale hydrogen corridors based on renewables constitute a very promising option from both the economic perspective {{as well as from}} the perspective of realizing a sustainable hydrogen supply. However, competing utilisation possibilities for renewable resources and the potentially increasing demand for hydrogen within the neighbouring countries themselves may limit this <b>option.</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> corridors based on fossil or nuclear feedstock are not promising because it is usually more beneficial to transport the feedstock or electricity itself instead of hydrogen...|$|R
40|$|Sewers {{systems are}} dynamic in nature, with {{periodic}} variation of hydraulic flow and wastewater substrate concentrations. While various models are currently available for predicting hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) production in rising mains, they assume constant biofilm activities {{along the length}} and ignore the effect of substrate availability on biofilm development. To investigate variation in rising main biofilm structure and activity, detailed {{studies were carried out}} on a Robbins device setup, which was established in parallel to a real rising main that it simulated. The changes in wastewater characteristics, as wastewater traveled through both the experimental setup and the real sewer system, were monitored. The study revealed that the biofilm activities varied significantly with locations, with biofilm corresponding {{to the start of the}} rising main capable of greater sulfide and volatile fatty acid production than biofilm downstream. Analysis of microbial community composition of these biofilms showed a difference in diversity and abundance, both with regard to general bacterial populations and sulfate reducers. These differences were hypothesized to be a consequence of varying substrate types and availability along the sewer line. The results suggest that the biofilm structure and activity may vary considerably along the length of rising mains and should be taken into consideration for improved sewer modeling and when considering the overall effect of different <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide management <b>options...</b>|$|R
40|$|Decision {{makers of}} the highest rank are {{committed}} to <b>hydrogen</b> and electrical <b>options</b> in the world-wide efforts to create a zero-emissions vehicle. Neither option is truly zero emissions due to the carbon dioxide discharged in producing the hydrogen or electricity. In addition, both options require a costly change of existing fuel supply infrastructure. This paper elaborates on the ZEMPES, introduced at the Second Conference in Alexandria, 2003 and further described in the VAFSEP Conference in Dublin, 2004. Stress {{is placed on the}} use of propane as a fuel due to the possibility of storing captured CO 2 onboard in the fuel tank, requiring only a sliding baffle to separate it from the fuel. CO 2 could be discharged into a central tank at a filling station to create space for the new fuel. ZEMPES consists of a spark ignition piston engine with a supercharger, an ITMR (ion transport membrane reactor) to separate oxygen from compressed air, an air compressor and depleted air turbine and a CO 2 liquefaction system. There is also an optional bottoming Rankine cycle to use the wasted heat. The crucial new element is the ITMR which has been recently developed by Air Products Co. For 500 kg O 2 per day its dimensions are similar to a home breadbox, which is small enough to be used in a car. Ai...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in threats from global warming {{due to the}} consumption of fossil fuels requires our planet to adopt new strategies to harness the inexhaustible sources of energy. Hydrogen is an energy carrier which holds tremendous promise as a new renewable and clean energy <b>option.</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> is a convenient, safe, versatile fuel source {{that can be easily}} converted to a desired form of energy without releasing harmful emissions. However, no materials was found satisfy the desired goals and hence there is hunt for new materials that can store hydrogen reversibly at ambient conditions. In this chapter, we discuss and compare various nanofullerene materials proposed theoretically as storage medium for hydrogen. Doping of transition elements leads to clustering which reduces the gravimetric density of hydrogen, while doping of alkali and alkali-earth metals on the nanocage materials, such as carborides, boronitride, and boron cages, were stabilized by the charger transfer from the dopant to the nanocage. Further, the alkali or alkali-earth elements exist with a charge, which are found to be responsible for the higher uptake of hydrogen, through a dipole- dipole and change-induced dipole interaction. The binding energies of hydrogen on these systems were found to be in the range of 0. 1 eV to 0. 2 eV, which are ideal for the practical applications in a reversible system...|$|R
