2500|$|Penn faced serious {{problems}} in the colonies due to his sloppy business practices. Apparently, {{he could not be}} bothered with administrative details, and his business manager, fellow Quaker Philip Ford, embezzled substantial sums from Penn's estates. Ford capitalised on Penn's habit of signing papers without reading them. One such paper {{turned out to be a}} deed transferring ownership of Pennsylvania to Ford who then demanded a rent beyond Penn's ability to pay. After Ford's death in 1702, his wife, Bridget, had Penn thrown in debtors' prison, but her cruelty backfired. It was unthinkable to have such a person govern a major colony, and in 1708 the Lord Chancellor ruled that [...] "the <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> still remained in William Penn and his heirs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{commercial}} practice the term [...] "debenture" [...] typically {{refers to the}} document that evidences a secured debt, although in law the definition may also cover unsecured debts (like any [...] "IOU"). The legal definition is relevant for certain tax statutes, so for instance in British India Steam Navigation Co v IRC Lindley J held that a simple [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] was a debenture, which meant that a paper on which directors promised to pay the holder £100 in 1882 and 5% interest each half year was enough, {{and as a result}} subject to pay duty under the Stamp Act 1870. The definition depends on the purpose of the statutory provision for which it is used. It matters because debenture holders have the right to company accounts and the director's report, because debenture holders must be recorded on a company register which other debenture holders may inspect, and when issued by a company, debentures are not subject to the rule against [...] "clogs on the equity of redemption". This old equitable rule was a form of common law consumer protection, which held that if a person contracted for a mortgage, they must always have the right to pay off the debt and get full title to their property back. The mortgage agreement could not be turned into a sale to the lender, and one could not contract for a perpetual period for interest repayments. However, because the rule limited on contractual freedom to protect borrowers with weaker bargaining power, it was thought to be inappropriate for companies. In Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd the House of Lords held that an agreement by New Patagonia to sell sheepskins exclusively to Kreglinger in return for a £10,000 loan secured by a floating charge would persist for five years even after the principal sum was repaid. The contract to keep buying exclusively was construed to not be a clog on redeeming autonomy from the loan because the rule's purpose was to preclude unconscionable bargains. Subsequently, the clog on the <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> rule as a whole was abolished by what is now section 739 of the Companies Act 2006. In Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne the House of Lords applied this so that when Knightsbridge took a secured loan of £310,000 from Mr Byrne and contracted to repay interest over 40 years, Knightsbridge could not then argue that the contract should be void. The deal created a debenture under the Act, and so this rule of equity was not applied.|$|E

6000|$|Alas, by {{this time}} the gallant islanders had been driven out of Rousseau's mind by {{personal}} mishaps. First, Voltaire or some other enemy had spread the rumour that the invitation to become the Lycurgus of Corsica was a practical joke, and Rousseau's suspicious temper found what he took for confirmation of this in some trifling incidents with which we certainly need not concern ourselves.[158] Next, a very real storm had burst upon him which drove him once more to seek a new place of shelter, other than an island occupied by French troops. For France having begun by despatching auxiliaries to the assistance of the Genoese (1764), ended by buying the island from the Genoese senate, with a sort of <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> (1768)--an iniquitous transaction, as Rousseau justly called it, equally shocking to justice, humanity, reason, and policy.[159] Civilisation would have been saved one of its sorest trials if Genoa could have availed herself of her equity, and so have delivered France from the acquisition of the most terrible citizen that ever scourged a state.[160] ...|$|E

50|$|Usually {{a lender}} obtains a {{security}} interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset {{like a house}} to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults and the lender tries to repossess the property, courts <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> can grant the borrower the equitable right <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> if the borrower repays the debt. While this equitable right exists, it is a cloud on title and the lender cannot {{be sure that they}} can repossess the property. Therefore, through the process of foreclosure, the lender seeks to foreclose (in plain English, immediately terminate) the equitable right <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> and take both legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple. Other lien holders can also foreclose the owner's right <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> for other debts, such as for overdue taxes, unpaid contractors' bills or overdue homeowners' association dues or assessments.|$|R

5000|$|Historically the <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> would {{naturally}} expire {{upon the}} mortgagor breaching {{the terms of}} repayment. However, in modern times, extinguishing the <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> (and leaving the mortgagee with absolute title to the property) ordinarily requires a court order in most jurisdictions. For both legal and practical reasons, the use of foreclosure as a remedy has fallen into disuse. [...] Even where a mortgagee seeks an order for foreclosure from the courts, the courts will frequently order judicial sale of the property instead.|$|E
