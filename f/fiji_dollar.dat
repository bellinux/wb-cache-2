As a result, GDP fell 2 Â¾ percent in 2000, {{and the current}} account deficit widened to 6 Â½ percent of GDP. Financial stability and the basket peg of the <b>Fiji</b> <b>dollar</b> were maintained through tightening of domestic monetary policy and exchange controls, together with government spending cuts to offset the impact of weaker growth on the fiscal deficit.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{provides}} screenshots {{of the financial}} models of the five mixed-species agroforestry (MSA) models selected and described in Working Paper 8, together with notes to explain the structure and interpretation of these models. The Microsoft Excel workbook for each MSA system consists {{of a set of}} spreadsheets, including a first or summary sheet and a sheet for each individual species module. For each MSA system, the summary sheet contains the key parameter values of the system, and these are referenced by the spreadsheets for individual species. Conversely, the summary sheet for each system references the cash flow sequences for each individual species module to compile a summary of financial performance for the overall agroforestry system. Each species module is for a standard area unit of 1 ha, and all use a discount rate of 8 %. Estimates of annual capital outlays, operating costs and revenue generated are presented for each individual species, to derive the annual net cash flows. Annual labour requirements are also estimated. The currency units are those for the country to which the MSA is best suited (<b>Fiji</b> <b>dollars</b> or Vanuatu vatu). In the summary sheet, the overall net present value (NPV) is computed for each species mixture. Sensitivity analysis, breakeven analysis and scenario analysis (where optimistic or pessimistic values for all parameters are considered simultaneously) are demonstrated. Notably, these have not been performed for individual tree and crop species, the financial analyses being designed to evaluate overall agroforestry systems, not individual components of them. Because the overall rotation length varies between MSA systems, the financial performance of all systems is compared on the basis of site value or land expectation value (LEV) (the sum of NPVs for a perpetual rotation). It is found that given the parameter values and other assumptions of the analyses, all the selected species mixtures would generate positive returns. NPV estimates per hectare for the five MSA systems in local currencies (<b>Fiji</b> <b>dollars</b> and Vanuatu Vatu) and Australian dollars are summarised in the following table. MSA species mixtures 2, 4 and 5 have very similar LEVs, considerably lower than those for mixtures 1 (dominated by mango) and 3 (dominated by sandalwood) ...|$|R
50|$|Australia donated {{approximately}} three million Australian Dollars to the Relief fund. This {{was made up}} of $1,000,000 (US$500,000) for immediate assistance and 2,000,000 (US$1,000,000) for long-term assistance. AusAID also donated just under 390,000 FJD (200,000 USD) to assist with the repairs to school infrastructure and the provision of resources to flood-affected schools. New Zealand also donated near four million New Zealand dollars to the relief fund. This {{was made up of}} 3 million dollars for long term recovery and 80,000 for the educational needs of people in the areas that were hardest hit by the depression. The European Union also donated over $2 million <b>Fiji</b> <b>dollars</b> (FJD), (One million USD), which was also for rehabilitation of schools as well as paying of some of the fees that students are required to pay. The Governments of the United Kingdom, China, France, Tonga, Korea and Samoa each contributed money to the relief fund totaling up to 286,000 FJD (152,000 USD). Whilst the governments of Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, and India pledged over $700,000 USD to the relief effort and for reconstruction efforts. The Us Embassy and the China Red Cross also donated just under 120,000FJD worth of goods for relief efforts.|$|R

40|$|This paper brings {{together}} {{many of the}} considerations on multi-species agroforestry (MSA) examined in the above working papers. The complexities in designing MSA mixtures for particular settings are examined. Some parallels and differences are drawn between designs of mixed-species plantation systems that were adopted for rainforest cabinet timbers in tropical north Queensland and MSA systems for ACIAR project focus locations in Fiji and Vanuatu. It is demonstrated that for various reasons the design and financial analysis of MSA systems are much more complex than for mixed-species timber plantations; various biophysical and socioeconomic factors {{must be taken into}} consideration in designing coherent mixtures. In developing MSA system financial models for Fiji and Vanuatu, considerable effort was required to carry out species–site matching for priority tree species, determine technical aspects (such as site amelioration, species compatability, shading requirements and equipment needed), examine labour requirements and cash flows over time, and sketch field layout diagrams for species mixtures including the pattern of intercropping and how this would change over time. Finally, five MSA models which have a relatively high likelihood of being successful in Fiji and Vanuatu according to biological and financial criteria were identified and their rationales described. Detailed financial performance estimates for these models are provided in Working Paper 9 (Screenshots of multi-species financial models and explanatory notes). Also, financial performance has been estimated for eight priority tree and crop species not included in the MSA models, but available as modules for further agroforestry system designs. A table of financial performance for these eight species and interpretation of the findings is provided in Appendix A of this working paper. Calculations have been made in <b>Fiji</b> <b>dollars</b> per hectare of planted area. These species and estimated net present values, and land expectation values as a better criterion for comparison of species, are as follows: whitewood $ 5, 418 ($ 6, 898), vesi –$ 2, 054 (–$ 2, 153), flueggia $ 1, 505 ($ 3, 614), Polynesian chestnut $ 11, 734 ($ 13, 028), tropical almond $ 5, 084 ($ 5, 645), avocado $ 48, 175 ($ 70, 353), banana $ 43, 337 ($ 163, 556) and taro $ 20, 160 ($ 97, 785). The latter two species have particularly high labour requirements...|$|R
50|$|From its {{earliest}} {{days as a}} British colony, British sterling coinage circulated in Fiji, supplemented by locally produced paper money. In 1917, as a wartime emergency measure, the Fijian treasury issued paper money for Fiji in lieu of British gold sovereigns. During the great depression of the 1930s, Australian and New Zealand banks devalued the pound in their respective territories in order to bolster their exports to the UK. These same banks controlled the exchange rate for Fiji, and in 1933 the Fiji pound was devalued to £1.2.2 Fijian = £1 Sterling {{in order to bring}} it into line with the devalued New Zealand pound, even though the New Zealand pound would very shortly devalue further to bring it into line with the devalued Australian pound. At the outbreak of the second world war in 1939, the sterling area was set up as an exchange control area for the purposes of protecting the external value of the pound sterling, principally against the US <b>dollar.</b> <b>Fiji</b> immediately joined the sterling area.|$|R
