40|$|This paper studies how firms reorganize {{following}} diversification, {{proposing that}} firms use outsourcing, or vertical disintegration, to manage <b>diseconomies</b> of scope. We {{also consider the}} origins of scope <b>diseconomies,</b> showing how different underlying mechanisms generate contrasting predictions about the link between within-firm task heterogeneity and the incentive to outsource following diversification. We test these propositions using microdata on taxicab and limousine fleets from the Economic Census. The results show that taxicab firms outsource, by shifting the composition of their fleets toward owner-operator drivers, when they diversify into the limousine business. The magnitude of the shift toward driver ownership is larger in less urban markets, where the tasks performed by taxicab and limousine drivers are more similar. These findings suggest that (1) firms use outsourcing to manage <b>diseconomies</b> of scope at a particular point in the value chain and (2) interagent conflicts {{can be an important}} source of scope <b>diseconomies.</b> diversification, <b>diseconomies</b> of scope, adaptation, outsourcing, asset ownership...|$|R

The retailer may benefit from a larger production <b>diseconomy,</b> which is not possible without information contracting. Information contracting always benefits the retailer, and the benefit is larger when she offers contracts sequentially rather than simultaneously to the manufacturers. Information contracting benefits the manufacturers only when they offer the contracts and production <b>diseconomy</b> is large.

40|$|The {{research}} tests Oliver Williamson’s {{proposition that}} transaction cost economics {{can explain the}} limits of firm size. Williamson suggests that <b>diseconomies</b> of scale are manifested through four interrelated factors: atmospheric consequences due to specialisation, bureaucratic insularity, incentive limits of the employment relation and communication distortion due to bounded rationality. Furthermore, Williamson argues that <b>diseconomies</b> of scale are counteracted by economies of scale and can be moderated by adoption of the multidivisional organisation form and by high internal asset specificity. Combined, these influences tend to cancel out and thus {{there is not a}} strong, directly observable, relationship between a large firm’s size and performance. A review of the relevant literature, including transaction cost economics, sociological studies of bureaucracy, information-processing perspectives on the firm, agency theory, and studies of incentives and motivation within firms, as well as empirical studies of trends in firm size and industry concentration, corroborates Williamson’s theoretical framework and translates it into five hypotheses: (1) Bureaucratic failure, in the form of atmospheric consequences, bureaucratic insularity, incentive limits and communication distortion, increases with firm size; (2) Large firms exhibit economies of scale; (3) <b>Diseconomies</b> of scale from bureaucratic failure {{have a negative impact on}} firm performance; (4) Economies of scale increase the relative profitability of large firms over smaller firms; and (5) <b>Diseconomies</b> of scale are moderated by two transaction cost-related factors: organisation form and asset specificity. The hypotheses are tested by applying structural equation models to primary and secondary cross-sectional data from 784 large U. S. manufacturing firms. The statistical analyses confirm the hypotheses. Thus, <b>diseconomies</b> of scale influence the growth and profitability of firms negatively, while economies of scale and the moderating factors have positive influences. This implies that executives and directors of large firms should pay attention to bureaucratic failure. bureaucratic failure, <b>diseconomies</b> of scale, transaction cost economics...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{efficiency and}} success of small firms in R&D remains largely unexplained. This paper empirically examines scale <b>diseconomies</b> in offering employment contracts as an explanation for <b>diseconomies</b> of scale in R&D. The paper argues that small firms more efficiently resolve the severe agency problems of hidden information and hidden behavior in R&D. Small firms more efficiently offer contracts that reward performance than large firms, and consequently, small firms attract and retain engineers with higher ability and skill. Further, small firms through these more performance-contingent contracts induce higher levels of effort than large firms. The study tests and generally confirms these hypotheses using data collected from 912 current and former engineering employees of two large high-technology companies. <b>diseconomies</b> of scale, compensation, job mobility, self-selection, agency theory, firm size and innovation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} efficiency structure hypothesis {{holds true for}} Japanese major commercial banks using a panel data set covering the period from fiscal year 1974 to 2001. The efficiency structure hypothesis has been hitherto mostly examined {{in comparison with the}} structure-conduct-performance (SCP) hypothesis in the framework that determines which of the two measurements - the degree of market concentration or market shares - better explains market performance such as profits and interest rates. In this paper, we point out some problems of this framework and examine the efficiency structure hypothesis in a more straightforward manner by focusing on the proposition that the more efficient a bank the more it grows. First, we estimated organizational inefficiencies and the <b>diseconomy</b> of scale for each major bank using the panel data set. Then, we examined how these estimates for a certain bank in a certain year affect the bank's size in the next year. The regression analysis, in which the organizational inefficiencies and the <b>diseconomy</b> of scale in the preceding fiscal year are linked to the reduced-form equation for bank loans, has found that organization inefficiencies adversely affect the amount of bank loans, just as expected. However, contrary to our expectation, the impact of the <b>diseconomy</b> of scale vis-a-vis bank loans {{has turned out to be}} positive. Meanwhile, we have found that both organizational inefficiencies and the <b>diseconomy</b> of scale have a negative impact on the amount of bank assets, which is consistent with the efficiency structure hypothesis. ...|$|E

40|$|The cost of {{wind energy}} is a {{function}} of turbine size. Economies of scale are offset by a fundamental mass-driven <b>diseconomy,</b> resulting in an optimum point. The <b>diseconomy</b> is very dependent on turbine design, while the economies of scale are relatively independent. As a result a low-mass design will reach its optimum at a larger scale than a heavier design. With heavy designs achieving cost-reductions by scaling up to around 750 kW rating and larger, a low-mass design should achieve its optimum at 1000 kW or more. This paper illustrates this potential using the example of the two-bladed Windflow 500 design.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{incentive}} for vertical information sharing in competing supply chains with production technologies that exhibit diseconomies of scale. We consider a model of two supply chains each consisting of one manufacturer selling to one retailer, with the retailers engaging in Cournot competition. The problem is analyzed using a multi-stage game. We fully characterize the information sharing, wholesale pricing and retail quantity decisions in equilibrium and show that information sharing benefits a supply chain when the production <b>diseconomy</b> is large, competition is less intense, and the information is less accurate. When a supply chain makes its information more accurate or production more efficient, it may be worse off if such an improvement induces the firms in the rival supply chain to stop sharing information. We also consider the model with Bertrand competition. When there is no production <b>diseconomy,</b> information sharing benefits a supply chain when competition is intense and the information is accurate. When there is production <b>diseconomy,</b> a manufacturer may be worse off by receiving information. Our results show that information sharing in one supply chain triggers a competitive reaction from the other that is negative under Cournot competition but may be positive under Bertrand competition. 1...|$|E
