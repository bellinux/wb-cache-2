40|$|OBJECTIVE: It is {{not well}} known which {{exercise}} intensity is needed to obtain blood pressure reductions in response to endurance training. We therefore compared the effect of training at lower and <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> on blood pressure, and, in addition on other cardiovascular risk factors, in at least 55 -year-old sedentary men and women. METHODS: We used a randomized crossover design comprising three 10 -week periods. In {{the first and third}} periods, participants exercised at, respectively, lower and <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> (33 and 66 % of heart rate reserve) in random order, with a sedentary period in between. Training programmes were identical except for intensity and were performed three times, 1 h per week. Thirty-nine (18 men) out of 48 randomized participants completed the study; age averaged 59 years. RESULTS: The change of aerobic power from baseline to the end of each period was more pronounced (P < 0. 05) with <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> (+ 3. 70 ml/kg min; P < 0. 001) than with lower intensity training (+ 2. 31 ml/kg min; P < 0. 001). Systolic blood pressures at rest and during submaximal exercise were reduced with both intensities (P < 0. 01), whereas diastolic office blood pressure was significantly reduced after <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> only (P < 0. 01). There {{were no significant differences in}} blood pressure reduction between intensities. Ambulatory blood pressure remained unchanged after training. Only <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> training reduced weight (- 1. 09 kg; P < 0. 001), body fat (- 0. 85 %; P < 0. 001), plasma triglycerides (- 0. 17 mmol/l; P < 0. 05) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (- 5. 92 U/l; P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: <b>Higher</b> and lower <b>intensity</b> training reduces systolic office and exercise blood pressure to a similar extent, but does not alter ambulatory blood pressure; only <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> training favourably affects anthropometric characteristics and blood lipids. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening {{throughout the}} day on August6, Felicia leveled out with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a 23mi (37km) wide eye as the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, which would allow Felicia to maintain a <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> over marginally warm waters. Early the next day, {{the structure of the}} hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly. This marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal Category 3 hurricane. Several hours later, the mid-level circulation began to separate from the low-level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased. By this time, the storm began to take a long-anticipated westward turn towards Hawaii. After briefly re-intensifying on August7, Felicia weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on August8. Around 11:00am HST (2100UTC), the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) took over responsibility of issuing advisories as Felicia crossed longitude 140°W.|$|E

5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> fire.|$|E
5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by <b>high</b> <b>intensity,</b> low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E

In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman's win raising nationalist tensions further. The Serbs in Croatia, intent on achieving independence from Croatia, left the Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). As tensions rose, Croatia declared independence in June 1991; however the declaration came into effect on 8 October 1991.
