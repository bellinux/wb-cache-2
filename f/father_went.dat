5|$|Although {{he shared}} {{interests}} in both philanthropy and military affairs with his father, they eventually had a falling out while Johnston {{served as a}} State Assemblyman, and was bitterly opposed by his father in {{a vote on the}} 1889 World's Fair Bill. The feud became so heated that while Johnston was Mayor of Tivoli, his father, who owned the building where the town government met, barred his son from entering the building. The village government was forced to move to another building and remained there until 1894, when they finally returned to de Peyster's building. Another incident occurred and was reported in the press when Johnston's mother fell ill, and he visited her at the de Peyster family home and was violently assaulted by his father. The <b>father</b> <b>went</b> so far as to run against his son for Mayor of Tivoli in 1900, but was defeated in the general election.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his <b>father</b> <b>went</b> to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E
