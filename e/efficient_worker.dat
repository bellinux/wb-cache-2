2500|$|A Working Kelpie {{can be a}} {{cheap and}} <b>efficient</b> <b>worker</b> that can save farmers and graziers the cost of several hands when {{mustering}} livestock. The good working Kelpies are herding dogs that will prevent stock from {{moving away from the}} stockman. This natural instinct is crucial when mustering stock in isolated gorge country, where a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock (usually cattle) until the rider appears. The preferred dogs for cattle work are Kelpies, often of a special line, or a Kelpie cross. [...] They will drive a mob of livestock long distances in extremes of climates and conditions. Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. They will work sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock. The Kelpie's signature move is to jump on the backs of sheep and walk across the tops of the sheep to reach the other side and break up the jam. A good working Kelpie is a versatile dogthey can work all day on the farm, ranch, or station, and trial on the weekends. Kelpies compete and are exhibited in livestock working trials, ranging from yards or arenas to large open fields working sheep, goats, cattle, or ducks.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "efficiency-wages" [...] (or rather [...] "efficiency-earnings") {{has been}} {{introduced}} by Alfred Marshall to denote the wage per efficiency unit of labor.

60|$|Here, then, we {{have the}} {{construction}} of the Abyss and the shambles. Throughout the whole industrial fabric a constant elimination is going on. The inefficient are weeded out and flung downward. Various things constitute inefficiency. The engineer who is irregular or irresponsible will sink down until he finds his place, say as a casual labourer, an occupation irregular in its very nature and in which {{there is little or no}} responsibility. Those who are slow and clumsy, who suffer from weakness of body or mind, or who lack nervous, mental, and physical stamina, must sink down, sometimes rapidly, sometimes step by step, to the bottom. Accident, by disabling an <b>efficient</b> <b>worker,</b> will make him inefficient, and down he must go. And the worker who becomes aged, with failing energy and numbing brain, must begin the frightful descent which knows no stopping-place short of the bottom and death.|$|E

40|$|Scapegoating {{is often}} {{said to be a}} source of {{inefficiency}} in organizations. In this paper, I analyze the consequences of scapegoating within a firm in a model where reputation concerns drive the actions of superiors. Consider delegation choices, for example. Hiring <b>efficient</b> <b>workers</b> may be a good idea if successful production is the only way to build reputation. But if successful scapegoating also increases reputation, superiors will tend to hire less <b>efficient</b> <b>workers</b> and will eventually blame them for failures. I characterize scapegoating as an activity "nested" after failures. Even though the results of scapegoating do not affect welfare directly, they do so indirectly through the decisions governing the probability of success in production. We examine how activities "nested" after good results may increase efficiency without relying on costly incentives and why superiors tend to hire better workers during good times. Productivity...|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps {{the seminal}} case in prefrontal cortex {{function}} {{is that of}} Phineas Gage, whose left frontal lobe was destroyed when a large iron rod was driven through his head in an 1848 accident. The standard presentation (e.g.) is that, although Gage retained normal memory, speech and motor skills, his personality changed radically: He became irritable, quick-tempered, and impatient—characteristics he did not previously display — so that friends described him as [...] "no longer Gage"; and, whereas he had previously been a capable and <b>efficient</b> <b>worker,</b> afterward {{he was unable to}} complete tasks. However, careful analysis of primary evidence shows that descriptions of Gage's psychological changes are usually exaggerated when held against the description given by Gage's doctor, the most striking feature being that changes described years after Gage's death are far more dramatic than anything reported while he was alive.|$|E

At the age of 13 Krumins had to start working, as a {{collector}} of tree resin. Very soon, he became an <b>efficient</b> <b>worker,</b> partly because his height (he was 2m tall by the age 14) allowed him to reach where others failed.

As a well-built giant, Krumins attracted attention of many coaches who tried to bring him to wrestling, boxing and athletics. Famous Soviet athletics coach Victor Alexeev even brought him for a month to an athletics training camp. All attempts failed because of lack of interest from Krumins.|$|E

We can also find that the running time of the uniform distribution is larger than that of the normal distribution, and a possible reason is that the number of edges with low weight in the normal distribution is larger than that in the uniform distribution.

40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} crowdsourcing for {{commercial and industrial}} purposes rises the need for creating sophisticated mechanisms in crowd-based digital platforms for <b>efficient</b> <b>worker</b> management. One of the main challenges {{in this area is}} worker motivation and skill set control {{and its impact on the}} output quality. The quality delivered by the workers in the crowd depends on different aspects such as their skills, experience, commitment, etc. The lack of generic and detailed proposals to incentive workers and the need for creating ad-hoc solutions depending on the domain make it difficult to evaluate the best rewarding functions in each scenario. In this paper, we make a step further in this direction and propose the use of aggregation functions to evaluate the professional skills of crowd-workers based on the quality of their past tasks. Addi-tionally, we present a real industrial crowdsourcing solution for software localisation in which the proposed solutions are put into practice with real text translations quality measures.

30|$|The Polish {{labor market}} in early {{transition}} was inhibited {{by the lack}} of inter-regional worker and job flows and intra-region differences in the pace of employment restructuring. Yet, these legacies of planning have allowed this research to study the importance of regional labor demand dynamics on earnings, as outlined in Aghion and Blanchard (1994), in an environment far less complex than that observed in mature market economies. While individual characteristics are clearly important for determining labor force participation rates and where one is on the wage distribution within regions, differences in mean wage across regions are clearly dictated by the pace of regional employment restructuring. In other words, differences in expected pay across regions are explained more by the pace of structural change in labor demand and less by labor supply considerations. It is found that structural change in employment has a first order effect on wages in a labor market in early transition. The importance of an unemployment benefits and good infrastructure for the private sector cannot be underestimated for an <b>efficient</b> <b>worker</b> reallocation path.|$|E
40|$|Workers of most eusocial Hymenoptera {{can produce}} sons but rarely {{do so in}} the {{presence}} of the queen, despite the potentially high fitness payoff of direct reproduction. It has often been suggested that col-ony-level productivity costs may outweigh the fitness advantages of worker reproduction, but this has never been shown. We estimated these costs in two ant species with large complex societies, the leafcutter ants Acromyrmex echinatior and Acromyrmex octospinosus, by splitting 16 laboratory colonies and comparing the dynamics of the fungus garden volume between orphaned and queenright nests (with and without laying workers, respectively). Apart from fungus volume as a longitudinal measure of colony productivity, we estimated sex allocation, the timing of the switch between raising queen offspring and worker sons, and differences in body mass between queen and worker sons. We showed that orphaned nests give pri-ority to raising dispersing queen-derived sexuals (virgin queens, haploid and diploid queen sons) over rais-ing worker sons. Worker sons could be heavier than, equally heavy as, or lighter than queen sons, depending on the condition of the colony. The reduction in colony productivity of orphaned nests com-pared to their queenright counterparts was negligible (1. 2 %), at least during the first 9 weeks after queen loss when these costs could be estimated. Such low costs could only outweigh the benefit of worker laying if the survival of worker sons is low, for example if workers show <b>efficient</b> <b>worker</b> policing, or discriminate against all male brood outside the brief reproductive season...|$|E
