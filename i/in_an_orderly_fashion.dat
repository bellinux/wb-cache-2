25|$|Takenaga's troops {{managed to}} shake off pursuit by the Australians, but decided that they would surrender. They took a leaflet {{containing}} a notice of surrender {{that one of the}} soldiers had been carrying, added some conditions underneath in English, tied it to a pole for the Australians to find, and left the area. Scouts from Miles' platoon then found the leaflet and brought it back with them. On 2 May, the Australian platoon spotted Takenaga's unit near Womgrer village, and asked a native to help them make contact. Two truce bearers from the Japanese side came to the Australians to negotiate, and on the following day Takenaga's unit surrendered at Womgrer and were disarmed. At the time of surrender, Takenaga's unit consisted of 42 men: 5 officers (including Takenaga), 4 warrant officers, and 33 non-commissioned officers and soldiers.

25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} tested these {{hypotheses}} {{and some have}} led to significant discoveries. In The Frozen Echo, Kirsten Seaver contests {{some of the more}} generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or Vinland. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack. The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> <b>fashion,</b> with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. Middens at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. Else Roesdahl argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.|$|E

25|$|On 9 April 1940 Nazi Germany invaded Norway, {{capturing}} ports {{along the}} Norwegian coast from Oslo to Narvik. The main field artillery {{piece of the}} Norwegian Army that faced the invasion forces was the Ehrhardt Model 1901. During the two months of fighting in the Norwegian Campaign that followed the Norwegian field artillery arm suffered greatly from organizational difficulties. The difficulties originated {{in part from the}} fact that very few artillery pieces had been mobilized during the seven months of neutrality that preceded the invasion. The units that had been activated to guard Norwegian neutrality had been equipped mainly with rifles and light and heavy machine guns. In the confusion and chaos that followed the German invasion most Norwegian units were only mobilized on an improvised basis, with limited supplies and little time to get properly organized before going into battle with the Germans. Only in Northern and Western Norway did the units (the 6th Division in Northern Norway and the 4th Brigade in Western Norway) have time to mobilize <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> <b>fashion.</b> Due to the complete lack of dedicated anti-tank guns in the Norwegian Army, Model 1901s were pressed into service in an improvised anti-tank role during the fighting in Eastern Norway. The field guns were used in direct fire mode at close range against German Panzers. All 12 of the Model 1901 field guns that had been converted to motorized transport were deployed to Northern Norway at the outbreak of war, with four in Troms County and eight in the eastern parts of Finnmark. Seven of these guns saw action on the Narvik front, supporting the Norwegian counter-offensive against Eduard Dietl's Gebirgsjägers.|$|E

500|$|Aileen Fyfe, a {{historian}} {{interested in the}} relationship between science and religion, has argued that Trimmer's text, although inspired by Barbauld's books, differs dramatically from Barbauld's in its religious orientation. Barbauld was a Dissenter and more inclined, according to Fyfe, to [...] "encourage curiosity, observation, and reasoning". In contrast, Trimmer, as a high church Anglican, depicted nature as [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] and as a reflection not only of God's divinity but also of his goodness. These beliefs are reflected even {{in the structure of the}} text; Trimmer's aim was to convey a sense of the awe, therefore her text does not progress <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>orderly</b> <b>fashion</b> through a study of the natural world. Barbauld's texts, however, emphasize the slow accumulation of knowledge as well as logical thinking. Thus Evenings at Home, which she co-wrote with her brother, John Aikin, has a [...] "systematic structure". Another difference between the two writers lies in the role of authority: whereas Barbauld's texts and those she wrote with her brother, emphasize dialogues between teacher and pupil, Trimmer's textual conversations, Fyfe notes, were [...] "controlled by the parent".|$|E
