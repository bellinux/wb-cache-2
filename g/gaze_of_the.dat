The body was burned to ashes; but for many days, the head, that hive of subtlety, fixed on a pole in the Plaza, met, unabashed, the <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whites; and across the Plaza looked towards St. Bartholomew's church, in whose vaults slept then, as now, the {{recovered}} bones of Aranda: and across the Rimac bridge looked towards the monastery, on Mount Agonia without; where, three months after being dismissed by the court, Benito Cereno, borne on the bier, did, indeed, follow his leader.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{art critic}} Leo Steinberg {{in his essay}} The Philosophical Brothel posited a wholly {{different}} explanation for {{the wide range of}} stylistic attributes. Using the earlier sketches—which had been ignored by most critics—he argued that far from evidence of an artist undergoing a rapid stylistic metamorphosis, the variety of styles can be read as a deliberate attempt, a careful plan, to capture the <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viewer. He notes that the five women all seem eerily disconnected, indeed wholly unaware of each other. Rather, they focus solely on the viewer, their divergent styles only furthering the intensity of their glare.|$|E

30|$|The {{experiment}} utilized a 2 (teacher {{gesture to}} graphs: yes or no)[*]×[*] 2 (teacher gesture to equations: yes or no) design which yielded four lesson conditions: no gesture, gesture to equations only, gesture to graphs only, or gesture to both equations and graphs. In all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions, the teacher <b>gazed</b> to elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual representations when she mentioned them; her gaze was scripted {{and did not}} vary across conditions. In the no-gesture condition, the teacher did not produce any hand gestures to the visual representations; however, she did <b>gaze</b> to elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphs and equations when she spoke about them. In the gesture-to-graphs-only condition, the teacher pointed (and <b>gazed)</b> to elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphs when she mentioned them during the lesson, {{but she did not}} point to the equations. Thus, she pointed and <b>gazed</b> to elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphs, but only <b>gazed</b> to elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equations. In the gesture-to-equations-only condition, the teacher gestured to elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equations when she mentioned them during the lesson, but did not point to the graphs.

The film describes the connection between the Corfu Gorgon at the Artemis Temple of Corfu and Kaiser Wilhelm II. Harrison concludes his 1992 film-poem by making a proposal that in the 1994 European Union summit in Corfu, Heine's statue be returned to Corfu on time to preside over the new Europe so that EU can keep its eyes open and not turn to stone from the Gorgon's gaze.|$|E
25|$|The image {{can be read}} as a petrified {{synthesis}} of all the stages during and after the Descent from the Cross: the lowering of the corpse, the Deposition, Lamentation and the Entombment. Christ's feet appear to be still nailed together, while the spread of His arms retains the position of His body on the Cross. Christ's body is shown as if held out for the concentrated <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viewer. Joseph of Arimathea looks across the body towards the skull of Adam. Joseph appears as a sumptuously dressed burgher and has the most portrait-like appearance of the figures in the painting; his gaze links the hands of Christ and his mother, the new Adam and Eve, with the skull of Adam. Thereby visualising the essence of the Redemption.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child on his future to meet the <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E

500|$|The Netherlandish artists {{moved away}} from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more {{engaging}} three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 Portrait of a Man is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer. [...] Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits {{or in the case of}} potential betrothals, when the object of the work is to make the sitter as attractive as possible. In these cases the sitter was often shown smiling, with an engaging and radiant expression designed to appeal to her intended.|$|E

Inside Madonna starts singing the song from the center of a carousel that revolves to display her to the <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> customers who are sitting safely in their cubicles.
