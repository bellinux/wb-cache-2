40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide a {{systematic}} review of the studies on skipping breakfast among school children. Skipping breakfast among school children is mainly caused by delaying the time to go to bed, which, in turn, appears to be caused by two reasons. The first reason is shifting daily activities until late night. The second is disordered <b>eating</b> <b>habit.</b> The most important factor affecting the sleeping time and lifestyle of infants and children is the policy of their mother. The difference in lifestyle made by environmental differences has little influence on skipping breakfast directly, but it exerts some influence on living rhythm of children. Children dwelling in a big city tend to develop a night mode lifestyle and make the living schedule steady. Because of the fact that skipping breakfast among school children is strongly related to eating the meal alone, it is thought that mothers' attitude strongly influences their children's <b>eating</b> <b>habit.</b> On the other hand, the increased use of processed food suggests change in awareness of <b>eating</b> <b>habit</b> among Japanese. 朝食欠食について,系統的レビューを行った。朝食欠食に最も関連している項目として「就寝時刻の遅延化」が挙げられ,背景には「生活の夜型化」や「食習慣の乱れ」も関与している可能性が考えられる。幼児・児童の「就寝時刻」および「生活習濱」に最も影響を与えている要因は「母親の生活信条」であった。「生活環境による生活習慣の違い」による朝食欠食率の差は見られなかったが「生活リズム」に違いが見られ,大都市の児童は「夜型」であるが「生活が規則的」であった。朝食欠食には「個食(もしくは孤食) 」が強く関連していることから,保護者(特に母親) の影響が大きいことがわかった。また,調理済み食品の使用金額および使用頻度も増加していることから,児童・生徒の保護者を含めた日本人全体の食に対する意識の低下がうかがえる...|$|R

5|$|Pallid {{sturgeon}} {{are generally}} bottom feeders, skimming the sandy {{reaches of the}} various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though {{little is known about}} the precise <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as cyprinids (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% of the wet weight was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.|$|E

Children were given one tablespoon of minced meat and a tablet of calcium daily for as long as the child takes to quit the soil eating This course of treatment was proven to be fairly effective. The reason forthis success was the fact that the cause behind soil eating is the body’s requirement forcertain nutrients (e. g. Anemicpeople have been reported to have such a habit, cause being iron deficiency) and soil or clay has all these nutrients, i. e. iron, calcium, zinc, proteins, vitamins etc. and so this need can also be fulfilled through a diet of meat and additional administration of calcium.
