This type of device failure {{is one of}} the dominant sources of yield loss in MEMS. This paper reviews the physical mechanisms responsible for the failure from both the theoretical and practical stand point. In general, the failure requires two different phenomena. First (a) the device must be subject to a force sufficiently strong to collapse the <b>elastic</b> <b>member</b> thus bringing it in contact with the substrate. (b) After contact is established and the force removed, the intersolid adhesion must exceed the <b>elastic</b> <b>member</b> restoring force hence keeping the device permanently pinned to the substrate. Both of these problems develop during the device fabrication as well as during the device operation.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} {{by the need to}} develop low cost, wireless velocity sensors for hydraulic research and application in streams. A velocity bend sensor (VBS) is a flexible plastic polyimide substrate sheet with an electronic resistor connected to a voltage divider. Drag of a moving fluid bends the sensor, changes the electronic resistance, and produces a voltage drop that can be related to the time-averaged freestream velocity of the fluid. VBSs were tested in a recirculating hydraulic flume with a gravel bed. The VBSs show transition from rigid to elastic bending with increasing freestream velocity, which can be described using dimensionless fluid and beam-bending properties. The relationship between stream velocity and voltage drop across the circuit is nonlinear. A semitheoretical approach to estimate time-averaged streamwise velocity from the voltage drop based on fluid drag, <b>elastic</b> <b>member</b> bending, and circuit principles is applied and shows good agreement with experimentally derived calibration curves. The triple decomposition theorem and spectral analysis are performed on VBS and acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) time series. Results show that the VBS captures low-frequency character-istics of macroturblence present within the turbulent open channel flow but is unable to measure smaller-scale characteristics of eddy shed-ding for these hydraulic conditions. Turbulent intensity calculated using VBS data is 12 % of that from the ADV attributed to the lack of detection of shedding-sized eddies. But, the linear fit between turbulent intensity from the VBS and ADV suggests that the VBS {{can be used as a}} proxy for more detailed turbulent measurements when applied in streams.

40|$|The {{presence}} of link flexibilities in multilink manipulators increases the system order {{by the number}} of modes retained when the assumed modes approach is taken or {{by the number of}} independent coordinates of a finite element description of the <b>elastic</b> <b>member.</b> The resulting model is a highly coupled nonlinear model of higher complexity than the rigid manipulator model. Such complex dynamics are ignored in non-model based controllers which are simpler and limited in performance compared to model based controllers. Recently, model based predictive controllers based on linear models have been shown to give performance improvements over non-model based controllers in plants with variable dead times and non-minimum phase effects. When the plant is highly nonlinear, it can be advantageous to consider a nonlinear model such as the multilayer perceptron (MLP) network that can approximate to arbitrary precision the nonlinearities over an operating range. Based on recursive long range predictions of the neural model, an input sequence that minimizes a cost function is approximated by a second order descent method. This is equivalent to a Backpropagation where the derivatives are calculated with respect to future control inputs rather than the network weights. The predictive control framework allows variations in model order, variable dead times and nonminimum phase effects in the plant. ^ The modeling part presents a derivation of the equations of motion based on finite element analysis that results in a more structured set of equations for the flexible link manipulator compared to previous derivations. The new set of equations preserves the structure of the rigid manipulator model but single terms corresponding to a rigid linkage are expanded into submatrices of a chosen dimension when link flexibilities are introduced. Furthermore, the new dynamic equations satisfy the passivity properties needed for many nonlinear adaptive control schemes. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years, {{regional}} trade agreements have proliferated. These have usually taken the form of customs unions (CUs) or free trade areas (FTAs). This thesis concentrates mostly on the formation and behaviour of CUs. Union members levy a common external tariff (CET) on non-members. Existing theoretical models, however, do not agree on how the CET rate is chosen. Every model imposes a different choice rule exogenously. In this thesis, for the first time, plausible choice rules, based on the CU's social welfare function, are derived endogenously. The strategic behaviour of members and non-members, reveals that responsibility for CET choice tends to be assumed by the member that can induce {{the rest of the}} world to levy those tariffs members prefer to face. Relatively few general results exist describing the relationship between country characteristics and trade bloc formation. Here, new light is shed on this issue, by systematically analysing bloc formation in an asymmetric world, and investigating the role of preferences in coalition formation. It is found that global free trade is most likely to arise when all countries are similar. Customs unions tend to form between relatively well-endowed countries or those with similar preferences. It is also demonstrated that CUs will usually Pareto dominate FTAs, except where preferences differ significantly. The role of transfers in CU formation has received relatively little attention in the regionalism literature. In this thesis, optimal intra-union transfers are introduced and their impact on CET choice is investigated. The impact of transfers on CU behaviour depends on the direction of the transfer. When the relatively inelastic member is the recipient, the CU responds less aggressively to non-member tariff choices than it does when transfers are not permitted. However, if the relatively <b>elastic</b> <b>member</b> is the transfer recipient, the union's aggression increases. Moreover, when one union member exercises a similar degree of control over both CET and transfer choice, then the equilibrium CET tends to be lower than in the corresponding no-transfers situation...|$|E
40|$|A typical {{continuous}} web-processing machine {{consists of}} hundreds of idle rollers and web spans. A web span is formed by tensioning a thin film (the web) over at least two idle rollers. Machine drive controls, bearing friction, and air impingement on the web surface represent some {{of the factors that}} can influence web tension and web speed. A significant effort is devoted to maintaining uniform web tension and web speed in these machines. The uniformity of these parameters is a requirement to consistently manufacture web products within rigorous quality specifications. In support of this effort to control web tension and web speed, reports have been published to investigate the vibration response of the web-idle roller system. The machine is modeled as a multidegree-of-freedom system consisting of numerous springs and masses connected in series. The equivalent spring and mass elements are represented by the web span and roller inertia respectively. The scope of this investigation is limited to the analysis of the axial vibration of a single web span and idle roller interface. The two main objectives of this work are to characterize the axial vibration response of a single web span and numerically determine axial displacements of the web. A correlation is made between the axial displacement (less than 0. 05 inch) of the web relative to the surface of an idle roller and small scratches (0. 005 - 0. 010 inch long) formed {{on the surface of the}} web. The web is assumed to be an <b>elastic</b> <b>member</b> subject to tensile forces only. The one-dimensional wave equation is shown to be the governing equation of motion for the web-idle roller system. Boundary conditions are developed to accommodate the web-idle roller interface at one end of the web and the input tension force at the opposite end. A simplifying assumption of the model is that the average web speed is zero. The effect of zero average web speed is assumed to be small because the wave speed is nearly 1000 times greater than the typical average web conveyance speed of 250 feet per minute. Three solution methods have been presented for the wave equation (Separation of Variables, Laplace Transform combined with Inverse Fast Fourier Transform, and Galerkin Finite Element).

Also the dependence of fluid concentration on the viscosity in the channel is studied. The results are analyzed. Transition of fluid behavior from non-Newtonian shear thickening to non-Newtonian shear thinning is observed when the RBC concentration varies from 5. 5 × 106 to 5. 5 × 107 cells/ml in the channel.

In the simulation part, interaction behavior of biomolecule DNA is studied in the channel containing biofluid which is characterized in the experimental part. Cell free DNAs are common problem in infectious disease detection. Based on the assumptions of the WLC model, DNA strand is assumed as a one dimensional <b>elastic</b> <b>member</b> with its one end fixed at the channel wall and the other end free to move in the fluid. Bent and straight DNAs are considered for the study. Multiple scales are involved in this problem which is not fully understood.

Numerical simulations are carried out for the multiphysics problem of DNA in the fluid using a coupled multiphysics finite element scheme and the results are obtained.

It is found that when the channel width increases the tip displacement of DNA decreases. It was observed that DNA tip displacement is more in the channel when its end-to-end length is approximately half the width of the channel.
