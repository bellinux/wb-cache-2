Several corrugated, nanocrystalline diamond stripping <b>foils</b> {{have been tested}} at SNS. Beyond about 300 C of injected charge, significant distortion and darkening of the <b>foils</b> is observed.

5|$|However, some {{researchers}} have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal.

5|$|Casino Royale {{takes place}} at the {{beginning}} of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill. The film's plot sees Bond becoming involved in an assignment to bankrupt terrorist financier Le Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game, after <b>foiling</b> an attack he arranged on a new aircraft being demonstrated at Miami International Airport; during the course of his assignment, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, a treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs for the game. The film is part of a story arc that continues in Quantum of Solace (2008), with explicit references to the characters and events being made in films set after the story, within Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015). Casting the film involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy surrounded Craig when he was selected to succeed Pierce Brosnan in October 2005. Location filming took place in the Czech Republic, the Bahamas, Italy and the United Kingdom with interior sets built at Barrandov Studios and Pinewood Studios; although part of the storyline is set in Montenegro, no filming took place there.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel technique for joining similar and dissimilar metal <b>foils,</b> namely micro clinching with cutting by laser shock forming. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted to study the deformation behavior of single layer material, during which many important process parameters were determined. The process window of the 1060 pure aluminum <b>foils</b> and annealed copper <b>foils</b> produced by micro clinching with cutting was analyzed. Moreover, similar material combination (annealed copper <b>foils)</b> and dissimilar material combination (1060 pure aluminum <b>foils</b> and 304 stainless steel <b>foils)</b> were successfully achieved. The effect of laser energy on the interlock and minimum thickness of upper <b>foils</b> was investigated. In addition, the mechanical strength of different material combinations joined by micro clinching with cutting was measured in single lap shearing tests. According to the achieved results, this novel technique is more suitable for material combinations where the upper <b>foil</b> is thicker than lower <b>foil.</b> With the increase of laser energy, the interlock increased while the minimum thickness of upper <b>foil</b> decreased gradually. The shear strength of 1060 pure aluminum <b>foils</b> and 304 stainless steel <b>foils</b> combination was three times as large as that of 1060 pure aluminum <b>foils</b> and annealed copper <b>foils</b> combination...|$|R

Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax <b>foiling</b> a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up.

40|$|<b>Foil</b> {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used for oil-free micro turbomachinery. One of the critical technical issues related to reliability of the <b>foil</b> bearings is a coating wear on the top <b>foil</b> and rotor during start/stops. Bearing cooling is also mandatory for certain applications because the <b>foil</b> bearings can generate significant amount of heat depending on operating conditions. Usually axial flow is used through {{the space between the}} top <b>foil</b> and bearing sleeve. In this thesis, a hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearing with external pressurization is introduced. The hybrid operation eliminates the coating wear during start-up/shut down, and also reduces drag torque during starts. Furthermore, this hybrid <b>foil</b> bearing does not need cooling system. An experimental test with a loaded bearing under hydrostatic mode demonstrates the high potential of hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearings. The load capacity of the hybrid <b>foil</b> bearing was measured at 20, 000 rpm, and compared with that of hydrodynamic <b>foil</b> bearing. The hybrid <b>foil</b> bearing has much higher load capacity than the hydrodynamic <b>foil</b> bearing. The starting torque was also measured and compared with hydrodynamic bearing. A simple analytical model to calculate top <b>foil</b> deflection under hydrostatic pressurization has been developed. Predictions via orbit simulations indicate the hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearings can have a much higher critical speed and onset speed of instability than the hydrodynamic counter part. Major benefits of the hybrid <b>foil</b> bearings also include very low starting torque, reduced wear of the top <b>foil</b> and rotor, and very effective cooling capability by the pressurized air itself. This new concept of hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearings are expected to be widely applied to the oil free turbomachinery industry, especially for heavily loaded and/or high temperature applications...|$|R
