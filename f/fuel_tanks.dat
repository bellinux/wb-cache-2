3000|$|The {{crashworthiness}} of helicopter <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> {{is vital}} to the survivability of the passengers and structures. In order to understand and improve the crashworthiness of the soft <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> of helicopter during the crash, this paper investigated the dynamic behavior of the nylon woven fabric composite <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> striking on the ground. A fluid–structure interaction finite element model of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> based on the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method was constructed to elucidate the dynamic failure behavior. The drop impact tests were conducted to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulation. Good agreement was achieved between the experimental and numerical results of the impact force with the ground. The influences of the impact velocity, the impact angle, the thickness of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> wall and the volume fraction of water on the dynamic responses of the dropped <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> were studied. The results indicated that the corner of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> is the most vulnerable location during the impact with ground.|$|R

5|$|Six {{external}} hardpoints {{were located}} {{along the bottom}} of the helicopter, with two under each wing and two on the fuselage under the sponsons. The two inner wing hardpoints could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks.</b> The wing hardpoints were also plumbed to allow the carriage of additional <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> if required.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{problems}} facing automotive <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> designers today is that of premature shut-off during the filling process. Premature shut-off occurs when the fuel dispensing nozzle stops before the automotive <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> is completely full. A simplified lumped parameter model has been developed in order to predict the pressures and flow rates associated with <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> filling...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "radiator" [...] cap was {{actually}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> filler, which led to problems when mechanics unfamiliar with air-cooled cars topped off the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> with water.|$|R
5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks.</b> No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E

5|$|During {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, nine Zeros were shot down. From these wrecks, the Allies learned that the Zero lacked armor and {{self-sealing}} <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> but little else about its capabilities. The Zero's flight performance characteristics—crucial to devising tactics and machinery to combat it—remained a mystery.|$|E
5|$|F-16E/F: The F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat) are newer F-16 variants. The Block 60 {{version is}} based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52 and has been {{developed}} especially for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It features improved AN/APG-80 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, avionics, conformal <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> (CFTs), and the more powerful General Electric F110-GE-132 engine.|$|E
5|$|Hertfordshire {{police and}} fire {{services}} and the member of parliament for the area, Mike Penning, {{said that there were}} seven <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> on the site which, as of 14:00 on 12 December, had not been affected. These tanks were at risk of exploding if the fire were to spread.|$|E
40|$|Statistics {{show that}} the fire, as a {{consequence}} of the ground impact of a helicopter in an emergency, is the first cause of death among the helicopter occupants. In view of that, severe requirements for <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> certification were established and now the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> crashworthiness is the first concern in the helicopter fuel system design. In this research work, a numerical model capable to capture the complex impact dynamics of a <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> impacting the ground is introduced. Experimental ground impact tests were performed using <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> simulacra and the data acquired were used to validate a <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> finite element model. Furthermore, in effort to achieve an accurate description of the event tests were carried out to characterize the impact behavior of the sandwich panels used to realize the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> structure, the <b>fuel</b> bag and the failure mechanism of the riveted and bolted joints. Experimental tests were numerically reproduced and, eventually, a good numerical-experimental correlation was achieved. The latter showed that the numerical approach is actually a valuable tool for the development of crashworthy structures. The experience collected during this research work contributed to achieve the certification of the modified configuration of an actual <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> whose original configuration had been previously certified by test...|$|R
25|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the Fit and the Insight platform is the position of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> While the Fit locates the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> under the front seats, the Insight positions the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> under the rear seats. This allows the Insight’s hybrid battery pack to be located in the cargo floor below the spare tire, to accommodate folding rear seats, lower roofline, and a more aerodynamic body shape.|$|R
5000|$|The {{upgraded}} {{cars for}} September 1967 also featured <b>fuels</b> <b>tanks</b> enlarged from 38 litres to 45 litres, which will presumably have marginally reduced luggage capacity, since the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> was positioned {{on the right}} side of the boot/trunk, under the rear right-hand wing.

5|$|T-26 model 1938: new conical turret, {{small changes}} in hull parts, {{increased}} volume of <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks.</b> Tank gun mod. 1937 and mod. 1938 were equipped with an electric breechblock and a vertically stabilized TOP-1 telescopic sight (or a TOS telescopic sight on the 1938 model).|$|E
5|$|The Dornier had {{self-sealing}} <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> {{to protect}} fuel {{stored in the}} wings and fuselage. This reduced the loss of fuel and risk of fire when hit in action, and often enabled the aircraft to return. Twenty oxygen bottles were provided for crew use during long flights above 3,660 m (12,000ft).|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 R-1 had a B-1 {{airframe}} {{with the}} exception of a modification in the fuselage which enabled an additional oil tank. This was installed to feed the engine due to the increase in range after the addition of the extra <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{originally}} {{built by}} EMD, the SD90MAC had a <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> capacity of 5,700 gallons. While owned by Union Pacific,the units started developing {{cracks in the}} frames around the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> mounts. UP worked with EMD to solve the frame cracking problem by adding additional mounting brackets between the frame and <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> In addition, the fuelfiller pipes were modified to only allow a maximum of 4,700 gallons of fuel to be added.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} linear static stress {{analysis}} of an automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> The objectives {{of this project}} are to develop a 3 D model of an automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> finite element model, and linear static stress analysis of an automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> The thesis describes the finite element analysis techniques starting from the selection of best mesh types and size until {{the identification of the}} critical locations of an automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> under static loading from. The material chosen for the automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> was AISI S 21900 Stainless Steel. The structural three-dimensional solid modelling of an automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> was developed using the computer-aided drawing software. The strategy of the mesh optimization for the best mesh selection of finite element model was developed. The finite element analysis was then performed using MSC. NASTRAN code. The finite element model of the automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> structure was analyzed using the linear elastic approach. The comparison of mesh configuration between tetrahedral with 4 nodes and tetrahedral with 10 nodes were made in many aspect of the results obtain including number of total nodes, displacements and stresses. From the results, it is observed that tetrahedral with 10 nodes give higher accuracy in many aspects than of tetrahedral with 4 nodes. The results obtain were then used to compare between three type of stress namely maximum principal stress, Von Mises stress and Tresca stress. The obtained results indicate that the stress not exceeding the tensile strength of the steel but rapid deformation will result leakage to the automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> structure. The durability assessment results are significant to improve the automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> venting system in the future. The results can also significantly help in the process of reducing the cost, and improve product reliability and customer confidence decesively...|$|R
50|$|Two-blade propeller, 4.4 m diameter. <b>Fuel</b> <b>tank</b> 1200 l in the fuselage, {{which could}} be dumped in case of fire. There could be mounted an {{additional}} <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> increasing the range to 1720 km, though this reduced the bomb load.|$|R
5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> {{making it easier for}} the lower tank to be filled first.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{assessment of}} both sides was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack was a failure {{as a result of}} poor formation flying and leadership. It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and self-sealing <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> were needed. These tactical considerations might, they believed, still salvage the day-bomber concept.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E
