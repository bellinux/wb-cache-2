Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards.

He placed in the top four in all ten events, and his Olympic record of 8,413 points would stand for nearly two decades.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
5|$|Cars {{would be}} the final film worked on by Joe Ranft {{who died in a}} car {{accident}} a year before the film's release, aged 45. The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after Corpse Bride (that showed the roles he had done in the other films directed by John Lasseter during the credits). This is also the last (non-documentary) movie for Paul Newman before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be the highest-grossing film of his career.|$|E

The mother offers reasons as to why they'd be a great match for one another, but Gyeon-woo and the Girl are too busy gazing into each other's eyes.

However, Akbari was not informed {{that he was the}} chosen assassin or that it was a secret mission, and he confided the information to contacts in the Soviet embassy. The embassy responded by warning Amin of the assassination attempt, thereby saving him from certain death.|$|E

SuperLuchas magazine later described the Universal Tournament as a promising sign of what the CMLL/TNA working relationship would bring, but in hindsight also noted that <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> that those promises were never fulfilled as the two companies stopped working together by the end of 2008.|$|E
