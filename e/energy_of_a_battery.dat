40|$|One of {{the major}} {{barriers}} to expanding the capacity of large-scale electrochemical energy storage within batteries is {{the threat of a}} catastrophic failure. Catastrophic battery pack failure can be initiated by a defect within a single battery cell. If the failure of a defective battery cell is not contained, the damage can spread and subsequently compromise the integrity of the entire battery back, as well as the safety of those in its surroundings. Replacing the volatile, flammable liquid electrolyte components found in most current lithium ion batteries with a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) would significantly improve the cell-level safety of batteries; however, poor ionic conductivity and restricted operating temperatures compared to liquid electrolytes have plagued the practical application of SPEs. Rather than competing with the performance of liquid electrolytes directly, our approach to developing SPEs relies on increasing electrolyte functionality through the use of block copolymer architectures. Block copolymers, wherein two or more chemically dissimilar polymer chains are covalently bound, have a propensity to microphase separate into nanoscale domains that have physical properties similar to those of each of the different polymer chains. For instance, the block copolymer, polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (SEO), has often been employed as a solid polymer electrolyte because the nanoscale domains of polystyrene (PS) can provide mechanical reinforcement, while the poly(ethylene oxide) microphases can solvate and conduct lithium ions. Block copolymer electrolytes (BCEs) formed from SEO/salt mixtures result in a material with the bulk mechanical properties of a solid, but with the ion conducting properties of a viscoelastic fluid. The efficacy SEO-based BCEs has been demonstrated; the enhanced mechanical functionality provided by the PS domains resist the propagation of dendritic lithium structures during battery operation, thus enabling the use of a lithium metal anode. The increase in the specific <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> upon replacing a graphite anode with lithium metal can offset the losses in performance due to the poor ion conduction of SPEs. However, BCEs that enable the use of a lithium anode and have improved performance would represent a major breakthrough for the development of high capacity batteries. The electrochemical performance of BCEs has a complex relationship with the nature of the microphase separated domains, which is not well-understood. The objective of this dissertation is to provide fundamental insight into the nature of microphase separation and self-assembly of block copolymer electrolytes. Specifically, I will focus on how the ion-polymer interactions within a diverse set of BCEs dictate nanostructure. Combining such insight with knowledge of how nanostructure influences ion motion will enable the rational design of new BCEs with enhanced performance and functionality. In order to facilitate the study of BCE nanostructure, synchrotron-based X-ray scattering techniques were used to study samples over a wide range of length-scales (i. e., from Angstroms to hundreds of nanometers) under conditions relevant to the battery environment. The development of the experimental aspects of the X-ray scattering techniques, as well as an improved treatment of scattering data, played a pivotal role in the success of this work. The dissemination of those developments will be the focus of the first section. The thermodynamic impact of adding salt to a neutral diblock copolymer was studied in a model BCE composed of a low molecular weight SEO diblock copolymer mixed with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI), a common salt used in lithium batteries. In neutral block copolymers (BCPs), self-assembly is a thermodynamically driven process governed by a balance between unfavorable monomer contacts (i. e., the enthalpic contribution) and the entropy of mixing. When the enthalpic and entropic contributions to free energy are similar in magnitude, a block copolymer can undergo a thermally reversible phase transition from an ordered to a disordered nanostructure (i. e., the order-to-disorder transition (ODT). We used temperature-dependent small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to observe this transition in the model SEO/LiTFSI system. Unlike neutral BCPs, which to a first approximation are single component systems, the SEO/LiTFSI system demonstrated the thermodynamically stable coexistence phases of ordered lamellae and disordered polymer over a finite temperature window. Analysis of the lamellar domains revealed an increase in salt concentration during the ODT, indicating local salt partitioning due to the presence of nanostructure. While the Gibbs phase rule predicts this behavior, this was the first result demonstrating a direct connection between ion-polymer interactions and block copolymer nanostructure. We found evidence of salt redistribution in BCEs wherein self-assembly has been kinetically arrested. Through the structural analysis of BCEs formed from a high molecular weight SEO sample over a wide range of LiTFSI concentrations, it was revealed that in some cases, coexisting nanostructures were stable. While {{it is likely that the}} stability of these nanostructures was kinetic in nature, the relationship between nanostructure and salt partitioning revealed previously indicates that the salt could redistribute between the nanostructures to achieve the lowest energetic state. Unusual trends in the ionic conductivity with respect to salt concentration support this hypothesis. In some cases, high salt concentrations lead to significant improvements in ionic conductivity, representing a strong departure from the behavior of standard SPEs, and a possible route to improving the performance of BCEs. The performance of BCEs can also be improved by chemically functionalizing one of the polymer blocks by covalently attaching the salt anion. Since the cation is the only mobile species, these materials are coined single-ion conducting block copolymers. Single ion conduction can improve the efficiency of battery operation. In order for cation motion to occur in single-ion conducting block copolymers, it must dissociate from the backbone of the anion-containing polymer block. Through the structural and electrochemical characterization of poly(ethylene oxide) -b-poly[(styrene- 4 -sulfonyltrifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide] (PEO-P(STFSI)) -based single-ion conductors, we found that ion dissociation significantly influences nanostructure: when a large amount of ions are dissociated, the polymer blocks tend to mix, thus precluding microphase separation and the formation of nanostructure. This direct coupling of ion dissociation (and hence conduction) and nanostructure has interesting implications for BCE performance. For instance, without discreet microphases, the single-ion conducting polymers cannot provide the enhanced mechanical properties like those obtained in SEO/LiTFSI electrolytes. Future development in single-ion conducting block copolymers should investigate polymer architectures where a third polymer block, such as PS, facilitates microphase separation and improved mechanical properties. Additional analysis of the single-ion conducting block copolymers revealed that ion dissociation from the charge-containing backbone (P(STFSI)) could also influence the crystallization of the neutral polymer block (PEO). Interestingly, ion dissociation did not disrupt PEO crystallization by directly interfering with the PEO chains, rather the homogeneity of the polymer melt prior to PEO crystallization led to differences in crystallization behavior. In the cases where ion dissociation lead to significant mixing of the polymer block, PEO crystallites grew unimpeded and formed well-ordered lamellar structures. When ion dissociation did not occur, fluctuations in concentration due to the demixing of PEO and P(STFSI) interrupted the growth of PEO crystallites, slowing the crystallization process and leading to less-ordered nanostructures. The final study in this work highlights the capability of utilizing in situ electrochemical characterization techniques while monitoring polymer microstructure using synchrotron X-ray scattering. We studied the electrochemical oxidation (doping) of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) in a block copolymer of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) -b-poly(ethylene oxide) (P 3 HT-PEO) mixed with LiTFSI. During the doping process, we monitored the charge mobility electrochemically and the crystalline structure of P 3 HT using wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Combining the structural analysis with the transport measurements in situ allowed the observation of a clear correlation between doping-induced changes in the P 3 HT crystal lattice and improvements in charge mobility. Since the doping-induced structural changes involve the intercalation of a salt anion into the P 3 HT crystal lattice, tuning the nature of the anion present during electrochemical oxidation might provide a new route to improving hole mobility in P 3 HT...|$|E

Second use of GV batteries, after their automotive life, can generate some revenue for the owners to recover <b>a</b> part <b>of</b> their <b>battery</b> purchase cost. However, this is dependent on the remaining capacity of the battery and the capacity degradation rate both in the automotive and second life. In this paper, capacity degradation and the remaining <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GV <b>battery</b> at different operating cycles have been quantified in both their automotive and second lives. Cost <b>of</b> battery <b>energy</b> both in automotive and second life have also been modelled that informs the owners of the revenue potentials, especially from the second life use. Finally, an economic load dispatch model with the inclusion of second life revenue has been developed to establish that using GV batteries in this way would earn extra revenue thus contributing to the initial buying price and encouraging more GV participation in the smart grid. Simulation results show that the proposed model can contribute up to 19. 56...|$|R
40|$|International audienceData {{collection}} from unreachable {{terrain and}} then transmit {{the information to}} the sink is a fundamental task in periodic sensor networks. Energy is a major constraint for this network as the only source <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> is <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> with limited lifetime. Therefore, {{in order to keep the}} networks operating for long time, adaptive sampling approach to periodic data collection constitutes a fundamental mechanism for energy optimization. The key idea behind this approach is to allow each sensor node to adapt its sampling rates to the physical changing dynamics. In this way, over-sampling can be minimised and power efficiency of the overall network system can be further improved. In this paper, we present an efficient adaptive sampling approach based on the dependence of conditional variance on measurements varies over time. Then, we propose a multiple levels activity model that uses behavior functions modeled by modified Bezier curves to define application classes and allow for sampling adaptive rate. The proposed method was successfully tested in a real sensor data set...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are comprised of sensor nodes with resource-constrained hardware. Nodes in the sensor network without adequate protection may be compromised by adversaries. Such compromised nodes {{are vulnerable to}} the attacks like false reports injection attacks and false data injection attacks on legitimate reports. In false report injection attacks, an adversary injects false report into the network {{with the goal of}} deceiving the sink or the depletion of the finite amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> powered network. In false data injection attacks on legitimate reports, the attacker may inject a false data for every legitimate report. To address such attacks, the probabilistic voting-based filtering scheme (PVFS) has been proposed by Li and Wu. However, each cluster head in PVFS needs additional transmission device. Therefore, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based false report detection method (FRD) to mitigate the threat of these attacks. FRD employs the statistical en-route filtering scheme as a basis and improves upon it. We demonstrate that FRD is efficient with respect to the security it provides, and allows a tradeoff between security and energy consumption, as shown in the simulation...|$|R
40|$|Widespread use of {{electric}} vehicles is hinged on the advancement <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> storage {{technologies such as}} lithium-ion batteries. Current research and development endeavors in energy storage for electric vehicles are focused on increasing the <b>energy</b> density <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> while simultaneously reducing manufacturing costs. Energy density can be improved by minimizing the number of inactive components in a cell {{with the implementation of}} thicker electrodes. Furthermore, cost can be significantly reduced with aqueous electrode processing. Unlike conventional electrode processing which uses the expensive and highly toxic organic solvent, N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP), aqueous processing employs deionized water. Aqueous processing of thick electrodes offers the opportunity to produce relatively inexpensive, high energy density lithium-ion batteries. However, thick aqueous processed cathodes have been found to crack as they dry. In an effort to avoid cracking and enable aqueous processing for thick LiNi 1 -y-zMnyCozO 2 (NMC) cathodes, the influence of two processing parameters on cracking were investigated in this work. They include solvent surface tension and electrode drying temperature. Small weight percentages of isopropanol (IPA) mixed in water were tested as novel composite solvents in aqueous processing. It was found that the addition of 20 wt. % IPA produced an aqueous solvent with a surface tension low enough to avoid any cracking in thick cathodes. When paired with a graphite anode in a single unit pouch cell, thick cathodes processed with 20 wt. % IPA as solvent performed comparably to an electrode processed with the conventional solvent, NMP. Separate experiments with electrode drying temperatures ranging from 20 ?C to 70 ?C revealed cracking worsens at elevated drying temperatures. Images of electrode surfaces were processed to quantify crack dimensions and crack intensity factor (CIF). Average crack length and width increased with drying temperature and electrode thickness. The CIF also increased with drying temperature and electrode thickness, the most dramatic increase being from 0. 68 % for thick electrodes dried at 20 ?C to 15. 8 % when thick electrodes were dried at 70 ?C...|$|R
40|$|In a {{large-scale}} sensor network individual sensors {{are subject to}} security compromises. A compromised node can inject bogus sensing reports into the network. If undetected, these bogus reports would be forwarded to the data collection point (i. e. the sink). Such attacks by compromised sensors can cause not only false alarms but also the depletion of the finite amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> powered network. In this paper we present a Statistical Enroute Filtering (SEF) mechanism that can detect and drop such false reports. SEF requires that each sensing report be validated by multiple keyed message authentication codes (MACs), each generated by a node that detects the same event. As the report is forwarded, each node along the way verifies the correctness of the MACs probabilistically and drops those with invalid MACs at earliest points. The sink further filters out remaining false reports that escape the en-route filtering. SEF exploits the network scale to determine the truthfulness of each report through collective decision-making by multiples detecting nodes and collective false-report-detection by multiple forwarding nodes. Our analysis and simulations show that, with <b>an</b> overhead <b>of</b> 14 bytes per report, SEF is able to drop 8090 % falsely injected reports by a compromised node within 10 forwarding hops...|$|R
40|$|Standalone {{operation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{wind turbine}} generating system under fluctuating wind and variable load conditions {{is a difficult}} task. Moreover, high reactive power demand makes it more challenging due to the limitation of reactive capability of the wind generating system. A Remote Area Power Supply (RAPS) system consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG), a hybrid energy storage, a dump load and a mains load is considered in this paper. The hybrid <b>energy</b> storage consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> storage and <b>a</b> supercapacitor where both {{are connected to the}} DC bus of the RAPS system. An energy management algorithm (EMA) is proposed for the hybrid energy storage with a view to improve the performance <b>of</b> the <b>battery</b> storage. <b>A</b> synchronous condenser is employed to provide reactive power and inertial support to the RAPS system. A coordinated control approach is developed to manage the active and reactive power flows among the RAPS components. In this regard, individual controllers for each RAPS component have been developed for effective management of the RAPS components. Through simulation studies carried out using detailed model in MATLAB Simulink, it has been demonstrated that the proposed method is capable <b>of</b> achieving: <b>a)</b> robust voltage and frequency regulation (in terms of their acceptable bandwidths), b) effective management of the hybrid storage system, c) reactive power capability and inertial support by the synchronous condenser, and d) maximum power extraction from wind. 2014 IEEE...|$|R
