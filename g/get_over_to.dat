Re5 is the correct method because White's king is cut off from the pawn, White will have {{to spend a lot of}} time activating his rook, and by that time the black king will be able to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the queenside.

2500|$|Lewis {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: [...] "e felt like happiness is something everyone strives to have, and sometimes it's not just about being happy, but if you have obstacles in your life that you have to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> be happy. And it's just about that striving to get there. t was kind of like looking back at all of the things I've been through, just kind of putting that into the song."

2500|$|Wilson also {{produced}} the band's second album, Whip It Out, which {{was released in}} November 1977. [...] The associated single, [...] "(I'm in a) Dancing Mood", peaked at No.90. Songwriting {{was at this point}} divided more-or-less equally amongst Burt (still contributing to the band as a songwriter), Camilleri, and Young, all working individually. To capture the energy and spontaneity of a live performance, the next Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons release was a five-track extended play, Live!! Loud and Clear, which reached No.53 in August 1978. Its lead track [...] "The Honeydripper" [...] receiving most of the airplay. Fellow musician, Paul Kelly, recalled their early performances, [...] "hey did house-rocking, roof-raising versions of classic and obscure soul, R'n'B and reggae songs...

500|$|Three notable occurrences during live {{performances}} are the physically complicated [...] "stop/start" [...] dance technique that brings Jackson and his dancers to a frozen stop several times, the sing-along between performer and audience during the bridge, and him singing [...] "Hard <b>To</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Over,</b> Hard <b>To</b> <b>Get</b> Under" [...] instead of [...] "Too High <b>To</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Over,</b> Too Low <b>To</b> <b>Get</b> Under" [...] {{in the studio}} version.|$|R

60|$|After a {{fair and}} uneventful voyage of six weeks, I beheld again my native shores in the low spits of the Virginia capes.
