5000|$|Oxford Nanopore {{has worked}} to {{establish}} {{the concept of an}} 'Internet of Living Things', originally conceived as an 'Internet of DNA' by a bioinformatician based at UC Santa Cruz. In an article in Wired in 2015, Clive Brown, CTO of Oxford Nanopore noted that [...] "future nanopore sensing devices linked to cloud based analyses could run anywhere on anything.". [...] The concept of an <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Things</b> was referenced in a 2015 paper by Yaniv Erlich describing a future of ubiquitous genomics. Erlich noted that [...] "multiple appliances could benefit from integration with sequencing sensors, including air conditioning or the main water supply to monitor harmful pathogens. However, of all possible options, toilets may offer the best integration point.”. For health-related applications he noted that [...] "rapid sequencing at airport checkpoints might be useful to control pathogen outbreaks and offer medical assistance to affected passengers. Similarly, a portable sequencer will enable physicians to provide more accurate diagnoses in the field during humanitarian crises or in the clinic without the need to waste time by sending samples to a lab.” ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{companies}} have recently emerged to provide online Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) DNA analysis and sequencing. Those activities will be, {{in the near}} future, {{the foundations of the}} emerging <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Things.</b> The concept of <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Things</b> has been introduced to characterize networks of biological sequencing sensors, which could rely on cloud-based analysis capabilities, to support the users in deeply studying DNA or other molecules. Sequencing sensors have many fields of application and much more will likely to come. In this context, DNA microarray images represent the core of modern genomic data analysis, since they allow the simultaneous monitoring of many thousands of genes and represent a sort of "container", not only for storing genomics data, but also for managing, sharing and exchanging such type of data. In this scenario, the ability to protect genomics and medical big data is a growing challenge. In particular, for what concerns DNA microarray images, the techniques commonly employed for data protection are not effective due for example to the unauthorized use or manipulation after decryption or the lost of metadata during image processing. In this paper we address the problem of protecting such type of information, by means of watermarking techniques. In particular, we propose reversible watermarking techniques explicitly tailored for the characteristics of DNA microarray images to ensure the protection of such images in terms of authenticity and integrity, besides enabling the binding of those imaging data with other information related to them. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques by means of a working prototype...|$|E

In Experiment 1, the hypothesis that visual and functional knowledge play different roles in the representation <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> and nonliving things is tested and confirmed. A parallel distributed processing model of semantic memory in which knowledge is subdivided by modality into visual and functional components is described. In Experiment 2, the model is lesioned, and {{it is confirmed that}} damage to visual semantics primarily impairs knowledge <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>things,</b> and damage to functional semantics primarily impairs knowledge of non!iving things. In Experiment 3, it {{is demonstrated}} that the model accounts naturally for a finding that had appeared problematic for a modality-specific architec-ture, namely, impaired retrieval of functional knowledge about <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> Finally, in Experiment 4, it is shown how the model can account for a recent observation of impaired knowledge <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> only when knowledge is probed verbally...|$|R
