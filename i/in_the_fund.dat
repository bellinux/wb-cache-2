Other Australian States were consulted and requested to provide funding of £9,250. The specific state funding quotas were: Victoria £2,500, New South Wales £2,500, Western Australia £2,600, Queensland £1,000 and South Australia £450. There was a concern as to not impact on the fund raising required by the Commonwealth Games appeal. Several reports of the Games highlight the importance of large spectator attendance and 'passing the hat' around <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> raising efforts. The total cost at the Games was £11,717 with a surplus of £2,089.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, Lillehammer Olympiapark had {{an annual}} revenue of NOK20 million, {{of which a}} third came from the fund. Commercial {{activities}} contributed half the revenue, while the remaining fraction came from sports activities. Between 80 and 90 percent of the rental time went to sports activities. A report published by Lillehammer University College in 2007 concluded that all the 260 permanent jobs created in the Lillehammer area {{as a result of}} the Olympics were directly dependent on subsidies from the post-Olympic use funds. In the late 2000s, Lillehammer Olympiapark was using between NOK8 and 12 million per year. There was NOK25 million left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> in 2012, which was scheduled to be closed in 2014, after it has served for 20 years. Lillehammer Olympiapark started planning the organization of the venues in 2010. The company recommended that the subsidies be equally funded between Lillehammer Municipality, Oppland County Municipality and the Ministry of Culture. Specifically it recommended that the state take over ownership of the bobsleigh and luge track, while the county took partial ownership of Lillehammer Olympiapark. The state would thus continue to finance the track, which is the only such venue in Northern Europe, while the municipality and county finance the other four venues. The venues are recommended held to such a standard that they can host world cup and world championships in relevant sports.|$|E

The shareholders indirectly own the assets of the fund, and they will typically get an annual report. Shareholders are entitled to a share of the profits, such as interest or dividends, and they may get a residual value in case the fund is liquidated. Their ownership interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> can easily be bought and sold.|$|E

25|$|Title VI {{amended the}} Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA) {{to change how}} the U.S. Victims of Crime Fund was managed and funded, {{improving}} the speedy provision of aid to families of public safety officers by expedited payments to officers or the families of officers injured or killed {{in the line of}} duty. Payments must be made no later than 30 days later. The Assistant Attorney General was given expanded authority under Section 614 of the U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act to make grants to any organization that administers any Office of Justice Programs, which includes the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program. Further changes to the Victims of Crime Fund increased the amount of money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> and changed the way that funds were distributed. The amount available for grants made through the Crime Victim Fund to eligible crime victim compensation programs were increased from 40 percent to 60 percent of the total <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund.</b> A program can provide compensation to U.S. citizens who were adversely affected overseas. Means testing was also waived for those who apply for compensation. Under VOCA, the Director may make an annual grant from the Crime Victims Fund to support crime victim assistance programs. An amendment was made to VOCA to include offers of assistance to crime victims in the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and any other U.S. territory. VOCA also provides for compensation and assistance to victims of terrorism or mass violence. This was amended to allow the Director to make supplemental grants to States for eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs, and to victim service organizations, public agencies (including Federal, State, or local governments) and non-governmental organizations that provide assistance to victims of crime. The funds could be used to provide emergency relief, including crisis response efforts, assistance, compensation, training and technical assistance for investigations and prosecutions of terrorism.|$|E

500|$|The Churches Conservation Trust, {{which was}} {{initially}} {{known as the}} Redundant Churches Fund, is a charity whose purpose is to protect historic churches at risk, {{those that have been}} made redundant by the Church of England.

The legally defined object of the Trust is [...] "the preservation, {{in the interests of the}} nation and the Church of England, of churches and parts of churches of historic and archaeological interest or architectural quality vested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund...</b> together with their contents so vested".

In the 12months ending 31March 2010 the charity's income was £6,161,653, and its spending was £6,035,871. [...] During that year it had 44employees, and used the services of 2,000volunteers.

500|$|The Civil Rights Movement sparked extremist {{antisemitism}} in the South, and [...] "Communist Jews" [...] were {{blamed for}} destroying democracy following the United States Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Southern Jews {{found themselves in}} a difficult position; they were a vulnerable minority whose status in Southern white society was marginal and conditional on their acceptance of the status quo. Because of these concerns, particularly after the 1958 bombing of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple in Atlanta, the congregation did not want Wax taking a public stand on civil rights. In addition, though Wax supported racial integration, not all his congregants did; according to Wax, [...] "Almost all native-born Southerners whose families lived in the South for two or more generations have segregationist attitudes." [...] Rather than getting involved in public protests, Wax worked with groups supporting integration, such as the Memphis Ministers Association. He also encouraged Temple Israel's members to join groups like the Panel of American Women, an interfaith and inter-racial group that spoke in favor of religious and racial tolerance at community events and whose Memphis chapter was founded by congregation member Jocelyn Wurzburg. Temple Israel member Myra Dreifus co-founded Memphis's Fund for Needy Schoolchildren in the 1960s. It helped provide food for hungry schoolchildren, primarily in black schools, and later expanded its efforts to include the distribution of free or discounted clothing and footwear. The group had both white and black women as members, including members of Temple Israel, and because of Dreifus's role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund,</b> Temple Israel itself supported it. By 1968, members of the Sisterhood were donating money so that tutors could be bussed to the majority African-American Kansas Street School. According to professor of women's and gender studies Kimberly K. Little, this [...] "marked the first occasion where Temple Israel opened its doors to community–based programs; its prior charitable work focused on Jewish community outreach".|$|E
