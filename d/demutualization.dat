40|$|A {{setting in}} which customer-owned mutual {{companies}} converted to publicly listed firms created a plausibly exogenous shock to salience of stock ownership. We use this shock to identify the effect of stock ownership on political behavior. Using IV regressions, difference-in-differences analyses, and matching methods, we find the shock changed the way people vote in the affected areas, with the <b>demutualizations</b> being followed by a 1. 72 ̆ 0132. 7 percentage points increase in rightof- center vote share. Analyses of <b>demutualizations</b> that did not involve public listing of shares suggest that explanations based on wealth, liquidity, and tax-related incentives do not drive the results...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the determinants {{and consequences of}} the mutual holding company (MHC) structure that allows mutual thrifts to issue stock to outside shareholders while maintaining the mutual form. Capital constrained firms with greater profit opportunities {{are more likely to}} choose a full demutualization; demonstrating that the MHC choice can be used to control for over- and under-investment costs. During periods of greater regulatory constraints, MHC firms have lower offer-day returns than full <b>demutualizations.</b> MHC firms are also less likely to be acquired as the MHC structure provides protection from the market for corporate control. Demonstrating a clear preference by minority shareholders for the elimination of the MHC structure, the announcement of a second-stage conversion generates a 12 percent return.

50|$|Carpetbagging {{was used}} as a term in Great Britain in the late 1990s during the wave of <b>demutualizations</b> of {{building}} societies. It indicated members of the public who joined mutual societies with the hope of making a quick profit from the conversion.Contemporarily speaking, the term carpetbagger refers to roving financial opportunists, often of modest means, who spot investment opportunities and aim to benefit from a set of circumstances to which they are not ordinarily entitled. In recent years the best opportunities for carpetbaggers have come from opening membership accounts at building societies for as little as £100, to qualify for windfalls running into thousands of pounds from the process of conversion and takeover. The influx of such transitory 'token' members as carpetbaggers, took advantage of these nugatory deposit criteria, often to instigate or accelerate the trend towards wholesale demutualisation.|$|R

40|$|We {{undertake}} {{an empirical}} {{assessment of the}} competitiveness and market contestability of the major British banks post- 1980 - a period of major structural changes, mergers, <b>demutualizations</b> and acquisitions. Specifically, we estimate and test the Rosse-Panzar model on a panel of 12 banks for the period 1980 - 2004; furthermore, we buttress the Rosse-Panzar methodology by estimating the ratio of Lerner indices obtained from interest rate setting equations. The sample of banks corresponds closely to the major British Banking Groups as specified by the British Banking Association. Our results confirm the consensus finding that the British banking market {{can be described as}} monopolistically competitive. We also find that on the core business of balance sheet activity, British banks have remained as competitive in the 1990 s as in the 1980 s. This finding is further supported by evidence from the ratio of Lerner indices for loans and deposits. However, we find a significant worsening of competitiveness on the non-core (off-balance sheet) business of the banks. Competitive conditions in banking; market contestability; UK...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Demutualization</b> {{of mutual}} {{insurers}} to form stock companies, {{as well as}} the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century. [...] However, not all states permit mutual holding companies.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a certain}} period of years, owners of Mitchell-Lama limited equity housing co-operatives may decide {{according}} to their co-op voting rules to [...] "privatize" [...] or demutualize their building as well. That may permit them to sell their apartments, often at a high profit, but it can potentially increase the rents of remaining residents since the building loses its tax abatement and may have increased payments for a non-subsidized mortgage. Flip taxes on resales can be used to mitigate such increases, but that is up to the co-op boards. There is some effort to require them by legislation, but that has so far been unsuccessful. Such <b>demutualization</b> thus simultaneously diminishes the stock of affordable housing in a given area and increases tax revenue.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} general methods {{in which an}} {{organization}} might demutualize, full <b>demutualization,</b> sponsored <b>demutualization,</b> and into a mutual holding company (MHC). In any type of <b>demutualization,</b> insurance policies, outstanding loans, etc., are not directly affected by the organization's change of legal form.|$|E
5000|$|In a full <b>demutualization,</b> {{the mutual}} {{completely}} converts to a stock company, and passes {{on its own}} (newly issued) stock, cash, and/or policy credits to the members or policyholders. No attempt is made to preserve mutuality in any form. However, in a full <b>demutualization</b> of a mutual savings bank, stock is issued to investors in the initial public offering, and the depositors, who theoretically owned the bank before <b>demutualization,</b> receive no stock unless they invest in the initial public offering.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2010, {{the board}} of Economical Mutual Insurance Company {{announced}} its intention to pursue <b>demutualization,</b> which would mean that its policy holders would become shareholders. [...] It is the first Property & Casualty Insurance company in Canada to do this. However, as of 2014, the <b>demutualization</b> was temporarily on hold, pending finalization of new federal regulations governing this process. According to the Globe and Mail, the upcoming <b>demutualization</b> has made the company a potential target for takeover bids from other Canadian and international insurance companies.|$|E
50|$|Gains from <b>demutualization</b> - {{this example}} {{can lead to}} {{especially}} large windfall gains. A study in 1999 into the potential <b>demutualization</b> of the John Lewis Partnership predicted that partners would receive upwards of £100,000 in windfall gains had the company been floated on the stock market.|$|E

50|$|As well as {{the many}} {{agricultural}} supply cooperatives that demutualized, {{a small number of}} general retail consumer's cooperatives have demutualized or considered <b>demutualization.</b> In 1997, Andrew Regan launched an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid to demutualize the UK's giant Co-operative Wholesale Society, which, despite its name, was a large retailer in its own right. In 2007, the tiny Scottish retailer, Musselburgh and Fisherrow Co-operative Society, completed most or all of the steps necessary to demutualize. In 2008, a Swiss competition regulator recommended <b>demutualization</b> to Switzerland's leading supermarket chains, Coop and Migros.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Demutualization</b> is {{the process}} by which a customer-owned mutual {{organization}} (mutual) or co-operative changes legal form to a joint stock company. It is sometimes called stocking or privatization. As part of the <b>demutualization</b> process, members of a mutual usually receive a [...] "windfall" [...] payout, in the form of shares in the successor company, a cash payment, or a mixture of both. Mutualization or mutualisation is the opposite process, wherein a shareholder-owned company is converted into a mutual organization, typically through takeover by an existing mutual organization. Furthermore, re-mutualization depicts the process of aligning or refreshing the interest and objectives {{of the members of the}} mutual society.|$|E

50|$|Some MHC demutualizations {{have been}} planned {{as the first}} of a {{two-stage}} process. The second stage would be full <b>demutualization</b> once the transition pains into MHC status are complete. In other cases, the MHC is the final stage.|$|E

5000|$|Mutualization or {{mutualisation}} is {{the process}} by which a joint stock company changes legal form to a mutual organization or a cooperative, so {{that the majority of the}} stock is owned by employees or customers. <b>Demutualization</b> or privatization is the reverse process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Demutualization</b> {{of mutual}} {{insurers}} to form stock companies, {{as well as}} the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century.

50|$|A mutual may convert {{itself to}} a non-mutual {{through the process of}} <b>demutualization.</b> This process became {{increasingly}} common in the 1980s as a result of deregulation. In the United States, conversion may be full, to a public company, or, in many states, partial, to a mutual holding company.|$|E

50|$|The Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company {{has also}} {{investigated}} <b>demutualization,</b> {{even though its}} form of ownership is embedded in its name. It is noted that other formerly mutual companies such as Washington Mutual, a former savings and loan association, {{have been allowed to}} demutualize and yet retain their names.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sponsored}} <b>demutualization</b> is similar; {{the mutual}} is fully demutualized and its policyholders or members are compensated. The {{difference is that}} the mutuality is essentially bought by a stock corporation. Instead of receiving stock in the formerly mutual company, stock in the new parent company is granted instead.|$|E
