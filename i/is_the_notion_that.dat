5|$|Typical to {{variations}} of the Irenaean theodicy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the present world is the greatest possible world, or {{the best of all}} possible worlds. This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> a body's motion {{can be described as}} a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features introduced by Eyring, Polanyi and Evans <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> activated complexes <b>are</b> in quasi-equilibrium with the reactants. <b>The</b> rate <b>is</b> then directly proportional to the concentration of these complexes multiplied by the frequency (kBT/h) with which they are converted into products.|$|R
5|$|More recently, Maurice Friedman {{writes about}} the book {{in the context of}} the various {{attempts}} to find a universal essence - or perennial philosophy - within religion. He finds that Time and Eternity is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by Aldous Huxley or Ananda Coomaraswamy, but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.|$|E
5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> {{there ought to}} be a political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E
5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups {{must be a}} direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated {{by the fact that}} {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Cartesian dualism and Popper's three {{worlds are}} {{two forms of}} what is called {{epistemological}} pluralism, that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include psychophysical parallelism and epiphenomenalism. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is not reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.|$|E
25|$|Vaccine {{overload}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> giving many vaccines at once may overwhelm or weaken a child's immature {{immune system}} and lead to adverse effects. Despite scientific evidence that strongly contradicts this idea, some parents of autistic children believe that vaccine overload causes autism. The resulting controversy has caused many parents to delay or avoid immunizing their children. Such parental misperceptions are major obstacles towards immunization of children.|$|E

5000|$|The specialists' {{proposals}} for a judiciary free from party and political interference were denounced and ridiculed. Mao {{did not want}} a judiciary that stood as an impartial arbiter between the party and anyone else.

25|$|Discussion {{regarding}} destiny {{does not}} necessitate {{the existence of}} supernatural powers. Logical determinism or determinateness <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and {{is referred to as}} the problem of future contingents.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{physical}} cosmology, {{the cosmological}} principle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> {{the distribution of}} matter in the universe is homogeneous and isotropic when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe and have no preferred direction, and should, therefore, produce no observable irregularities in the large scale structuring {{over the course of}} evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the Big Bang.|$|E
25|$|Nomological {{determinism}} is {{the most}} common form of causal determinism. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics and various interpretations thereof pose a serious challenge to this view. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that is a misnomer. Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological determinism (its opposite being physical indeterminism).|$|E

50|$|King Arthur's messianic {{return is}} {{an aspect of}} the legend of King Arthur, the mythical 6th-century British king. Few {{historical}} records of Arthur remain, and there are doubts that he ever existed, but he achieved a mythological stature that gave rise to a growing literature about his life and deeds. One recurrent aspect of Arthurian literature <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> he would one day return in the role of a messiah to save his people.|$|R
40|$|The "Eco-papas" project, {{implemented}} {{in the province of}} Carchi, Ecuador, followed a broad approach: reintroducing biological and ecological farming techniques that decrease the importance of chemical inputs and moving towards a more stable and sustainable agroecosystem.

25|$|During the Qing dynasty, {{criminal}} justice {{was based on}} extremely detailed Great Qing Legal Code. One element of the traditional Chinese {{criminal justice}} system <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> criminal law has a moral purpose, {{one of which is}} to get the convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of torture, in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All capital offenses were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the emperor.|$|E
25|$|At its core, {{sacrifice}} {{symbolized the}} renewal of divine energy and, in doing so, the continuation of life. Its ability of bloodletting {{to do this is}} based on two intertwined concepts that are prevalent in the Maya belief system. The first <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the gods had given life to humankind by sacrificing parts of their own bodies. The second is the central focus of their mythology on human blood, which signified life among the Maya. Within their belief system, human blood was partially made up of the blood of the gods, who sacrificed their own divine blood in creating life in humans. Thus, in order to continually maintain the order of their universe, the Maya believed that blood had to be given back to the gods.|$|E
25|$|Dependency grammar (DG) is a {{class of}} modern {{syntactic}} theories that are all based on the dependency relation (as opposed to the constituency relation) {{and that can be}} traced back primarily to the work of Lucien Tesnière. Dependency <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links. The (finite) verb is taken to be the structural center of clause structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in terms of the directed links, which are called dependencies. DGs are distinct from phrase structure grammars (constituency grammars), since DGs lack phrasal nodes, although they acknowledge phrases. Structure is determined by the relation between a word (a head) and its dependents. Dependency structures are flatter than constituency structures in part because they lack a finite verb phrase constituent, and they are thus well suited for the analysis of languages with free word order, such as Czech, Slovak, Turkish, and Warlpiri.|$|E
50|$|Historical works {{eventually}} {{focused on}} the nature and intent of Nazi policy. Heinz Heger, Gunter Grau and Richard Plant all contributed greatly to the early Holocaust discourse which emerged throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Central to these studies <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> statistically speaking, homosexuals suffered greater losses {{than many of the}} smaller minorities under Nazi persecution such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses and within the camps experienced harsher treatments and ostracization as well as execution.|$|R

25|$|Berkeley Construction Grammar (BCG: {{formerly}} also simply called Construction Grammar {{in upper}} case) {{focuses on the}} formal aspects of constructions and makes use of a unification-based framework for description of syntax, not unlike head-driven phrase structure grammar. Its proponents/developers include Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Laura Michaelis, and {{to a certain extent}} Ivan Sag. Immanent within BCG works like Fillmore and Kay 1995 and Michaelis and Ruppenhofer 2001 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> phrasal representations—embedding relations—should not be used to represent combinatoric properties of lexemes or lexeme classes. For example, BCG abandons the traditional practice of using non-branching domination (NP over N' over N) to describe undetermined nominals that function as NPs, instead introducing a determination construction that requires ('asks for') a non-maximal nominal sister and a lexical 'maximality' feature for which plural and mass nouns are unmarked. BCG also offers a unification-based representation of 'argument structure' patterns as abstract verbal lexeme entries ('linking constructions'). These linking constructions include transitive, oblique goal and passive constructions. These constructions describe classes of verbs that combine with phrasal constructions like the VP construction but contain no phrasal information in themselves.|$|E

50|$|According to {{resource}} mobilization theory, a core, professional {{group in}} a social movement organization works towards bringing money, supporters, attention of the media, alliances with those in power, and refining the organizational structure.
