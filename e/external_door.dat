5|$|The Norman priory, {{completed}} around 1180, {{was relatively}} short and narrow. It {{was constructed in}} the Romanesque style with twin aisles {{either side of the}} nave and a single tower at the west end, aligned with the main axis of the church. It could be entered from the north, via an <b>external</b> <b>door,</b> and the south via the cloister. The existence of the northward door suggests it was used by a secular congregation, possibly the local nobility and patrons. A number of graves associated with the first priory have been found in the south aisle's floor and against the north wall.|$|E
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no <b>external</b> <b>door</b> and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E
25|$|Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is a {{joint venture}} of the U.S. and German {{aerospace}} agencies, NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to make an infrared telescope platform that can fly at altitudes high enough {{to be in the}} infrared-transparent regime above the water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere. The aircraft is supplied by the U.S., and the infrared telescope by Germany. Modifications of the Boeing 747SP airframe to accommodate the telescope, mission-unique equipment and large <b>external</b> <b>door</b> were made by L-3 Communications Integrated Systems of Waco, Texas.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>external</b> <b>doors</b> with the largest type having a trefoil arch and double-leafed {{patterned}} doors. All doors are detailed and with arches.|$|R
50|$|Between the inset end {{doors were}} five windows (four {{in the first}} class section) and then a pair of {{pivoting}} <b>external</b> <b>doors</b> as a centre entrance, which was also inset.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} treasures of the basilica is a mosaic set above the central <b>external</b> <b>door.</b> Called the [...] "Navicella", it is based on a design by Giotto (early 14th century) and represents a ship symbolizing the Christian Church. The mosaic is mostly a 17th-century copy of Giotto's original.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{prototype}} {{was of a}} {{more powerful}} and slightly larger variant designated the model 360-6; it first flew on 25 May 1965. [...] This model had a choice of engines, either 290hp (216kW) Lycoming IO-540 six cylinder engines driving constant speed, three-bladed propellers, or 310hp (231kW) Lycoming TIO-541 engines. [...] The span was increased by 0.37 m (15in) and length by 0.64 m (25in). [...] The increased length allowed seats for 6-7, with two rows of two single seats and a bench seat at the rear that could accommodate 2 or 3. [...] The cabin was sound-proofed and air conditioned and could be pressurised. [...] Access was via a forward starboard side door. [...] There was baggage space behind the cabin with its own <b>external</b> <b>door.</b> [...] The sole 360-6 was registered as F-WLKY.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was duralumin throughout and {{was flat}} sided and bottomed, though its top was slightly rounded and the nose was rounded in both plan and elevation. [...] The pilots' cabin had two seats side-by-side, fitted with dual control and radio equipment by the righthand seat. Behind them {{there was a}} separate cabin with a [...] floor, which could be fitted as a navigator's post or a bar and gave access to an underfloor baggage hold; a port-side <b>external</b> <b>door</b> accessed this space and allowed the pilots to reach their positions via an internal door. A second internal door opened into the passenger cabin, [...] in plan and [...] high, which had nine rows of seats, {{one on each side}} under its own window. There was a toilet at the rear and behind it a final space containing a library and the main passenger door port-side.|$|E

2500|$|The Latécoère 440 was {{powered by}} a 650hp (485kW) Hispano-Suiza 12 Nbr upright V-12 engine. [...] Two of its {{radiators}} {{were placed on the}} underside of the lift struts, close to the fuselage, with a third on the port side of the fuselage itself. [...] This allowed a smoothly streamlined nose profile, though the cross-section of the fuselage here and elsewhere was essentially rectangular. [...] The aircraft commander, who was also navigator and bomb aimer was stationed with his bomb sights immediately behind the engine firewall. The pilot's cabin was under the wing, with his windshield at about mid chord; he had a Rhodoid glazed panel in the wing for a better view. [...] The cabin rear was glazed and extended into a deep cut-out in the wing trailing edge to improve upward visibility. [...] It merged into the gunner/radio operator's circular glazed cupola. The three crew positions were linked by a starboard side corridor which had an <b>external</b> <b>door</b> at each end. [...] The externally braced tailplane, placed on the top of the fuselage had a swept leading edge and carried split elevators. [...] The fin was nearly triangular but the rudder was deep and rounded. [...] Neither control surface was balanced, but both had trim tabs.|$|E
60|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} {{conclusion}} of Stephen's remark, {{the sound of the}} closing of an <b>external</b> <b>door</b> in their immediate neighbourhood reached Elfride's ears. It came from the further side of the wing containing the illuminated room. She then discerned, by the aid of the dusky departing light, a figure, whose sex was undistinguishable, walking down the gravelled path by the parterre towards the river. The figure grew fainter, and vanished under the trees.|$|E
6000|$|After walking {{round the}} cathedral, {{we went up}} a narrow and crooked street, very old and shabby, but with an antique house {{projecting}} {{as much as a}} yard over the pavement on one side,--a timber house it seemed to be, plastered over and stained yellow or buff. There was no <b>external</b> <b>door,</b> affording entrance into this edifice; but about midway of its front we came to a low, Gothic, stone archway, passing right through the house; and as it looked much time-worn, and was sculptured with untraceable devices, we went through. There was an exceedingly antique, battered, and shattered pair of oaken leaves, which used doubtless to shut up the passage in former times, and keep it secure; but for the last centuries, probably, there has been free ingress and egress. Indeed, the portal arch may never have been closed since the Reformation. Within, we found a quadrangle, of which the house upon the street formed one side, the others being composed of ancient houses, with gables in a row, all looking upon the paved quadrangle, through quaint windows of various fashion. An elderly, neat, pleasant-looking woman now came in beneath the arch, and as she had a look of being acquainted here, we asked her what the place was; and she told us, that in the old Popish times the prebends of the cathedral used to live here, to keep them from doing mischief in the town. The establishment, she said, was now called [...] "The College," [...] and was let in rooms and small tenements to poor people. On consulting the York Guide, I find that her account was pretty correct; the house having been founded in Henry VI.'s time, and called St. William's College, the statue of the patron saint being sculptured over the arch. It was intended for the residence of the parsons and priests of the cathedral, who had formerly caused troubles and scandals by living in the town.|$|E
50|$|The factory was poorly {{designed}} and built. Fire exits drawn {{in the building}} plans were not, in fact, constructed, and the existing <b>external</b> <b>doors</b> were locked. The building was reinforced with uninsulated steel girders which quickly weakened and collapsed when heated by the flames.|$|R
5000|$|The school's {{enrollment}} {{declined in}} the 1970s {{from a peak of}} more than 600 students. [...] The 1978 - 79 school year was the building's last as a school, and in 1980 the building (making use of the many <b>external</b> <b>doors)</b> was converted to condominiums.|$|R
50|$|In 1894 {{the car was}} {{returned}} to the workshops and rebuilt for special service. When it re-entered service it had been completely cleared out, {{and most of the}} <b>external</b> <b>doors</b> were sealed. The new car was called the Governor's Car (State), and featured a ladies lavatory and water closet at one end (windows 1 & 2), then two saloons with lounge chairs and tables (windows 3 to 9 and 10 to 17), a gentlemen's lavatory and water closet with a side corridor (windows 18 and 19), then a small buffet counter at the far end (windows 20 and 21). Most of the <b>external</b> <b>doors</b> were sealed, leaving one each side per saloon, and three for accessing the buffet area at the gentlemen's end.|$|R
60|$|The main {{building}} was about twenty-four {{feet long and}} sixteen broad--certainly not more. Its total height, from the ground to {{the apex of the}} roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. To the west end of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its proportions:--the line of its front standing back about two yards from that of the larger house, and the line of its roof, of course, being considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining. At right angles to these buildings, and {{from the rear of the}} main one--not exactly in the middle--extended a third compartment, very small--being, in general, one-third less than the western wing. The roofs of the two larger were very steep--sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve, and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front, so as to form the roofs of two piazzas. These latter roofs, of course, needed no support; but as they had the air of needing it, slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone. The roof of the northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof. Between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and red:--a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. Over the gables the roofs also projected very much:--in the {{main building}} about four feet to the east and two to the west. The principal door was not exactly in the main division, being a little to the east--while the two windows were to the west. These latter did not extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than usual--they had single shutters like doors--the panes were of lozenge form, but quite large. The door itself had its upper half of glass, also in lozenge panes--a movable shutter secured it at night. The door to the west wing was in its gable, and quite simple--a single window looked out to the south. There was no <b>external</b> <b>door</b> to the north wing, and it also had only one window to the east.|$|E

5000|$|John Pavelka died in 1926; Anna Pavelka, in 1955. [...] At {{some time}} after {{both of them had}} died, {{probably}} in the 1950s, the house was remodelled: the porch was enclosed and given two <b>external</b> <b>doors,</b> and a south-facing gable window was raised. [...] Several of the sheds have undergone significant deterioration.|$|R
