5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock,</b> American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the area}} resembles Pennsylvania in climate, {{vegetation}} and wildlife. The park is near the southern limit for <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock</b> and eastern white pine. Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. The surrounding forests contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Persistent Trillium, which grows near Rhododendron. Nearby boulderfields by Blood Mountain include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E
5|$|The Shickshinny Mountain Slopes, {{which are}} listed as a Locally Significant Area in the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory, {{are located in the}} {{watershed}} of Hunlock Creek in Plymouth Township. These slopes are on the northern side of Shickshinny Mountain and contain second-growth northern hardwood forests and some rock outcroppings with small seeps. The area contains a large number of wildflower species and some rare plants. The main tree species in this area include American basswood, sugar maple, white ash, white oak, black cherry, and <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another study {{observed}} {{the effects of}} loss of foundation <b>Eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> (Tsuga canadensis) in a forest ecosystem. <b>Eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> are a foundation species in eastern North American forests, but have been threatened by the accidental introduction of woolly adelgid. This study {{observed the}} effects that a loss in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Hemlocks</b> {{would have on the}} populations of arthropods, such as ants, beetles, and spiders, since these species are known indicators of environmental change. The results found that in areas of hemlock removal, there was an overall increase and influx of arthropod species. Researchers suggested that this was due to an increase in open habitats from the loss of the hemlocks. The results of this hemlock study corroborated with those from the previous McKenzie Flats study discussed in that the loss of foundation species led to a proliferation of species diversity in the affected area. These results seem to contradict a long-standing belief that foundation species {{play a vital role in}} communities and ecosystems by creating habitats for organisms, suggesting that in some circumstances they bottleneck species diversity.|$|R
25|$|Trunk {{volume is}} the third {{dimension}} to receive attention by ENTS. Many <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> have been modeled to over 30m³ trunk volume, and the largest has been calculated to be 44.8 m³, making it the largest natural evergreen conifer in the eastern United States. The center of maximum size development for the species is the southern Appalachians, especially the Great Smoky Mountains.|$|R
50|$|Despite its name, {{there are}} very few natural pine trees around Pines Lake. The area is mostly forested in black oak, white oak, and red oak along with {{flowering}} dogwoods and American beech. There are groves of mature <b>Eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> that may have been mistaken for pine trees. The Glen is forested with mature oaks, hemlocks, and beech, including American sycamores along the stream banks.|$|R
5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock,</b> eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E
5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock.</b> The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|Mahoning Creek lacks a {{riparian}} buffer in some places. However, the Mahoning Creek floodplain and {{the nearby}} slopes are listed as a Locally Significant site on the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory. <b>Eastern</b> <b>hemlock</b> trees inhabit the slopes and river birch, silver maple, and silky dogwood inhabit the floodplain itself. American basswood also grows {{in the vicinity of}} the creek here. Additionally, spring wildflowers grow in this area. The site has a high level of plant biodiversity. However, many trees in the area are affected by an aphid species known as the hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
50|$|Boreal {{species at}} Ice Mountain include bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), Appalachian wood fern (Gymnocarpium appalachianum), Canada {{mayflower}} (Maianthemum canadense), minniebush (Menziesia pilosa), mountain maple (Acer spicatum), nannyberry (Viburnum lentago), northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), prickly gooseberry (Ribes cynosbati), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), purple virgin's bower (Clematis occidentalis), shale barren primrose (Oenothera argillicola), skunk currant (Ribes glandulosum), starflower (Trientalis borealis), and twinflower (Linnaea borealis). <b>Eastern</b> <b>Hemlocks</b> (Tsuga canadensis) provide shade to and cool the mountain's ice vents.|$|R
50|$|The park is forested with mature <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlocks.</b> Deer, {{overpopulated}} on the island, eat most of {{the young}} hemlocks. In time red pines and spruces may become dominant. Small fenced plots are scattered throughout the island to protect saplings and undergrowth from the deer. In 1977, a tornado touched down on the north-central part of the island, leveling 18 acre. The tornado left so much debris that the park was closed until spring 1978 for cleanup. Today, this area is regenerating with birch trees.|$|R
50|$|In 1885, as {{the state}} {{legislature}} was considering the bill that created the Adirondack Park, Ulster County {{was trying to get}} out of paying delinquent property taxes that, under the law passed over its objections six years earlier, it owed the state. The lands, mostly around Slide Mountain had come into the county's possession when loggers looking to extract tannin for use in tanning leather from the bark of the many <b>Eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> growing there at the time, took the trees, made their money and then left the region without paying taxes.|$|R
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{southern}} Blue Ridge Mountains, the area surrounding the lake consists of many valleys, ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions, starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1.5 billion years ago. The resulting landscape created diverse topology containing many different species of plants and animal. Much of the area is similar to Pennsylvania in climate, vegetation and wildlife. The lake is near the southern limit for <b>Eastern</b> <b>hemlock</b> and Eastern white pine. Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. Forests surrounding the lake contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Painted Trillium, which grows near Rhododrendron. Boulderfields near Sosebee Cove include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E

25|$|Tsuga canadensis, {{also known}} as <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock,</b> eastern hemlock-spruce or Canadian hemlock, and in the French-speaking regions of Canada as pruche du Canada, is a {{coniferous}} tree native to eastern North America. It is the state tree of Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|Scott's Run Nature Preserve is {{a nature}} {{preserve}} in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. Located in McLean, it is bordered by Virginia State Route 193 to its south, Interstate 495 to its {{east and the}} Potomac River to its north. It encompasses 336 acre of woodland with its namesake, Scott's Run, flowing through its west side. Scott's Run originates in nearby Tysons Corner and enters the Potomac on the northwest side of the preserve. The preserve is noted for including <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> among its plant life, which are rare for the area. It is a popular destination for recreation and hiking and is operated by the Fairfax County Park Authority.|$|R

25|$|Tree species {{native to}} Whitchurch–Stouffville include: American Mountain Ash, Balsam Fir, Bitternut Hickory, Black Cherry, Black Spruce, Bur Oak, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Hemlock,</b> Eastern White Cedar, Peachleaf Willow, Pin Cherry, Red Oak, Red Maple, Red Pine, Shagbark Hickory, Silver Maple, Sugar Maple, Tamarack, Trembling Aspen, White Birch, White Oak, White Pine and White Spruce. In 2012, Whitchurch–Stouffville's forest cover was 28.9%.|$|E
25|$|Infestation by an {{invasive}} species, the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid, {{resulted in}} the death of large stands of mature <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock</b> in Penwood State Park on Talcott Mountain. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection began a program of removal of dead trees and contaminated living trees in 2000. The infestation and subsequent tree removal dramatically impacted the character of the forests on that part of the mountain.|$|E
25|$|Because of its low elevation, {{the forests}} on Mount Tremper are {{dominated}} by a forest type {{referred to in the}} Catskills as southern hardwoods. This is dominated by oak, hickory and pine species, with some basswood and poplar scattered in lower elevations. Chestnut were once common as well, but most died off in the blight of the early 20th century. Some <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlocks,</b> once more widespread before they were harvested for their tannin-rich bark, remain, primarily higher on the mountain where the barkpeelers never reached. The summit ridge has some areas of the northern hardwood forest (beech, birch and maple) more common on higher Catskill slopes. The more shade-tolerant northern hardwoods are slowly invading the southern hardwoods as an understory; due to the cessation of human intervention in the forest they will eventually displace the southern hardwoods.|$|R
50|$|The Nature Conservancy, {{with the}} help of volunteers, has worked to control {{non-native}} invasive species to protect and preserve Ice Mountain's rare and native plant species. These invasive species include tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), and Japanese stilt grass (Microstegium vimineum). The Nature Conservancy has also partnered with the United States Forest Service to prevent the deaths of <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> (Tsuga canadensis) due to the hemlock woolly adelgid. The Nature Conservancy has worked with West Virginia University geologists to preserve and prevent the mountain's ice vents from succumbing to effects associated with climate change. The melting of the ice vents warms the soil's temperature which threatens the survival of the boreal species that thrive there. The Nature Conservancy also continues to monitor the natural forest regeneration throughout the areas of Ice Mountain effected by a 2008 tornado.|$|R
40|$|When European {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the land that is now the northeastern United States, they found a vast forest with rich living resources. Stretching from the Coastal Plains to the Mississippi River was an environment shaped by trees. The climate, soils, and glacial history produced a forest that was unique in the world. In the 300 years since the arrival of Europeans, however, human activities have drastically changed this landscape. Still, as immense as the changes have been, they largely altered the appearance, but not the processes, of the ecosystems of the Northeast. A comparison of pictures of the Northeast from the 1700 ’s with the 1900 ’s would reveal striking differences. Early Europeans encountered great forests of American beeches, maples, birches, <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlocks,</b> and spruces from New England to northern Pennsylvania, and oaks, hickories, American chestnuts, and pines from Maryland through Ohio. Inhabiting these great forests were many wildlife populations...|$|R
25|$|The {{forests of}} the Catskills {{generally}} (though not those around Balsam Lake and its neighboring peaks) had been heavily exploited {{over the course of}} the 19th century by various forest-product industries, particularly tanning, which depended on the bark of the <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock</b> for tannin, and left many stands of peeled first-growth trees to rot and die when they had taken all the usable bark. Loggers harvested commercial-grade timber for furniture and made charcoal in open pits in the woods.|$|E
25|$|In {{southern}} Michigan {{and northern}} Indiana, which are {{mainly in the}} oak-hickory and elm-ash-cottonwood cover types, trees utilized as roosts include green, white, and black ash (Fraxinus nigra), silver maple, shagbark hickory, and American elm. And finally, in the southern areas of the Indiana bat's range (primarily Tennessee, Arkansas, and northern Alabama), which include the oak-hickory and oak-pine cover types, Indiana bats utilize shagbark hickory, white oak, red oak, pitch pine (P. rigida), shortleaf pine (P. echinata), loblolly pine (P. taeda), sweet birch (Betula lenta), and <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock</b> (Tsuga canadensis).|$|E
25|$|The High Alleghenies {{are noted}} for their forests of red spruce, balsam fir, and {{mountain}} ash, trees typically found much farther north. Hardwood forests also include yellow birch, sugar and red maple, <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock,</b> and black cherry. American beech, pine and hickory {{can also be}} found. The forests of the entire region are now almost all second- or third-growth forests, the original trees having been removed in the late 19th and (in West Virginia) early 20th centuries. The wild onion known as the ramp (Allium tricoccum) is also present in the deeper forests.|$|E
40|$|Micromechanical {{properties}} that help mediate herbivore access {{may be particularly}} important when considering herbivorous insects that feed with piercing-sucking stylets. We used microindentation to quantify the micromechanical properties of hemlock, Tsuga spp., to quantify the hardness of the feeding site of the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae. We measured hardness of the hemlock leaf cushion, the stylet insertion point of the adelgid, across four seasons in a 1 y period for four hemlock species growing in a common garden, including eastern, western, mountain, and northern Japanese hemlocks. Leaf cushion hardness was highest {{in the fall and}} winter and lowest in summer for all species. Northern Japanese hemlock had relatively greater hardness than the remaining species. Our data contributes an additional perspective to the existing framework within which greater susceptibility and subsequent mortality of <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> is observed. The potential application of microindentation to understanding the nature and relevance of plant mechanical defenses in plant–herbivore interactions is also demonstrated and highlighted...|$|R
25|$|The {{mountain}} {{was first}} known as Timothyberg, {{in the vernacular}} of the early Dutch settlers of the Catskills. The area was first settled in the 1780s. Its location near the creeks and valleys made it ideal for barkpeeling, the first major industry of the Catskills. Bark from the many <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> on its slopes was {{a rich source of}} tannin, and leather hides were often brought to the region to be tanned. The creek valley made it possible to easily transport them to and from the Hudson River at Kingston to the east, and the later development of the Ulster and Delaware Railroad (UDRR) made it even easier. The road up {{the south side of the}} mountain, which forest historian Michael Kudish calls the best example of an extant bark road in the Catskills, was built for this purpose. By the end of the century, since a synthetic process for creating tannin had made it less necessary to harvest large acres of forest, it was being used for quarrying instead.|$|R
25|$|The native {{trees of}} the Paudash Lake area include the silver, red, sugar, mountain, and striped maple; the jack, red, and white pine; the largetooth and {{trembling}} aspen; the yellow and white birch; black, white, and possibly red spruce; the bur and red oak; the white, black, and red ash; the pin, black, and choke cherry, and the balsam fir, <b>eastern</b> tsuga (<b>hemlock),</b> tamarack (larch), balsam poplar, white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), American beech, ironwood (Ostrya virginiana), and speckled alder.|$|R
25|$|According to Catskill forest {{historian}} Michael Kudish, the Slide wilderness {{contains the}} most extensive tract of first-growth forest in the Catskills. Much of the area remained out of reach during the peak years of logging and barkpeeling from <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock</b> trees, to make tannin for leather production in the mid-19th century and thus remained largely untouched. Indeed, the upper valley of the East Branch of the Neversink, located centrally within the SMWA, is the only completely wild valley in the Catskills. It is possible to look out over it from several points on the surrounding mountains and see no evidence of civilization.|$|E
25|$|East Rock hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Cooler north facing backslopes tend to support extensive stands of <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock</b> interspersed with the oak-hickory forest species more common in the surrounding lowlands. Narrow ravines crowded with hemlock block sunlight, creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in eastern Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlers}} {{came to the}} Salt Springs area in the 1790s, {{and found}} an area of unbroken forest that was dominated by the <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlock</b> tree. The settlers focused on clearing the land for farming. Many of the trees were simply burned, while others were used to build log cabins. Eventually the settlers began stripping the hemlocks of their bark for use in tanneries, while other trees were harvested for the lumber industry. Sawmills soon appeared on Silver Creek and other streams in the area. However, not all the old hemlocks were harvested. Those still standing in and about Fall Brook Gorge were left because the area had become a recreation destination {{as soon as the}} early 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|At lower elevations, {{the many}} fires that have raged {{over the region}} have left it with a mixed forest where oak and pine predominate. Several large areas of Norway spruce were planted on the north slopes of Windham High Peak during {{reforestation}} efforts following state land acquisitions in the 1930s. Due {{to the history of}} fires and logging on the northern sections of the range, there are very few areas of first-growth remaining outside of the boreal plots. The largest is the summit of Blackhead; the largest hardwood first-growth is likewise the [...] around the summit of Windham High Peak. The <b>eastern</b> <b>hemlocks</b> around Spruce Creek below Kaaterskill Falls are also a virgin stand. They survived the era when tanners sought the species for the tannin in its bark since the steep and perilous nature of that terrain made them too difficult to profitably extract. It and many of the other ravines draining into Kaaterskill Clove also support some plants species rare in New York State, such as roseroot stonecrop and fragrant cliff fern (listed as threatened and endangered at the state level, respectively).|$|R
50|$|Kase Run {{begins in}} a small pond {{immediately}} south of Styer Road in <b>eastern</b> West <b>Hemlock</b> Township.
