40|$|Heat {{measurement}} errors cause large revenue discrepancies {{in the district}} heating industry. Some of these errors are static and can be estimated using standard error analysis, but the largest error cause is the dynamic load such systems are subject to, {{as in the case}} of warm water tapping. The frequency at which <b>heat</b> <b>meters</b> estimate and update the energy is either constant or depends on the flow rate. They are often battery operated and their power consumption is proportional to their estimation frequency. <b>Heat</b> <b>meters</b> with a flow rate dependent estimation frequency are usually based on volume-flow meters. They are widely used in district heating due to their lower estimation frequency, which prolongs their battery life. Such devices are inaccurate especially at low flow rates.

This method reduces the heat measurement error due to the dynamics of the system while minimizing the battery power consumption.

40|$|This thesis gives {{a summary}} of {{different}} faults that occur in district heating substations and suggests ways of detecting them. The {{aim of the research}} has been to achieve fault detection using only the <b>heat</b> <b>meter</b> and the sensors connected to it, namely two temperature sensors and one flow meter. The incentive for fault detecting district heating substations comes from an effort to keep them in proper working order so as {{to be able to keep}} a low return temperature in the network and thus be able to lower the supply temperature. Hypothetically, if the supply temperature in Sweden were lowered by only one degree, the annual savings would be about SEK 50 million. The thesis also entails brief accounts of district heating and heat metering along with two models of heat exchangers. The first paper in this thesis presents a way of fault detecting the temperature sensors by detecting the noise amplitude. The second paper describes how to separate the energy usage for heating and domestic hot water production using only one <b>heat</b> <b>meter.</b> Energy separation is very interesting, since separate measurement of domestic hot water energy usage and heating usage is recommended by the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. The third paper describes how to estimate hot water consumption using the hot water energy consumption and measurement of cold water and hot water temperature. It also contains an error analysis of the estimate. The error analysis suggests that the estimate using a class 1 <b>heat</b> <b>meter</b> is as accurate as the measurement using a class- 3 flow meter. Thus, the two estimation methods presented can be used instead of installing extra heat meters or flow meters. This makes it possible to implement the separate measurement(s) according to the recommended guidelines at a lower cost. Godkänd; 2005; 20060922 (ysko) Fjärrvärm...|$|E
