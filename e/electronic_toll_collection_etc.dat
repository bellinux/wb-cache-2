5|$|The A1 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming a unified toll system. Since the two motorways are operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and debit cards and using a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC – an <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> (<b>ETC)</b> which is shared at all motorways in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at toll plazas and a discounted toll rates.|$|E
5|$|The E751 mostly {{consists}} of motorways, but considerable sections are either expressways or two-lane roads with at-grade intersections. All motorway {{sections of the}} E751 are tolled, using the <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> (<b>ETC)</b> and ticket systems. Since the 1980s, the E751 has gradually been upgraded from a regular two-lane road to motorway standards, and further upgrades are still being carried out or planned in some areas, particularly in the Rijeka–Kanfanar section and in the section located in Slovenia.

5|$|Since June 2011, the E751 {{comprises}} the Croatian A8 and A9 tolled motorways of the Istrian Y. The tolls there {{are based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed-toll system. Tolls charged along the A9 motorway toll plazas vary depending on the length of route traveled and range from 3.00 kuna (€0.40) to 26.00 kuna (€3.51) for passenger cars and 15.00 kuna (€2.02) to 185.00 kuna (€25.00) for semi-trailer trucks. Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A user of {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars or up to 205.00 kuna (€27.70) for semi-trailers, depending on vehicle classification in Croatia.

40|$|Freeways and expressways are {{considered}} {{an important part}} of any successful transportation system. These facilities carry the majority of daily trips on the transportation network. Although expressways (Toll Roads) offer high level of service, and {{are considered}} the safest among other types of roads, traditional toll plazas may have both safety and operational challenges. The traditional toll facilities still experience many crashes, many of which are severe. Therefore, the main focus {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the effect of tollbooths’ number and types (i. e. cashier lanes, coin lanes and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Toll</b> <b>Collections</b> (<b>ETC)</b> lanes) on safety performance at traditional toll plazas. The literature showed that about 30 to 40 percent of the total crashes on expressways occur at these facilities. An extensive data collection was conducted that included 42 traditional mainline toll plazas located on approximately 750 miles of expressways in Florida, and multiple analytical techniques were used. Based on the finding in this paper, choosing locations for the toll plazas that have safe distances from the interchanges, installing flashing lights at night time, and finding ways to improve signage and road marking are potential means of reducing lane changes before tollbooths.
