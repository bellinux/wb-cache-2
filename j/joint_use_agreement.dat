40|$|Recent {{studies have}} emerged linking {{physical}} activity with improved academic performance, classroom behavior and school attendance among children and youth. 1 Yet, some communities lack safe and accessible places {{for children to}} play and some schools lack adequate facilities and resources for physical activity and physical education programs. 2 A strategy to expand physical activity opportunities, programs and services for students, staff and the community involves the district or county office of education (COE) jointly sharing recreational facilities with another governmental agency, community-based organization or the community before, during and/or after the school day. This strategy involves sharing program costs, liability, maintenance and operations. This approach {{is commonly known as}} “joint use ” because the school and other entity jointly use one or more facilities, such as gymnasiums, pools, playgrounds, school yards, playing fields, tracks and/or multi-purpose rooms. Policies and practices that provide opportunities for physical activity, such as safe and available open space, indoor/outdoor facilities and physical activity programs and equipment, can help promote healthy behaviors, improve academic outcomes and prevent childhood obesity. In a time of shrinking budgets for school districts/ COEs and local governments, <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> projects provide an opportunity to work together to identify creative solutions to achieve shared goals and priorities (see CSBA’s sample board policy BP 1330. 1 – <b>Joint</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Agreements).</b> Common examples of <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> include: 1) The district/COE opens existing school recreational facilities for public use during non-school hours. For example, San Francisco Unified School District and the City and County of San Francisco have an agreement that allows the City to unlock the outdoor playground areas for open, unsupervised use during non-school hours when such use does not conflict with educational or school co-curricular activities.

BOAC contributed 70% of the new company's capital and eight Boeing 707s. Cunard Eagle's long-haul scheduled operation — including the two new 707s — was absorbed into BOAC-Cunard before delivery of the second 707, in June 1962. BOAC-Cunard leased any spare aircraft capacity to BOAC to augment the BOAC mainline fleet at peak times. As part of this deal, BOAC-Cunard also bought flying hours from BOAC for using the latter's aircraft {{in the event of}} capacity shortfalls. This maximised combined fleet utilisation.

40|$|The {{published}} and research literature on <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> libraries relates mostly to school community libraries, which are normally combina-tions {{of high school}} and public libraries.

There has been an American presence at Aviano Air Base {{since the end of}} World War II. In 1954 the Italian and American governments signed a <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> <b>agreement</b> and by 1955, HQ United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) had moved its Italian operations from Udine to Aviano. The base went through a period of hosting rotational fighter squadrons. With the declining use of the Italian live fire range, the rotational squadrons became a thing of the past. Aviano became a war reserve material storage base and played a big part in Desert Storm. In 1992, HQ 16th Air Force and the 401st Fighter Wing moved from Torrejon Air Base, Spain to Aviano. The Wing became home to two F-16 fighter squadrons, the 510th FS and the 555th FS. Both squadrons relocated from Ramstein AB in 1994 and redesignated. The wing was redesignated from the 401st Fighter Wing to the 31st Fighter Wing in 1994 as Aviano took on permanently based aircraft {{for the first time in}} over 50 years.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to present a case study of In-Motion, a pilot <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> <b>agreement</b> project at one urban high school in Honolulu, Hawaii. ContextResidents of urban Honolulu are underserved by the amount of parkland and recreational facilities available for their use. The Honolulu County Department of Parks and Recreation sought to implement a <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> <b>agreement</b> to use the facilities of one urban high school for a recreational program. The high school selected for the pilot project has a student population primarily from low-income and ethnic minority backgrounds. MethodsAn assessment of the potential of 7 urban high schools to implement a <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> <b>agreement</b> was conducted to select the pilot site. In-Motion developed and implemented a <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> <b>agreement.</b> PA preferences of students, staff, and community members were assessed to guide recreational program offerings. Various recreational classes were offered free to the school community. ConsequencesSeveral barriers to implementing the <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> <b>agreement</b> and recreational program were encountered.

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to discuss the {{establishment}} of <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> libraries as something more than just administrative collaboration. It focuses on <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> solutions between public libraries and university college libraries. Normative institutionalism is used as a theoretical framework for the discussion, which draws from studies on and experiences of the establishment of two <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> libraries in Sweden: Sambiblioteket in H??rn??sand and Almedalsbiblioteket in Visby. Conclusions are drawn that show that the establishment of <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> libraries is a very complex process of change. Norms and values of the collaborating units are challenged, and the institutional identities of participating libraries as well as the professional identities of the librarians are subject to change. This is due to a shift in normative institutional identity, which makes it possible to claim that <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> libraries may actually be regarded as a new form of library with a unique identity. In claiming this, a need for further library and information science research on <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> libraries is called for. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

40|$|Schools often {{represent}} the largest, single community public infrastructure investment. In light of this, California's Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is {{in a unique}} and critical position as it attempts to undertake the largest, single capital improvement campaign in the Nation's history. With a growing public investment of $ 19. 2 billion for local schools, LAUSD's efforts create an opportunity to attract greater physical, programming and economic resources <b>using</b> a <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> school development approach. Through <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> development, LAUSD acts as a development anchor, driving community and economic development by leveraging resources from public and private entities. The benefits of <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> include greater overall project value; public investment maximizing; more efficient use of scarce community resources; and increased number of resources available to local communities. In order to achieve these goals, LAUSD recently adopted a formal <b>Joint</b> <b>Use</b> Program that lays out a strategy for identifying community resource needs, seeking out <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> opportunities, and outreaching to potential partners. (cont.) Despite these efforts, however, <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> remains an incidental development activity that lacks full integration within LAUSD's overarching school development framework. Hence this thesis examines LAUSD's current <b>Joint</b> <b>Use</b> Program in context of its ongoing capital improvement campaign, policy development and past implementation efforts. Based on review of District reports, policies, independent case studies, and interviews, this thesis examines current implementation challenges and advances recommendations for improving LAUSD's <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> practice.
