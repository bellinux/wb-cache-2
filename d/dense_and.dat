5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental {{to our understanding of}} the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently <b>dense,</b> <b>and</b> hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have <b>dense</b> <b>and</b> flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
5|$|Acacia pycnantha {{was first}} {{formally}} described by botanist George Bentham in the London Journal of Botany in 1842. The type specimen was {{collected by the}} explorer Thomas Mitchell in present-day northern Victoria between Pyramid Hill and the Loddon River. Bentham thought it was related to A. leiophylla, which he described in the same paper. The specific epithet pycnantha {{is derived from the}} Greek words pyknos (<b>dense)</b> <b>and</b> anthos (flowers), a reference to the dense cluster of flowers that make up the globular inflorescences. Queensland botanist Les Pedley reclassified the species as Racosperma pycnanthum in 2003, when he proposed placing almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus Racosperma. However, this name is treated as a synonym of its original name.|$|E

5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek {{on the southern}} flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less <b>dense</b> <b>and</b> rises {{back to the surface}} along fissures or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because they seem to represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E
5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very <b>dense,</b> <b>and</b> prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious <b>dense</b> <b>and</b> heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E
30|$|In realizing memristor-based {{synaptic}} systems, a crossbar circuit {{that is made}} of only passive memristors can {{be thought}} of as the <b>densest</b> <b>and</b> simplest architecture among various synaptic circuits that have been developed previously. If a crossbar circuit is made of both memristors and selectors such as transistors and diodes, this kind of hybrid-type crossbar circuit is difficult to be stacked layer by layer. Thus, the pure crossbar circuit with only passive memristors can be a key element to implement the <b>densest</b> <b>and</b> simplest three-dimensional architecture of neuromorphic systems.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} descriptive {{evidence about}} the distribution of wages <b>and</b> skills in <b>denser</b> <b>and</b> less <b>dense</b> employment areas in France. We confirm that on average, workers in denser areas are more skilled. There is also strong over-representation of workers with particularly high and low skills in denser areas. These features are consistent with patterns of migration including negative selection of migrants to less <b>dense</b> areas <b>and</b> positive selection towards denser areas. Nonetheless migration, even in the long run, accounts for little of the skill differences between <b>denser</b> <b>and</b> less <b>dense</b> areas. Finally, we find marked differences across age groups and some suggestions {{that much of the}} skill differences across areas can be explained by differences between occupational groups rather than within...|$|R
