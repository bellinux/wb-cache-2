30|$|The {{purpose of}} fire {{blocking}} technologies {{is to reduce}} the flammability of soft furnishings by preventing or delaying direct flame impingement and heat transfer from the flames or molten polymer to the core components. In addition to fire/flame resistance, other desirable properties of fire blocking materials include good handle and drape properties (which <b>impact</b> <b>comfort),</b> durability to wear and tear, cleaning, etc. (which impact service life), and neutral color (which may impact covering fabric appearance, especially for materials under white mattress tickings). As indicated earlier, the flammability behavior of soft furnishings is exceptionally complex because of the large number of variations in materials, construction, and geometries. As a component of a consumer product, fire blocking materials must be cost-effective and not negatively impact the aesthetics, comfort, and durability of the soft furnishings. The number of fire blocking technologies (woven and nonwoven fabrics, FR coatings, and FR PUF) available is quite large to accommodate the requirements of consumers, manufacturers, and regulatory agencies.|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of housing is {{a significant factor in}} greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently Australia has recently introduced legislation to control the {{environmental impact}} of future construction by imposing energy efficiency targets. This has highlighted not only the poor thermal performance of conventional housing (operating energy) but also the irrationality of ignoring the significant {{environmental impact of}} the building process itself (the embodied energy). Consequently {{there is a need for}} developments in sustainable building techniques. The project reported here focuses on a concrete surface and rammed earth core walling system that promises significant improvements in environmental <b>impact,</b> <b>comfort</b> and cost (construction and running cost). The construction uses mainly local natural materials with little high energy processing thus reducing the embodied energy of the construction. In addition to using local materials, only basic building skills are required and hence the system is ideally suited to rural areas and has potentially world-wide application.

40|$|This {{proposal}} is a Diploma Project developed at School of Architecture and Urbanism at University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in December 2007. The project {{is based on}} principles of sustainable concepts {{that can be applied}} for a building. Thus, it has tried to join social, economic and environmental aspects. The construction is composed of three linked up blocks: an educational center, a paper recycling factory, and a restaurant. The needs of the program was defined by the surrounding area context and by researches made at the city hall and some private entities. The solution chosen for this matter considered the area features. That means that the focus was given to environment, approaching the river to the community and valuing the green area that already exists. Also, it focused on social insertion once it was designed to be a vocational center, helping people to develop their skills and to learn a profession. In short, this paper shows that sustainable strategies can be taken at any stage of a project, from the choice of materials to the concern for social characteristics of the region.

40|$|This article {{claims that}} the {{contents}} of energy conservation information policy instruments must be better adapted to household members’ everyday life experiences in order to capture their interest and transform information into action. The article elaborates on how to ground energy policy information in the everyday doings and strivings of households. Using two time-geographical concepts, i. e. activity and project, we investigate how people understand and define their energy-related activities as parts of overarching everyday projects {{with a focus on}} the constraints on energy conservation. The analysis is empirically based on interview data from a case study of households’ use of renewable heating technologies. The results illustrate how peoples’ heating activities are related to everyday projects such as reducing environmental <b>impact,</b> <b>comfort</b> for a convenient daily life, the household budget balance, learning about and/or maintaining home technologies and hobbies. One conclusion is that information instruments focusing solely on one or two such projects might hamper the translation from information to action and also limit the number of people interested in or able to access the information. Another conclusion is that the growing use of energy-efficient technologies might influence new habits and perceptions of the everyday use of energy, making common economic motives for saving energy less useful. Anchoring energy-related information and support in the everyday activities and projects of households would facilitate the translation process. If this is achieved, information could prove a useful instrument in the broader reorganization of societal institutions in a sustainable direction.

40|$|Background The {{prevalence}} of chronic illness {{has increased dramatically}} worldwide {{and will continue to}} grow. As such, one of the major challenges at present is to find ways to increase patients’ health and quality of life {{while at the same time}} keeping healthcare costs within bounds. As in-hospital healthcare is labor-intensive and costly as well as limited in reach and scalability, there is a growing need for remote health monitoring and care provision to patients at home, as is done in telehealth context. The effectiveness of these programs has been shown to depend for a large part on a patient’s self-management, making the provision of psychosocial care an essential element of a disease management program (cf. Lorig &Holman, 2003). However, technology-based solutions for providing psycho-social care for chronic patients are at present scarce, and if existent, limited in their scope. In the current study, the aim was to include psychosocial coaching in a telehealth program. Psycho-social care covers a range of psychological and social factors which are important to chronically ill patients’ (ability to deal with) physical and mental health. It is important for healthcare providers to obtain an understanding of each individual patient’s needs to direct intervention efforts. To that end, we developed an online tool (More About You, henceforth MAY) which entails an assessment, leading to an enriched understanding of the patient (the profile) in an automated way and automatically suggests techniques for intervention. The pilot study described aimed to examine the feasibility and usability of the MAY for psychosocial care in a telehealth program; i. e. if structured care planning can be implemented in the regular work processes of the health coaches and if health coaches appreciate working with MAY. Description MAY provides a psychosocial profile of each patient, comprising factors that signify patients’ strengths and barriers related to disease management. The following factors are included: disease <b>impact,</b> <b>comfort</b> with technology, communication style preferences, coping style, patient activation (PAM; Hibbard 2004), ability for self-care, social support and well-being. The self-report questionnaire has 65 questions and is administered online. The resulting profile provides the starting point for health coaches (HCs) to choose and prioritize the needs of each individual patient in a structured and evidence-based manner. Furthermore, the MAY contains recommendations for intervention per psychosocial topic, so that communication and interventions can be tailored to specific needs. To embed MAY into a coaching process, we devised a structured psychosocial care planning approach. This structured approach includes a planning and review (PAR) form to support planning and tracking of coach visits. First, HCs and patients fill out the MAY assessment together on a laptop, during a regular home visit. Next, the HCs discuss the outcomes with their supervisor, a social worker (SW). Together, they plan the first structured coaching meeting with the patient: from the MAY profile they identify the most urgent needs, and decide on the coaching actions. After the coaching sessions, HCs use this form to describe what has been done, the results, future plans, and a review of the meeting. The study was designed as an experimental study with one intervention condition. Thirteen health coaches (HCs) participated; each implementing the MAY tool for structured psychosocial care with 2 patients. All patients were members of the Philips Intensive Ambulatory Care pilot telehealth program, and had at least 5 chronic illnesses. All HCs received training in MAY usage, like filling out the assessment and intervention techniques. At the end of the training and at the end of the study, HCs filled out the baseline survey on determinants of implementation, based on the MIDI (Fleuren, 2014). Descriptive statistics were used for analysis as to increase insight in determinants of usability. All the PAR forms were sent to the research team anonymously and consequently analyzed in a qualitative way in order to gain insight in the planning and reviewing process and thus feasibility. Results: The surveys showed that coaches had positive attitudes towards working with MAY. Improvements between pre- and post survey were seen in aspects related to perceived knowledge and confidence about providing psychosocial care. HCs appreciated the structure and the insights that the protocol provided, and how it helped them reach their goals. They were however critical of the additional workload and did not always see the added benefit of the PAR form. From the HC PAR forms, it became clear that the HCs are using the MAY recommendations to plan their coaching sessions. Noticeably, the language use suggests that it was difficult to translate the recommendations from MAY into concrete actions. The forms revealed that often goals were not set or were incomplete, and there was a lack of detail in the provided information and in the provision of next steps for coaching. HCs mostly reported that the coaching went well. Conclusions The results show that the structured, partly automated approach can be used in a telehealth context by means of health coaches. MAY appeared to be a suitable tool for providing input for psychosocial care. HCs attitudes towards the structured approach were positive, which is crucial to the success of the implementation of MAY. Based on these results, we recommend to continue this approach as it may strengthen the wellbeing of patients (to be evaluated in future work). However, improvements are necessary. The tool should get a better fit in the current working procedures, and support the translation from recommendations to action. Further automation may facilitate this. In conclusion, this study shows that it is possible for HCs to implement structured psychosocial care in a telehealth program but that combining digitalized and human efforts in one structure is a challenge. The appreciation of the health coaches is an important first step in this process...|$|E
40|$|Background More {{than one}} in five {{patients}} who undergo treatment for breast cancer will develop breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). BCRL can occur {{as a result of}} breast cancer surgery and/or radiation therapy. BCRL can negatively <b>impact</b> <b>comfort,</b> function, and quality of life (QoL). Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), a type of hands-on therapy, is frequently used for BCRL and often as part of complex decongestive therapy (CDT). CDT is a fourfold conservative treatment which includes MLD, compression therapy (consisting of compression bandages, compression sleeves, or other types of compression garments), skin care, and lymph-reducing exercises (LREs). Phase 1 of CDT is to reduce swelling; Phase 2 is to maintain the reduced swelling. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of MLD in treating BCRL. Search methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform), and Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register from root to 24 May 2013. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of women with BCRL. The intervention was MLD. The primary outcomes were (1) volumetric changes, (2) adverse events. Secondary outcomes were (1) function, (2) subjective sensations, (3) QoL, (4) cost of care. Data collection and analysis We collected data on three volumetric outcomes. (1) LE (lymphedema) volume was defined as the amount of excess fluid left in the arm after treatment, calculated as volume in mL of affected arm post-treatment minus unaffected arm post-treatment. (2) Volume reduction was defined as the amount of fluid reduction in mL from before to after treatment calculated as the pretreatment LE volume of the affected arm minus the post-treatment LE volume of the affected arm. (3) Per cent reduction was defined as the proportion of fluid reduced relative to the baseline excess volume, calculated as volume reduction divided by baseline LE volume multiplied by 100. We entered trial data into ReviewManger 5. 2 (RevMan), pooled data using a fixed-effect model, and analyzed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). We also explored subgroups to determine whether mild BCRL compared to moderate or severe BCRL, and BCRL less than a year compared to more than a year was associated with a better response to MLD. Main results Six trials were included. Based on similar designs, trials clustered in three categories. (1) MLD + standard physiotherapy versus standard physiotherapy (one trial) showed significant improvements in both groups from baseline but no significant between-groups differences for per cent reduction. (2) MLD + compression bandaging versus compression bandaging (two trials) showed significant per cent reductions of 30 % to 38. 6 % for compression bandaging alone, and an additional 7. 11 % reduction forMLD (MD 7. 11 %, 95 % CI 1. 75 % to 12. 47 %; two RCTs; 83 participants). Volume reduction was borderline significant (P = 0. 06). LE volume was not significant. Subgroup analyses was significant showing that participants with mild-to-moderate BCRL were better responders to MLD than were moderate-to-severe participants. (3) MLD+ compression therapy versus nonMLDtreatment + compression therapy (three trials) were too varied to pool. One of the trials compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus pneumatic pump. Volume reduction was statistically significant favoringMLD (MD 47. 00 mL, 95 % CI 15. 25 mL to 78. 75 mL; 1 RCT; 24 participants), per cent reduction was borderline significant (P= 0. 07), and LE volume was not significant. A second trial compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus selfadministered simple lymphatic drainage (SLD), and was significant forMLD for LE volume (MD - 230. 00 mL, 95 % CI - 450. 84 mL to - 9. 16 mL; 1 RCT; 31 participants) but not for volume reduction or per cent reduction. A third trial of MLD + compression bandaging versus SLD + compression bandaging was not significant (P = 0. 10) for per cent reduction, the only outcome measured (MD 11. 80 %, 95 % CI - 2. 47 % to 26. 07 %, 28 participants). MLD was well tolerated and safe in all trials. Two trials measured function as range of motion with conflicting results. One trial reported significant within-groups gains for both groups, but no between-groups differences. The other trial reported there were no significant within-groups gains and did not report between-groups results. One trial measured strength and reported no significant changes in either group. Two trials measured QoL, but results were not usable because one trial did not report any results, and the other trial did not report between-groups results. Four trials measured sensations such as pain and heaviness. Overall, the sensations were significantly reduced in both groups over baseline, but with no between-groups differences. No trials reported cost of care. Trials were small ranging from 24 to 45 participants. Most trials appeared to randomize participants adequately. However, in four trials the person measuring the swelling knew what treatment the participants were receiving, and this could have biased results. Authors' conclusions MLD is safe and may offer additional benefit to compression bandaging for swelling reduction. Compared to individuals with moderate to-severe BCRL, those with mild-to-moderate BCRL may be the ones who benefit from adding MLD to an intensive course of treatment with compression bandaging. This finding, however, needs to be confirmed by randomized data. In trials where MLD and sleeve were compared with a nonMLD treatment and sleeve, volumetric outcomes were inconsistent within the same trial. Research is needed to identify themost clinically meaningful volumetric measurement, to incorporate newer technologies in LE assessment, and to assess other clinically relevant outcomes such as fibrotic tissue formation. Findings were contradictory for function (range of motion), and inconclusive for quality of life. For symptoms such as pain and heaviness, 60 % to 80 % of participants reported feeling better regardless of which treatment they received. One-year follow-up suggests that once swelling had been reduced, participants were likely to keep their swelling down if they continued to use a custom-made sleeve...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} passenger comfort as {{an experience}} {{generated by the}} cabin interior features. The findings of previous studies are affirmed regarding a set of 22 context features. Passengers experience {{a certain level of}} comfort when these features impact their body and elicit subjective perceptions. New findings characterise these perceptions in the form of eight themes and outline their particular eliciting features. Comfort is depicted as a complex construct derived by passengers' perceptions beyond the psychological (i. e. peace of mind) and physical (i. e. physical well-being) aspects, and includes perceptual (e. g. proxemics) and semantic (e. g. association) aspects. The seat was shown to have a focal role in eliciting seven of those themes and <b>impacting</b> <b>comfort</b> through its diverse characteristics. In a subsequent study, a group of aircraft cabin interior designers highlighted the possibility of employing the eight themes and their eliciting features as a framework for design and evaluation of new aircraft interiors.

Findings The paper demonstrates that the ambient environment can have a significant <b>impact</b> on occupant <b>comfort,</b> health and wellbeing, which in turn has implications for built asset performance. Within the ambient environmental factors considered, a hierarchy may exist with noise being of particular importance. Occupant behaviour within the workplace was also found to be influential. Research limitations/implications The research was limited to a single commercial office building, and a wider range of case studies would therefore be of benefit.

40|$|Abstract:- Engineered fabrics {{are being}} used {{increasingly}} in commercial and domain-specific systems. Such fabrics with specified consumer-desired characteristics can be computationally designed. Through {{the use of an}} extensive database that correlates sensory and mechanical properties with tactile comfort assessments, desired comfort can be predicted by measuring a limited number of properties. In this paper we are focusing on the most significant sensory and mechanical properties influencing tactile fabric comfort. Output systems can be optimized to exhibit the highest level of comfort by engineering a fabric with specific sensory and mechanical properties. This paper examines stepwise regression analysis and identifies the most significant properties influencing tactile fabric comfort. The reported Beta coefficients are the standardized regression coefficients. Their absolute magnitudes reflect their relative importance in predicting comfort values. A universe of 48 fabrics is examined to analyze and map the relations. The initial 17 mechanical and 17 sensory parameter sets are reduced to sets of 1 to 4 and 1 to 5 properties, respectively. Adjusted R 2 values were 0. 360 to 0. 657 for mechanical and 0. 713 to 0. 863 for sensory parameters, reflecting sound goodness-of-fit measures, and providing reasonable ways for identifying the mechanical and sensory properties that are most significant influences on tactile fabric comfort. Elongation and hysteresis of shear force were found to be the most influential mechanical properties, while compression resilience rate and graininess were found to be the sensory properties that most <b>impacted</b> <b>comfort.</b> Key-Words: tactile perception, fabric mechanical properties, stepwise regression analysis, standardized importance factors, textile property analysis...|$|R

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2009 truck drivers experienced 16. 8 % of all transportation-related fatalities and 2. 04 % of the nonfatal injuries requiring days away from work, even though they only made up 1. 0 % of the U. S. workforce. Truck drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, working an average of 41. 5 hours per week. Therefore, a well-designed truck cab can make {{a significant difference in}} the working conditions for a truck driver. Truck cab design <b>impacts</b> <b>comfort,</b> but more importantly impacts the safety of truck drivers and other road users. For example, if the design of the truck cab is poorly fitted to the size and dimensions of the driver, the road may be less visible, driving controls may be more difficult to reach, and seatbelts may be less comfortable and less likely to be used - all of which increase the risk of injury to the driver and other road users. Truck manufacturers consider the body dimensions of truck drivers as they design truck cabs. However, until recently the most current body measurement data for truck drivers dated from the early 1980 s. The composition of the trucker workforce has changed dramatically in the past 30 years, with an increase in the diversity of ethnic groups and the percentage of women working in this profession. As the truck manufacturing industry moves forward to design the next generation of truck cabs, there is a pressing need for up-to-date information on the body dimensions of U. S. truck drivers.

The review covers {{the most important}} variables in automotive seating design that <b>impact</b> on occupant <b>comfort.</b> These findings will help Futuris and the University develop the target settings that will be measured during the testing phase of the C 3 - 21 project. The review also provides valuable information that may {{be incorporated into the}} final comfort procedure that will be developed...|$|R
30|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} in this project to assess the mobility and <b>comfort</b> <b>impacts</b> of ITS systems on vulnerable road users. The method {{is analogous to the}} safety approach. The problematic aspect of applying the method was data availability, especially for comfort. The use of expertise, external as well as internal to the project to assess the impact, was a useful method to steer the assessment process. The methodology provides a good starting point for future work and methodological development.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} thermal {{insulation}} worn {{by a person}} has a substantial <b>impact</b> on thermal <b>comfort,</b> because it influences the heat loss and consequently the thermal balance. Layers of insulating clothing prevent heat loss and can either help keep a person warm or lead to overheating. Generally, the thicker the garment is, the greater insulating ability it has. Depending {{on the type of}} material the clothing is made out of, air movement and relative humidity can decrease the insulating ability of the material.|$|R

Improving the accessibility of transit system {{has the potential to}} increase the attractiveness of public transit to current and prospective riders. Xu et al. [127] defined the Expected Locational Accessibility (ELA) of urban transit networks for commuters, measured by the sample-test-statistics method and the topological analysis method. De Oña et al. [128] proposed a Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach for evaluating the quality of service perceived by users of a bus transit service with 1200 collected surveys. The results showed the service has the highest weight, while comfort and personnel parameters have little weight in the model. And conventional evaluation practices generally assign the same time value regardless of travel conditions, and the <b>impacts</b> of <b>comfort</b> and convenience are underestimated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Self-locking {{worm gears}} have the advantage, {{that they can}} {{position}} loads, blocking any further movements. This feature exploits the physical effect of self-locking. This provides an efficient solution, since any further locking devices, such as brakes, can be omitted. A load of arbitrary dimension is safely held in position even if the motor is turned off. In practical applications the exploitation of self-locking is not free of problems. Under certain circumstances chatter vibrations can arise, which have a negative <b>impact</b> on <b>comfort</b> and noise generation, increase wear, {{and can lead to}} instabilities, which render impossible the operation of the equipment. The paper examines the influence of various parameters on the occurrence of chatter phenomena – analytically for systems with few degrees of freedom as well as numerically for complex vibratory systems. The results are summarized in stability chart...|$|R
