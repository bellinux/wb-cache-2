40|$|Photogrammetry {{has been}} used to control the {{assembly}} of a convex paraboloidal jig, used in the construction of a 500 m dish concentrator. The photogrammetric measurement precision was ~ 1 : 175, 000, corresponding to an accuracy of better than 1 mm at the <b>jig</b> <b>reference</b> points. Equipment (camera, flash and retro-reflective film) and software are discussed. Photogrammetry was also used to characterise the dish mirror panels: the rear surface of the panels was mapped, as it made possible a denser target array and quicker image capture than if the reflective surface was used. The targets were produced with a digital projector, and the measurement precision attained was ~ 1 : 150, 000...|$|E
40|$|Close-range {{photogrammetry}} {{has been}} used to control the construction of a jig used in the assembly of a new generation solar concentrator and the validation of the final, mirrored surface. The concentrator is a concave paraboloid dish with an area of a 489 m(2). The typical photogrammetric relative precision realized was 1 : 175, 000, corresponding to an accuracy of better than 1 mm at the <b>jig</b> <b>reference</b> points. The validation of the mirrored surface achieved a relative precision of 1 : 300, 000. Photogrammetry was also used to characterize the dish mirror panels. The rear surface of the panels was mapped, as it made possible a denser target array and quicker image capture than if the reflective surface was used. The targets were produced with a digital projector, and the typical measurement precision attained was 1 : 150, 000. This paper describes the equipment and techniques required to provide the required accuracy and precision for the jig and panel surfaces...|$|E

40|$|A new {{rotating}} coil probe (a mole) {{has been}} developed for the simultaneous measurement of the magnetic field and magnetic axis of warm superconducting LHC dipoles and associated corrector windings. The mole houses a radial rotating coil and travels inside the magnet aperture {{by means of an}} externally driven two-way traction belt. The coil is rotated by an on-board piezo motor, being tested in view of future devices for cold measurements as the only type of motor compatible with strong magnetic fields. A virtual light spot is generated in the coil center by a LED source. The position of this light spot is measured from the outside by a system including a telescope, a CCD camera and a DSP. <b>Jigs</b> on <b>reference</b> granite tables are used to transfer the optical measurements to the magnet fiducials. We describe here the main characteristics and performance of the mol...|$|R
30|$|The ACL {{reconstruction}} {{was performed}} arthroscopically by two experienced orthopaedic specialists. In 22 cases, the semitendinosus tendon alone {{was used as}} the cruciate ligament graft and, in the remaining 16 cases, the semitendinosus tendon in combination with the gracilis tendon was used. After removal, the tendons were sutured and augmented with Orthocord™ sutures (Mitek, Norderstedt, Germany) on the femoral and tibial aspects. The tibial tunnel was prepared using an alignment <b>jig</b> and <b>referencing</b> the PCL. The cortex was opened at an angle of 55 ° to the tibial articular surface directly above the pes anserinus. The femoral tunnel was prepared over the anteromedial portal using an alignment jig with a 5 – 6  mm offset—depending on the graft height—in the 1.30 or 10.30 position. After femoral screw fixation, the graft was pretensioned and the knee joint moved through its range of motion before the tibial screw was placed as close to the joint as possible. A 23 -mm femoral screw and 30 -mm tibial screw were used. The bone tunnel diameter was adapted to 0.5  mm of the graft height. The diameter of the interference screws was selected according to the bone tunnel diameter (0.5  mm smaller).|$|R
40|$|Producing micro texture on surface, it's {{possible}} to give various characteristics of functions. In {{the case of}} micro grooving using a diamond cutting tool, form accuracy {{is determined by the}} so-called copy principle, where a copy is made of the accuracy of the machine tool. In this report, we try improvement of grooving accuracy on an ordinary machine tool by in-process measurement and control, though it is important to improve the accuracy and stiffness of machine tool and the machining conditions. In this study, with aim of accuracy improvement, this method is applied to micro grooving using single crystal diamond tool on an ordinary machine tool. First, we propose micro grooving without environmental control and ultra-precision machine tool by CCRS. Second, in-process measurement and control unit, which is composed of micro tool servo, optical gap sensor, control computer and attachment <b>jig</b> for <b>reference</b> surface and workpiece, are designed and manufactured. Third, characteristics of control system are evaluated. Finally, this unit and system were applied to an ordinary lateral milling machine without NC control and a profile grinder with NC control, and grooving surfaces are compared with and without in-process control...|$|R
40|$|Rotation of the femoral {{component}} {{is an important}} aspect of knee arthroplasty, due to its effects on postsurgery knee kinematics and associated functional outcomes. It is still debated which method for establishing rotational alignment is preferable in orthopedic surgery. We compared force sensing based femoral component rotation with traditional anatomic landmark methods to investigate which method is more accurate in terms of alignment to the true transepicondylar axis. Thirty-one patients underwent computer-navigated total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis with femoral rotation established via a force sensor. During surgery, three alternative hypothetical femoral rotational alignments were assessed, based on transepicondylar axis, anterior-posterior axis, or the utilization of a posterior condyles <b>referencing</b> <b>jig.</b> Postoperative computed tomography scans were obtained to investigate rotation characteristics. Significant differences in rotation characteristics were found between rotation according to DKB and other methods (P< 0. 05). Soft tissue balancing resulted in smaller deviation from anatomical epicondylar axis than any other method. 77 % of operated knees were within a range of ± 3 ° of rotation. Only between 48 % and 52 % of knees would have been rotated appropriately using the other methods. The current results indicate that force sensors may be valuable for establishing correct femoral rotation...|$|R
