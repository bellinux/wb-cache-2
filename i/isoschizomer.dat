50|$|An {{enzyme that}} recognizes the same {{sequence}} but cuts it differently is a neoschizomer. Neoschizomers are {{a specific type}} (subset) of <b>isoschizomer.</b> For example, SmaI (CCC/GGG) and XmaI (C/CCGGG) are neoschizomers of each other. Similarly Kpn1 (GGTAC/C) and Acc651 (G/GTACC) are neoschizomers of each other. An enzyme that recognizes a slightly different sequence, but produces the same ends is an isocaudomer.|$|E
50|$|PstI {{is a type}} II {{restriction}} endonuclease isolated from the Gram negative species, Providencia stuartii. It is the <b>isoschizomer</b> of Streptomyces albus P restriction enzyme SalPI. It cleaves DNA at the recognition sequence 5′-CTGCA/G-3′ generating fragments with 3′-cohesive termini. This cleavage yields sticky ends 4 base pairs long. PstI is catalytically active as a dimer. The two subunits are related by a 2-fold symmetry axis which in the complex with the substrate coincides with the dyad axis of the recognition sequence. It has a molecular weight of 69,500 and contains 54 positive and 41 negatively charged residues.|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} specificities {{of three}} Bacillus subtilis restriction/modification systems were established: (i) BsuM (CTCGAG), an <b>isoschizomer</b> to XhoI; (ii) BsuE (CGCG), an <b>isoschizomer</b> to FnuDII; and (iii) BsuF (CCGG), an <b>isoschizomer</b> to MspI, HpaII. The BsuM modification enzyme methylates the 3 ' cytosine of the recognition sequence. The BsuF modification enzyme methylates the 5 ' cytosine of the sequence, rendering such sites resistant to MspI degradation {{and leaving the}} majority of sites sensitive to HpaII degradation...|$|E
50|$|<b>Isoschizomers</b> are {{pairs of}} {{restriction}} enzymes {{specific to the}} same recognition sequence. For example, SphI (CGTAC/G) and BbuI (CGTAC/G) are <b>isoschizomers</b> of each other. The first enzyme discovered which recognizes a given sequence {{is known as the}} prototype; all subsequently identified enzymes that recognize that sequence are <b>isoschizomers.</b> <b>Isoschizomers</b> are isolated from different strains of bacteria and therefore may require different reaction conditions.|$|R

HgiCI from strain Hpg 9 recognizes and cleaves the degenerate sequence: GGPyPuCC, producing 5 '-hexanucleotide protruding ends. Endonucleases HgiBI, HgiCII and HgiEI are <b>isoschizomers</b> of AvaII; HgiCIII and HgiDII are <b>isoschizomers</b> of SalI; and HgiDI and HgiGI are <b>isoschizomers</b> of AcyI.

Another two specific endonuclease Eco 47 I (<b>isoschizomer</b> of AvaII) and Eco 47 II (<b>isoschizomer</b> of AsuI) were also found in this strain. There are two Eco 47 III recognition sites on λ DNA at 20997 and 37060 basepairs.

50|$|In some cases, {{only one}} out of a pair of <b>isoschizomers</b> can {{recognize}} both the methylated as well as unmethylated forms of restriction sites. In contrast, the other restriction enzyme can recognize only the unmethylated form of the restriction site.This property of some <b>isoschizomers</b> allows identification of methylation state of the restriction site while isolating it from a bacterial strain.For example, the restriction enzymes HpaII and MspI are <b>isoschizomers,</b> as they both recognize the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' when it is unmethylated. But when the second C of the sequence is methylated, only MspI can recognize it while HpaII cannot.|$|R
40|$|Thirteen {{restriction}} endonuclease-containing strains {{were isolated}} from {{a collection of}} 186 clinical isolates of Shigella spp. Among these, eight and five isolates carried <b>isoschizomers</b> of EcoRII and NciI, respectively. The former restriction-modification (R-M) system was homologous to that of EcoRII and was located on plasmids with sizes of 46. 6 or 55. 6 kb. Isolates producing NciI <b>isoschizomers</b> contained a 5. 7 -kb non-transferable plasmid. Together with antimicrobial susceptibility tests and plasmid profile studies, it is concluded that these two R-M systems are not widely spread but confined to strains with similar antibiotic resistance and plasmid profile...|$|R
40|$|Although DNA-recognition {{sequences}} {{are among}} the most important characteristics of restriction enzymes and their corresponding methylases, determination of the recognition sequence of a Type-I restriction enzyme is a complicated procedure. To facilitate this process we have previously developed plasmid R-M tests and the computer program RM search. To specifically identify Type-I <b>isoschizomers,</b> we engineered a pUC 19 derivative plasmid, pTypeI, which contains all of the 27 Type-I recognition sequences in a 248 -bp DNA fragment. Furthermore, a series of 27 plasmids (designated ‘reference plasmids’), each containing a unique Type-I recognition sequence, were also constructed using pMECA, a derivative of pUC vectors. In this study, we tried those vectors on 108 clinical E. coli strains and found that 48 strains produced <b>isoschizomers</b> of Type I enzymes. A detailed study of 26 strains using these ‘reference plasmids’ revealed that they produce seven different <b>isoschizomers</b> of the prototypes: EcoAI, EcoBI, EcoKI, Eco 377 I, Eco 646 I, Eco 777 I and Eco 826 I. One strain EC 1344 produces two Type I enzymes (EcoKI and Eco 377 I) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{new type}} II {{restriction}} endonuclease Asp 7 / 8 % has been {{isolated from the}} non-pathogenic species of Achromobacter 718. This novel enzyme, an <b>isoschizomer</b> of Kpnl, recognizes and cleaves specifically within the nucleotide sequence: 5 '-G/GTAC-C- 3 ' 3 '-C-CATG/G- 5 '. In contrast to Kpnl, Asp 718 generates fragments with 5 '-protruding single-stranded ends. These 5 '-terminal extensions of the Asp 718 fragments may be efficiently labeled with T 4 poly nucleotide kinase, whereas the recessed 3 '-ends are suitable substrates for the terminal labeling reaction applying Klenow enzyme. The presence of only one restriction activity in this Achromobacter strain facilitates the preparation of Asp 718 free of other contaminating site-specific nucleases which could interfere with the in vitro digestion of DNA.
