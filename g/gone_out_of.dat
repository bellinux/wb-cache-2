5|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, {{replacing}} parts became an increasing problem. Components were failing due to wear and age, but the companies responsible for manufacturing the parts had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business {{during the previous}} twenty years, sometimes immediately after World War II ended. The carrier's engineers often resorted to making replacements from scratch.|$|E

5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> style, and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E

5|$|No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith is a 1945 book by Fawn McKay Brodie, {{the first}} {{important}} non-hagiographic biography of Joseph Smith, {{the founder of}} Latter Day Saint movement. The book has not <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print, and 60 years after its first publication, its publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, continues to sell about a thousand copies annually. A revised edition appeared in 1971, and on the 50th anniversary of its first publication, Utah State University issued a volume of retrospective essays about the book, its author, and her methods.|$|E
5|$|Crane's {{contract}} with Appleton {{allowed him to}} receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold. However, the contract also stipulated {{that he was not}} to receive royalties from the books sold in Great Britain, where they were released by Heinemann in early 1896 as part of its Pioneer Series. In 1982, W. W. Norton & Company published a version of the novel based on Crane's original 1894 manuscript of 55,000 words. Edited by Henry Binder, this version is questioned by those who believe Crane made the original edits for the 1895 Appleton edition on his own accord. Since its initial publication, the novel has never <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print.|$|E
5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} has <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our lives, {{and there is}} {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite {{know what to tell}} you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E

50|$|When {{the referee}} blows the whistle during play {{everyone}} must stop {{exactly where they}} are. If the ball <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds on a shot then the player that is closest to the ball receives the possession. If the ball <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds not on a shot then the other team is awarded with the possession. For example, if a player threw a bad pass to her teammate and the ball <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds then the other team would receive the ball. If the ball <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds on a shot, {{it is common for}} the player to reach out her stick in an attempt to be ruled closest to the ball and gain possession.|$|R
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on {{his head in the}} end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E

It also appeared on album charts in the UK and Japan, but did not achieve notable success. The album has <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print in the US, but was reissued in 2007 for the Japanese and European markets.|$|E
5|$|Zimmer wrote {{several hours}} of music, and an {{abundance}} of different themes, before Malick started to shoot the film. The director played the music on the set, while filming, to get himself, {{and the rest of}} the crew and actors in the right frame of mind. The official soundtrack features tracks that were not used on the film and some tracks from the film are not found on the CD. The film features several pieces of Melanesian choral music sung by the Choir of All Saints in Honiara, only one of which is featured on the soundtrack. However, another soundtrack was released containing several tracks from the Choir, which has since <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> circulation.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, Harvey {{was facing}} serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal {{had died in}} 1903 and was interred in a {{mausoleum}} in Monte Ne. His other son, Tom, had left in 1908 never to return. The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend William Jennings Bryan failed {{to find a place}} for him in the new Woodrow Wilson administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business. Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning that the end of civilization was at hand. In February 1920, he published Common Sense, in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future {{in the form of a}} pyramid.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the team}} {{believed}} {{that they would be}} unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles, only to discover that the original developer, Muse Software, had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business several years earlier and let the trademark lapse, leaving them the option to use the name Wolfenstein 3D. The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he paid id a US$100,000 advance on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen, which had published id's December 1991 Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter, overcoming the publisher's concerns over Wolfensteins proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had the {{majority}} of the possession up to this point, with Dortmund content to counter-attack. The tactic worked as Dortmund took lead in the 61st minute. Sigfried Held passed to Lothar Emmerich on the left hand side of the pitch, Emmerich played a lofted pass to Held, who volleyed the ball into the goal to give Dortmund a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later Liverpool were level. Peter Thompson ran down the left hand side of the pitch and passed to Roger Hunt who scored to level the match at 1–1. The linesman on the left hand side of the pitch signalled to the referee that the ball had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> play, yet the referee ignored him and allowed the goal to stand. There were few chances for either side {{until the end of the}} half when Liverpool had a chance to win the match, but Hunt's shot missed. With the scores still level at 1–1, the match went into extra-time.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) demands {{compensation}} for her voice work in Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. The argument escalates and Liz orders {{them to stop}} their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman {{sitting next to her}} is Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, {{will be able to make}} them come to terms. As it turns out, her inflight conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.|$|E
