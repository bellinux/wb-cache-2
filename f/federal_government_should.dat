5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> be more powerful than the states.|$|E
5|$|Hal {{is riding}} {{the school bus}} home one day when he is {{approached}} by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of the debate team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has {{dropped out of high}} school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.|$|E

As public servants, Congressman Ted Poe and State Senator Leticia Van de Putte recognize the deficiency in attention and resources dedicated to trafficked victims at both levels of <b>government.</b> <b>Federal</b> and state <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> provide the necessary resources for victims and victim service providers and help facilitate restitution for trafficking victims. In addition, the <b>federal</b> and state <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> help raise awareness of this crime’s impact on our nation.

The Article addresses, therefore, the apparent collision between two policies: on the one hand, the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> has a compelling interest in vigorously pursuing those contractors who defraud it; on the other hand, the government has an interest in not encouraging its own investigators to enrich themselves by bringing personal suits for damages against the target of their investigations...|$|R

25|$|One {{unforeseen}} {{result of}} the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union was the immediate emphasis on education for bright students in the United States, and this settled the question whether the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> get involved in public education at all. The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was passed by Congress in 1958 with $1 billion US to bolster science, math, and technology in public education. Educators immediately pushed to identify gifted students and serve them in schools. Students chosen for gifted services were given intelligence tests with a strict cutoff, usually at 130, which meant that students who scored below the 130 were not identified.|$|E
5000|$|He {{began with}} work on {{childhood}} development and delinquency, later branching out to include {{research on the}} underlying causes of poverty. He argued that social services provide by local, state and <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> be treated as a [...] "social utility", similar to fire departments and post offices, rather than being derogated as [...] "welfare" [...] and that these services should be offered to all, not just the poor. Starting in the 1970s, he developed numerous studies comparing how social welfare services are provided in the U.S. and Europe. During his 57 years teaching at the Columbia University School of Social Work, he provided oversight of social services provided New York, writing numerous reports for the Citizens' Committee for Children on subjects such as child-guidance programs, juvenile courts and truancy. In a 1965 interview with the New York Post he stated that [...] "I represent a concern for what is being accomplished, rather than what is being done", noting that [...] "'Services rendered' are not enough. I want to know what's going on." ...|$|R
40|$|Marijuana is {{becoming}} increasingly popular and accepted within our society; {{so much so that}} certain states have legalized it for medical or recreational use, despite marijuana remaining illegal with regards to the <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> This has lead, and will continue to lead, to complicated and uncertain tax scenarios for the businesses that produce and sell marijuana. Many problems stem from the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> being unable to recognize or associate with businesses that deal with marijuana. This affects these otherwise legitimate businesses by disallowing the use of federally insured banks as well as taking away the ability to seek federal bankruptcy protection. An inability to operate as a normal business may lead marijuana businesses to explore other tax planning solutions such as organizing as a social welfare organization. At worst, they may be driven back underground. Additionally, it may be professionally risky for CPAs to perform services to these businesses for fear of violating ethical standards. These smaller problems inevitably become one big problem, highlighting the power struggle between state and <b>federal</b> <b>governments.</b> <b>Should</b> the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> have the ability to make these decisions for all of the states or should each state and each county of each state be allowed to regulate marijuana on their own? At the heart of this issue is its time sensitive nature. As potential government power changes, the future of marijuana businesses and their associates is unfairly unclear. In order to solve these problems, the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> has three choices; each with their own benefits and costs. They can legalize marijuana at a federal level, completely outlaw marijuana and begin enforcing laws against known state dispensaries, or they can change certain areas of the tax codes and other select laws to offer clear directions for businesses and assurances of limited liability to those with whom they work...|$|R
