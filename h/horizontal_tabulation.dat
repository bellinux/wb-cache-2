50|$|The {{intention}} {{was to have the}} printers be programmed with control characters to set and clear the stops: ISO 6429 includes the codes 136 (<b>Horizontal</b> <b>Tabulation</b> Set), 137 (<b>Horizontal</b> <b>Tabulation</b> with Justification) and 138 (Vertical Tabulation Set). In practice, settable tab stops were rather quickly replaced with fixed tab stops, de facto standardized at every multiple of 8 characters horizontally, and every 6 lines vertically. A printing program could send zero or more tabs to get to the closest tab stop above and left of where it wanted to print, then send line feeds and spaces to get to the final location. Tab characters simply became a form of data compression.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the control}} codes area (the C0 range), the Spectrum mostly uses {{proprietary}} controls, such as INK and PAPER to control foreground and background colour. However, the common [...] and [...] code points {{are the same}} as in ASCII. Cursor-down (0x0A, ASCII Line Feed) can be simulated with 32 spaces printed with OVER 1 (transparent overprint) and cursor-up 0x0B (ASCII Vertical Tabulation) can be simulated with 32 backspaces. The system ROM has a fault which prevents cursor-right at 0x09 (c.f. ASCII <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Tabulation)</b> from working.|$|E
