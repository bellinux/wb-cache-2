The future trends of PC emissions were also projected under three scenarios to explore the reduction potential of possible policy measures. Estimated baseline emissions of CO, <b>HC,</b> <b>NOx,</b> PM 10 and CO 2 were respectively 3. 16 x 106, 5. 14 x 105, 3. 56 x 105, 0. 83 x 104 and 9. 14 x 107 Â tons for China's PCs in 2005 with an uneven distribution among provinces. Under a no improvement (NI) scenario, PC emissions of CO, <b>HC,</b> <b>NOx,</b> PM 10 and CO 2 in 2020 are respectively estimated to be 4. 5, 2. 5, 2. 5, 7. 9 and 8. 0 times that of 2005. However, emissions other than CO 2 from PCs are estimated to decrease nearly 70 % by 2020 compared to NI scenario mainly due to technological improvement linked to the vehicle emissions standards under a recent policy (RP) scenario.

40|$|An {{improved}} indicator &Phi;, {{based on}} the present indicator &Theta;=&tau;OHVOC/&tau;OHNOx, is developed to determine the sensitivity of ozone production to <b>HC</b> and <b>NOx</b> in the field campaign RISFEX 2003 (RIShiri Fall EXperiment 2003) made in September 2003 at Rishiri island (45. 07 &deg; N, 141. 12 &deg; E, and 35 m a. s. l.) {{in the sea of}} Japan. The indicator, defined as a ratio of kHC+OH[HC] to kNOx+OH[NOx], has a close correlation with the relative sensitivity (dlnP(O 3 ) /dln[NO] and P(O 3 ) /dln[HC]) which can explicitly give the sensitivity of P(O 3 ) to NO and HC. According to the indicator, four distinctive regimes were obtained in which modeled P(O 3 ) behaviors differently with <b>HC</b> and <b>NOx.</b> At &Phi;P(O 3 ) is located in Regime I and is greatly sensitive to both HC with a positive correlation and NOx with a negative one. In Regime II (1 &lt;&Phi;P(O 3 ) is more sensitive to <b>HC</b> than <b>NOx,</b> but has a similar relationship to <b>HC</b> and <b>NOx.</b> P(O 3 ) is both positively sensitive to <b>HC</b> and <b>NOx</b> in Regime III (7 &plusmn; 3 P(O 3 ) is greatly sensitive to NOx but nearly insensitive to HC. During the campaign, 91 % (247 / 271) of P(O 3 ) data are located in Regime III and IV, illuminating that NOx is a limiting factor for ozone production. Hence a controlling of NOx emission can be a more efficient strategy for ozone abatement at the site. Detailed comparisons between the experimental and modeled P(O 3 ) were performed in different regimes and the results show basically an agreement between the two methods. However, the model tended to underestimate P(O 3 ) in Regime II, indicating that an important source of peroxy radicals missed. In Regime IV with low j(O 1 D), the over-prediction of modeled P(O 3 ) and the elevated monoterpenes implies that the reactions of monoterpenes with O 3 may over-predict the formation of peroxy radicals. Budget analysis shows that P(O 3 ) is dominated by the HO 2 +NO reaction and followed by the MO 2 +NO reaction in all regimes. Meanwhile, the ratio of the percent contribution of the HO 2 +NO reaction to the sum of RO 2 +NO reactions decreases as &Phi; increases, implying a decrease efficiency of the RO 2 to HO 2 conversion via the reaction of RO 2 with NO. Further analysis ascertain a declining sensitivity of P(O 3 ) to HC but ascending one to NO with &Phi; shifting from Regime II to Regime IV, according with the results from the indicator. Sensitivity studies for P(O 3 ) are performed to discover the impaction of NOx and monoterpenes on ozone production in different regions and to compare with the indicator representation. Expected results are obtained and are in good agreement with those given by the indicator. Therefore, the indicator can be applicable to illuminate the features of P(O 3 ) sensitivity at the site...|$|R

An onboard instrumentation able to communicate with the electronic system of the vehicle (OBD/CAN) was developed to collect all the sensor data installed on a vehicle: those values are used as input values to the emissions models of CO 2, CO, <b>HC</b> and <b>NOx</b> developed in the present work.

Regulated air pollutants (<b>HC,</b> CO, <b>NOx,</b> particulate matter) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions were meas-ured.

Total PAH (sum of 21 PAHs) emission factor was 3. 6 mg/BHP-hr. The non-liner two-variable regression analysis was used to identify the fuel properties which may have influenced the diesel engine particulate and PAH emissions. The greatest influential factor on particulate emission was carbon content, followed by density and viscosity. A 1 % increase in carbon content was associated with an increase of 63. 1 % in particulate emission.
