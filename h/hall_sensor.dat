40|$|AbstractThe {{market for}} {{magnetic}} sensors {{has been growing}} rapidly. In 1995, Asahi Kasei Electronics (AKE) commercially produced over 800 million InSb high-sensitivity <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> (which amounts to 70 %, of the world market) by vacuum deposition. InAs <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> having good noise properties and small temperature dependence have also been developed by mass production molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Further, InAs deep quantum well (InAs DQW) <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> with high sensitivity and good stability under a wide temperature range are opening up new applications of magnetic <b>sensors.</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> have now become an important application for III-V compound semiconductors...|$|R

First and second <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> are positioned in a spaced-apart relationship with the first and second armatures of the rotor such that the first and second <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> generate electrical outputs that are 90. degree. out of phase with one another as the rotor rotates.

50|$|The primary {{signal from}} a <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor</b> loses {{amplitude}} sharply {{as the air}} gap increases. For <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor</b> manufacturers this means {{that they need to}} provide maximum possible compensation for the Hall signal’s physically induced offset drift. The conventional way of doing this is to measure the temperature at the sensor and use this information to compensate the offset, but this fails for two reasons: firstly because the drift does not vary linearly with the temperature, and secondly because not even the sign of the drift is the same for all sensors.|$|E

40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{the use of}} analog light barrier and <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> for waveform control in an actuator system for turbulence research. The system shall produce up to 80 Hz, 80 mm wavelength running surface wave with amplitudes from 50 to 1000 μm. To ensure both, waveform and amplitude, the control algorithm requires real time amplitude measurements of all 20 actuators. Techniques are described to extend the limited measurement range of analog light barriers and to reduce impact of mechanical disturbances on the measurement process by placement and compensation. Also a small bar permanent magnet together with <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> to track position are employed and a method for reducing impact of the strong magnetic stray fields affecting <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> in this actuator system is developed...|$|R

The trench-defined vertical <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> show a very high current related sensitivity of up to 1000 V/AT, a non-linearity of 0. 06 %FSO, and a residual offset (after spinning current offset reduction) of about 0. 5 mT. A method for etching the poly-silicon inside the trenches using XeF 2 without additional mask is demonstrated on an SOI wafer. While the technology is demonstrated for vertical <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors,</b> it is also well suited for the fabrication and release of trench-defined MEMS, such as thin beams...|$|R
50|$|The magnet {{from the}} {{experiment}} with the planar <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor</b> stays connected to the flexible tube. Instead of measuring the change in magnetoresistance the magnet moves vertically through an electromagnetic coil which creates electromagnetic induction which can be measured by using a differential voltage sensor.|$|E

40|$|Graphene is an {{excellent}} material for <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> due to its atomically thin structure, high carrier mobility, and low carrier density. However, graphene devices need {{to be protected from}} the environment for reliable and durable performance in different environmental conditions. Here we present magnetic <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> fabricated on large area commercially available chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene protected by exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). To connect the graphene active regions of Hall samples to the outputs, 1 D edge contacts were utilized which show reliable and stable electrical properties.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} sensors and motor speed control methods for BLDC/PMSM motors in Aerospace applications. The sensors and methods were evaluated by considering accuracy, robustness, cost, development gain and parameter sensitivity. The sensors and methods chosen to simulate were digital <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> and sensorless control of BLDC motors. Using Matlab Simulink/Simscape some motor speed control methods and motor speed estimation methods were simulated using the <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> and sensorless control as a basis. It {{was found that the}} sensorless control methods for BLDC motors couldn't estimate the speed accurately during dynamic loads and that the most robust and accurate solution based on the simulations was using the digital <b>Hall</b> <b>sensors</b> for both speed estimation and commutation and this was tested on a hardware setup...|$|R

5000|$|In a {{rotating}} lever sensor a diametrically magnetized ring magnet rotates about a linear <b>hall</b> <b>sensor.</b> The sensor only measures the perpendicular (vertical) {{component of the}} field.

50|$|Controllers for brushed motors: Brushed motors {{are also}} used in e-bikes but are {{becoming}} less common due to their intrinsic lower efficiency. Controllers for brushed motors however are much simpler and cheaper {{due to the fact}} they don't require <b>hall</b> <b>sensor</b> feedback and are typically designed to be open-loop controllers.

50|$|Frequently, a <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor</b> is {{combined}} with threshold detection so that it acts as and is called a switch.

50|$|Controllers for {{brushless}} motors: E-bikes require high {{initial torque}} and therefore models that use brushless motors typically have <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor</b> commutation for speed and angle measurement. An electronic controller provides assistance {{as a function}} of the sensor inputs, the vehicle speed and the required force. The controllers generally allow input by means of potentiometer or Hall Effect twist grip (or thumb-operated lever throttle), closed-loop speed control for precise speed regulation, protection logic for over-voltage, over-current and thermal protection. Bikes with a pedal assist function typically have a disc on the crank shaft featuring a ring of magnets coupled with a <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor</b> giving rise to a series of pulses, the frequency of which is proportional to pedaling speed. The controller uses pulse width modulation to regulate the power to the motor. Sometimes support is provided for regenerative braking but infrequent braking and the low mass of bicycles limits recovered energy. An implementation is described in an application note for a 200 W, 24 V Brushless DC (BLDC) motor.|$|E
5000|$|It {{measures}} {{the change in}} anisotropic magnetoresistance caused by an external magnetic field in the Hall geometry. The sensor responds to magnetic field components in the sensor plane {{as opposed to the}} ordinary <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor,</b> which measures field components perpendicular to the sensor plane. Hence the name [...] "planar Hall". Generally speaking, for ferromagnetic materials, the resistance is larger when the current flows along the direction of magnetization than when it flows perpendicular to the magnetization vector. This creates an asymmetric electric field perpendicular to the current, which depends on the magnetization state of the sensor. Exactly controlling the magnetization state {{is the key to the}} operation of the planar <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor.</b> From fabrication the magnetization is confined to one certain direction in zero applied field, and the application of a field perpendicular to this direction changes the magnetization state in such a way that the electronic readout is linear with respect to the magnitude of the applied field. This is true for applied fields smaller than a fourth of the intrinsic effective anisotropy field (see ref. 1 for details on the working principle).|$|E

50|$|Commonly used in {{distributors}} for {{ignition timing}} (and in {{some types of}} crank and camshaft position sensors for injection pulse timing, speed sensing, etc.) the Hall effect sensor {{is used as a}} direct replacement for the mechanical breaker points used in earlier automotive applications. Its use as an ignition timing device in various distributor types is as follows. A stationary permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall effect chip are mounted next to each other separated by an air gap, forming the Hall effect sensor. A metal rotor consisting of windows and tabs is mounted to a shaft and arranged so that during shaft rotation, the windows and tabs pass through the air gap between the permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall chip. This effectively shields and exposes the Hall chip to the permanent magnet's field respective to whether a tab or window is passing though the <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor.</b> For ignition timing purposes, the metal rotor will have a number of equal-sized tabs and windows matching the number of engine cylinders. This produces a uniform square wave output since the on/off (shielding and exposure) time is equal. This signal is used by the engine computer or ECU to control ignition timing. Many automotive Hall effect sensors have a built-in internal NPN transistor with an open collector and grounded emitter, meaning that rather than a voltage being produced at the <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor</b> signal output wire, the transistor is turned on providing a circuit to ground through the signal output wire.|$|E
50|$|Tools {{and owner}} {{servicing}} were well thought out. The R65 came standard {{with a full}} tool kit, {{as well as a}} hand-operated tire pump. Owner maintenance is standard practice with these machines. Valve lash was adjusted by a simple set screw-and-locknut arrangement, and timing was taken care of by adjustment of the points' housing. On later models (i.e., model year 1981 onward), the points were no longer used and a <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor</b> was placed inside the housing, this housing behind the front engine cover is colloquially known as the 'bean can'. Most other maintenance tasks were easily achieved due to easy access to most mechanicals.|$|E
50|$|Scanning Hall probe {{microscope}} (SHPM) is {{a variety}} of a scanning probe microscope which incorporates accurate sample approach and positioning of the scanning tunnelling microscope with a semiconductor <b>Hall</b> <b>sensor.</b> This combination allows to map the magnetic induction associated with a sample. Current {{state of the art}} SHPM systems utilize 2D electron gas materials (e.g. GaAs/AlGaAs) to provide high spatial resolution (~300 nm) imaging with high magnetic field sensitivity. Unlike the magnetic force microscope the SHPM provides direct quantitative information on the magnetic state of a material. The SHPM can also image magnetic induction under applied fields up to ~1 tesla and over a wide range of temperatures (millikelvins to 300 K).|$|E
