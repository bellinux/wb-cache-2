5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility under the Empire, both upward and downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life in the Empire, particularly <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} consequences of the Secular Franciscan charism is that the spiritual formation of the OFS must cater <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> vocation is, motivated by the dynamic power of the Gospel, to live in secular circumstances.

Therefore, Secular Franciscans should seek to encounter the living and active person of Christ in their brothers and sisters, in Sacred Scripture, in the Church and in liturgical activity. They do this by studying, loving and most of all by living in an integrated way the human and evangelical aspects of their life.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} sources for surnames. Many Filipinos also have Chinese-derived surnames, {{which in some}} cases could {{indicate}} Chinese ancestry.

25|$|Greek Cypriots {{rejected}} the UN settlement plan in an April 2004 referendum. On 24 April 2004, the Greek Cypriots rejected by a three-to-one margin the plan proposed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan for {{the settlement of}} the Cyprus dispute. The plan, which was approved by a two-to-one margin by the Turkish Cypriots in a separate but simultaneous referendum, would have created a United Cyprus Republic and ensured that the entire island would {{reap the benefits of}} Cyprus' entry into the European Union on 1 May. The plan would have created a United Cyprus Republic consisting of a Greek Cypriot constituent state and a Turkish Cypriot constituent state linked by a federal government. More than half of the Greek Cypriots who were displaced in 1974 and their descendants would have had their properties returned to them and would have lived in them under Greek Cypriot administration within a period of 31/2 to 42 months after the entry into force of the settlement. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> property could not be returned, they would have received monetary compensation.|$|E
500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas {{authored}} the dissent, {{in which}} Justice Samuel Alito joined.

The dissent focused on the text of the statute Heffernan was suing under: 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The statute provides a cause of action only <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> rights have actually been violated by the government. Because Heffernan maintained that he had not been exercising his First Amendment rights, the dissent argued that those rights could not have been violated, and that a section 1983 claim requires that the employee engage in protected activity and that the employer retaliate against that activity.|$|E

500|$|None of this {{prevented}} Cornwallis, {{with the}} assistance of Castlereagh, from forging ahead with the raising of support for union in November 1798, after the rebellion had died down. [...] Their politicking included firing government officials opposed to union and giving the jobs to supporters, and the offering of a small number of peerages. [...] However, they could not overcome the rumours generated by early drafts of the details of union that appeared to conspire against the Protestant interests. [...] In December 1798, trade groups representing lawyers, merchants, and bankers all came out against the idea. The principal objection was that there would be fewer seats available for Irish representation in the united parliament, resulting in a loss of power <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> seats would not be retained. Cornwallis saw the trouble ahead, warning Portland that it was unlikely to pass.|$|E
500|$|During {{the years}} he was working at Hutchinson's in Widnes, Brunner was {{developing}} his political interests.

[...] Soon after moving to Northwich Brunner became more practically involved with education locally, in particular with the British School in the town. [...] He later served on its board of governors and also on the local sanitary authority. [...] As a result of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 the parliamentary constituency of Northwich was created and Brunner offered himself as a candidate for the Liberal Party. In his speech for the position he expressed support for the disestablishment of the Church of England, for reform of property laws, for Irish Home Rule and for compensation <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> properties had been damaged by the pumping of brine from the salt mines in the area. During the campaign he was heckled because he had a foreign-sounding name.
