25|$|Design or artwork is {{generally}} prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers {{are able to}} draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or stippled. Engraving artists may rely on <b>hand</b> <b>drawing</b> skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.|$|E
25|$|The {{manuscript}} is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed {{sheets of}} paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which {{a thin layer of}} rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left <b>hand,</b> <b>drawing</b> towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drawing</b> <b>Hands</b> {{has been}} {{referenced}} and copied many times by artists in different ways. One common tribute in tech culture is to <b>draw</b> robot <b>hands</b> <b>drawing</b> or building {{each other or}} human hands and robot <b>hands</b> <b>drawing</b> each other.|$|R

50|$|The 24 minute film, taking {{nearly two}} years to complete, cost £2 million to produce and, like the {{original}} movie, was created from over 200,000 <b>hand</b> <b>drawn</b> images. While the film was primarily <b>hand</b> <b>drawn,</b> CGI was used to add digital falling snow and lighting effects.|$|R
25|$|According to {{the account}} of a nun from nearby Heggbach Abbey, local peasants {{assembled}} and conferred in an inn at Baltringen {{for the first time}} on Christmas Eve 1524. From then on regular meetings took place, the number of attendants reaching 80 at the beginning of February 1525. Whereas in other regions the peasants met and discussed at markets, in Baltringen this occurred during the Fastnacht (Carnival) season, which aided conspirative gatherings in that peasants were wont to travel from village to village for eating and drinking, giving them the opportunity to discuss matters at <b>hand.</b> <b>Drawing</b> participants from the whole region, these meetings eventually became more regular, taking place every Tuesday with the number of attendants gradually swelling to 400, at which point meetings were beginning to be held in open space, the Baltringer Ried, a boggy area (now drained) just outside the village of Baltringen. On 3 or 4 February 1525 the peasants chose as their representative Ulrich Schmid (Huldrich Schmid), a blacksmith from the nearby village of Sulmingen, who hesitantly accepted the task.|$|E

50|$|Stauffer is {{recognized}} for the concept-driven {{approach to the}} topics he illustrates. The artist begins works with <b>hand</b> <b>drawn</b> sketches, then incorporates painted elements and scanned found objects. The final works are digital, but often the <b>hand</b> <b>drawn</b> elements remain {{as part of the}} finished works.|$|R

60|$|Since it was {{no further}} use to him, Ramiro had let the sword fall from his <b>hand.</b> <b>Drawing</b> it towards him with the point of his own weapon, Adrian stooped and picked it up.|$|E
60|$|Helena {{drew him}} {{to the edge of}} the cliff. He crushed her <b>hand,</b> <b>drawing</b> {{slightly}} back. But it pleased her to feel the grip on her hand becoming unbearable. They stood right on the edge, to see the smooth cliff slope into the mist, under which the sea stirred noisily.|$|E
60|$|But Dorothy {{sprang up}} and ran to seize her friend's <b>hand</b> <b>drawing</b> him impulsively toward the lovely Princess, who smiled most graciously upon her guest. Then the Wizard entered, and his {{presence}} relieved the boy's embarrassment. The little man was clothed in black velvet, with many sparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast; but his bald head and wrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive.|$|E

But her surreal illustrations of lanky, <b>hand</b> <b>drawn</b> women have also garnered attention from magazines like Another Magazine, V Magazine, Juxtapoz, computerarts, NOWNESS and [...] "The Gentlewoman." [...] Stylistically, Ratcliffe's work lends itself to fashion and <b>hand</b> <b>drawn</b> illustration.|$|R

60|$|Chingachgook {{waved his}} <b>hand.</b> <b>Drawing</b> the light blanket he wore over his head, as a Roman would conceal his grief in his robes, he slowly withdrew into the Ark, {{in order to}} indulge his sorrow and his musings, alone. Deerslayer did not speak again until the canoe was half-way to the shore. Then he {{suddenly}} ceased paddling, at an interruption {{that came from the}} mild, musical voice of Hetty.|$|E
60|$|One glance {{was enough}} to assure Judge Temple that his {{daughter}} and those {{in front of him}} were safe, and he turned his eyes, in dreadful anxiety, to learn the fate of the others. Young Edwards was {{on the opposite side of}} the tree, his form thrown back in his saddle to its utmost distance, his left <b>hand</b> <b>drawing</b> up his bridle with its greatest force, while the right grasped that of Miss Grant so as to draw the head of her horse under its body. Both the animals stood shaking in every joint with terror, and snorting fearfully. Louisa herself had relinquished her reins, and, with her hands pressed on her face, sat bending forward in her saddle, in an attitude of despair, mingled strangely with resignation.|$|E
60|$|It was an {{absolute}} comfort, indeed, to find Leutze so quietly busy at this great national work, which is destined to glow for centuries {{on the walls of}} the Capitol, if that edifice shall stand, or must share its fate, if treason shall succeed in subverting it with the Union which it represents. It was delightful to see him so calmly elaborating his design, while other men doubted and feared, or hoped treacherously, and whispered to one another that the nation would exist only a little longer, or that, if a remnant still held together, its centre and seat of government would be far northward and westward of Washington. But the artist keeps right on, firm of heart and <b>hand,</b> <b>drawing</b> his outlines with an unwavering pencil, beautifying and idealizing our rude, material life, and thus manifesting that we have an indefeasible claim to a more enduring national existence. In honest truth, what with the hope-inspiring influence of the design, and what with Leutze's undisturbed evolvement of it, I was exceedingly encouraged, and allowed these cheerful auguries to weigh against a sinister omen that was pointed out to me in another part of the Capitol. The freestone walls of the central edifice are pervaded with great cracks, and threaten to come thundering down, under the immense weight of the iron dome,--an appropriate catastrophe enough if it should occur on the day when we drop the Southern stars out of our flag.|$|E
