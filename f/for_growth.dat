5|$|Bacteria exhibit an {{extremely}} {{wide variety of}} metabolic types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups {{on the basis of}} three major criteria: the kind of energy used <b>for</b> <b>growth,</b> the source of carbon, and the electron donors used <b>for</b> <b>growth.</b> An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} reports we {{described a}} 22 -kb Legionella pneumophila chromosomal locus containing 18 genes. Thirteen of these genes (icmT, -R, -Q, -P, -O, -M, -L, -K, -E, -C, -D, -J, and -B) {{were found to}} be completely required <b>for</b> intracellular <b>growth</b> and killing of human macrophages. Three genes (icmS, -G, and -F) {{were found to be}} partially required, and two genes (lphA and tphA) were found to be dispensable <b>for</b> intracellular <b>growth</b> and killing of human macrophages. Here, we analyzed the requirement of these genes <b>for</b> intracellular <b>growth</b> in the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii, a well-established important environmental host of L. pneumophila. We found that all the genes that are completely required <b>for</b> intracellular <b>growth</b> in human macrophages are also completely required <b>for</b> intracellular <b>growth</b> in A. castellanii. However, the genes that are partially required <b>for</b> intracellular <b>growth</b> in human macrophages are completely required <b>for</b> intracellular <b>growth</b> in A. castellanii. In addition, the lphA gene, which was shown to be dispensable <b>for</b> intracellular <b>growth</b> in human macrophages, is partially required <b>for</b> intracellular <b>growth</b> in A. castellanii. Our results indicate that L. pneumophila utilizes the same genes to grow intracellularly in both human macrophages and amoebae...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the {{developing}} world today the accent is upon economic growth. No reasonable man can question this emphasis while inequalities among nations, and inequalities within nations, remain so glaring. Inevitable and healthy as this may be, it raises one fundamental question, <b>Growth</b> <b>for</b> what? <b>Growth</b> <b>for</b> <b>growth's</b> sake? <b>Growth</b> <b>for</b> those astute enough to profit from it? Or growth as an essential concomitant of political stability and social justice for the whole community? There are other searching questions. Is democracy compatible with economic growth? Are human rights and civil liberties, free enterprise and free trade unionism, compatible with growth? Where they conflict, which comes first? or what reasonable compromise can be made...|$|R

5|$|Agaricus deserticola, {{commonly}} known as the gasteroid agaricus, is a species of fungus in the family Agaricaceae. Found only in southwestern and western North America, A.deserticola is adapted <b>for</b> <b>growth</b> in dry or semi-arid habitats. The fruit bodies are secotioid, meaning the spores are not forcibly discharged, and the cap does not fully expand. Unlike other Agaricus species, A.deserticola does not develop true gills, but rather a convoluted and networked system of spore-producing tissue called a gleba. When the partial veil breaks or pulls away from the stem or the cap splits radially, the blackish-brown gleba is exposed, which allows the spores to be dispersed.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{stimulus}} <b>for</b> <b>growth</b> was the Second Great Awakening (c. 1790 – 1840), which initially {{grew out}} of a 1787 student revival at Hampden–Sydney College, a Presbyterian institution in Virginia. From there, revivals spread to Presbyterian churches in Virginia and then to North Carolina and Kentucky. The Revival of 1800 was one such revival that first {{grew out of}} meetings led by Presbyterian minister James McGready. The most famous camp meeting of the Second Great Awakening, the Cane Ridge Revival in Kentucky, occurred during a traditional Scottish communion season under the leadership of local Presbyterian minister Barton W. Stone. Over 10 thousand people came to Cane Ridge to hear sermons from Presbyterian as well as Methodist and Baptist preachers.|$|E

5|$|Ashford {{has been}} {{targeted}} {{as a key}} area for population development since the 1960s. In 1959, the London County Council negotiated 5000 new homes {{to be built in}} Ashford as overspill from London, which created most of what is now South Ashford and Kennington. The Buchanan Report, published in 1967, identified Ashford as a major town <b>for</b> <b>growth.</b> In 2001, Ashford was identified as one of four key areas for expansion in South East England.

5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition <b>for</b> <b>growth</b> and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends.
