500|$|Madhavan {{played an}} imposter gangster in K. S. Ravikumar's comedy Aethiree (2004) before being {{selected}} to feature {{in his fourth}} Mani Ratnam production, Aaytha Ezhuthu (2004), which featured him in an ensemble cast including Suriya, Siddharth, Meera Jasmine, Esha Deol and Trisha. Madhavan portrayed the character of Inba Sekhar, a hitman living in the slums of Chennai, whose path crosses with the characters portrayed by Suriya and Siddharth. His role also featured him in a struggling marriage, where his wife desperately tries to claw him away from his profession. Madhavan bulked up and sported a shaven look {{for the first time}} in his career to resemble the character of a ruffian and shot for the film through the sync sound technique. He received widespread praise for his depiction, with Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu claiming that Madhavan outplayed Abhishek Bachchan's interpretation of the character in the Hindi version of the bilingual, Yuva. Madhavan went on to win the Filmfare Award for the Best Tamil Supporting Actor, whilst another critic from The Hindu cited that he [...] "sparkles as an anti-hero" [...] and that the [...] "character ought to find a very special place in his repertoire". Similarly, a critic from Indiaglitz.com stated [...] "Madhavan's daring decision to play a negative character, who gets beaten up black and blue at the end, putting his 'hero' image in peril, has paid off, as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>away</b> with top honours", while a reviewer from Sify.com labelled him as [...] "terrific". In late 2004, Madhavan worked on Rajiv Anchal's English-Malayalam crossover film Nothing But Life (2005) and completed his work in a single schedule across Las Vegas and Albuquerque. Portraying an orphaned youth with suicidal tendencies being treated by a Malayali psychiatrist in the USA, the film and his portrayal opened to mixed reviews. He then appeared in another marriage drama film, Priyasakhi (2005) co-starring Sadha â€“ with the pair playing an estranged husband and wife. The film received praise for the lead pair's performances with Madhavan being praised as [...] "top class", while it also became the first Tamil film to be dubbed into Zulu.|$|E

Alfie then asks Kat to move out following an outbreak of bed bugs in the pub. She does not want to go as she does not want to continue her affair, but she cannot resist. Alfie later finds the bandage, but assumes it is from Kat and sends her a message in the pub's window saying [...] "I love you 2". Kat later ignores her lover's messages, and he tells her that he has got the messageâ€”that she is no longer interested. She throws away the key, but it is found by Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), who leaves it on the bar, thinking it belongs to a punter. Kat then takes it and later meets her lover at the flat.

Alfie demands to know the details but Kat refuses to tell him who her lover is. Alfie ejects Kat from their home, where she meets Michael, to whom she discloses the affair. He urges Kat to fix her relationship, so she goes back to Alfie and says she will do anything to make it right. He gets her to phone her lover and tell him that the affair is over for good.
