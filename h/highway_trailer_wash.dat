5000|$|The {{geometry}} {{required to}} make a trailerable flooding-ballast boat function is such {{that they are a}} little awkward in appearance. This is accentuated by the high freeboard and narrow beam required to meet <b>highway</b> <b>trailering</b> limits ... Such boats almost always score poorly relative to their fixed keel counterparts in both sailing performance and power to carry sail. Apart from issues of portability and low cost, the more conventional fixed-keel boats ... are superior ... in most respects. Certainly if one is on a limited budget but wants a refined, good sailing, capable boat, one should consider a previously owned ... fixed-keel vessel.|$|R
50|$|Some {{sailboat}} {{designs for}} trailering incorporate special features. The MacGregor 26S, for {{example is a}} boat 25.82 ft in length, but that weighs 1650 lb empty and dry and carries 1200 lb of flooding water ballast in tanks which are filled when the boat is launched and drained when the boat {{is removed from the}} water, thus making the boat lighter to transport than if it used more traditional iron or lead ballast. The design also has a pivoting centreboard, plus a pivoting rudder and easily rigged mast to make getting the boat from the trailer to the water easy to accomplish. It also has a beam of 7.82 ft, under the 8.00 ft width limit for <b>highway</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|All was not {{necessarily}} lost after this incident when only four months later, the Illinois Central Gulf sold the CO&E Railroad its trackage and property altogether after they discontinued freight service along the entire route. With this new advantage in hand, the railroad's first common carrier freight services would commence soon afterwards and the first revenue train was pulled behind 2-4-2 #5 on [...] These changes in operation immediately took off successfully as freight customers started growing rapidly with CO&E's new locally owned and operated service. Piggyback service was also eventually added in [...] when a large fleet of more than 200 new flatcars and 600 <b>highway</b> <b>trailers</b> painted for the CO&E Railroad were delivered.

[...] Other components included wheel chocks and ramps for loading and unloading the trailers from the flatcars. [...] By 1953, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois, and the Southern Pacific railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of piggyback trailer service.|$|R

2500|$|NS {{is a major}} {{transporter}} {{of domestic}} and export coal. The railroad's major sources of the mineral are located in: Pennsylvania's Cambria and Indiana counties, {{as well as the}} Monongahela Valley; West Virginia; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania, NS also receives coal through interchange with R.J. Corman Railroad/Pennsylvania Lines at Cresson, Pennsylvania, originating in the [...] "Clearfield Cluster". NS's export of West Virginia bituminous coal begins transport on portions of the well-engineered former Virginian Railway and the former N double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its Lambert's Point coal pier on Hampton Roads at Norfolk. Coal transported by NS is thus exported to steel mills and power plants around the world. The company is also a major transporter of auto parts and completed vehicles. It operates intermodal container and TOFC (trailer on flat car) trains, some in conjunction with other railroads. NS was the first railway to employ roadrailers, which are <b>highway</b> truck <b>trailers</b> with interchangeable wheel sets.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} which components of heavy-duty highway vehicles are candidates for the substitution of titanium materials for current materials if the cost of those Ti components is very significantly reduced from current levels. The processes which could be used to produce those low cost components were also investigated. Heavy-duty highway vehicles are defined as all trucks and busses included in Classes 2 C through 8. These include heavy pickups and vans above 8, 500 lbs. GVWR, through <b>highway</b> tractor <b>trailers.</b> Class 8 is characterized as being a very cyclic market, with ''normal'' year volume, such as in 2000, of approximately 240, 000 new vehicles. Classes 3 - 7 are less cyclic, with ''normal'' i. e., year 2000, volume totaling approximately 325, 000 new vehicles. Classes 3 - 8 are powered about 88. 5 % by diesel engines, and Class 2 C at very roughly 83 % diesel. The engine portion of the study therefore focused on diesels. Vehicle production volumes were used in estimates of the market size for candidate components...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} of disease among livestock farms could {{be addressed by}} the efficiency of truck washes to clean and disinfect trailers used for transporting animals. Collecting swab samples from trailers and cabs of identified truck <b>wash</b> <b>trailers</b> will help to determine the proper procedures and steps needed to reduce the {{transmission of}} disease. Truck washes {{in the state of}} Iowa were identified and invited to participate in a questionnaire that will provide helpful information for this research. The main goals of this study are to 1) determine the areas in the truck washing process that pose a high risk to transmit disease, and 2) to identify the location of current livestock truck washes and their capability in the event that some disease outbreak requires their involvement. This survey tool could help to provide necessary information in order to determine which service methods are best for reducing back contamination and the spread of disease among livestock herds. Determining what locations would be beneficial in collecting samples will be easier overall when the surveys are completed...|$|R
5000|$|Keith Walton Tantlinger (March 22, 1919 - August 27, 2011) was a {{mechanical}} engineer and inventor. As Vice President of Engineering at the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation his inventions {{played a major role}} in containerization. [...] Working with a Fruehauf customer, Malcom McLean, they spearheaded the container ship revolution in the 1950s, Tantlinger developed much of the early technology that made modern container shipping possible while at Fruehauf. After its initial order of containers from Brown Trailer, Sea-Land switched to containers made by the Strick division of the Fruehauf Trailer Company. Fruehauf had been one of the dominant players in building truck bodies and trailers for a long time, and, as already described, had previously innovated in the design and construction of the early commercial semi-trailers. President Roy Fruehauf was impressed with the idea of containerization, so in addition to manufacturing containers for Sea-Land his company agreed to make the trailer chassis that were needed, and also to provide financing to Sea-Land for the purchase of these containers and chassis. In 1958 Tantlinger left Sea-Land and became chief engineer at Fruehauf, where he continued to work with containers. More importantly, over the years he played a key role in the process of container standardization, working extensively on a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA) and later being critically involved with the ISO’s efforts. His designs included the corner casting and Twistlock systems found on every intermodal container, the spreader bar for automatic securing of containers lifted on and off ships, and the ship-shore container transfer apparatus for the first cellular container ship. In the course of his professional career, Tantlinger was granted 79 United States patents, all related to transportation equipment. Many of his patents related to commercial <b>highway</b> freight <b>trailers</b> and transit buses.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{validate}} a new protocol, the thermo-assisted drying and decontamination (TADD) system, for eliminating porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from contaminated transport vehicles. Scale models of weaned pig trailers were used. The principle of TADD is to raise the interior temperature of trailers to 71 °C for 30 min to promote drying and degradation of PRRSV. Trailer interiors were artificially contaminated with 5 × 105 TCID 50 of PRRSV strain MN 30 - 100, then treated with 1 of 4 treatments: 1) TADD; 2) air only (no supplemental heat); 3) overnight (8 h) drying; and 4) washing only. Following treatment, swabs were collected from the trailer interiors at 0, 10, 20, and 30 min post-treatment and from the overnight group after 8 h. Swabs were tested for PRRSV-RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As {{a measure of the}} presence of infectious PRRSV, sentinel pigs were housed in treated trailers for 2 h post-treatment and supernatants from swabs were injected IM into naïve pigs (bioassay), the recipient pigs were then tested for PRRSV infection. All trailers were PRRSV positive by PCR immediately after washing, prior to treatment (pt). At 10 min pt, 7 / 10 swabs were positive from the TADD trailers; however, all swabs collected at 20 and 30 min pt were PRRSV negative by PCR, and trailer interiors were visibly dry. In contrast, 9 / 19, 6 / 10, and 6 / 10 swabs collected at 10, 20, and 30 min, respectively, from trailers treated with air only were positive and visibly wet. All swabs (10 / 10) collected from <b>trailers</b> treated with <b>washing</b> only were PRRSV positive by PCR and all swabs collected at 8 h of drying were PRRSV negative by PCR. All tests for the presence of infectious PRRSV were negative for trailers treated with TADD and overnight drying, while infectious PRRSV was detected in sentinel pigs and bioassay pigs in the other groups. Under the conditions of this study, the efficacy of the TADD system was equal to that of the overnight drying treatment, and it required a shorter period of time to complete its objective...|$|R
