5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, {{in an attempt to}} determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch.</b> These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

25|$|Possibly {{because of}} Thornton's delay in {{crossing}} {{the river and}} the withering artillery fire that might hit them from across the river, the 93rd Highlanders were ordered to leave Keane's assault column advancing along the river and move across the open field to join the main force on the right of the field. Keane fell wounded as he crossed the field with the 93rd. Rennie's men managed to attack and overrun an American advance redoubt next to the river, but without reinforcements they could neither hold the position nor successfully storm the main American line behind it. Within a few minutes, the American 7th Infantry arrived, moved forward, and fired upon the British in the captured redoubt: within half an hour, Rennie and nearly all of his men were dead. In the main attack on the right, the British infantrymen either flung themselves to the ground, huddled in the canal, or were mowed down by a combination of musket fire and grapeshot from the Americans. A handful {{made it to the top}} of the parapet on the right but were either killed or captured.

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as a Squad Leader, serving with Company C, First Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Okinawa Shima in the Ryukyu Islands, 7 May 1945. When his squad was suddenly assailed by extremely heavy small-arms fire from the front during a determined advance against strongly fortified, fiercely defended Japanese positions, Corporal Fardy temporarily deployed his men along a near-by drainage ditch. Shortly thereafter, an enemy grenade fell among the Marines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditch.</b> Instantly throwing himself upon the deadly missile, Corporal Fardy absorbed the exploding blast in his own body, thereby protecting his comrades from certain and perhaps fatal injuries.

A stouthearted leader and indomitable fighter, Corporal Fardy, by his prompt decision and resolute spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of certain death, had rendered valiant service, and his conduct throughout reflects the highest credit upon himself and the United States Naval Service.

40|$|Drainage ditches {{are used}} {{extensively}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Midwest to remove standing water from poorly drained agricultural fields. However, drainage ditches {{are thought to}} expedite downstream nutrient transport and prevent denitrification within soils. Little research has currently been performed on the nutrient dynamics within Midwestern ditches, however, studies point to agricultural and drainage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Midwest {{as the source of}} <b>the</b> hypoxia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico. This study focused on seasonal nutrient dynamics within three agricultural drainage ditches with different management practices (dredging, vegetated, and unvegetated) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hoagland <b>Ditch</b> watershed <b>in</b> northern Indiana. Short-term nutrient injections of nitrate, phosphate, and ammonium were performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> to determine nutrient uptake length (Sw) during spring and fall conditions. Injections of phosphate and ammonium into <b>the</b> vegetated <b>ditched</b> yielded shorter Sw than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nonvegetated <b>ditch,</b> indicating greater retention and processing of nutrients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vegetated <b>ditch.</b> Nitrate uptake was determined to be negligible due to high ambient nitrate concentrations. To determine sediment-nutrient interactions, sediment extractions including equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPCo), phosphorous sorption index (PSI), and exchangeable phosphorous (Ex-P) were performed. Dredging disturbed the bottom sediments and affected Ex-P, PSI, and EPCo sediment extraction experiments at Robinson Ditch. This ditch experienced increased Ex-P and decreased PSI, possibly due to ditch dredging. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{experimental}} ditches {{gross and}} net production were estimated from continuous dissolved oxygen measurements for individual days over a two year period. There are two {{series of three}} ditches: the first is dominated by benthic algae, and the second by submerged macrophytes. Each series receives three different levels of external nutrient (N,P) loading, referred to as reference, medium-loaded and highest-loaded level. Generally, there were no vertical oxygen gradients, and a one-box model satisfied. For periods with O 2 -stratification a two-box model has been developed. This model assumes that primary production only occurs in a well mixed top layer. <b>In</b> both series, <b>the</b> cumulative gross primary production over two years {{was positively related to}} the level of external nutrient input. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> dominated by benthic algae, a continuous increase in cumulative net systems production, that was positively related to the level of external nutrient input, was observed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> macrophyte <b>ditches,</b> <b>the</b> cumulative net systems production was positively related to the level of nutrient input during the first half year, but after that showed an irregular pattern. The maximum, areal daily gross productions during the summer, corrected for temperature, increased from 1990 to 1991 in all ditches dominated by benthic algae, but decreased <b>in</b> all macrophyte <b>ditches.</b> <b>The</b> accumulation of biomass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> with benthic algae was calculated from the cumulative net production, and showed a good agreement with measured values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>ditch,</b> but yielded higher values than measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium-loaded and highest-loaded ditches. Reaeration was calculated using a system specific, empirical wind-reaeration relationship. The wind speed was on average higher during the afternoon than {{during the rest of the}} day. High wind speeds thus coincide with high oxygen saturations, and the use of a variable reaeration coefficient during a day results in higher gross and net production estimates than the use of a constant value throughout a day...|$|R
