40|$|In the {{treatment}} of dystonia patients, we give a muscle afferent block (MAB), an intramuscular injection of lidocaine plus one tenth the volume of ethanol, to reduce abnormal hypercontraction of the relevant muscles. In this study we investigate {{the role of the}} proximal muscles in the pathophysiology of writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp.</b> Five idiopathic writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> patients were studied. MAB treatment targetting the forearm muscles was unsuccessful in all cases. All patients showed more improvement when they were given extra MAB injections into the proximal muscles. Two cases in particular benefitted just after proximal injections only. Our results show proximal muscles can be responsible for writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp.</b> We assume dystonia to be an abnormality in 2 ̆ 7 motor subroutine 2 ̆ 7; in accordance with certain repeated movements some motor loops can be formed between the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia and problems within these loops can cause dystonia. Some writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> patients gradually have difficulty with manual lacor other than writing resulting in incovenience when manipulating the upper limb. It is possible that the proximal muscles would take part in the 2 ̆ 7 motor subroutine 2 ̆ 7 of writing...|$|R

40|$|Patients with writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> present sensory and {{representational}} abnormalities {{relevant to}} motor control, such as impairment in the temporal discrimination between tactile stimuli and in pure motor imagery tasks, like the mental rotation of corporeal and inanimate objects. However, only limited {{information is available}} on the ability of patients with dystonia to process the time-dependent features (e. g. speed) of movement in real time. The processing of time-dependent features of movement has a crucial role in predicting whether the outcome of a complex motor sequence, such as handwriting or playing a musical passage, will be consistent with its ultimate goal, or results instead in an execution error. In this study, we sought to evaluate the implicit ability to perceive the temporal outcome of different movements in a group of patients with writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp.</b> Fourteen patients affected by writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> in the right hand and 17 age-and gender-matched healthy subjects were recruited for the study. Subjects were asked to perform a temporal expectation task by predicting the end of visually perceived human body motion (handwriting, i. e. the action performed by the human body segment specifically affected by writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp)</b> or inanimate object motion (a moving circle reaching a spatial target). Videos representing movements were shown in full before experimental trials; the actual tasks consisted of watching the same videos, but interrupted after a variable interval (2 ̆ 7 pre-dark 2 ̆ 7) from its onset by a dark interval of variable duration. During the 2 ̆ 7 dark 2 ̆ 7 interval, subjects were asked to indicate when the movement represented in the video reached its end by clicking on the space bar of the keyboard. We also included a visual working memory task. Performance on the timing task was analysed measuring the absolute value of timing error, the coefficient of variability and the percentage of anticipation responses. Patients with writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> exhibited greater absolute timing error compared with control subjects in the human body motion task (whereas no difference was observed in the inanimate object motion task). No effect of group was documented on the visual working memory tasks. Absolute timing error on the human body motion task did not significantly correlate with symptom severity, disease duration or writing speed. Our findings suggest an alteration of the writing movement representation at a central level and are consistent with the view that dystonia is not a purely motor disorder, but it also involves non-motor (sensory, cognitive) aspects related to movement processing and planning...|$|R

40|$|ADHD is a neurobiological {{disorder}} typically {{developed and}} diagnosed in childhood (Faraone et al., 2003). Impaired motor function is commonly observed in individuals with ADHD, but often overlooked (Brossard-Racine et al. 2011; Meyer and Sagvolden, 2006). Deficits in movement accuracy and increased movement variability {{can have a}} profound impact on fine motor skills, such as handwriting (Adi-Japha et al., 2007).

40|$|International audienceSensorimotor {{representations}} of movements are {{created in the}} sensorimotor network through repeated practice to support successful and effortless performance. Writer 3 <b>s</b> <b>cramp</b> (WC) is a disorder acquired through extensive practice of finger movements, {{and it is likely}} associated with the abnormal acquisition of sensorimotor representations. We investigated (i) the activation and connectivity changes in the brain network supporting the acquisition of sensorimotor {{representations of}} finger sequences in patients with WC and (ii) the link between these changes and consolidation of motor performance 24 h after the initial practice. Twenty-two patients with WC and 22 age-matched healthy volunteers practiced a complex sequence with the right (pathological) hand during functional MRI recording. Speed and accuracy were measured immediately before and after practice (day 1) and 24 h after practice (day 2). The two groups reached equivalent motor performance on day 1 and day 2. During motor practice, patients with WC had (i) reduced hippocampal activation and hippocampal–striatal functional connectivity; and (ii) overactivation of premotor–striatal areas, whose connectivity correlated with motor performance after consolidation. These results suggest that patients with WC use alternative networks to reach equiperformance in the acquisition of new motor memories...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores two English {{translations}} of Carlo Collodi's Le avventure di Pinocchio (1883), one by British translator M. A. Murray in 1891 {{and the other}} by American translator Walter <b>S.</b> <b>Cramp</b> in 1904. It also examines Walt Disney's adaptation of Pinocchio (1940) for the screen, {{and in the process}} studies how the different English target cultures and systems have motivated and influenced translators' and adaptors' decisions and how, therefore, translations and adaptations are necessarily products of their environment. My approach is to focus specifically on moments of violence in Collodi's text, and use them as particularly 'hot' text situations from which to study the English translations. These translations are placed into and then analysed in regard to their respective reconstructed socio-cultural, literary and translation contexts. The norms governing the British and American translators' and American adaptor's respective versions provide some insight into the translators' and adaptor's approach to violence in children's literature and help identify possible reasons for the differences between the source and the target texts, and also between the different translations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ensuring {{adequate}} {{dietary intake}} during pregnancy {{has important implications}} for optimising maternal and fetal health. It is not known whether diet quality is altered over pregnancy and the post-partum period. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} perform a comprehensive assessment of diet quality in overweight and obese women during pregnancy and early post-partum. DESIGN: In a prospective cohort study, n= 301 overweight or obese pregnant women completed a food frequency questionnaire at study entry (10 – 20 weeks gestation), 28 weeks gestation, 36 weeks gestation and 4 months post-partum for assessment of macronutrient and micronutrient intake and diet quality by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). RESULTS: Energy, macronutrient and dietary sources of micronutrients did not alter across pregnancy or post-partum. The HEI was of below average quality in 31. 0 % of women at baseline. This decreased from week 28 (P< 0. 001) and was maintained at a lower level post-partum such that HEI levels were lower compared with study entry (53. 3 ± 12. 7 versus 56. 7 ± 10. 1, P< 0. 001). The HEI decrease occurred in association with decreases in the milk, meat and unsaturated oil components, and increases in the proportion of energy from solid fats, alcohol and added sugars (P< 0. 001), and was independently predicted by the socioeconomic index for areas score (β=− 0. 011, s. e. = 0. 011, P= 0. 031). CONCLUSION: We report for the first time that dietary quality decreases across pregnancy and is maintained at this reduced level in the early post-partum period in overweight and obese women. Dietary interventions aimed at improving diet quality should be targeted to early pregnancy and post-partum. L. J. Moran, Z. Sui, C. <b>S.</b> <b>Cramp</b> and J. M. Dod...|$|R
