40|$|Using stable {{nitrogen}} and carbon isotope signatures, we investigated the trophic ecology and identified potential prey fish groups supporting the <b>giant</b> <b>Arapaima</b> within floodplain lakes of the Essequibo River basin in southwestern Guyana. Morphological descriptions of feeding structures and digestive tract are presented together with preliminary data on Arapaima diets. Stable isotope {{results suggest that}} algivorous/detritivorous and omnivorous fishes contributed most to Arapaima biomass, and generally, that was consistent with {{what is known about}} Arapaima diets. Stable nitrogen isotope ratios for piscivorous fishes in these lakes were higher than nitrogen isotope ratios for Arapaima, indicating that piscivorous fishes are unlikely to constitute a major source of energy for Arapaima. This population of Arapaima has an intestine averaging 1. 45 times total body length, relatively small teeth, and numerous, closely-spaced gill rakers. These morphological features, together with isotope data, support our inference that Arapaima are secondary consumers and may be better characterized as omnivores and not top predators...|$|E

50|$|The largest {{accepted}} {{record is}} {{of a female}} taken in 1827 in the Volga estuary at 1571 kg and 7.2 m. Several other records of aged sturgeon exceed 5 m. These great sizes mark the beluga as the largest freshwater fish in the world. A few other species of sturgeon can attain great sizes but none match the maximum sizes known for the beluga, like Chinese, Pacific White, Oceanic European, Atlantic, Baikalian, and Kaluga, the latter a close cousin which can attain a maximum weight of 1000 kg, thus attaining the second largest sturgeon size. It may {{be considered as a}} rival in size to the ocean sunfish among all extant bony fishes although that marine, passive giant has not been nearly as heavily fished nor takes as long to attain great sizes as does the beluga so more regularly attain massive weights. The Beluga also rivals the great white shark, the Greenland shark, and the tiger shark for the title of largest actively predatory fish, only the great white easily exceeding the beluga's maximum size. The giant belugas are much larger than the Mekong <b>giant</b> catfish, the <b>arapaima</b> or other sizable rivals for the title of largest freshwater fish. Nevertheless, some scientists still consider the Mekong giant catfish to be the largest true freshwater fish, owing to sturgeons' ability to survive in seawater and that it spends much of its life in brackish environments.|$|R
