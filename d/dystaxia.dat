5000|$|Ataxia is a {{neurological}} sign consisting {{of lack of}} voluntary coordination of muscle movements that includes gait abnormality. Ataxia is a non-specific clinical manifestation implying dysfunction of {{the parts of the}} nervous system that coordinate movement, such as the cerebellum. Ataxia can be limited {{to one side of the}} body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. <b>Dystaxia</b> is a mild degree of ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom. The word is from Greek α- negative prefix + -τάξις order = [...] "lack of order".|$|E
40|$|An {{autosomal}} dominant presenile dementia affecting 39 individuals in a seven-generation, 383 -member pedigree {{has been studied}} at Indiana University. In the affected members of this family, clinical symptoms occurred early in life, {{with an average age}} at onset of 48. 8 years. The presenting clinical features include disequilibrium, neck stiffness, dysphagia, and memory loss. As the disease progresses, further cognitive decline, superior-gaze palsy, and <b>dystaxia</b> also are observed. The average duration from onset of symptoms to death is approximately 10 years. Neuropathologic studies of nine affected individuals showed neuronal loss in several areas of the CNS, as well as argentophilic tau-immunopositive inclusions in neurons and in oligodendroglia. A limited genomic screen by use of DNA samples from 28 family members localized the gene for this disorder to a 3 -cM region on chromosome 17, between the markers THRA 1 and D 17 S 791. The gene for tau also was analyzed, through samples from the family...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{report a}} case of Wernicke {{encephalopathy}} in the early stage after surgery. Methods: A nonalcoholic female patient with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis and hypersplenism underwent splenectomy in a local hospital. No surgical complications occurred and the patient recovered well. However, on the eighth postoperative day she developed psychiatric and neurological disturbance without an obvious cause. She was then admitted to our hospital. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with FLAIR T 2 showed symmetric high-signal intensities in the periaqueductal area of the midbrain, which were consistent with Wernicke encephalopathy. She was thus given intramuscular thiamine immediately. Results: After the administration of thiamine, the patient’s confused mental state resolved within 3 d, and her <b>dystaxia</b> gradually improved over the next 5 d. The brain MRI with FLAIR T 2 was re-examined {{one month after the}} episode, and showed nearly complete resolution of the previously abnormal signal intensities in the periaqueductal area of the midbrain. Conclusion: Physicians {{should be aware of the}} possibility of acute Wernicke encephalopathy, especially in patients with liver dysfunction...|$|E
