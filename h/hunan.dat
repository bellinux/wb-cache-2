5|$|Because of {{the sudden}} large {{increase}} in the number of reported deaths in <b>Hunan</b> in a matter of hours, Chinese government officials accused local officials of covering up damage and casualty details. The Ministry of Civil Affairs sent a team to <b>Hunan</b> to investigate the allegations, and issued a notice stating that anyone found to be covering up any damage details would be held accountable.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1926 and March 1927 Peng campaigned in <b>Hunan,</b> {{participating}} in the capture of Changsha and Wuhan. Under general Ho Chien(何键), Peng participated in the Battle of Fengtai, in which Kuomintang forces decisively defeated the warlord Wu Peifu. In 1927, Wang Jingwei attempted to establish a left-leaning Kuomintang government in Wuhan that threatened Chiang Kai-shek's leadership. Tang Shengzhi, who Peng served under, aligned himself with Wang, and Peng was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and regimental commander. After Tang's forces were decisively defeated by Chiang, Peng commanded the rear guard, protecting the retreat of Tang's forces back into <b>Hunan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Field {{observations}} {{suggest that}} the mushroom associates mycorrhizally with the plant Castanopsis fissa, a deciduous tree found only in the southern provinces of China, such as Guangdong, Yunnan and <b>Hunan.</b> Mushroom fruitings are abundant in the warm spring rains of March and April, although they are also seen in May to July.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Tang Shengzhi aligned {{himself with}} {{northern}} warlords against the warlord controlling Guangdong, who was {{aligned with the}} Kuomintang. Peng conducted skirmishes along the Hunan-Guangdong border for nine months, but reorganized his battalion along pro-Kuomintang political lines in 1925. In late 1925 Chiang Kai-shek established the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) and led the Kuomintang {{to take control of}} Guangdong. Tang then aligned himself with Chiang and joined him in the Northern Expedition, an effort to unify China by defeating the northern warlords. The Hunanese army was reorganized, and Peng was promoted to the rank of major. When Wu Peifu invaded <b>Hunan</b> and occupied Changsha, Chiang sent the NRA to <b>Hunan,</b> beginning the Northern Expedition. Peng's forces then joined the Kuomintang, though Peng never joined the party as a formal member. It wasn't until after Peng joined the Kuomintang, in 1925, that he first heard of the Communist Party.|$|E

5|$|After passing {{north of}} Taiwan, Rananim made {{landfall}} at peak intensity around 1300UTC on August12, near Wenling in Zhejiang province in China. The China Meteorological Administration {{reported that the}} typhoon was the strongest to hit Zhejiang since Typhoon Sally in 1956. Moving over land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status as it turned toward the west. Early on August13, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; by that time, the circulation was over Jiangxi. The depression lasted another two days before dissipating over northwest <b>Hunan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bilis and its {{associated}} flooding left over 400,000people homeless, and over 2million more had to be evacuated {{in the face of}} rising waters. Following the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided food, blankets, and water purification kits to over 100,000 <b>Hunan</b> residents in mass evacuation shelters. The relief effort was complicated by an earthquake in Yunnan, as well as three more tropical cyclones: Typhoon Kaemi, Typhoon Prapiroon, and Typhoon Saomai. All of the storms were stronger than Bilis, and exacerbated flooding and other problems in the region.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes has a disjunct distribution, {{and is one}} {{of several}} fungi found in both eastern Asia and eastern North America. In North America, where it is {{relatively}} common, the range of the fungus extends from Alaska south to Mexico, and east to New York. In Central America, it has been recorded in Belize. The mushroom has also been recorded from Taiwan, China (including Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Kwangsi, and <b>Hunan),</b> and Japan.

5|$|In May 1945, Australian troops {{landed in}} Borneo, {{overrunning}} the oilfields there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March, and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May. Chinese forces started to counterattack in Battle of West <b>Hunan</b> that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa {{by the end}} of June. At the same time, American submarines cut off Japanese imports, drastically reducing Japan's ability to supply its overseas forces.|$|E
5|$|Suillus bovinus {{is found}} in conifer woods and {{plantations}} across Europe, including subalpine regions in the Alps, up to altitudes of 800m (2500ft). It is common in Lithuania, where it associates with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the only naturally occurring pine in that country. Preferred soils of S.bovinus are often acidic, sand-based, or sometimes calcareous (chalky) and moraine. In Asia, it has been recorded in Taiwan, and in Japan, where it associates with Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora). In China, it has been recorded from provinces Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, <b>Hunan,</b> Jiangxi, and Zhejiang.|$|E
5|$|The provincial {{observatory}} of Fujian {{issued a}} typhoon warning for the province on July 11, {{well in advance}} of Bilis' final landfall. In response to the warning, officials evacuated over 800,000people from <b>Hunan</b> and 70,000 from Zhejiang. In addition, 256,000 fishermen and workers were evacuated from coastal areas in southeastern China, and 220,000 ships were ordered to return to port. In Shanghai, the evacuations caused significant rail and bus delays, and more than 210 flights {{in and out of the}} city were canceled prior to landfall.|$|E
5|$|When Peng's grand-uncle died in 1911, Peng {{left home}} {{and worked at}} a coalmine in Xiangtan, where he pushed carts of coal for {{thirteen}} {{hours a day for}} a wage of nine yuan a month. In 1912, shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled, cheating Peng out of half his annual wages. Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913 <b>Hunan</b> suffered another drought, and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant's storehouse, and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng's arrest, and he fled to northern <b>Hunan,</b> where he worked for two years as a construction laborer {{for the construction of a}} dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed, in 1916, Peng assumed that he was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home, joining the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.|$|E
5|$|From 1905–1907, Peng was {{enrolled}} in a traditional Confucian primary school. In 1908 Peng attended a modern primary school; but, at the age of ten, was forced to withdraw from this school due to his family's deteriorating financial situation. In 1905–1906, there was a severe drought in <b>Hunan.</b> Peng's mother died in 1905, and Peng's six-month-old brother died of hunger. Peng's father was forced to sell most of his family possessions for food, and to pawn most of his family's land. When Peng was withdrawn from school in 1908, he and his brothers were sent to beg for food in their village. From 1908–1910, Peng took a job looking after a pair of water buffaloes.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 China and Germany inaugurated {{a long-distance}} freight train service between Beijing and Hamburg. Travelling {{a total of}} , the train uses the China Railways and the Trans-Mongolian line to travel from Xiangtan (in <b>Hunan</b> Province) to Ulaanbaatar, where it then {{continues}} north to the Trans-Siberian. After reaching {{the end of the}} Trans-Siberian at Moscow the train continues to Germany via rail links in Belarus and Poland. Total transit time is 15 days, as compared with the 30 days average it would take for the freight to make the same journey by ship. The first train of 50 containers, carrying a mixed load of clothes, ceramics and electronics (for the Fujitsu company), travelled on tracks operated by six different railways.|$|E
5|$|In Qinghai, the Salar Muslims voluntarily {{came under}} Ming rule, their clan leaders capitulating around 1370. Uyghur troops under Uyghur general Hala Bashi {{suppressed}} the Miao Rebellions of the 1370s {{and settled in}} Changde, <b>Hunan.</b> Hui Muslim troops also settled in Changde, <b>Hunan</b> after serving the Ming in campaigns against other aboriginal tribes. In 1381, the Ming dynasty annexed {{the areas of the}} southwest that had once been part of the Kingdom of Dali following the successful effort by Hui Muslim Ming armies to defeat Yuan-loyalist Mongol and Hui Muslim troops holding out in Yunnan province. The Hui troops under General Mu Ying, who was appointed Governor of Yunnan, were resettled in the region as part of a colonization effort. By the end of the 14th century, some 200,000 military colonists settled some 2,000,000 mu (350,000 acres) of land in what is now Yunnan and Guizhou. Roughly half a million more Chinese settlers came in later periods; these migrations caused a major shift in the ethnic make-up of the region, since formerly {{more than half of the}} population were non-Han peoples. Resentment over such massive changes in population and the resulting government presence and policies sparked more Miao and Yao revolts in 1464 to 1466, which were crushed by an army of 30,000 Ming troops (including 1,000 Mongols) joining the 160,000 local Guangxi (see Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)). After the scholar and philosopher Wang Yangming (1472–1529) suppressed another rebellion in the region, he advocated single, unitary administration of Chinese and indigenous ethnic groups in order to bring about sinification of the local peoples.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1957 Mao {{suggested}} a nationwide programme of mass collectivization, in which China's farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao's theories on mass collectivization became {{the basis of the}} Great Leap Forward, a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, {{tens of millions of people}} had starved to death. From October–December 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to work in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, <b>Hunan,</b> Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.|$|E
5|$|Mao {{was born}} on December 26, 1893 in his {{familiar}} home in the rural village of Shaoshanchong in Xiangtan county, <b>Hunan</b> Province, part of south-central China. Typical of many Hunanese villages, Shaoshanchong was situated in a narrow valley surrounded by mountains. Both the village and the nearest town, Shaoshan, were named for the local Shaoshan Mountain ("Music Mountain"), a prominent feature in the local landscape with sacred associations for the region's Buddhists. The village was inhabited by many individuals with the surname of Mao; the Mao clan traced their lineage back to Mao Taihua, a warrior from Jiangxi Province who had moved to Xiangtan county in the mid-fourteenth century after fighting for Zhu Yuanzhang's military campaign to overthrow the Mongol-governed Yuan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Paper {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} discoveries of ancient China. Beginning in the 3rd century BCE paper was made in all sizes with various materials. Silk was no exception, and silk workers had been making paper since the 2nd century BCE. Silk, bamboo, linen, wheat and rice straw were all used differently, and paper made with silk became the first type of luxury paper. Researchers have found an early example of writing done on silk paper in the tomb of a Marchioness who died around 168, in Mawangdui, Changsha, <b>Hunan.</b> The material was certainly more expensive, but also more practical than bamboo slips. Treatises on many subjects, including meteorology, medicine, astrology, divinity, and even maps written on silk have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Rice cultivation: In 2002, a Chinese and Japanese group {{reported}} the discovery in eastern China of fossilised phytoliths of domesticated rice apparently {{dating back to}} 11,900 BC or earlier. However, phytolith data are controversial in some quarters due to potential contamination problems. It is likely that demonstrated rice was cultivated in the middle Yangtze Valley by 7000 BC, as shown in finds from the Pengtoushan culture at Bashidang, Changde, <b>Hunan.</b> By 5000 BC, rice had been domesticated at Hemudu culture near the Yangtze Delta and was being cooked in pots. Although millet remained the main crop in northern China throughout history, several sporadic attempts {{were made by the}} state to introduce rice around the Bohai Gulf as early as the 1st century.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{had mixed}} success in {{mainland}} Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched {{the first of}} two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields. By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha in the <b>Hunan</b> province.|$|E
5|$|The {{early life}} of Chinese revolutionary and {{politician}} Mao Zedong covered the first 27 {{years of his}} life, from 1893 to 1919. Born in Shaoshanchong, Shaoshan in <b>Hunan</b> province, Mao grew up {{as the son of}} Mao Yichang, a wealthy farmer and landowner. Sent to the local Shaoshan Primary School, Mao was brought up in an environment of Confucianism, but reacted against this from an early age, developing political ideas from modern literature. Aged 13 his father organised a marriage for him with Luo Yigu, the daughter of another land-owning family, but Mao denounced the marriage and moved away from home.|$|E
5|$|There were varying {{types of}} land {{ownership}} and tenure {{depending on the}} topography and climate of one's locality. In hilly, peripheral areas far from trade routes, most peasant farmers owned and cultivated their own fields. In frontier regions such as <b>Hunan</b> and Sichuan, owners of wealthy estates gathered serfs to till their lands. The most advanced areas had few estates with serfs tilling the fields; these regions had long fostered wet-rice cultivation, which did not require centralized management of farming. Landlords set fixed rents for tenant farmers in these regions, while independent small farming families also owned their own lots.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of its genus, C.cinnabarinum is {{generally}} considered inedible by field guides. Because the fruit bodies begin development underground, they are too tough for consumption {{by the time they}} are visible, and their appearance may be considered unappetizing. A study of the cultural practices of mestizo descendants of the Otomi people in Tenango de Doria, Mexico, reported that immature specimens of C.cinnabarinum, known locally as yemitas, were frequently eaten raw in the past, especially by children. Consumption of the species was no longer commonplace, with only five of the 450 locals interviewed familiar with the practice. The gleba of C.cinnabarinum has been described as having a mild taste and, despite a local recollection to the contrary, is not sweet. C.cinnabarinum has also been used in traditional medicine. A 1986 ethnomycological study of native traditions in Veracruz identified this use of huang noono, which locals roasted, then consumed as a powder with mineral water to treat gastrointestinal distress. Unlike these Mexican traditions, <b>Hunan</b> folk beliefs hold that the mushroom is poisonous on account of its bright color.|$|E
5|$|In late 1646 {{two more}} Southern Ming monarchs {{emerged in the}} {{southern}} province of Guangzhou, reigning under the era names of Shaowu (紹武) and Yongli. Short of official costumes, the Shaowu court had to purchase robes from local theater troops. The two Ming regimes fought each other until 20 January 1647, when a small Qing force led by Li Chengdong captured Guangzhou, killed the Shaowu Emperor, and sent the Yongli court fleeing to Nanning in Guangxi. In May 1648, however, Li mutinied against the Qing, and the concurrent rebellion of another former Ming general in Jiangxi helped Yongli to retake most of south China. This resurgence of loyalist hopes was short-lived. New Qing armies managed to reconquer the central provinces of Huguang (present-day Hubei and <b>Hunan),</b> Jiangxi, and Guangdong in 1649 and 1650. The Yongli emperor had to flee again. Finally on 24 November 1650, Qing forces led by Shang Kexi captured Guangzhou and massacred the city's population, killing as many as 70,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Peng enlisted as {{a private}} second class, with a monthly wage of 5.5 yuan, 2 yuan of which he sent back to support his family. Within seven months he was {{promoted}} to private first class, with a monthly wage of 6 yuan, 3 yuan of which he sent to his family. One of Peng's commanding officers was an idealistic Nationalist who had participated in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, who influenced Peng to sympathize with the Kuomintang goals of social reform and national reunification. When another civil war broke out in 1917, Peng's regiment split from the rest of its army and joined the forces of Tang Shengzhi, who was aligned with Tan Yankai and Sun Yat-sen, against those aligned with the northern warlord Wu Peifu. During this period Peng received training in formal tactics from an officer in his brigade. In July 1918 Peng was captured while on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, but was released after two weeks. In April 1919 Peng was promoted to master sergeant and acting platoon commander. Tang Shengzhi's forces drove enemy troops out of <b>Hunan</b> in July 1920, capturing the provincial capital of Changsha.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{remained}} behind to guard Jinggangshan {{with a force}} of 800 soldiers, but withdrew from the area when it was attacked by a Hunanese Kuomintang force of 25,000 soldiers, joining Zhu and Mao in Ruijin in March. Although he had saved his force from destruction, he was criticized by Mao for withdrawing. Peng returned to Jinggangshan with a force of 1,000 men later that year, occupying the area after the Kuomintang withdrew. In mid-1929 Peng's forces merged with the forces of two local bandit groups, but conflicts arose over supplies and the command structure, and the two groups rebelled against Peng in July 1929. One of the bandit leaders was captured and executed by Peng, and the other committed suicide. The remaining forces were incorporated into Peng's unit, bringing its strength up to 2,000 men. Peng then organized a series of increasingly ambitious raids into southern <b>Hunan</b> throughout 1929 and 1930, capturing an increasing amount of supplies and attracting more recruits.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Chinese made careful {{observations}} of heavenly bodies and phenomena since {{observations of}} the cosmos were used for astrology and prognostication. The astronomer Gan De (fl. 4th century BCE) from the State of Qi {{was the first in}} history to acknowledge sunspots as genuine solar phenomena (and not obstructing natural satellites as thought in the West after Einhard's observation in 807 CE), while the first precisely dated sunspot observation in China occurred on May 10, 28 BCE during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 33–7 BCE). Among the Mawangdui Silk Texts dated no later than 168 BCE (when they were sealed in a tomb at Mawangdui Han tombs site, Changsha, <b>Hunan</b> province), the Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images (Tianwen qixiang zazhan 天文氣象雜占) manuscript illustrates in writings and ink drawings roughly three-hundred different climatic and astronomical features including clouds, mirages, rainbows, stars, constellations, and comets. Another silk text from the same site reports the times and locations of the rising and setting of planets in the night sky from the years 246–177 BCE.|$|E
5|$|While maps {{drawn in}} ink on flat silk cloths {{have been found}} in the tomb of the Marquess of Dai (interred in 168 BCE at Mawangdui, <b>Hunan</b> province), the {{earliest}} known paper map found in China, dated 179–41 BCE and located at Fangmatan (near Tianshui, Gansu province), is incidentally the oldest known piece of paper. Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper. The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack. By the 3rd century, paper became one of China's chief writing mediums.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} native ethnic groups within Song China {{that did not}} belong to the Han Chinese majority. This {{included}} the Yao people, who staged tribal uprisings against the Song in Guangdong in 1035 and <b>Hunan</b> in 1043, during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song (r. 1023–1064). Song authorities employed Zhuang people as local officials in what is now Guangxi and Guangdong, where the Song placed them in charge of distributing land to the Yao and other tribal groups. The Yao peoples and others on the empire's frontier were incorporated into a feudal system, or fengjian shehui, which Ralph A. Litzinger says bypassed any possible native development of a primitive slave society, or nuli shehui, since the Yao and others lacked a sedentary tradition. Although mainland Chinese states made efforts to settle parts of Hainan Island since the 3rd century BC, {{it was not until the}} Song that a concerted effort was made to assimilate the Li people of its highlands, who at times had fought against and repelled Han Chinese settlers. During the 11th century, the Man people of Hainan wreaked havoc by joining bandit gangs of ten to several hundred men. The statesman Ouyang Xiu estimated in 1043 that there were at least several thousand Man bandits residing in a dozen or so prefectures of mainland China.|$|E
5|$|Though the Qing under Dorgon's {{leadership}} {{had successfully}} pushed the Southern Ming deep into southern China, Ming loyalism was not dead yet. In early August 1652, Li Dingguo, {{who had served}} as general in Sichuan under bandit king Zhang Xianzhong (d. 1647) and was now protecting the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming, retook Guilin (Guangxi province) from the Qing. Within a month, most of the commanders who had been supporting the Qing in Guangxi reverted to the Ming side. Despite occasionally successful military campaigns in Huguang and Guangdong {{in the next two}} years, Li failed to retake important cities. In 1653, the Qing court put Hong Chengchou in charge of retaking the southwest. Headquartered in Changsha (in what is now <b>Hunan</b> province), he patiently built up his forces; only in late 1658 did well-fed and well-supplied Qing troops mount a multipronged campaign to take Guizhou and Yunnan. In late January 1659, a Qing army led by Manchu prince Doni took the capital of Yunnan, sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing into nearby Burma, which was then ruled by King Pindale Min of the Toungoo dynasty. The last sovereign of the Southern Ming stayed there until 1662, when he was captured and executed by Wu Sangui, the former Ming general whose surrender to the Manchus in April 1644 had allowed Dorgon to start the Qing conquest of China.|$|E
5|$|Crossbow and repeating crossbow: According to British art {{historian}} Matthew Landruss and Gerald Hurley, Chinese crossbows {{may have been}} invented {{as far back as}} 2000 BC, while Anne McCants speculates that they existed around 1200 BC. In China bronze crossbow bolts dating as early as the mid 5th century BC were found at a State of Chu burial site in Yutaishan, Hubei. The earliest handheld crossbow stocks with bronze trigger, dating from the 6th century BC, comes from Tomb 3 and 12 found at Qufu, Shandong, capital of the State of Lu. Other early finds of crossbows were discovered in Tomb 138 at Saobatang, <b>Hunan</b> dated to the mid 4th century BC. Repeating crossbows, first mentioned in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, were discovered in 1986 in Tomb 47 at Qinjiazui, Hubei dated to around the 4th century BC. The earliest textual evidence of the handheld crossbow used in battle dates to the 4th century BC. Handheld crossbows with complex bronze trigger mechanisms have also been found with the Terracotta Army in the tomb of Qin Shihuang (r. 221–210 BC) that are similar to specimens from the subsequent Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), while crossbowmen described in the Han Dynasty learned drill formations, some were even mounted as cavalry units, and Han dynasty writers attributed the success of numerous battles against the Xiongnu to massed crossbow fire. In comparison, the ancient Greeks also had a crossbow known as the gastraphetes ("belly-bow", so named because the shooter had to draw the bow by pressing his stomach against the concave rear) also invented in the 5th century BC; other versions were the more portable Cheirobalista (hand balista), arcubalista and manubalista, this last Roman version was almost all metal composed (the spring mechanism and the skeins). There was also the katapeltikon (399 BC), a siege weapon using similar mechanisms. Unlike the Chinese crossbow, the heavy weight and bulk of these weapons necessitated a prop to keep them standing.|$|E
