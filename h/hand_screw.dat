5000|$|The {{definition}} of the term screw machine has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws, that is, {{there would have been no}} established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term screw machine was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic screw machine was applied, and the term <b>hand</b> <b>screw</b> machine or manual screw machine was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic screw machines, and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term screw machine no longer was used to refer to manual or semi-automatic turret lathes, having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of screw machine remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models [...] "screw machines", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called screw machines there were variations, such as single-spindle versus multispindle, horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc.|$|E

The ship is built to Lloyds’ 100 A1 class, with additions to the scantlings in various parts to meet the requirements of the traffic. The first-class accommodation includes staterooms and beds for 36 passengers, with dining-saloon, smokeroom, ladies’-room, and conveniences, worked out in polished and hard woods, and finished in a tasteful manner. Complete fittings are also provided for 100 emigrants in the forward ‘tween decks. The boats and their outfit, with life-belts, &c., will be in accordance with the provisions of the Life-Saving Applicances Act of 1888, which recently came into force.

The most favorite grasping posture is calculated when the multi-fingered robot hand can withstand the largest external wrench. In order to guarantee the explosive not to be exploded under the exceeding grasp force, the weight of the explosive the multi-fingered hand can hold is also discussed in this paper.

30|$|An {{object is}} called chiral {{if there is}} no {{translational}} or rotational transformation that allows its mirror image to be superimposed onto the original one. As Lord Kelvin mentioned [21], chiral media and systems are ubiquitous. For example, our <b>hands,</b> <b>screws,</b> shells of snails and so on are clearly chiral.

Very frequently, however, a medium’s chirality is ignored, which has led, for example, to the disastrous misuse of sedative drug thalidomide [22]. From the perspective of optics, there are two main reasons for this: the optical response due to chirality is in general weaker than the achiral response and a medium can include an equal number of elements with two different handedness (which is called racemic mixture) rendering it optically inactive.|$|R

40|$|Background: Pedicle screw {{instrumentation}} {{has many}} advantages for correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) deformity including better correction and fewer late complications. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>screw</b> insertion in AIS is challenging. Intraoperative fluoroscopy or navigation techniques are expensive, time-consuming, and exposed to high radiation. Free-hand technique {{relies on the}} surgeon's experience and locating the pedicle entry point with anatomical landmarks. There are few studies that evaluated pedicle screw position accuracy with postoperative multi-slice computed tomography scan. Materials and Methods: We prospectively considered 38 consecutive AIS cases, who underwent corrective surgery with all pedicle screw technique. All the screws were inserted with free-hand technique using anatomic landmarks {{as a guide for}} an entry site. We divided pedicle penetration in medial, lateral, inferior, superior, and anterior vertebral body as Grades 0 – 4, that Grade 0 is fully contained within the pedicle, Grade 1 (6 mm). Results: A total of 720 screws were inserted, of which 623 screws (86. 5 %) were perfect and 97 screws (13. 5 %) were misplaced. Of those which were misplaced, 39 screws (40. 2 %) were medial and 58 (59. 8 %) were lateral, which shows that the prevalence of lateral misplacement was more in comparison to medial misplacement. However, in all misplaced cases, the deviation of the screw was < 2 mm (Grade 1). There was no misplacement in the inferior and superior. Conclusion: Pedicle screw insertion in AIS with the free-hand technique is a safe and reliable method...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Functional outcome after {{reconstruction}} of open ankle injuries {{has not been}} well presented in the literature. The authors present the functional results of 24 patients who sustained complex ankle injuries. METHODS: Patients were assessed using three scoring systems (a modified A/O score, the Enneking score, and the AOFAS) and subdivided into two groups: those primarily treated at Charing Cross Hospital according to strict protocols combining orthopedic and plastic surgical techniques (group P) and those secondarily treated who were transferred to Charing Cross Hospital after initial management at a remote unit (group S). RESULTS: There were nine patients (37. 5 percent) in group P and 15 (62. 5 percent) in group S. Eighteen patients (75 percent) underwent free-tissue transfer. Sixteen patients (67 percent) were assessed (group P, n = 7; group S, n = 9) for return of function using the Enneking score. Mean time to assessment was 10. 5 months for group P and 11. 4 months for group S. Mean Enneking percentage score was 75 for group P and 72. 2 for group S. There {{were no significant differences}} (p > 0. 05) between these scores. The mean time to union was 19 weeks (n = 5) for group P and 24 weeks (n = 7) for group S. The mean AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scores were comparable to the Enneking scores when independent observers undertook this assessment. Most patients in both groups reported difficulty with descent of stairs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the authors were able to achieve a similar return of function for both groups, group S patients needed at least one more operation. In cases of ankle fracture where there is significant soft-tissue injury (either closed or open), representing a complex injury, the authors recommend making no attempt to internally fix the fracture and instead referring the patient to a specialist center for combined orthoplastic attention. If this is not immediately at <b>hand,</b> <b>screw</b> fixation of the medial malleolus should be undertaken after open reduction. The lateral malleolus should not be internally fixed, but should it require control, external fixation is the preferred method of skeletal stabilization...|$|E
