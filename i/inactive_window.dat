5000|$|Windows 7 {{introduced}} Aero Flip (renamed Windows Flip in Windows 8). When {{the user}} holds down the [...] key, Aero Flip causes only {{the contents of}} the selected window to be displayed. The remaining windows are replaced with transparent glass-like sheets that give an impression where the <b>inactive</b> <b>window</b> is located.|$|E
5000|$|Task {{switcher}} is {{a feature}} present in Windows 3.0 and all subsequent versions of Windows. It allows a user to cycle through existing application windows by holding down the [...] key and tapping the [...] key. Starting with Windows 95, {{as long as}} the [...] key is pressed, a list of active windows is displayed, allowing the user to cycle through the list by tapping the [...] key. An alternative to this form of switching is using the mouse to click on a visible portion of an <b>inactive</b> <b>window.</b> However, [...] may be used to switch out of a full screen window. This is particularly useful in video games that lock, restrict or alter mouse interactions for the purpose of the game. Starting with Windows Vista, Windows Desktop is included in the list and can be activated this way.|$|E
50|$|Appearance {{allows users}} to {{customize}} the Windows Classic theme by changing the colour of various objects, such as scrollbars, active and <b>inactive</b> <b>windows,</b> menu bar, message box, window borders, window frame, selected items, font colours, 3D objects, {{and a few other}} things as well.|$|R
5000|$|Mac OS X Leopard brought wide-ranging {{changes to}} Aqua. Aqua windows and [...] "brushed metal" [...] windows {{obtained}} the same metal-like, gray look, pin-striped backgrounds were removed entirely, toolbars and titlebars were fused into a whole, differences between active and <b>inactive</b> <b>windows</b> became more distinct through thicker drop shadows and a monochrome appearance of <b>inactive</b> <b>windows,</b> {{the color of}} the menubar was changed into gray with an optional semi-transparency look on capable Macs and the Dock obtained a 3D look with a reflective glass-like 'floor'. The Dock's design, when placed on the left or right side, changed to a black translucent background with a white border and rounded corners. Context menus had slightly-rounded corners and numerous icons were redesigned, including folder icons and System Preferences icons.|$|R
25|$|Window {{management}} in Windows 7 has several new features: Snap maximizes a window {{when it is}} dragged {{to the top of}} the screen. Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows users to snap software windows to either side of the screen, such that the windows take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were snapped or maximized using Snap, the system restores their previous state. Snap functions can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts. Shake hides all <b>inactive</b> <b>windows</b> when the active window's title bar is dragged back and forth rapidly (metaphorically shaken).|$|R
50|$|In Mac OS X Panther, brushed metal {{was brought}} to the Finder. New buttons were made to appear sunken into their surroundings, {{following}} a general trend of more flattened interface elements in the operating system. The traditional pinstripes were replaced with a much subtler theme, most notably in the menu bar, and the use of transparency was again reduced (for example in the title bars of <b>inactive</b> <b>windows).</b> Tabs also changed; they were made flatter and the whole tab area was sunken rather than raised. Tab buttons were centered on the top border of the tab area. New icons appeared across the system, including a new flatter, glossier Finder icon and a new System Preferences icon.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, Aqua had two window designs: {{the default}} Aqua windows and [...] "brushed metal" [...] windows. Aqua windows {{typically}} have a metal-like or gray titlebar with three {{buttons on the}} left side (for closing, minimizing and zooming or entering fullscreen mode). Visually, these buttons used to be placed on top, but later appeared 'sunken' into the window. Aqua windows have almost no frame or outside border, instead drop shadows are used to separate and distinguish active from <b>inactive</b> <b>windows.</b> The aesthetic of the window backgrounds changed from pin-striped to white backgrounds. Brushed-metal windows had a thick frame with a metallic texture or dark-gray background and sunken buttons and inner frames. They had the additional property of being draggable at every point of the frame instead of just the titlebar and toolbar. Apple recommended brushed-metal windows for applications that mimic real-world devices (such as iTunes) or are used to interface with such devices (such as iSync), but was criticised by designers for not following its own guidelines or applying it inconsistently (it was also used in Safari or Finder). Brushed-metal windows have been largely phased out since Leopard and become visually indistinctive from Aqua windows.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—GridFTP is an {{exceptionally}} fast transfer protocol for {{large volumes of}} data. Implementations of it are widely deployed and used on well-connected Grid environments {{such as those of}} the TeraGrid because of its ability to scale to network speeds. However, when the data is partitioned into many small files instead of few large files, it suffers from lower transfer rates. The latency between the serialized transfer requests of each file directly detracts from the amount of time data pathways are active, thus lowering achieved throughput. Further, when a data pathway is <b>inactive,</b> the TCP <b>window</b> closes, and TCP must go through the slow-start algorithm. The performance penalty can be severe. This situation is known as the “lots of small files ” problem. In this paper we introduce a solution to this problem. This solution, called pipelining, allows many transfer requests to be sent to the server before any one completes. Thus, pipelining hides the latency of each transfer request by sending the requests while a data transfer is in progress. We present an implementation and performance study of the pipelining solution. Index Terms — data transfer, small files, GridFTP...|$|R
