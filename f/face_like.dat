There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L half-sections. Where ZiT faces ZiT, the section is called a Π section. Where ZiΠ faces ZiΠ the section formed is a T section. Further additions of half-sections to either of these forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or shunt elements.|$|E

5|$|In the {{anthropomorphic}} form, Varaha {{often has}} a stylized boar <b>face,</b> <b>like</b> the zoomorphic models. The snout may be shorter. The position {{and size of}} the tusks may also be altered. The ears, cheeks and eyes are generally based on human ones. Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced the issue of how to attach the boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck. However, in Badami, the problem was resolved by including a human neck. While some sculptures show a mane, it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown - typical of Vishnu iconography - in others. Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right; there are very rare instances of left-facing Varaha depictions.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Saadanius provides new evidence for competing hypotheses about the facial {{appearance of the}} ancestral crown catarrhines, or common ancestor. One reconstruction is based on living catarrhine traits and predicts a short face and a rounded braincase, {{similar to that of}} a gibbon. Another reconstruction, based on the morphology of early Miocene apes and the basal cercopithecoid Victoriapithecus, predicts that the last common ancestor had a projecting snout and tall <b>face,</b> <b>like</b> that of living baboons and the oldest fossil apes and Old World monkeys. The conservative features of Saadanius, {{similar to those of the}} older stem catarrhines, support the latter hypothesis, according to Zalmout et al. However, one palaeontologist, Eric Delson, has cautioned that geological pressure may have distorted the shape of the skull.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain <b>face</b> <b>like</b> its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E

25|$|Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is {{characterized}} by involuntary contraction of facial muscles, typically occurring only {{on one side of}} the <b>face.</b> <b>Like</b> blepharospasm, the frequency of contractions in hemifacial spasm may range from intermittent to frequent and constant. The unilateral blepharospasm of HFS may interfere with routine tasks such as driving. In addition to medication, patients may respond well to treatment with Botox. HFS may be due to vascular compression of the nerves going to the muscles of the face. For these patients, surgical decompression may be a viable option for the improvement of symptoms.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to make the game look more realistic, many of the real players in the game had their entire body scanned into the game, as opposed to just the <b>face</b> <b>like</b> in {{previous}} NBA 2K games. A first for the NBA 2K series, the full body scanning allows the entire body of a specific player to be uniquely different from any other body. In previous NBA 2K games, a player's face was unique, while the body was generic and predefined. The full body scanning improves details in players' tattoos as well, something that has been criticized in past NBA 2K games. Cheerleaders, coaches, and fans were also scanned into the game; the designs of cheerleaders, coaches, and the crowd have too been criticized in past games.|$|E
25|$|Both Suther and Régine Tessier, {{the latter}} in a sketch of Sage in Notable American Women: The Modern Period, note key {{features}} of Sage’s mature work. Most of Sage’s paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and latticework, which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Some contain figures that {{might or might not}} be human, hidden by flowing drapery. (Le Passage, one of Sage’s last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even Small Portrait, thought by many to be a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as a <b>face.)</b> <b>Like</b> Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as “reminiscent of the sulphurous light before a thunderstorm”. Critics frequently called Sage’s work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.|$|E

In addition, Pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour—"a <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a month of wet weekends" [...] and [...] "a voice that could curdle milk."

500|$|Several L half-sections may be {{cascaded}} to form {{a composite}} filter. [...] The most important rule when constructing a composite image filter is that the image impedances must always face an identical impedance; like must always <b>face</b> <b>like.</b> [...] T sections must always face T sections, Π sections must always face Π sections, k-type must always face k-type (or the side of an m-type which has the k-type impedance) and m-type must always face m-type. [...] Furthermore, m-type impedances of different values of m cannot face each other. [...] Nor can sections of any type which have different values of cut-off frequency.|$|E
500|$|... {{the female}} Shiba Inu {{featured}} in the original meme, was a pedigree puppy who was sent to an animal shelter when her puppy mill shut down. She was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Satō, and named after the citrus fruit kabosu because Sato thought she had a round <b>face</b> <b>like</b> the fruit. Another Shiba Inu {{featured in the}} meme is Suki, a female belonging to photographer Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco. His wife had accidentally put a scarf in the wash, making it shrink. He took a photograph of Suki wearing the scarf outside on a cold night in February 2010.|$|E

On Saw V, I pulled back a little bit and on this one, I pulled back even more." [...] He commented that the [...] "steam room" [...] trap was the [...] "best looking" [...] of them all. [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's big and expensive. It's got furnaces, fires and steam. It's multi-leveled. The most complex Saw. We had techno cranes flying through. It was pretty amazing."

500|$|Several {{publications}} {{commented on}} her cannibalistic tendencies. In a VentureBeat humor article by Jason Lomberg, Mileena [...] "tried {{her hand at}} stripping, modeling, and a stint on The View. But {{none of them could}} satisfy her insatiable desire for carnage and human flesh," [...] so she became Donald Trump’s co-host on The Apprentice. Ranking 1992's Mortal Kombat as the second-most controversial violent video game in history, CNN's Doug Gross noted that in the reboot, [...] "options include eating an opponent's head." [...] X360 chose her MK2011 Fatality, [...] "in which she tears a man's head off then chows down upon it", to represent cannibalism on their list of the top ten video game crimes. In a feature about Tommy Wiseau's 2011 web series The Tommy-Wi Show, Carl Lyon of Fearnet described Wiseau therein as [...] "an ambiguously-accented, sleepy-eyed 'actor' who chews scenery like Mileena on an opponent's throat." [...] Praising the 2011 reboot game for its inclusion of [...] "iconic" [...] characters and [...] "the quite remarkable violence," [...] GamesMaster opined one [...] "simply cannot watch Mileena throw swords into Johnny Cage, decapitate him and then take repeated bites out of his <b>face</b> <b>like</b> a dog on death row without deeply desiring this game."
