5|$|After {{three years}} at Cornell, Warner {{returned}} to Carlisle. <b>He</b> <b>considered</b> his second stint there his best. From 1907 to 1914, the team won ten or more games a season five times.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Chekhov {{qualified}} as a physician, which <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> his principal profession though he made little money {{from it and}} treated the poor free of charge.|$|E

5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. Perhaps most importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote that <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> renaming the play The Night is Young. After the play opened, <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> changing its name each day to match the current date.|$|E
5|$|As general Yang Pu {{returned}} north {{with his}} soldiers after the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, he requested the emperor's permission to annex Dongyue. The emperor refused after <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> {{the morale of}} the troops. Zou Yushan had promised to supply an army to assist the Han in their war against the Nanyue. The army never arrived and Zou blamed the weather conditions, while secretly maintaining a diplomatic relationship with Nanyue.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming {{came up with}} the concept of the front cover design; <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced in the book and wanted this echoed on the cover.

5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E
5|$|By {{the mid-1990s}} Arnada had begun working for Bintang Indonesia, {{owned by the}} Ciputra family.

During this time he worked extensively with MTV Indonesia and various start-ups.|$|E

5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (<b>he</b> <b>considered</b> its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{early years}} in the {{entertainment}} industry were marred with difficulties. When his role in the second season of Alias was demoted to a minuscule part, <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> quitting show business.
