40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{equity and}} debt securitisation in Germany {{and its implications}} for the property industry. Based on the current market environment the key drivers of change that will lead to an increase in equity and debt securitisation {{within the next five years}} are discussed. Furthermore, the crucial legal requirements and restrictions that will determine the future success of German real estate securitisation are identified. In terms of real estate investment, Germany is the biggest market in Europe. Nevertheless, the total securitised real estate equity has only been € 7 billion as of August 2005. It is broadly anticipated that the introduction of REITs in Germany will promote a fast expansion of the listed property sector. Particularly by eliminating the current tax disadvantages and by providing corporates and private equity investors with an attractive <b>exit</b> <b>vehicle</b> for their property portfolios. On the debt side, 70 % of all German real estate is funded through the use of traditional bank loans. Apart from synthetic debt securitisation structures and the German Pfandbrief market, which exceeds a volume of over € 1 trillion, international capital market instruments have not yet been established. However, recent changes in the German legal landscape have opened the door for true-sale securitisation deals. The advantages of true-sale transactions, such as higher LTVs, will determine the significant expected growth in the German real estate debt securitisation market. – 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays examining issues surrounding Real Estate Investment Trusts, corporate governance, institutional investment, and corporate exit strategies. In the first essay we examine the factors that affect institutional investors 2 ̆ 7 decisions to hold REIT shares. The main question we seek to answer is whether the existence of beneficial governance mechanisms is important in determining which REITs attract institutional investment. We study the effect of board structure and CEO characteristics {{on the level of}} institutional investment in REITs after controlling for appropriate firm-specific elements. We employ a quasi-maximum likelihood estimation method, and further test our results using instrumental variables to control for the potential endogeneity of CEO compensation and REIT performance. ^ We provide evidence that the costs of restricting cash flow exceed the governance benefits realized through greater management control. We find institutional ownership is greater when boards of directors are busier and less tenured, and when the CEO has less stock ownership. ^ In the second essay, we examine the cohort of 200 public Equity REITs that exist in 1996 and measure changes in corporate status through 2006. More than half of the cohort group exit from the population during the eleven-year period of study. The purpose of our paper is to systematically examine the nature of these exits. We measure abnormal returns to shareholders around announcement of the exit, and conduct logistic regression analyses to test the likelihood of exit from the population, and the likelihood of exit by a particular strategy. ^ Our main findings are (a) smaller REITs with lower debt ratios, lower profit margins and traditional structure are more likely to exit, (b) returns are positive for exit announcements and are greatest when firms merge private or liquidate, (c) the most common <b>exit</b> <b>vehicle</b> is public-public merger, and (d) diversified REITs are less likely to exit by merger than specialized REITs, smaller REITs are more likely to exit by public-public merger or liquidation, and REITs with the UPREIT structure are more likely to exit by public-private merger. ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{model used}} in the U.

40|$|The {{operational}} performance {{of an existing}} or proposed roundabout can be assessed through capacity models. In order to provide improved capacity predictions for existing and proposed Georgia roundabouts, the 2010 HCM roundabout capacity equations need to be locally calibrated based on Georgia drivers. The {{purpose of this study}} is to collect field data necessary to calculate follow-up and critical headways at Georgia roundabouts in order to calibrate the 2010 HCM capacity equations to yield improved capacity predictions. The research team filmed 28 approaches at thirteen Georgia roundabouts for a total of 56. 5 hours. The video was processed manually using an in-house computer program. Based on analyst keystrokes during the video review the program would extract timestamps of events that are necessary for calculating follow-up and critical headway. The follow-up and critical headway values were calculated for two different data sets: 1) including <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> and 2) excluding <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The critical and follow-up headway for an analysis including <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> is 4. 192 seconds and 2. 788 seconds respectively. The critical and follow-up headway for an analysis excluding <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> is 4. 747 seconds and 3. 265 seconds respectively. This study found that including the <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> impacts the capacity. The capacity increases or decreases based on the percentage of conflicting <b>vehicles</b> that are <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In addition, this study’s calibrated model excluding <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> predicts higher capacity than the 2010 HCM model that GDOT recommends which also excludes <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles.</b> M.

40|$|Even though {{venture capital}} trade sale exits {{are the most}} common and {{successful}} <b>exit</b> <b>vehicle,</b> historically most academic attention has been given to IPO exits. This thesis takes the first steps towards opening the black box that is trade sale exits. The thesis is paper-based, and the main academic contributions belong to the four papers appended. This document opens with an introduction to the field of study as well as overall reflections in order to offer the reader a contextual background. Paper one is based on a literature review, while paper two through four are based on an inductive multiple-case study covering 19 venture capital trade sale exits from Norway and the U. S. Paper one conducts an extensive literature review of venture capital exits in general, leading up {{to the development of a}} model denoted &# 147;The Road to Venture Capital Exit&# 148;. This model identifies the variables that influence the exit process in the different phases, and describes how these variables influence the exit process. Paper two explores the relation between pre-planned exit strategies and value-adding, and suggests the existence of two different venture capitalist mindsets; the Tailor and the Architect. The Tailor uses exit possibilities as an addition to traditional deal evaluation criteria, has a pre-planned exit strategy, and adds value with exit in mind. The Architect does not use exit possibilities as an evaluation criteria, and adds value in a more general manner. Paper three examines the relationship between the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur during the trade sale exit process, finding that this relationship is characterized more by consensus and cooperation than by conflict and defection. Further, it is found that four factors influence the relationship during the exit process, and are determining for the conflict level. These factors are: pre-investment alignment, strategic hurdles and personal motives faced by the entrepreneur, the reputation and connectedness of the venture capitalist, and the probability for entrepreneurial recycling. Paper four explores the role of financial advisors in trade sale exits, by looking closer at why advisors are utilized, as well as by examining the factors determining the choice of a specific advisor. It is found that advisors are considered especially useful in bargaining situations, through playing the role of bad cops, and also by letting venture capitalists and entrepreneurs focus on their primary tasks. With regards to selection criteria, venture capitalists emphasize industry experience, prior relations and the size of the advisory firm. Finally, the findings are integrated in a framework explaining the role of financial advisors in venture capital trade sale exits. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{shed some light on}} the black box of trade sale of venture capital backed small medium sized {{technology}} companies. The theory reviewed is mainly from venture capital theory, taking a special look at what venture capital is and exit. To understand the empirical finding there is a short review on trust, game theory and negotiations. The research material consists of 10 in-depth interviews with venture capitalists, corporate venture capitalists, business angel and entrepreneurs. They have different roles, but they all have in common that they have worked with or in venture capital backed small medium sized technology companies, where trade sale has been or is the <b>exit</b> <b>vehicle.</b> All of the interviewees have extensive experience, and draw their experience from several cases. The companies they refer to are mainly within oil and gas, some within IT. The main subject in the interviews has been to understand what can influence exit; if there are any specific activities or occurrences that the interviewees regard as a prerequisite to a successful exit, or having a positive influence on exit. What is behind a successful exit is not defined, and hence regarded as a subjective matter. There {{is no doubt that the}} research material stress that a successful exit is related to the entire investment process, not only to the exit phase. To understand the key drivers for a successful trade sale exit of venture capital backed small-medium sized technology enterprises, it was therefore crucial to understand what is important when building the company and what is important to do or not to do when preparing the company for an exit. This is the basis for the authors’ two research questions; 1) what are the key components to achieve trade sale exit of venture capital backed small-medium sized technology companies?, and 2) what are the key methods to optimize trade sale exit of venture capital backed small-medium sized technology companies? Even though different roles have different views of what is important when building and preparing a company for an exit, the study showed that regardless of role, there are certain key drivers behind a successful exit and that these elements are very much related to each other. From the empirical findings there are a set of components necessary to achieve trade sale exit, these are; 1) competence, team and culture 2) networks, trust and collaboration and 3) strategic alignment with potential buyers. Furthermore, to optimize trade sale exit there are identified two methods which are 1) socializing the business and 2) playing the game. Furthermore, the study strongly indicates that these elements are related to each other, and should not be regarded independently. Rather building a company and preparing it for an exit should be perceived as a process, where these key drivers should be part of the process...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increased}} interest in building modern roundabouts in Georgia and in the United States because of the safety and operational benefits that can be realized from this type of intersection. With this interest comes the increasing {{need to be able}} to estimate the capacity that a roundabout can provide after it is built. In the early 2000 s, a National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) study was conducted that, among other tasks, developed single-lane and multi-lane roundabout capacity estimation equations. These equations, presented in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (HCM 2010), can be calibrated using locally determined values of follow-up headway and critical headway. This study was designed to calibrate the HCM 2010 roundabout capacity equation for single-lane roundabouts to driving conditions in Georgia. In order to develop estimates of the calibration parameters, video imagery was recorded for 13 approaches at six roundabouts in Georgia for approximately two hours during the peak period. A total of 29. 5 hours of video was recorded. Data from three of these roundabouts forms the basis of this thesis. The videos were processed by a Java program to collect time stamps that were subsequently used in Microsoft Excel to calculate the follow-up and critical headway values required for calibration. The values of critical headway and follow-up headway that were found from the video data are presented in the results as well as the single-lane capacity equations calibrated from the data. Two types of analysis were done, one that includes <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> and one that does not include <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles.</b> When <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> were excluded, the weighted average of follow-up and critical headway were found to be 3. 46 and 4. 17 seconds respectively and when <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> were included in the analysis the weighted averages of the follow-up and critical headway were found to be 2. 80 seconds and 3. 34 seconds respectively. It was found that <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> do have an impact on the operations at the roundabout in most cases, and including <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the analysis tends to increase the capacity predicted by the calibrated equations.

30|$|Further {{investigations}} for {{the estimation}} of the critical and follow-up headways were conducted by Zheng et al. [17]. Critical and follow-up headway data were extracted for four roundabouts. The estimation of the critical headways included the mean and the standard deviation, following the current state-of-practice maximum likelihood method [19]; estimation of the follow-up headways included the sample average and standard deviation. Other factors as the consideration of the adjacent <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles,</b> vehicle type and queue lengths were also investigated. The assumption of log-normal distribution for the critical headway was made as suggested by Troutbeck [24] and used in NCHRP Report 572 [61]. Critical and follow-up headways were estimated considering (or not considering) <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles.</b> For multi-lane roundabouts, engineering judgment was required to examine the different scheme of conflicts {{with one or two}} antagonist traffic streams faced by right- or left-turning vehicles from entries.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between the number of lane changes, the speed of the ramp lane, and the location upstream of the ramp split. Analyses indicate the number of lane changes exhibits a parabolic relationship with respect to the ramp lane speed, and the number of lane changes exhibits gamma-distributed relationship with respect to the distance upstream of the ramp. The macroscopic lane changing model presented is best characterized as the development of generalized lane-changing relationships, and provides a starting point from which more complex corridor-level models can be developed. This study also identifies an unusual car-following behavior exhibited by certain lane-changing drivers. When the target lane is moving slowly, some lane-changing drivers will slow down, causing a disruption in their initial lane. Regression analysis is used to estimate the speed upstream of the initial lane to indicate the disruption is responsible for the lateral propagation of congestion. The lane choice of <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> is also studied. Lane choice appears to be a function of origin/destination, and freeway speed. As speeds in the general purpose lanes decrease, <b>exiting</b> <b>vehicles</b> are more likely to wait longer to move into the exit ramp lanes, resulting in an increased lane changing density. 	Results from this study are expected to have the greatest impact on microscopic lane-change model validation. Additionally, results have implications for design and safety issues associated with freeway ramps. As data collection technologies improve and data becomes increasingly available, this research provides the basis for the further development of more elaborate lane-changing models. Ph. D...|$|R
