40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare farmed with free-ranging red deer with respect to levels and interactions of 18 selected elements. The study comprised liver samples of 43 freeranging animals collected from 6 hunting areas, and 52 farmed animals from 9 different herds in Norway. About half of the farmed animals had lower Cu contents than 4 ppm and suffered probably from Cu deficiency. The main structural differences between farmed and freeranging animals with liver Cu levels 4 - 40 ppm wm were by partial least square regression analyses related to the higher Al-, Fe- and Mo-concentrations and the lower Cu-concentrations in the farmed animals. This may indicate pronounced element imbalances in the <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> since they also in general contained significantly lower levels of trace elements compared to the free-ranging. Comparisons of Cu categories of <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> (5 ppm) with free-ranging deer revealed, however, that differences in essential element concentrations diminished with increasing Cu categories of <b>farmed</b> <b>deer.</b> Low Cu concentrations and high Fe concentrations in the <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> may have ensued from relatively high absorption of Mo and Al by the <b>farmed</b> <b>deer.</b> We suggest that the <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> are influenced by deleterious elements due to a higher rate of ingestion of soil particles than are the free-ranging deer...|$|E

40|$|Leptospirosis is a {{bacterial}} zoonotic disease of global importance. It {{is caused by}} infection with pathogenic Leptopsira species. Leptospirosis encompasses {{a wide spectrum of}} clinical or subclinical disease in both humans and animals. In New Zealand (NZ), leptospirosis is considered {{to be the most important}} occupational zoonosis. Livestock farming plays an important role as a major occupational risk factor for human leptospirosis and <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> is one of the contributing factors. Commercial farming of deer began in NZ in the early 1970 s. It remains the world’s largest and most advanced deer farming industry. Leptospirosis in <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> can cause illness and possibly sub-clinical production losses. <b>Farmed</b> <b>deer</b> also play an important role in the transmission of leptospirosis by shedding the organisms in their urine, putting both other animals and humans at risk. Leptospira serovars Hardjobovis and Pomona are the most commonly found serovars in this stock group. The first substantial case report of leptospirosis in <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> was in the 1980 s but it was not until 2006 that a substantial epidemiological study of this disease in <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> was reported. The purpose of this research was to improve and extend current knowledge on the epidemiology of leptospirosis on mixedspecies deer farms, to develop and validate a novel molecular diagnostic tool and to enhance understanding of control measures and their outcomes by means of vaccination. A pilot longitudinal seroprevalence survey of leptospirosis on mixed-species deer farms was conducted. Results from this study revealed that leptospiral infection averaged 70 % in all species on mixed-species farms in the lower North Island of NZ. Co-grazing with infected sheep and/or cattle was positively associated with deer herd serological status to both serovars Hardjobovis and Pomona which suggests the possibility of inter-species transmission. Results from this study justify further investigation of leptospirosis on mixedspecies farm at the national level. A collaborative study between Massey University and the WHO/FAO/OIE reference laboratory for leptospirosis in Brisbane to investigate for exotic serovars in <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> revealed seropositivity to Arborea which has never been found before in NZ. Attempts to isolate Arborea from kidney samples of <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> were unsuccessful and require further investigation. Real-time PCR assay was developed and validated against culture as the gold standard for use on deer kidney tissue and urine as a research and diagnostic tool for determining infection, carrier and shedding status of deer. This research revealed that the real-time PCR assay was highly sensitive (sensitivity: 85 % for kidney and 96. 7 % for urine) and specific (specificity: 99. 2 % for kidney and 100 % for urine). It is a useful tool for the rapid and cost-effective detection of pathogenic leptospires in clinical samples. It can also be used to quantify the concentration of leptospires from clinical samples and identify the likely infecting serovar in NZ when adjunct with a DNA sequencing technique. Vaccination control for leptospirosis has proven to be efficacious and likely to be costeffective. Present research has determined the effect of a commercial bivalent leptospiral vaccine (Leptavoid- 2, Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health Limited, NZ) on leptospiral shedding, growth and reproduction of <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> under NZ pastoral conditions. The study was designed to simulate an infection-free herd scenario followed by exposure to natural challenge. Results have shown the potential of vaccine to improve mean weight gain (up to 6. 5 kg) and weaning rate (average 6. 9 %) in infected herds and prevent urinary shedding after natural challenge with Hardjobovis. It also provides the first evidence of adverse subclinical effects on deer production by Hardjobovis alone. A pilot study to investigate the presence and localisation of pathogenic Leptospira in the uterus and foetus of female deer revealed evidence of a foetal infection using real-time PCR. This finding suggests a possible explanation for effects of leptospiral infection on NZ <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> reproduction. However, further study is required to justify this proposition. This research has contributed significantly to understanding of epidemiology of leptospirosis in NZ <b>farmed</b> <b>deer,</b> providing objective data to assist producers in decision-making on leptospirosis control. Furthermore, this study has made available a valuable diagnostic resource for future leptospirosis studies, and has provided direction for future research into leptospirosis on <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> and mixed-species farms...|$|E

40|$|Epidemiology, diagnostics, and {{management}} of tuberculosis in domestic cattle and deer in New Zealand {{in the face of}} a wildlife reservoir BM Buddle*§, GW de Lisle†, JFT Griffin ‡ and SA Hutchings# The control of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle and <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> inNew Zealand has been greatly influenced by the existence of a wildlife reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis infection, principally the Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). The reduction in possum numbers in areas with endemic M. bovis infection through vigorous vector control operations has been a major contributor to the marked reduction in the number of infected cattle and <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> herds in the past two decades. Management of TB in cattle and <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> in New Zealand has involved a combination of vector control, regionalisation of diagnostic testing of cattle and deer herds, abattoir surveillance and movement control from vector risk areas. Accurate diagnosis of infected cattle and deer has been a crucial component in the control programme. As the control programme has evolved, test requirements have changed and new tests have been introduced or test interpretations modified. Subspecific strain typing of M. bovis isolates has proved to be a valuable component in the epidemiological investigation of herd breakdowns to identify whether the source of infection was domestic livestock or wildlife. New initiatives will include the use of improved models for analysing diagnostic test data and characterising disease outbreaks leading to faster elimination of infection from herds. The introduction of the National Animal Identification Tracing programme will allow better risk profiling of individual herds and more reliable tracing of animal movements. TB in cattle and <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> in New Zealand can only be controlled by eliminating the disease in both domestic livestock and the wildlife reservoir...|$|E

The samples of venison were derived from javan rusa (Cervus timorensis russa), moluccan rusa (Cervus timorensis moluccensis), sambar (Cervus unicolor brookei), fallow (Dama dama) and imported red deer (Cervus elaphus). Moluccan rusa and red deer were grass-fed deer. Javan rusa, sambar and fallow deer were concentrate-fed deer. Cholesterol content in Longissimus Dorsi (LD) muscles of sambar, fallow and rusa deer were 75. 36, 76. 61 and 77. 58 mg/ 100 g of fresh venison, respectively.

Further studies are required on Salmonella spp. in farmed wild boar and T. gondii in farmed wild boar and <b>farmed</b> <b>deer.</b> If new information confirms a high risk to public health from meat from these species, setting targets at carcass level should be considered. Palpation and incision should be omitted, as it will not detect biological hazards considered to be {{a high priority for}} meat inspection while increasing the potential spread and cross-contamination of the carcasses with Salmonella.

As <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> and farmed wild boar can act as tuberculosis reservoirs, any reduction in the detection, due to changes in the post-mortem inspection procedures, will have consequences for the overall surveillance of tuberculosis. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible and based on the risk of occurrence, taking into account FCI, which should be expanded to reflect the specific environmental conditions of the farms where the animals are reared, and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated and include new hazards.

Deer sampled in this study included 1041 adult animals from 6 Spanish farms and 111 adult wild deer. We injected four sites of the neck with 0. 1 ml bovine purified protein derivative (PPD), 0. 1 ml avian PPD, 0. 1 ml negative control PBS and 0. 1 ml of Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA, containing 250 μg) as positive control, and measured the skin fold increase at time 72 h. Bovine PPD reactors were identified in 5 of 6 farms and among wild deer. Apparent prevalence among wild deer (18. 9 %) was not significantly higher than among <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> (14. 5 %). Avian PPD reactors were found among all 7 study populations, but apparent prevalence was lower among wild deer (< 1 %) than among <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> (12. 6 %; p < 0. 001). Deer management (farmed versus wild) was identified as a key factor affecting deer skin fold thickness increase in response both to mycobacterial (bPPD and aPPD) and non-mycobacterial antigens (PHA). The differences occurred in the same sense, regardless of some interactions; <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> showing higher values. The PHA skin fold increase was not affected by the PPD skin test results.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that even small numbers of lung and gastro-intestinal (GI) nematodes cause sub-clinical infections during autumn and can reduce voluntary feed intake (VFI) and liveweight gain (LWG) post-weaning in <b>farmed</b> <b>deer.</b> However, {{little is known about the}} effect of parasitism on growth of young <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> prior to weaning (summer and early autumn). At present, the control of deer parasites is largely by anthelmintic treatment. Alternatively, chicory sown as a pure sward has been shown to reduce parasitism and increase post-weaning growth of deer compared with perennial ryegrass-based pasture, although, neither forage plantain nor the inclusion of chicory in a pasture mix have yet been evaluated in this context. In addition, it has been suggested that to achieve a high pregnancy rate early in the mating season, deer calves should be weaned prior to mating to optimise nutrition and body condition of the hinds. At present there is no adequate evidence in the published literature to justify this. Two experiments were conducted in 2005 and 2006 respectively. The first experiment investigated the impact of early or late pre-rut weaning, with and without anthelmintic treatment, on parasitism and growth (LWG g/day) of deer calves during summer and early autumn. Weaning date effects on hind reproductive parameters were also investigated. The second experiment was a preliminary investigation to compare the effect of grazing permanent perennial ryegrass pasture (Lolium perenne) with chicory (Cichorium intybus) narrow-leaved plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and pasture mixes based on short-rotation tetraploid ryegrass (TSR-mix; nil endophyte) or long-rotation tetraploid ryegrass (TLR-mix; low endophyte), with both mixes sown with the same clover (white and red) and chicory, on post-weaning growth and endoparasitism of weaned farmed red deer calves in autumn. In 2005, seventy-six deer calves were randomly allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial design, involving sex, genotype, weaning date (February 17 or March 17), treatment with either topical moxidectin (0. 5 mg/kg) on January 14 and February 25 or no anthelmintic treatment. Liveweight gain, faecal gastrointestinal egg counts (FEC) and lungworm larval counts (FLC), haematological parameters and serum proteins concentrations (i. e., total protein, albumin and globulin) of calves were measured. Mixed-age adult hinds (64) were used to investigate the effect of weaning date on internal parasitism, conception date and pregnancy rate determined by ultrasound scanning. These hinds were not given anthelmintic treatment, but FLC and FEC were determined on January 12, February 17, March 17, March 31 and May 4. All deer rotationally grazed permanent perennial ryegrass-based pasture (Lolium perenne) together until weaning at which point calves were removed to separate but similar pasture. Calves weaned in March had a higher LWG to March 31 than those weaned in February (P< 0. 0001). Faecal larval count in treated calves was zero, but FEC remained similar to the untreated control calves, regardless of when they had been treated (average 136 epg, range 0 - 600 epg in mid February and average 92, range 0 - 350 epg at the end of March). Treated calves had higher serum albumin, and lower serum globulin concentrations than the untreated control group (albumin, 36. 2 ± 0. 3 vs 35. 2 ± 0. 3 g/L; P< 0. 001; globulin, 23. 9 ± 0. 4 vs 25. 5 ± 0. 4 g/L; P< 0. 005). In hinds, FLC averaged 5 lpg (range 0 – 122) and FEC averaged 26 (range 0 - 200) with no significant relationship between weaning date and either FLC or FEC. No effect of weaning date on conception rate or date was observed. This study showed that pre-rut weaning date, (although confounded by weaning process management) and sub-clinical parasitism during summer and early autumn may influence LWG in young <b>farmed</b> <b>deer.</b> The failure of moxidectin to reduce FEC to zero raises the question of the efficacy of this macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic against GI nematodes in <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> and/or emergence of <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> GI nematode resistance. Potential diagnostic parameters such as serum albumin concentration, which was reduced in untreated control deer, warrant further investigation for clinical diagnostic use in <b>farmed</b> <b>deer.</b> The study also highlighted the need for further research to demonstrate the advantages or disadvantages of pre-rut weaning on growth of deer calves and hind reproduction. The 2006 grazing experiment investigated the effect of pasture species grazed on post-weaning growth and endoparasitism of farmed red deer from 3 - 6 months of age. Ninety-five red deer calves were randomly allocated to five groups based on sex, LW, FEC and FLC. These calves rotationally grazed either a permanent pasture based on perennial ryegrass, chicory, narrow-leaved plantain, or one of two pasture mixes based on either a short-rotation tetraploid ryegrass (TSR-mix) or long-rotation tetraploid ryegrass (TLR-mix). Both mixes included the same white clover, red clover and chicory. All deer were initially treated with an anthelmintic (albendazole), with subsequent trigger treatment withheld until weight loss or clinical parasitism was observed. Anthelmintic trigger treatment (albendazole) was given on an individual animal basis. The anthelmintic trigger treatment and LWG data in this study suggest that plantain, TLR- and TSR-mixes and chicory may all have a role in aiding control of endoparasitism in young growing deer in autumn in deer production systems based on permanent perennial ryegrass-based pasture with low anthelmintic input. However, any potential effects of forage feeding value and anti-parasitic plant compounds of chicory, plantain and pasture-forage mixes on parasitism and growth could not be separated in this study. It is therefore acknowledged that these observations are preliminary and based on a design intended only to establish whether further replicated studies are warranted, particularly with plantain and pasture mixes. However, the study has shown that pasture species, either sown as a pure crop or in a pasture mix can influence LWG, resilience to internal parasitism and requirement for anthelmintic use in young <b>farmed</b> <b>deer.</b> Data from the first experiment (2005) has shown that pre-rut weaning date and sub-clinical parasitism during summer and early autumn can influence LWG in young <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> while the trigger treatment and LWG data from the second experiment (2006), suggest that plantain, TLR-and TSR-mixes and chicory may have a role in aiding control of internal parasitism in young deer in autumn. The outcome of the second experiment has application to deer production systems with low anthelmintic input. Serum protein and haematological parameters investigated in both studies demonstrated the need for further research to establish diagnostic markers for both sub-clinical and clinical internal parasitism in farmed young deer...|$|E

40|$|As a {{response}} to the need for improved and cost-efficient West Nile virus (WNV) and other flavivirus surveillance tools, we tested 887 juvenile free-living red deer, 742 free-living juvenile wild boar, and 327 <b>farmed</b> <b>deer,</b> to detect temporal variability in exposure to these viruses. Thirty of 742 wild boar samples (4 %; 95 % CI 2. 8, 5. 7) yielded a positive ELISA result. Antibody-positive individuals had been sampled between 2003 and 2011 in localities from central and southern Spain. No wild boar from the northern half of Spain (n= 120) tested positive. Regarding juvenile wild red deer, only two out of 887 samples yielded a positive ELISA result (0. 2 %; 95 % CI 0. 1, 0. 8). These two samples came from the same site and sampling year. The likelihood of detecting contact with WNV or cross-reacting flaviviruses was 18 times higher among juvenile wild boar than among juvenile red deer. ELISA positivity among <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> increased 10 -fold after local flavivirus outbreaks recorded in the summer and autumn of 2010. This survey demonstrated the potential usefulness of juvenile wild ungulates, particularly wild boar, as suitable flavivirus sentinels in southwestern Europe, and that systematic serum banking of samples from hunter-harvested wildlife or from individual farmed ungulates provides valuable material for retrospective epidemiological surveys and future disease monitoring.

40|$|Raising {{red deer}} in {{enclosures}} for meat production {{is a relatively}} new practice in Norway and is based on national stocks (Cervus elaphus atlanticus). Presently only 400 - 500 hinds are reared in enclosures by 25 enterprises. Interest, however, is increasing with expansion limited only by the supply of breeding animals. Recently some deer in enclosures have shown disease symptoms typical for enzootic ataxia, and some have died. Since the disease is believed to be caused by copper deficiency we analyzed for this element and elements known to interact with copper and indirectly may cause copper deficiency including molybdenum, zinc, sulphur and cadmium. Liver samples were collected from 60 enclosed deer representing 10 enterprises and compared with samples from 43 free-living animals. All liver samples were collected during the fall. Concentrations of copper in <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> (n= 52) averaged only 4. 0 ppm (wet weight). In a group (n= 8) given feed added copper sulphate the average was 21. 3 ppm. In free-living animals (n= 43) copper levels averaged 44. 2 ppm. We also analyzed for copper in serum samples from a selection of <b>farmed</b> <b>deer</b> (n= 23) and wild deer (n= 20). The concentrations were 13. 6 µmol/L and 21. 1 µmol/L respectively. Molybdenum concentrations in liver averaged about 0. 8 ppm in both farmed and free-living deer. Zinc levels were higher in wild animals (46. 1 ppm) than those from enclosures (26. 2 ppm). Cadmium concentrations were low in both groups while the sulphur concentrations exceeded 2000 ppm both in farmed and wild red deer. The biological significance of these findings and possible remedies are discussed...|$|E
