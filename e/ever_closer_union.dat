40|$|The <b>ever</b> <b>closing</b> <b>Union</b> of the EU has {{through the}} years {{facilitated}} an increased integration of its member states’ economies to a degree, where {{there is now a}} host of programs and tools for a system of economic governance regulated by the EU through the European Semester. This thesis examines the European Semester in a Danish context {{in order to determine the}} EU’s success in shaping the socioeconomic agenda in Denmark, by utilizing the tools of coordination made available in the Semester. Since interest organizations plays a vital part in the legislative procedure in Denmark, these external actors are included in the assessment in order to discover their role in the process of the European Semester, and whether or not the process can be seen as successful in terms of legitimacy and effectiveness. The theory of New Institutionalism is used to systematically uncover and categorize actor’s preferences and the institution of the European semester under the framework of Europeanization. In order to examine the actor preferences two types of New Institutionalism are use; Rational Choice Institutionalism and Sociological Institutionalism. It is concluded that the EU is partially successful in shaping the socioeconomic agenda in Denmark, as the Semester informally provides access points and a norm of compliance, but formally lacks coercion...|$|R
40|$|Even in {{the days}} of an <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> European <b>union,</b> Europe {{contains}} no less than four different legal cultures with respect to real estate conveyances: the Latin-German notary system, the deregulated Dutch notary system, the lawyer/solicitor system, and the Scandinavian licensed real estate broker system. The latter is of particular interest in that Scandinavian brokers play a far larger role in real estate transactions than their European counterparts. This paper examines and compares the Swedish real estate broker and the Latin notary. The Swedish broker is required by law to act as an impartial intermediary, to provide counseling to both parties, and to assist in drawing up all contracts and other documents necessary for the transaction at hand. To that end, the broker must be active and observant of the particular needs of the parties to the present transaction, always striving to enable them to reach equitable and practical agreements so as to prevent future disputes. In other words, the broker is required to tailor the transaction to fit the needs of the buyer and seller. The Latin notary profession prevails in large parts of the world, particularly the Latin-German parts of continental Europe, and Latin America. While there are divergences in the notaria...|$|R

40|$|Initially {{off to a}} slow start, European Union (EU) {{consular}} crisis management cooperation eventually developed as a response to exogenous factors. Given that guaranteeing the safety of one’s citizens is seen as one of the core responsibilities of the nation state, however, the EU’s Member States still seem reluctant to transfer this responsibility to the European level and the EU institutions. At times equated with propaganda, both the terminology and practice surrounding public diplomacy has received increased attention recently. Though not always labelled as such, public diplomacy efforts have gradually been stepped up by national foreign ministries and the EU institutions. Against the backdrop of this renaissance for consular affairs and public diplomacy, the current study examines EU action in the field of {{consular crisis}} management cooperation as a means of EU public diplomacy, potentially affecting the alleged (internal) lack of support for the project of an <b>ever</b> <b>closed</b> <b>Union</b> among the EU citizens, as well as serving the EU’s public diplomacy purposes vis-à-vis foreign audiences. On the basis of legal provisions, budget allocations and proven action thus far in the field of public diplomacy efforts related to EU consular crisis management cooperation, a number of conclusions are suggested: According to existing legal provisions, there is considerable scope for EU efforts in this field. Though it could potentially later be challenged by Member States and/or other EU institutions, the so-called institutional prerogative – which is often used as the legal basis for budgetary commitments in the field of information and communications by the European Commission – could be applied also to EU public diplomacy efforts in this area, i. e. (increasingly) funded through the Community budget. Though the enabling legal conditions are in place, and a number of budget lines exist {{that could be used to}} this end, to date a very limited number of initiatives have been realised. Looking at existing data regarding public opinion and EU consular cooperation, it seems that EU citizens (though to a varying degree, depending on the EU Member State and other demographical variations) would welcome an increased role for the EU in the area. Regarding public diplomacy, recent developments cannot be confined to the EU alone, but tend to be part of a broader trend which can be labelled the “societization” of traditional diplomacy, characterised by closer links between diplomacy and society. In terms of the limits of EU consular crisis management cooperation as a means of EU public diplomacy, constraints include the issue of responsibility, the distribution of credit and blame, national sensitivities, and differences in Member States’ resources and representation. Finally, arguing that the potential for European efforts in the field of consular crisis management as a tool of effective EU public diplomacy (both within the Union and outside) is great, it is surprising that not more attention is given to the area – especially in light of the Commission’s discourse on delivering tangible benefits to the EU’s citizens. To move from action as a mere response to exogenous factors to a situation where it is part of an EU policy of deliberate public diplomacy, the Union still has a long way to go...|$|R

40|$|Proponents of the European project often portray further {{enlargement}} of the European Union as a complement {{to the process of}} building an <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>union.</b> The eurozone crisis, however, has highlighted the risks associated with pursuing deeper integration in a diverse union and reignited the debate on differentiated integration. This contribution examines how public attitudes towards the processes of deepening and broadening are related and asks whether European citizens see them as complementary or conflicting. Using multilevel analysis of Eurobarometer data, the contribution examines the factors - individual and contextual - that shape attitudes towards enlargement and deeper political integration across the 27 member states. The findings suggest that the 'winners' of integration - high-skilled individuals in core eurozone countries - are most likely to support deepening, but oppose further enlargement out of fear that an ever wider union might be costly...|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. European Union {{has been}} the {{theoretical}} goal of the Europcan Community (EC) since its conception. For many, the intention was that it remained a theoretical goal to be dreamed of but never achieved. The Treaty of Rome, signed in 1957, called for an "ever closer union among the peoples of Europe", yet the first two decades after its signing saw {{little in the way}} of progress towards union. Indeed General de Gaulle's opposition to majority voting in the Council and ringing endorsement of a 'Europe des parties' in 1966 was a serious reversion to intergovernmentalism. Depressed by years of slide and stagnation Europe's leaders attempted in the early ' 80 s to kick-start the Community into a new life. The Stuttgart Declaration, signed by the Heads of Governments at their summit there in June 1983, resolved to "create a United Europe" and confirmed "their commitment to <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>union</b> amongst the peoples and Member States of the European Community"...|$|E

It is based on analyses of some of the recent opinions polls. The discussion of prevailing in Polish society attitudes to the EU is placed in historical context. Issues relevant to democratization are related to some aspects of accession and post-accession processes.
