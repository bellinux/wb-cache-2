40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Recently, <b>informal</b> venture capital <b>investors</b> have been recognised as {{an important source of}} financing small & medium sized enterprises(SMEs). Unfortunately, very little research (if any) has been devoted to understanding how these investors fund particular investments in developing countries. This research study conducts the first-ever, detailed investigation in Saudi Arabia of the <b>informal</b> <b>investor's</b> characteristics, and decision-making behaviour across the full investment process. A theoretical framework, based on the asymmetric information that characterises this market, was used. Five hypotheses were developed to see how <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> behave to reduce the inefficiencies and risks associated with the asymmetric information problem. Data from 156 Saudi <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> were compiled. To analyze the data, three statistical methods, Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis and Two-Way ANOVA, were applied. A descriptive picture of the profile and the investment activities of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> is presented in Chapter Seven. Research hypotheses related to investors' decision-making were then tested in Chapter Eight. First, the study shows that <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> in Saudi Arabia depend on personal searches for investment opportunities. This is clearly supports the view that the flow of information between entrepreneurs and <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> is inefficient. Secondly, in order to select a high quality entrepreneur and venture, investors use specific criteria though clearly the entrepreneur's reputation is the most important criterion. Third, <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> use staging of finance and involvement in the venture to have access to information and gain better control over the venture. Fourth, <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> apply the above methods to reduce the risks of the agency problem. However, <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> in Saudi Arabia prefer to monitor the behaviour of entrepreneurs through outcome-based incentives with moderate use of involvement and behaviour monitoring. In concluding the thesis, recommendations and the possible implications of these findings are discussed. Finally, future research is suggested that may improve the understanding of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> but which {{is beyond the scope of}} this thesis or which depends on its findings...|$|R
40|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>investors</b> {{have proved}} to be highly {{valuable}} for the growth of the firms in which they have invested. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} what motivates potential <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> to make their initial investment as well as how already active investors develop their entrepreneurial careers. Such an understanding may prove helpful in directing efforts to locate and attract potential and existing <b>informal</b> <b>investors.</b> This paper investigates the entrepreneurial career of four <b>informal</b> <b>investors.</b> Based on the personal stories of these individuals, we explore their career patterns and present the central concepts of the different career phases they have progressed through. The results indicate that <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> have experienced three overall career phases: (1) the corporate career phase; (2) the entrepreneurial learning phase; and (3) the integrated investment career phase. Each career phase provides <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> with possibilities for learning and developing valuable competencies in order to advance in their entrepreneurial career. During the corporate career phase, the investors learn a 'managerial logic' and create a platform on which they can build up their managerial competence, establish a network, and legitimize their reputation. In the following entrepreneurial learning phase, the investors make use of this platform in varying entrepreneurial projects, mainly as consultants, which in turn provides them with the possibilities for learning the 'logic' behind entrepreneurial processes. During the integrated investment career phase, <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> extend the platform by making use of their managerial and entrepreneurial competence in the firms in which they invest, and thus act as both entrepreneurs and <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> in the firms in which they are involved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>investors</b> {{have been}} {{highlighted}} as important stakeholders for potential high-growth ventures. Extant empirical research provides {{evidence that they}} contribute not only with money but also bring added value in terms of providing their skills and experience to support the continued development and growth of the ventures {{in which they have}} invested. However, despite the reported benefits of the value added provided by <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> there are very few studies that explicitly address the issue of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> and value added. The present paper seeks to meet this shortcoming by presenting a review of state-of-the-art literature and research on informal venture capital and value added.

Drawing on resource-based, staged-growth and international new venture theory, a series of study propositions are advanced. Logistic regression is then used to examine the profile of exporters and nonexporters. While export propensity was highest among manufactures, export intensity was highest among service-based firms. Firm owners with more than 5 years of firm ownership experience, <b>informal</b> <b>investor</b> status, Canadian residency and a foreign language were associated with increased likelihood of export. Manufacturers, professional service firms, larger SMEs and innovative firms were also most likely to export.

40|$|We {{estimate}} a two-equation {{model to}} jointly {{determine the number}} of informal investors and {{the amount of money that}} they invest over the last 3 years. Our model uses data on 126, 189 individuals in 21 highly developed countries in the period 2002 - 2006. We delve deeper into the hypothesis of Burke et al (2010) that ‘the demand for informal venture finance tends to generate its own supply’. To our knowledge, we undertake the first research to move analysis of the supply of informal venture finance investment beyond estimating the propensity for a person to become an <b>informal</b> <b>investor</b> and onto the core concern which is the total volume of venture finance. We find that a one per cent increase in entrepreneurial activity increases the number of informal investors by 1. 702 per cent. However, the average invested amount declines by 0. 827 per cent leading to a net positive total increase by 0. 861 per cent. This result indicates that, to a considerable extent, demand for informal investment creates its own supply. This effect is stronger for males than females. We also find that the level of venture capital investment has a net positive effect on the level of informal investment and that this effect is stronger for females than males. ...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{research}} conducted into Portuguese business angels – a term referring to informal investors – who are private wealthy individuals willing to invest {{a part of their}} own wealth in new business ventures for a profit. The business angel market is partially opaque in that many informal investors are not part of any organisation, club, or network and, therefore, they are difficult to identify (Mason and Harrison 2010; Mason and Harrison 2011). Many, however, are formally organised in clubs, associations, or networks (Amis and Stevenson 2001; Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). Starting from the visible part of the market—the one linked by networks—and subsequent to the literature review, two relevant topics were identified: business angel profiles and their investment profiles. These two topics were crucial to the design of the questionnaires. Analysis of the questionnaire responses – which included the recipients of two of the most representative <b>informal</b> <b>investor</b> clubs in Portugal – helped to identify the profile of Portuguese business angels and their investments.

40|$|This {{research}} broadly {{falls in}} the area of entrepreneurial finance and focuses on <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> in New Zealand. Of particular interest is the suitability of models or taxonomies used for the categorisation of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> in NZ using GEM and MED data. Since Wetzel's (1996) seminal study of <b>informal</b> <b>investors,</b> researchers have struggled to define and categorise <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> into meaningful groups. Many {{attempts have been made to}} develop a robust taxonomy that meaningfully categorises <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> in a way which can be replicated cross-nationally. To date, no taxonomy achieves this goal. This study clarifies the issues and discrepancies, and then proposes an improved taxonomy for the categorisation of <b>informal</b> <b>investors.</b> The researcher uses complementary data gathered from 2002 - 2004 by the Global Entrepreneurial Monitor (GEM) New Zealand project and by the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development (MED) in 2003. It is believed that these New Zealand-based improvements will be generalisable to other countries and circumstances. The role of informal venture capital has become the focus of considerable international research in recent years. Wetzel's (1983) seminal paper was followed inter alia by Wetzel (1986), Riding (1993), Harrison and Mason (1992), Coveney and Moore (1998), Landstroem (1993), Lumme (1998), Hindle and Wenban (1999), Mason and Harrison (2000), Linde (2000). The reason for such attention is related to the crucial role that informal venture capital plays in the supply of funds to SME's (small to medium sized enterprises) in the early stages of firm development. This funding, it is believed, contributes significantly to the firm's performance and consequently to growth in the overall economy (Sorheim and Landstroem, 2001). There is considerable debate regarding what variables or factors that should be analysed as the basis for this categorisation or segmentation of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> (Sorheim et al., 2001, p. 5). Without an internationally accepted method for categorisation, there is a degree of ambiguity and confusion amongst international experts (Hindle, 1999, p. 5), (Sorheim, 2000, p. 353). Most of this research has been conducted outside New Zealand and is almost exclusively focused on a particular type of investor called the 'business angel', or 'angel' for short. This study takes a different tack in shedding light on one sub-set category of angels, namely <b>informal</b> <b>investors,</b> which has been identified by the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) as useful (Infometrics Ltd, 2004, p. 26). New Zealand research has not extensively examined the demographic and behavioural characteristics of <b>informal</b> <b>investors.</b> The most comprehensive research in NZ has come from the Global Entrepreneurial Monitor 2003 report (Frederick, 2003) and a 2004 report released by the MED (Infometrics Ltd, 2004, p. 26). The GEM Report's focus is on overall entrepreneurial behaviour and does not attempt to differentiate investment patterns amongst categories of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> in NZ. The report, however, discusses the need and importance for further study {{in the area of}} informal investment and in particular, the characteristics of groups of investors other than business angels (Frederick, 2003, p. 3). The Infometrics report, though far more detailed and perhaps the most in-depth report into informal investment in NZ, similarly does not focus on the investment patterns of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> as a whole but rather only on those that match the international description of an angel investor. The Infometrics report also highlights the need for further categorisation of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> in NZ (Infometrics, 2004, p. 26). In conclusion, there is an identified gap in the literature regarding the investment behaviour of the various types of investors in NZ and there is little consensus amongst authors regarding a framework for the categorisation of <b>informal</b> <b>investors...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study explores {{individual}} and country-level environmental drivers of informal "seed" investment. We examine {{four types of}} <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> based on business ownership experience (or no such experience) and close family relationship with investee (or no such relationship) : "classic love money", "outsider", "kin owner" and "classic business angel" investors. At the environmental level, {{we are interested in}} the role of economic development, income tax policies, start-up costs, pro-enterprise government programmes, availability of debt financing, entrepreneurship education and culture. Using Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data from telephone interviews with 257, 793 individuals in 31 countries, including 5, 960 <b>informal</b> <b>investors,</b> we report drivers for the four types of seed investment. Descriptive statistics are consistent with prior research: <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> are likely to be older males who work full-time, earn high incomes, perceive start-up opportunities in the environment, and believe that they have the skills to start their own businesses. At the environmental level, we find that countries with higher percentages of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> are significantly likely to have higher levels of economic development, higher business start-up costs, higher levels of entrepreneurship education, lower income taxes and lower power distance. Other environmental effects on the four populations of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> are reported and discussed, as well as implications for practice, policy and future research...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} with this compound thesis, focusing on informal investors as financiers of entrepreneurial ventures, {{can be summarized}} in the following way: - To reveal the existence of, and describe the characteristics, investment activities, and preferences of Norwegian informal investors. - To refine the <b>informal</b> <b>investor</b> concept by developing a robust categorization of Norwegian informal investors. - To uncover how relational aspects influence the investment process of experienced informal investors. The core of the present thesis consists of four academic papers, employing data from two separate empirical studies. Paper 1, “The informal venture capital market in Norway – investor characteristics, behaviour and investment preferences”, is {{to a large extent}} a replication of previous studies in other geographical contexts. This paper suggests that Norwegian informal investors are quite similar to investors in the UK and Sweden, but there are differences, most notably the fact that Norwegian informal investors to a lesser degree are actively involved in their portfolio firms. Paper 2, “Informal investors – a categorization, with policy implications”, provides a categorization that is more robust, and hopefully more useful than categorizations in previous research; it has revealed the assumed heterogeneity among informal investors with four basic categories of investors: i) “Lotto Investors”, ii) “Traders”, iii) “Analytical Investors”, and iv) “Business Angels”. This categorization refines the <b>informal</b> <b>investor</b> concept and enhances the understanding of different categories of investors. This insight should then be used when introducing private and public means in order to stimulate the informal venture capital market. Paper 3, “The pre-investment behaviour of business angels – a social capital approach”, addresses why and how experienced informal investors can deal with the fragmented market place per se. As a result of this study I propose that very experienced investors find it less difficult to identify and evaluate investment proposals. This finding relates to the relational nature of the market, as it is the previous regional or industry specific track record that defines how informal investors handle the fragmented marketplace. Paper 4, “Business angels as facilitators for further finance – an exploratory study”, deals with how these investors can add value to their portfolio firm by acting as facilitators for further finance. The empirical findings from this study indicate that experienced informal investors play a key role as facilitators for further finance; usually not as we would expect, by involving venture capital firms, but more often by facilitating the involvement of other informal investors, strategic partners, and banks. Paper 3 and 4 employ theoretical insight from social capital theory, adapted in order to study the informal investors’ investment processes. In paper 3, I argue that an integrative social capital approach (including both a bridging and a bonding view of social capital) is very useful in order to explain how informal investors actually deal with the fragmented marketplace. Paper 4 also employs central elements from social capital theory, but to a larger extent it employs a bridging view of social capital when studying how informal investors can act as facilitators for further finance. Overall, insights from social capital theory seem to be relevant in order to uncover the social/relational aspects of informal investors investment process. dr. polit. dr. polit...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} about <b>informal</b> <b>investors,</b> persons who individually invest {{in new and}} expanding entrepreneurial endeavors, has grown considerably over the past decade.

By combining the case-dependent descriptive work with randomly sampled empiricism, a richer and more rigorous body of work will result, thus allowing greater contributions to theory and ultimately practice.

The study compares the characteristics of firms that have obtained VC funding with those of firms that have not. Furthermore, it pays attention to the activities and non-financial value-added by different types of VC organization : <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> (business angels), public sector VCs, and private sector VCs. The study data was collected through a survey and interviews {{at the end of}} 2005 with the total population of small and medium-sized biotech companies established in Finland since 1986 - 85 companies, 95 % of which participated in the study. VC investors indeed provided both financial and non-financial value-added to their investee firms. All three VC types, <b>informal</b> <b>investors,</b> public sector VCs, and private sector VCs, had somewhat different investment profiles in terms of firm type and age, and therefore, we may conclude that they are not alternatives to, but complement each other. Central findings of the study included an observation that all three VC types were fairly active in their activities vis-à-vis their investee firms. Nevertheless, they differed in terms of the overall perceived value-added as well as their activity profiles. <b>Informal</b> <b>investors</b> were found to have the highest overall value-added and kept closest contacts with their investee firms. It is, however, to be noted that <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> invested in the youngest firms and therefore their advice and support was probably most needed.

40|$|This study explores gender {{differences}} in entrepreneurship and informal investment in Ireland, a country {{with one of the}} lowest rates of female entrepreneurship in the developed world. Females in Ireland are less likely than males to be engaged in either the demand for (as entrepreneurs), or the supply of (as <b>informal</b> <b>investors),</b> entrepreneurial finance. Using Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data from a telephone survey of nearly 6 000 individuals, we present a comparative analysis of 73 female and 172 male nascent entrepreneurs, and 40 female and 91 male <b>informal</b> <b>investors.</b> We find no differences in the planned absolute financial capitalization of new ventures of female and male nascent entrepreneurs or in the investments made by female and male <b>informal</b> <b>investors.</b> We compare the full sample (from which we identified the nascent entrepreneurs) and find that females, when compared to males, are less likely to report perceiving opportunities, less likely to perceive they have the skills and knowledge required to start a business, and are less likely to know a recent entrepreneur. We argue that this might suggest that there may be less demand for start-up capital from females. We conclude by suggesting that policies that focus narrowly on the provision of finance to female entrepreneurs may have limited impact on the levels of female entrepreneurial activity...|$|R

The analysis carried out during this work allows one to confirm that, in process of data collection on the number of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> and business angels and its processing, a distortion of data describing the number of business angels takes place in some cases. The problem is that, even if the procedure is correct but the inquiry-making quality is poor, a significant distortion of data is possible.

This paper advanced a multilevel model on how institutional factors moderate the decision of <b>informal</b> <b>investors.</b> It is postulated that formal institutional factors (rule of law, regulation quality) and informal ones (social trust, institutional uncertainty tolerance) can enhance information flow, collaboration, and sanctioning mechanisms in a society; as a result, they moderate the importance of decision factors of <b>informal</b> <b>investors.</b> Multilevel modeling on data from 27 countries (over 90, 000 people) shows that the institutional factors heighten the positive relationship between individual's having start-up skills and informal investment, but surprisingly dampen that between seeing opportunity in new business and informal investment. These moderating effects are robust even after wealth, cultural values, and other factors are controlled. This study contributes to the research interaction of entrepreneurship and institutional theory. It also sheds light on the differential effects of improved institutions on informal investment.

We compared these data on informal investment to data on venture capital obtained from national sources. We are thus able to compare New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s performance to cross-national measures. We also surveyed 20 key informants/experts on questions on financing. In New Zealand, venture capital accounts for only 0. 80 /o of total investment in new and growing start-ups. Yet New Zealand is world-ranked in terms of informal investment. In New Zealand, informal investment activity is 3. 5 olo of the national GDP amount. New Zealand is also a world leader in the prevalence of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> (percentage in the adult population). Seventy-three percent of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> put their money into a relative 2 ̆ 7 s or a friend 2 ̆ 7 s business. Fifty-eight Percent of New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> are female, quite the reverse of the world pattern. When we compare Australia and New Zealandlo the rest of the GEM world, Australia ranks favourably with the GEM globat measures in terms of venture capital as a percentage of GDp, while New Zealand does poorly. Australia also does about 40 olo better than New Zealand in terms of the amount of VC invested in individual companies. But New Zealand is clearly higher in the measures of informal investment. We conclude with implications for entrepreneurs, policy makers, educators, researchers, and journalists. In a nutshell, they should pay more attention to the critical role of the four F 2 ̆ 7 s - family friends, founders, and "foolish" investors - in start-up ventures. Informal investment is a critical component of New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s entrepreneurial process and thus to its economic growth. Perhaps fifty superstars with extraordinary opportunities will receive financing from the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund to launch their businesses. Meanwhile, the vast majority of firms rely on the 4 Fs - friends, family founders, and "foolish" lnvestors. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the validity of the assumption that the funds provided by <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> to new and growing businesses only come from their own savings. The analysis in the paper is descriptive and based on empirical data from the GEM adult population survey in Iceland carried out in May 2003. The results show that the assumption is not valid. Dept is frequently used and more out of necessity and without a clear understanding of the investment opportunity rather than as a mean for sizing opportunities. These findings should be taken into account when constructing policies for stimulating informal investments...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} {{informal}} investment {{have focused on}} individual characteristics and behaviour. Behavioural features are important drivers {{of the decision to}} invest in others' businesses, and the heterogeneity of <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> in terms of age, education, income, and working status has also been noted. While the decision to invest in another person's business is an individual behaviour, it is embedded in the larger environmental context. However, to date, there has been a lack of investigation into how different environmental factors in the form of economic, political, educational, or societal attributes affect the level of informal investment decision. The main reason is limited data sets. The GEM adult population survey of nearly 300, 000 individuals in 29 countries enables an investigation the significance of both the individual and environmental factors driving informal investment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the engineer who is undertaking distributed generation projects {{to a wide}} range of financing options. Distributed generation systems (such as internal combustion engines, small gas turbines, fuel cells and photovoltaics) all require an initial investment, which is recovered over time through revenues or savings. An understanding of the cost of capital and financing structures helps the engineer develop realistic expectations and not be offended by the common requirements of financing organizations. This paper discusses several mechanisms for financing distributed generation projects: appropriations; debt (commercial bank loan); mortgage; home equity loan; limited partnership; vendor financing; general obligation bond; revenue bond; lease; Energy Savings Performance Contract; utility programs; chauffage (end-use purchase); and grants. The paper also discusses financial strategies for businesses focusing on distributed generation: venture capital; <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> (''business angels''); bank and debt financing; and the stock market...|$|R
40|$|While it {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> {{play a vital role}} in the development of new businesses, extent research on the nature of informal investment activity has focussed on large economies. There is little research about informal investment in small economies, including Ireland. This paper uses data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor to outline the extent and nature of informal venture capital activity in Ireland and to provide an estimate of the size of the informal venture capital market in Ireland. Results suggest that Family, Friends and Colleagues provided at least € 195 million to new businesses in 2011, and Business Angels invested € 80 million. We find that for every € 1 of formal venture capital funding, there is approximately € 5 of informal capital funds. We conclude by highlighting implications for policy and practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} factors driving {{informal}} investment in Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia. Using Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data, {{we find that}} the low rates of informal investment activity and the small amounts of investments in these countries are driven by entrepreneurial behaviors consistent with limited market economy experience. We extend prior studies by investigating the role of business ownership, and identify significant differences between individuals with and without business ownership experience in terms of having start-up skills, knowing an entrepreneur and fearing failure. Cluster analysis identifies seven distinct groups of <b>informal</b> <b>investors,</b> and reveals the heterogeneity in terms of investors’ age, gender, level of education, amount of investment, start-up skills, ownership status, income, opportunity perception and country of residence.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the prevalence and {{the determinants of}} informal entrepreneurial investment activity (i. e. the 3 FFFs –friends, fools and family– and business angels), using a data set of more than 175, 000 individuals – including some 4000 <b>informal</b> <b>investors</b> – in {{a large number of}} highly developed countries over the period 2002 - 2004. We distinguish between micro-level and macro-level determinants. The results uncover a positive virtuous circle where the demand for business angel finance tends to generate its own supply as a result of micro and macro factors. Our results also suggest that higher levels of entrepreneurial activity at the country level increase the probability that venture capital and business angel finance work in tandem with one another as complements rather than substitutes. Overall, the results uncover some important new relationships that perhaps provide some good news that market forces to some extent appear to naturally ameliorate equity gaps faced by entrepreneurs. ...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{widespread}} concern in both the UK and in the European Union that technology-based firms encounter difficulties in raising venture capital at their start-up and early growth stages. This, in turn, reflects the perception amongst investors that investments in technology-based firms involve greater uncertainty (in terms of market and technology) and hence higher risks. This paper explores this contention {{by means of an}} examination of the performance of investments made by business angels (<b>informal</b> <b>investors)</b> in technology and non-technology firms. Based on the analysis of deal-specific information, the authors demonstrate that the overall returns profiles of the two types of investments are not significantly different. This may be because business angels are better able than venture capital fund executives to manage the risks involved in investing in technology-based firms on account of their industrial and entrepreneurial backgrounds. Alternatively, it may reflect the fact that the risks involved in investing in technology-based firms have been overstated...|$|R
