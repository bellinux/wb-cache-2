5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone <b>gripper</b> fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E
5|$|The former England home strip {{was white}} with {{a strip of}} red around the neck, and the away strip was black (causing much {{controversy}} due to the famous All-Black kit of New Zealand), both kits had a ground breaking new technology {{in the form of}} a <b>gripper</b> print. A special strip was worn during the match versus Wales in the 2010 Six Nations Championship which replicated that worn in 1910 to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of Twickenham.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gripper</b> {{was born}} on 7 July 1938, in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, which is now the city of Harare in Zimbabwe. <b>Gripper</b> worked as a farmer, before turning his {{attention}} towards cricket. He has one son, Trevor <b>Gripper,</b> who has played test and ODI cricket for Zimbabwe.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, Iron Man Magazine advertised a {{new line}} of <b>grippers</b> called the [...] "Super Heavy Iron Man Grip Developer." [...] These <b>grippers</b> had steel handles and thick springs and an “arguably {{somewhat}} primitive” design, but what distinguished them from torsion-spring <b>grippers</b> of the past was how difficult the Iron Man <b>grippers</b> were to close. The Iron Man ad billed the <b>grippers</b> as the [...] "world’s strongest <b>grippers</b> of this type." ...|$|R
50|$|Iron Man Magazine {{had stopped}} {{advertising}} its <b>grippers</b> in 1977 {{due to lack}} of sales, but the <b>grippers</b> had some followers, one of whom was IronMind founder Randall J. Strossen. In 1990, Strossen contacted Warren Tetting, who had made the Iron Man <b>Grippers,</b> and asked if he would be interested in making <b>grippers</b> for IronMind. The design of the original Iron Man <b>Grippers</b> varied in such features as the diameter of their handles, whether or not the handles were knurled, and whether the <b>grippers</b> had keepers on the springs.|$|R
5000|$|... (* These <b>grippers</b> are {{designed}} to help bridge the gap between the benchmark-level <b>grippers,</b> and are rated halfway between the No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 CoC <b>Grippers,</b> respectively; thus, these are their interpolated poundage ratings.) ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>gripper</b> rails are {{not fitted}} {{in the top}} and bottom stations, around Llanberis yard, on any pointwork, nor on the less steep lengths of railway just out of Llanberis and near Waterfall. At the {{beginning}} of the sections of <b>gripper</b> rail, the ends are staggered and chamfered to help guide the <b>gripper</b> into place.|$|E
25|$|The second {{recommendation}} {{was that}} a <b>gripper</b> system be installed (see <b>Gripper</b> rail). This required extra rails {{to be added to}} the rack rail and a mechanism to be fitted to the locomotives and carriages.|$|E
25|$|If {{a broken}} rack bar lifts under a locomotive, it can strike the <b>gripper</b> and jam under the train. In such an incident, the <b>gripper</b> {{has to be}} cut away in order to rescue the train.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 IronMind {{released}} the Captains of Crush <b>Grippers,</b> which pioneered {{the use of}} knurled, aircraft-grade aluminum handles, which made the <b>grippers</b> lighter and provided a more secure grip. Over the years, IronMind has advanced the precision, durability, and appearance of the <b>grippers,</b> but their basic design has remained consistent since 1995, with milestones including the introduction of its proprietary GR8 springs in CoC <b>Grippers</b> in 2005.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, Iron Man {{magazine}} {{introduced the}} “Iron Man Super Heavy Grip Developer,” and unlike mass market <b>grippers,</b> these <b>grippers</b> had steel handles, thick springs and were {{very difficult to}} close. The popularity of these <b>grippers</b> was limited and they were discontinued in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|Captains of Crush <b>Grippers</b> (commonly nicknamed [...] "CoC") are a {{brand of}} torsion-spring <b>grippers</b> (a torsion spring fitted with two handles) designed, {{manufactured}} and sold by IronMind Enterprises, Inc., based in Nevada City, California. They are the official <b>grippers</b> of the Arnold Sports Festival, the GNC Grip Gauntlet, United States Arm Wrestling and the World’s Strongest Man contest.|$|R
25|$|<b>Gripper</b> {{has also}} been accused by some of being {{involved}} in the players strike that crippled the country's national team during the Zimbabwe Cricket Crisis. <b>Gripper</b> was approached by ZCU chairman Ozias Bvute in an attempt to negotiate a compromise deal with the rebel players.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gripper</b> {{made his}} Test match debut in October 1999 against Australia at Harare; the selectors' {{decision}} was somewhat surprising since {{at the time}} <b>Gripper</b> had still not recorded a first-class century. He made 60 in the second innings. His maiden Test hundred came against Bangladesh in 2001, as Zimbabwe piled up 542/7 declared.|$|E

40|$|A kinetostatic {{model and}} a {{dynamics}} {{model of a}} parallel manipulator (PM) with three <b>grippers</b> are established and analyzed {{in the light of}} its application. First, the coordinative kinematics of this manipulator and three <b>grippers</b> are analyzed. Second, the kinetostatic formulae are derived for transforming the coordinative kinematics and forces applied on the <b>grippers</b> into the workloads applied on the moving platform and the active/constrained forces and torques applied onto active legs. Third, the dynamics formulae are derived for solving dynamic active wrench of <b>grippers</b> and PM by considering inertial mass of the <b>grippers,</b> legs and platform. Finally, a numerical example is given for illustrating application of kinetostatic model and dynamics formulae, and the dynamics solutions of this manipulator are verified by simulation...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Grippers</b> {{from the}} early part of the 20th century to the middle of the 20th century {{typically}} had wooden handles, were quite easy for a strong person to close and were a regularly advertised product in bodybuilding-weightlifting magazines. [...] Such mass market <b>grippers</b> were largely replaced with inexpensive plastic-handled <b>grippers</b> that are commonly found in sporting goods and exercise equipment stores today.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the {{gripping}} mechanism {{is done by}} the <b>grippers</b> or mechanical fingers. Generally only two-finger <b>grippers</b> are used for industrial robots as they tend to be built for specific tasks and can therefore be less complex.|$|R
25|$|The {{processing}} phase can range in complexity. At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands. Sensor fusion may first {{be used to}} estimate parameters of interest (e.g. {{the position of the}} robot's <b>gripper)</b> from noisy sensor data. An immediate task (such as moving the <b>gripper</b> in a certain direction) is inferred from these estimates. Techniques from control theory convert the task into commands that drive the actuators.|$|E
25|$|The Bernoulli grip {{relies on}} this {{principle}} {{to create a}} non-contact adhesive force between a surface and the <b>gripper.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following an {{accident}} in 1896, {{most of the}} line was fitted with 'gripper rails'. These are fixed {{to either side of}} the centre toothed rack rail and are of an inverted 'L' cross section. A 'gripper' is fitted to each locomotive, which fits around the <b>gripper</b> rails and holds the locomotive to the rails and prevents the pinion coming free from the rack. Although no other Abt rack railways use a <b>gripper</b> system, other rack systems do.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum {{gripping}} systems: Schmalz designs ready-to-connect vacuum gripping systems, {{that are}} adapted to customersecific requirements. The systems range from universal <b>grippers</b> to layer gripping systems and vacuum spiders. The <b>grippers</b> {{are used in}} all areas of automation.|$|R
40|$|Soft {{miniaturized}} untethered <b>grippers</b> {{can be used}} {{to manipulate}} and transport biological material in unstructured and tortuous environments. Previous studies on control of soft miniaturized <b>grippers</b> employed cameras and optical images as a feedback modality. However, the use of cameras might be unsuitable for localizing miniaturized agents that navigate within the human body. In this paper, we demonstrate the wireless magnetic motion control and planning of soft untethered <b>grippers</b> using feedback extracted from B-mode ultrasound images. Results show that our system employing ultrasound images {{can be used to}} control the miniaturized <b>grippers</b> with an average tracking error of 0. 4 ± 0. 13 mm without payload and 0. 36 ± 0. 05 mm when the agent performs a transportation task with a payload. The proposed ultrasound feedback magnetic control system demonstrates the ability to control miniaturized <b>grippers</b> in situations where visual feedback cannot be provided via cameras...|$|R

25|$|Repeatability in an {{industrial}} process is also subject {{to the accuracy of}} the end effector, for example a <b>gripper,</b> and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the <b>gripper</b> to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.|$|E
25|$|Industrial robots usually {{consist of}} a jointed arm (multi-linked manipulator) and an end {{effector}} that {{is attached to a}} fixed surface. One of {{the most common type of}} end effector is a <b>gripper</b> assembly.|$|E
50|$|IronMind {{sought to}} refine these nutcracker-style <b>grippers,</b> first by {{improving}} their consistency and standardizing their features. The company introduced its <b>grippers</b> {{in the summer}} of 1990 in three different strengths (#1, #2 and #3) and with standardized features such as knurled handles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grippers,</b> {{sometimes}} called hand <b>grippers,</b> are primarily used for testing {{and increasing the}} strength of the hands; this specific form of grip strength has been called crushing grip, which has been defined as meaning the prime movers are the four fingers, rather than the thumb.|$|R
50|$|Another premiere {{collector}} {{and with the}} World's Largest Known Private Collection of Hand <b>Grippers</b> belongs to Joe Musselwhite from Texas with 338 hand <b>grippers</b> (and growing) from 17 different countries and over 40 different brand names. This record was established on September 1, 2014.|$|R
25|$|<b>Gripper</b> {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for a Matabeleland Invitation XI during Worcestershire's 1996/97 tour of Zimbabwe, by scoring 45. However, {{he did not}} play another match at that level until the aforementioned game against England A in February 1999.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gripper</b> {{made his}} debut for the Rhodesian cricket {{team in the}} 1957–58 season, playing 83 first class games in the Currie Cup for the {{territory}} between 1957–58 and 1971–72. He had an unbroken run playing for the team for eight years between 1958 and 1966, when he was dropped for a game against Transvaal. He later managed {{to get back into}} the team however, and he scored his best score of 279 not out against Orange Free State in the 1967–68 season. This score was a Currie Cup record for many years. <b>Gripper</b> also occasionally bowled some right-arm medium pace, taking 3 wickets at an average of forty runs apiece in his first class career.|$|E
25|$|A {{mechanical}} failure in 1987 (a broken rod on the locomotive) {{could have caused}} {{a repeat of the}} 1896 accident, but the <b>gripper</b> system worked and held the train on the rails; the rails were, however, lifted off the ground by the locomotive.|$|E
50|$|Torsion-spring <b>grippers</b> {{date back}} {{at least as far}} as the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, and are used for both testing and building grip strength. Historically, torsion-spring <b>grippers</b> were not considered serious training tools because, among other things, they were not very difficult to close.|$|R
50|$|Hundreds {{of videos}} have been posted online and {{numerous}} blogs {{have been written}} documenting efforts to close the <b>grippers.</b> IronMind founder and president Randall J. Strossen wrote a book in 2003, Captains of Crush Grippers: What They Are and How to Close Them, {{to address some of}} the myths and questions surrounding CoC <b>Grippers.</b> This book was revised, and the second edition published, in 2009. The <b>grippers</b> have also been featured in publications such as Stanford magazine, The Sacramento Bee, and BusinessWeek’s BW SmallBiz magazine.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{research}} and development of <b>grippers</b> in object-handling applications, many research results in improving grippers' performances have been achieved, and many kinds of multi nger <b>grippers</b> have been developed. By using multifinger <b>grippers,</b> it is possible to grasp different objects of different shapes without changing grippers; and most importantly, it can manipulate the grasped object in the hand, under the condition that the object is controlled in real-time. Therfore, an object-pose controller with feedback from an object-pose sensor is presented in this paper...|$|R
