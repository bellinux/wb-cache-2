25|$|The first First Class Cricket {{match of}} the tour was a tougher proposition, but Geoff Boycott added 162 for the first wicket with John Edrich (63) and 138 for the third wicket with Keith Fletcher.

25|$|During the night, the Brumby herd gallops {{close to}} the homestead, and the colt from Regret breaks free from his tethers and joins them. John Conroy is furious {{at the loss of}} his prized colt, and unfairly blames Jim for what has occurred. Conroy decides to get all the crack riders (expert horse riders) from the {{stations}} near and far to muster at the homestead and hunt for the Brumbies, offering a reward of £1000, and angrily orders Jim to leave the property <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E

25|$|The two {{children}} who modelled {{for the cover}} were siblings Stefan and Samantha Gates. The photo shoot was a frustrating affair {{over the course of}} ten days. Shooting was done <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and at sunset in order to capture the light at dawn and dusk, but the desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds. The photos of the {{two children}} were taken in black and white and were multi-printed to create the effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on the album cover. The results of the shoot were less than satisfactory, but some accidental tinting effects in post-production created an unexpectedly striking album cover. The inner sleeve photograph was taken at Dunluce Castle nearby the Causeway.|$|E
25|$|The Adelaide Oval was {{notoriously}} flat, but Garth McKenzie was {{an expert}} on getting batsmen out on dull wickets and used the humid atmosphere and fresh pitch to bowl Bob Barber for a duck and have John Edrich caught by the ever-reliable Simpson at slip. Ian Chappell took a superb catch off Neil Hawke to remove Geoff Boycott and England were 33/3. Ken Barrington (60) and Colin Cowdrey (38) began to rebuild the innings with a 72 run partnership, until Cowdrey heard a shout from the Australian wicketkeeper Wally Grout, thought he was being called and was run out. Debutant Keith Stackpole took a great catch off Jim Parks (49) to give McKenzie his third wicket, who then removed Dave Allen and Dave Brown to give him his second five wicket haul in successive Tests. England were 240/9 {{at the end of}} the first day, which soon became 241 all out as McKenzie caught Fred Titmus (33) leg before wicket <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to give him 6/48, his best Test bowling figures to date.|$|E
500|$|Syringomyelia (SM) is a {{condition}} affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It {{is caused by a}} malformation, commonly known as Chiari Malformation, in the lower back of the skull which reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid's pressure, creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or syrinxes (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples {{in the past few years}} consistently showing over 90% of Cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30–70% have syrinxes. However, most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic. [...] Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder. [...] Scratching is often unilateral– restricted to one side of the body. [...] Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body ("air scratching"). [...] The scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking– without stopping– in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching ("bunny hopping"). [...] Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on leash, or is excited, and <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> or at night.|$|E

2500|$|Apomorphine, {{which is}} a {{dopamine}} agonist not orally administered, {{may be used to}} reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are not rare, patients under apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Apomorphine can be administered by subcutaneous injection using a small pump which is carried by the patient. A low dose is automatically administered throughout the day, reducing the fluctuations of motor symptoms by providing a steady dose of dopaminergic stimulation. After an initial [...] "apomorphine challenge" [...] in hospital to test its effectiveness and brief patient and primary caregiver (often a spouse or partner), the latter of whom takes over maintenance of the pump.

2500|$|At {{around one}} o'clock one morning I {{returned}} to the Windsor Hotel in Melbourne to the staggering sight of Ken Barrington sitting alone in the lounge drinking whisky. The Test match was critically poised and Barrington, invariably an early-to-bed man in a crisis, was a portrait of gloom. He was batting <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and couldn't sleep. He returned to bed, tossed and turned for another hour until, in desperation, he committed the capital offence of telephoning the manager's room. The Duke, a chronic insomaniac had a supply of sleeping pills so powerful that the average recipient would remain oblivious to nuclear attack. In the name of England, Barrington was determined {{to get his hands}} on them. [...] "Damn you, Barrington" [...] roared the Duke, [...] "I had only just got to sleep myself." [...] Then, relenting, he said [...] "All right, come and get them". In the same moment that Barrington's hand replaced the receiver his head hit the pillow and he fell into exhausted unconsciousness. The Duke waited and waited. He was still awake when dawn exploded into dazzling sunshine {{and it was time to}} get up.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a week of}} {{settling}} in and net-practice the MCC drove deep into the bush {{to play at the}} gold mining town of Kalgoorlie, 370 miles from Fremantle. A major part of the MCC tour was flying the flag, promoting cricket and earning revenue for the English counties. All these were fulfilled by playing [...] "bush games" [...] against local grade cricket teams and as these sides were roughly the equivalent to Lancashire League they provided the tourists with valuable practice before taking on the state sides and Australia. The local captain David Herbert won the toss and put in the MCC to entertain the 4,888 strong crowd. David Sheppard (45) and Geoff Pullar (102) soon found their feet, adding 95 for the first wicket an hour, when [...] "The Rev" [...] was brilliantly caught-and-bowled by Gary Duperouzel. Pullar hit a six and 13 fours in his two-hour century. Ted Dexter was run out for 6, but Ken Barrington (46) and Peter Parfitt (45 not out) added 62 in 40 minutes and Dexter declared on 247/4 an hour before tea. Fred Trueman soon bowled the opener Mucciarone, but Campbell (66) and Sounness (48) added 99 for the second wicket in {{two and a half hours}} and Campbell hitting Fred Titmus for six. The stand was broken by Ken Barrington's leg-spin, he caught-and-bowled Sounness just before stumps and had Campbell caught behind <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> He took another two wickets to finish with 4/44 and Trueman (4/22) finished the tail with the new ball - taking 3/5 in 7 balls - after Titmus (1/55) and David Allen (1/33) each took a wicket as the Country XI was dismissed for 212. Dexter declined to make a game of it and batted out the second day. The 2,877 spectators were entertained with some big hitting from Barry Knight (40), Trueman (36) and John Murray, who hit 2 sixes and 15 fours in his 102, adding 123 inside an hour with Sheppard (59). The MCC made 314/8 in under three and a half hours and the local spinner Menegola took 4/101 in 14 overs, having been hit for 72 runs off 10 wicketless overs in the first innings. The MCC returned a profit of £500.|$|E

2500|$|Australia's first wicket cost England dearly. After 32 dull minutes Bill Lawry edged {{a chance}} off Len Coldwell (1/41) which John Murray took {{just off the}} grass in a dive that tore his {{shoulder}} ligaments. Lawry was out for 8, but Murray {{had to be taken}} off the field for medical treatment and Peter Parfitt took over behind the stumps (both he and Tom Graveney, who he replaced, were reserve wicket-keepers for their county). He did a reasonable job, but took no catches and few Test teams expect to do well in these circumstances. Norm O'Neill had failed in the number three spot so Neil Harvey came in and was missed in the slips by Cowdrey on 2 and lofted a gentle catch off Fred Trueman to David Sheppard at extra-cover on 37. Sheppard [...] "saw it all the way into my hands - and out of them. If ever I have wanted that secret trap-door and underground route to the pavilion it was then", Brian Statham shouted [...] "Bad luck", Trueman's comments are unprintable, but are usually translated as [...] "Pretend it's Sunday Reverend, and keep your hands together", Harvey hit 64 runs out of 160 in 170 minutes with only two boundaries in what Johnny Moyes thought was the worse innings of his career. He was the first victim of the Cockney off-spinner Fred Titmus (7/79) who in eight overs dismissed Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Norm O'Neill and Brian Booth for 5 runs as Australia slumped from 174/1 to 212/5 {{by the end of the}} day. [...] "Most males in the Australian population knew how to hit Titmus out of the attack but the selectors kept filling the Australian XI with the minority who did not", his flighty off-spin down the leg-side shackling the batsmen. Harvey was bowled, Simpson was caught off a cut by Ken Barrington for his third Test 90 (and the sixteenth first-class 90 of the season), O'Neill was bowled when he started a drive and changed his mind and Booth prodded one to Trueman at short leg. Barry Jarman came in as a nightwatchman, but was run out for a duck <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> overbalancing after pushing the ball to David Sheppard at forward short-leg, who threw down the stumps. Titmus continued his good work, Alan Davidson (15) was caught at short-leg hitting across the line, Richie Benaud (15) was caught and bowled and Garth McKenzie (4) was quickly lbw. Only Barry Shepherd (71 not out) hit out at the bowlers, with 8 fours and a towering six off Titmus, the last scoring stroke of the innings. Brian Statham (1/67) bowled Colin Guest in his only Test innings after a last-wicket stand of 39 and Australia were out for 319, a lead of 40 far behind what was expected or wanted. The wisdom in the press box thought Australia needed to be 150 runs ahead seeing as they would bat last.|$|E
