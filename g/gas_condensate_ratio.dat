(2005) and Al-Dhamen and Al-Marhoun (2011). Humoud and Al-Marhoun (2001) developed another model based on available field data from 74 PVT reports. They correlated the dew point pressure of a gas condensate fluid directly with its reservoir temperature, pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature, primary separator gas–oil ratio, the primary separator pressure and temperature, and relative densities of separator gas and heptanes plus specific gravity. The average error for this model was 4.33 %. Ovalle et al. (2005) used readily available field data to calculate the dew point pressure. Their database contained 615 points. Their model is based on initial producing <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>ratio</b> from the first-stage separator, initial API of the stock tank liquid, specific gravity of the initial reservoir gas, and reservoir temperature. Nonparametric approaches for estimating optimal transformations of data were used to obtain the maximum correlation between observed variables. Al-Dhamen and Al-Marhoun (2011) developed a new model to predict dew point pressure for gas condensate reservoirs, using nonparametric approaches and artificial neural networks.

Flow equations in fracture were developed for the first time (Barrenblatt et al. 1960). Primary theory for single-phase flow in fracture was developed (Warren and Root 1963). Then, these equations for fluid flow numerical simulation by Kazemi et al. were applied. The first model for gas condensate pressure and saturation prediction around production well was developed (Kniazeff and Naville 1965; Eilerts et al. 1965). Gas condensate recovery by computer programming and finite difference method was modeled (Eilerts et al. 1965). Pseudo-pressure for gas phase was developed {{for the first time to}} investigate of gas condensate accumulation in steady-state regime (O’Dell and Miller 1967). A simulator for reservoir simulation with compositional method was developed (Roebuck and Henderson 1969). Kazemi considered block matrix as a cylindrical thick layer and fracture as a thin layer between them. Then, by consideration no connection between block matrix and boundary conditions, solved flow equations and determined pressure as a function of time and location (Kazemi 1969). Gas condensate phase behavior on porous media was investigated (Saeidi and Handy 1974). A model was developed which fracture network in Warren–Root model was replaced with a vertical fracture (Cinco-Ley et al. 1985). Triple porosity model with two various porosity block matrix was developed (Abdassah and Ershaghi 1986). An equation for determination fracture network permeability was developed (Jones et al. 1988). Effect of surface tension on gas and condensate relative permeability was investigated (Asar and Handy 1988). A gas condensate reservoir including a mixture of three hydrocarbons with compositional and fully implicit method was modeled (Jones and Raghavan 1988). Gas injection into gas condensate reservoir in 2 -D was simulated, and simulation results with finite difference method were compared (Chang et al. 1991). Effect of gas condensate accumulation on production reduction was investigated (Afidick et al. 1994). By gridding around well, a reservoir was simulated (Malachowski et al. 1995). A method for determination of gas relative permeability in oil reservoir with associate gas was developed (Hatzignatiou and Reynolds 1996). A model was developed which block matrix size is not same in it, but in the Warren–Root model is same (Rice 1997). Dual porosity–dual permeability model for single-phase flow was developed (Cather et al. 1998). Phase behavior around well according to non-Darcy flow was modeled (Coats et al. 1998). A method for modeling gas and condensate relative permeability was determined (Fevang and Whitson 1999). Relative permeability in gas condensate reservoir as a function of the capillary number was determined (Henderson et al. 2000). An experimental method was developed which relative permeability around well in steady-state, high-pressure and high-velocity conditions was determined (Mott 2000). Effect of the capillary number and the non-Darcy flow on phase’s relative permeability in gas condensate reservoir were investigated (Penuela et al. 2002). Equations of gas injection into gas condensate reservoir were solved, and MMP was determined (Seto et al. 2003). A method for determining <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>ratio</b> was developed (Mott 2003). Miscibility variation in gas injection into gas condensate reservoir with numerical method was investigated (Hoier et al. 2004). Four porosity model including fracture network with three various properties fractures was developed (Dreier et al. 2004). MMP in gas condensate reservoir by injecting NGL and CO 2 with the help of Peng–Robinson, Patel–Teja, Patel–Teja–Valderrama and Esmaielzadeh–Roshanfekr EOS was determined (Esmaeilzadeh and Roshanfekr 2006). Simulation of gas condensate well with pseudo-pressure method was developed (Bonyadi 2006). A 2 -D and single-phase model of fracture gas reservoir was developed (Shane and Hattingh 2009). Another technique for applying mathematical modeling in petroleum reservoirs is the model based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that was applied to determine the oil-CO 2 molecular diffusion coefficient in the secondary and tertiary production mechanisms such as CO 2 miscible injection as well as applying the particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the ANFIS model parameters, that can be applied in the numerical simulation of petroleum reservoirs (Ejraei Bakyani et al. 2016 a). Finally, based on the linear regression technique, several empirical relationships of two-phase (gas–water) relative permeabilities through fracture were obtained for the various conditions both the smooth and the rough parallel fractures during the imbibition and the drainage mechanisms that can be applied in the numerical simulation of two-phase flow through fractured reservoirs (Ejraei Bakyani et al. 2016 b).|$|E

30|$|It is envisioned {{that the}} {{calculated}} dew point from this model {{could be used}} in several applications. First, it can be employed as a form of quality control to ensure the sampling procedure takes fluid samples with down-hole pressure above the dew point pressure (for more accurate sampling). This can serve as a confirmation to the current operational procedure of establishing dew point (by pumping out until liquid appears and is sensed by the tool sensors). This is particularly useful in low <b>condensate</b> <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> fluids. Secondly, it provides a quick estimate of dew point pressure that can help in any further estimation of phase behavior of gas wells for reservoir and production engineering applications. Thirdly, in cases having extensive down-hole data for multi-wells in the same reservoir, the calculated dew point pressure can be used to quality control the down-hole data. In this application, the trend of the calculated dew point pressure will be checked to see whether it follows the expected increase with depth trend.

These techniques range from traditional (Arps and Fetkovich) to modern (for the variation of operating conditions at the wellbore).

Storage of sour gas can be advantageous from economic standpoint, as it reduces treatment costs and increases the potential of production from shared reservoirs. This paper investigates feasibility of UGS in one of Iranian depleted fractured <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> reservoirs. Compositional simulation was employed to build dynamic reservoir model, develop the history matching phase of the reservoir and construct Injection/Withdrawal (I/W) cycles. One sweet gas stream and three sour gas streams with different compositions were tested for storage into reservoir during summer season. 				Results of simulation showed that presence of H 2 S and CO 2 in the injected <b>gas</b> stream improves <b>condensate</b> production. Condensate Production Enhancement (CPE), defined {{as the percentage of}} condensate recovery increase due to sour gas injection relative to the sweet gas injection, was calculated for different compositions of storage <b>gas.</b> Also, <b>Condensate</b> Holding <b>Ratio</b> (CHR), defined as the <b>ratio</b> of <b>condensate</b> in the withdrawn sour gas to that in the withdrawn CH 4, was estimated for different storage gas compositions.

It is obviously that trend lines in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> sample are sharper in vertical whereas there are more linear in horizontal direction in volatile oil. Results show that from left-top towards right-bottom corner, methane composition varies about 5.2  mol% in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> sample, whereas this value is about 0.45  mol% in volatile oil sample. Hence, volatile oil sample becomes more uniform in comparison with <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> in the same magnitude of permeability. In Fig.  12 a, b, which demonstrates variations of density in both <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> {{and volatile}} oil samples, {{it is obvious that}} in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> fluid, density has higher gradient from right-top to left-bottom corner, more than 350  kg/m 3 versus 150  kg/m 3 in volatile oil; it means that there is more turbulence in gas sample compared with oil sample causing to have higher gradient of C 1 in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate.</b> On the other hand, more uniformity in density of volatile oil sample has caused to have almost flat trends of C 1 composition. It seems that one logical reason is due to bulk velocity. Figure  13 a, b shows contour plot of bulk velocity for two samples.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> {{flow in the}} porous {{media is}} distinctly {{different from that of}} gas-oil flow. The differences are attributed to the difference in fluid properties, phase behaviour, and condensation and vaporisation phenomena that distinguishes <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> fluids from the aforementioned fluid types. These differences manifest themselves into an important flow parameter that is typically known as relative permeability. Relative permeability is known {{to be related to the}} phase saturation, and the interfacial tension (EFT). Also, at high phase velocities, its reduction with increasing velocity, known as Forchheimer (turbulence) or inertia effect, is well documented. An unconventional behaviour of <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> fluids has been experimentally proven in Heriot-Watt laboratory and confirmed by other experimental studies performed elsewhere. These tests have shown that at intermediate velocities, before the inertia becomes significant, the <b>gas</b> and the <b>condensate</b> relative permeabilities are significantly improved by increase in velocity. This phenomenon is referred to as the rate-effect. None of the conventional relative permeability models include this experimentally proven favourable rate effect. In this work the flow of <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> fluids in porous media is modelled with emphasis on near wellbore conditions. Theoretical, empirical as well as simulational investigations are used to improve the present technology on the treatment of the flow of <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> in reservoirs. The use of X-ray or y-ray devices to monitor saturation profile during displacement experiments is investigated and the appropriate test conditions leading to reliable measured relative permeability data are determined. The regimes of the <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> flow at the core level, where the rate effect is evident, are investigated using the concept of Reynolds number. Then a mechanistic flow model, where the flow of <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> fluids is assumed to follow an annularmist flow criterion, is presented to capture the essence of the rate effect in perforations. The favourable EFT and rate effects are incorporated into the modelling of <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> relative permeability by correlating it with capillary number (I). Two forms of the correlation are presented. The impact of EFT and Ne together with the Forchheimer (inertia) on well deliverability is thoroughly investigated using the above correlation.

The present study extends the work of Al-Attar for high rate <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> wells flowing through different large choke sizes between 40 / 64 and 192 / 64 in. under subcritical flow conditions, in order to develop individual empirical correlations to be applied to predict gas flow rates under a wide range of flow conditions usually encountered during the flow of <b>gas</b> <b>condensates</b> through wellhead chokes in high rate wells.
