5|$|According to some authors, {{the name}} killer whale is a {{mistranslation}} of the 18th century Spanish name asesina-ballenas which means literally whale killer. Basque whalers {{would have given}} <b>it</b> <b>such</b> name after observing pods of orcas hunting baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|A COBOL {{program is}} split into four divisions: the {{identification}} division, the environment division, the data division and the procedure division. The identification division specifies {{the name and}} type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies any program features that depend on the system running <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as files and character sets. The data division is used to declare variables and parameters. The procedure division contains the program's statements. Each division is sub-divided into sections, which {{are made up of}} paragraphs.|$|E
5|$|A large tumulus of {{uncertain}} {{origin and}} purpose stands approximately {{in the middle}} of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city.

5|$|As {{a coping}} mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables {{him or her}} to deal with intense stress in the current moment. The patterns sometimes created by <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being {{on the right side of}} the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as signs or on spines of books.|$|E

5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{anticipation}} {{when the}} first media for Unleashed was revealed was high, as the demonstration videos hinted at a possible return of Sonic to his traditional platforming roots, especially because of the series' declining quality in recent years, {{and a number of}} poorly received titles in the franchise that preceded <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as the 2006 game, Sonic the Hedgehog.|$|E
5|$|Live & Kicking is a BBC Saturday morning children's {{magazine}} programme, {{running from}} 1993 to 2001. The fourth in {{a succession of}} Saturday morning shows, it was the replacement for Going Live!, and took many of its features from <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as phone-ins, games, comedy, competitions and the showing of cartoons. Once Live & Kicking had become established in series two, it reached its height in popularity during series four, when it was presented by Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston; their final episode won a BAFTA award. After this the series ratings dropped with the launch of SMTV Live on ITV and the show eventually {{came to an end}} in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field {{can be understood}} as a gauge field, i.e., as a field that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the {{electromagnetic field}}, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E
5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after <b>it</b> <b>such</b> as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} known to be toxic to goats; a study {{published}} in the early 1980s revealed that 11 out of 12 goats died after 1 to 40 days of daily oral dosing of Tephrosia apollinea shoots (fresh or dried), and that they displayed adverse reactions to ingesting <b>it</b> <b>such</b> as dyspnoea, weakness of the limbs and joints causing instability in movement, changes in fat composition, catarrhal enteritis, and hemorrhage in the heart, lungs, and intestinal mucosa. Rotenoids extracted from the seeds of the plant also caused complete mortality in Aphis craccivora, when applied at a concentration of 0.1% for 48 hours.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as hairless rats.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the arrests the solicitors for one of the {{deported}} men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with Sir Patrick Hastings KC, a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party and a noted barrister. On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a Divisional Court consisting of Mr Justice Avory and Mr Justice Salter to apply for a writ of habeas corpus for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in Mountjoy Prison), which was required for a writ of habeas corpus to be considered, {{but by the time the}} hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one. Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed. In addition the Home Secretary had no power to order an individual to be detained overseas because he had no control over what happened to them there.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening <b>it</b> <b>such</b> that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
