In the film's early sequences, he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> {{fighting}} man, but years later, {{due to a}} poor diet, has gained {{an enormous amount of}} weight. A fan of the X-Men movies, Durand contacted the producers for a role as soon as news of a new film came out. The suit went through six months of modifications, and had a tubing system inside to cool Durand down with ice water. David Harbour auditioned for the role, but was turned down for being too fat at the time.|$|E

She has also trained in several forms of martial arts, with kick-boxing as her specialty.

25|$|The {{character}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> fighter {{possessing the}} innate {{ability to control}} ice in many forms. In his first return appearance in Mortal Kombat II, {{it was revealed that}} the original Sub-Zero had died during the events of the first game and was replaced by his brother. In the subsequent games, the younger brother of Sub-Zero, remained as Sub-Zero, while the elder brother became Noob Saibot. The most defining trait of the character is his fierce rivalry with his nemesis Scorpion.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} two days, on the {{southern}} front, the Nationalists could not make progress along the valley, so had {{no option but to}} advance up the ridge of the Sierra towards Pico Turbina. This peak, at 1,315m, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> obstacle with slopes of 40° and an almost moon-like karst terrain. There were no tracks, even for mules, so supplies and ordnance were largely carried by hand. The weather was bad, too, so aircraft could not operate – but the fog also hid the attacking forces.|$|E

25|$|A large, {{athletic}} dog, the Estrela Mountain Dog <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> opponent for any predator - fortunately, it is {{not often}} called upon to rise to anyone's life-or-death defense. It is calm but fearless and will not hesitate to react to danger, making it an exceptional watchdog as well as an excellent guard dog. It is intelligent, loyal, and faithful, affectionate to those it knows but wary of those it does not. It is instinctively protective of any children in its family. It needs early and continued socialization to be trustworthy around small pets and other dogs.|$|E
500|$|... he {{evidence}} moldering {{in county}} courthouses and the National Archives compels us to confront this extinguished past, {{to recognize the}} terrible contours of the record, to teach our children the truth of a terror that pervaded much of American life, to celebrate its end, to lift any shame on {{those who could not}} evade it. This book is not a call for financial reparations. Instead, I hope it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> plea for a resurrection and fundamental reinterpretation of a tortured chapter in the collective American past.|$|E
500|$|After Eddard Stark convinces King Robert not to {{join the}} tourney, the crowd watches a jousting match between the fearsome Ser Gregor [...] "The Mountain" [...] Clegane, brother of the Hound, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the [...] "Knight of Flowers". The Mountain <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> opponent, but Loras cleverly defeats him in the joust by riding a mare in heat, distracting Clegane's stallion. Furious, Clegane beheads his horse and {{attempts}} to kill Loras. Sandor [...] "The Hound" [...] Clegane comes to Tyrell's rescue and defends him against his brother until Robert orders them to stop. Grateful for being rescued, Loras calls Sandor a hero when he is cheered by the crowd.|$|E

500|$|Edward's {{motivation}} {{stems from}} a love for his brother, Alphonse, whom he is desperately seeking to restore to human form after their mistake. He is extremely idealistic, and strongly believes in the alchemical concept of [...] "Equivalent Exchange," [...] which states that every outcome requires an equal payment. Edward also behaves in a childish manner when confronted about his short height, tending to overreact to any negative comment regarding the subject, usually attacking people {{in a fit of}} rage. Unlike regular alchemists who use transmutation circles, Edward has the ability to create alchemical currents in his body simply by connecting his hands {{as a result of his}} failed human transmutation which gave him such trait. In addition to this, Edward <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> fighter as a result of his training with Izumi, who had extensively trained both brothers in martial arts.|$|E
500|$|Domestically, the {{reaction}} to the cancellation was split along partisan lines. The Department of Defense was surprised by the announcement; internal expectations were that the number of B-1s ordered would be reduced to around 150. Congressman Robert Dornan (R-CA) claimed, [...] "They're breaking out the vodka and caviar in Moscow." [...] In contrast, it appears the Soviets were more concerned by large numbers of ALCMs representing a much greater threat than a smaller number of B-1s. Soviet news agency TASS commented that [...] "the implementation of these militaristic plans has seriously complicated efforts for the limitation of the strategic arms race." [...] Western military leaders were generally happy with the decision. NATO commander Alexander Haig described the ALCM as an [...] "attractive alternative" [...] to the B-1. French General Georges Buis stated [...] "The B-1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> weapon, but not terribly useful. For the price of one bomber, you can have 200 cruise missiles." ...|$|E
500|$|Maggie has {{performed}} {{a number of}} feats that suggest she is a genius. She has spelled out E=MC² with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center, written her name on an Etch A Sketch, played Internet poker, and treated her pacifier like a cigarette. However, {{the rest of the}} Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie's maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting her walk by herself. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy. Despite her age, Maggie <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> marksman, as seen in [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls into her hands, and in a more intentional manner during [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{its great}} size and tusks, the walrus {{has only two}} natural predators: the killer whale (orca) and the polar bear. [...] The walrus does not, however, {{comprise}} a significant component of either predator's diets. Both the orca and the polar bear are also most likely to prey on walrus calves. The polar bear often hunts the walrus by rushing at beached aggregations and consuming the individuals crushed or wounded in the sudden exodus, typically younger or infirm animals. The bears also isolate walruses when they overwinter and are unable to escape a charging bear due to inaccessible diving holes in the ice. However, even an injured walrus <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> opponent for a polar bear, and direct attacks are rare. Walruses {{have been known to}} fatally injure polar bears in battles if the latter follows the other into the water where the bear is at a disadvantage. Polar bear–walrus battles are often extremely protracted and exhausting, and bears have been known to forgo the attack after injuring a walrus. Orcas regularly attack walrus, although walruses are believed to have successfully defended themselves via counterattack against the larger cetacean. However, orcas have been observed successfully attacking walruses with few or no injuries.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{criticized the}} {{contract}} amount, considering it a gamble for Virgin. He stated that Jackson [...] "is a producer-dependent artist—i.e., someone who relies on others {{to make her}} sound interesting and trendy. She also lacks a sharply defined personality, both {{as an artist and}} celebrity. Where singers like Ms. Houston and Mariah Carey have commanding vocal power, Ms. Jackson's is a relatively indistinguishable studio voice." [...] Richard Branson rebutted this argument stating [...] "Ms. Jackson has met with great success working with the production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, just as her brother Michael Jackson has experienced his greatest successes with the producer Quincy Jones. It is interesting that Mr. Holden doesn't mention this similar 'liability' when discussing Michael Jackson. To say that Ms. Jackson is 'dependent' on her producer is a shortsighted observation. She <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>formidable</b> talent who stands on her own." [...] Michael Jackson would break his sister's record only days later, when he signed a $60 million contract with Sony Music Entertainment. Both sibling's contracts garnered considerable criticism. Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "A Records President Al Cafaro, whose company lost the fierce bidding battle over Janet Jackson to Virgin Records, said record companies may be vesting too much importance in individual performers" [...] as the funds used as advances to the Jacksons could have launched recording careers for numerous unknown talents. Cliff Burnstein of Q-Prime [...] management commented that recording artists demands for advances upon signing would begin to escalate from that point forward.|$|E
