40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} “work structuring, ” a {{term used}} to describe the effort of integrating product and process design throughout the project development process. To illustrate current work structuring practice, we describe a case study involving the <b>installation</b> of door <b>frames</b> into walls in a prison. We analyze why various problems existed. To improve the work structuring effort, we apply the “five whys” to develop local and global fixes for the system of precast walls and door frames. The five whys is a technique to elicit alternative ways of structuring work without being constrained by contractual agreements, traditions, or trade boundaries. We discuss the importance of dimensional tolerances in construction and how these affect the handoff of work from one group of workers to the next. We argue that these constraints and tolerance management practices are so embedded that project participants can miss opportunities to better integrate product and process design. We propose shifting the focus of work structuring from maximizing local trade efficiency to improving overall performance in the delivery system of a capital project...|$|R

His practice is informed by real factors of circumstance, site, or the particular inhabitants or histories of a building or place and he mixes these with interlinked narratives that are drawn from film, architecture, art, music and books. There is a clear coherence and dialogue across his work through its continual engagement with ideas about architecture and space, and its characteristic use of abstract geometric forms, fields and lines of intense colour. Many of his drawings represent the floor plans of idealised or imagined dwellings, sometimes for specific people or historical figures, sometimes for fictional ones. Colour is {{used to describe the}} functions and atmospheres of rooms, or the situations and qualities of the surrounding landscape, and take their cues from the identity of the person who is thought to live there, in a web of imaginative factors that intuitively feed into the geometrical arrangement for each drawing. For Chapter, Lothar has created a number of new works: retreat Black is a sculptural form or ‘room’ that employs the many facets of his wide-ranging practice and offers a more complex viewing experience of the works contained within. Shadow Green, Shadow Black, and Shadow orange, three site-specific wall paintings, work to redefine specific characteristics of the gallery by drawing the gaze from inside this structure and in to a dialogue with the existing architecture beyond. Circus, a new wall painting {{at the end of the}} gallery, is a vivid exploration of the many- layered nature of line and plane, and the architectural qualities and spirit of the place.

40|$|Water quality {{improvement}} and suppression of cyanobacterial blooms were planned in a eutrophic reservoir in southern China through ecological engineering measures from 2006 to 2011. This consisted in (i) a hydraulic resetting of inflows and outflows {{to increase the}} distance between inlet and outlet and the water residence time in the reservoir, and in (ii) the <b>installation</b> of floating <b>frames</b> hosting wetland vegetation to promote an alteration in phytoplankton composition. The environmental changes were therefore followed through the analysis of biotic responses in phytoplankton assemblages. Ecological engineering was effective in reducing phytoplankton total biomass, in re-establishing more diversified phytoplankton assemblages and in avoiding cyanobacterial blooms. These changes may be considered as an improvement of the reservoir water quality. However, trophic state parameters and the dynamics of dominant species were not sensitive enough in describing the environmental changes that had occurred when the eco-engineering measures were implemented. These were more effectively tracked by the dynamics followed by phytoplankton Morpho-Functional-Groups and by their classification based on Competitors, Stress tolerants and Ruderals strategies. Although providing immediate positive effects, the ecoengineering was temporally limited, highlighting the importance of constant management {{in the context of}} long-term oriented remediation techniques...|$|R
50|$|Joists must {{exhibit the}} {{strength}} to support the anticipated load {{over a long period}} of time. In more developed countries such as the United States, the fabrication and <b>installation</b> of all <b>framing</b> members including joists must meet building code standards. Considering the cross section of a typical joist, the overall depth of the joist is critical in establishing a safe and stable floor or ceiling system. The wider the spacing between the joists, the deeper the joist will need to be to limit stress and deflection under load. Lateral support called dwang, blocking, or strutting increases its stability, preventing the joist from buckling under load. There are approved formulas for calculating the depth required and reducing the depth as needed; however, a rule of thumb for calculating the depth of a wooden floor joist for a residential property is to take half the span in feet, add two, and use the resulting number as the depth in inches; for example, the joist depth required for a 14‑foot span is 9 inches. Many steel joist manufacturers supply load tables in order to allow designers to select the proper joist sizes for their projects.|$|R
40|$|Building {{information}} modelling {{has proven to}} be an effective tool for both engineering and construction management. It can be used from early conceptual design to detailed design and for creating construction phase models. It is also a practical tool for managing communication and other data between Designers, Constructor, Fabricators and Contractors. This Master’s thesis is a company specific case study and written for localizing potential in more BIM based project management. Main objective of the research is to formulate a sketch of a suitable BIM based installation logistics and project management system focusing on packing management system and packing order. The research has been delimited to pertain steel frame elements of power plant engine hall. In order to achieve the main objective, installation logistics and other construction management related properties of the chosen softwares Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight are examined. Main interests of the constructor company concerning construction management and especially installation logistics are also localized. Furthermore, quality standards for modelling and packing process are defined to achieve the main objective. As a result, findings of the research and suggested tools are evaluated based on the needs of the constructor. Tekla Stuctures can be used for conceptual design, for generating drawings and report, and for erection scheduling. In addition, it {{has turned out to be}} practical software for managing frame element delivery and data needed for site management. Organizer found in Tekla Structures especially is a handy tool for managing information needed for coordination of a site and frame element delivery. Tekla BIMsight is software for project collaboration and can be used for combining the models of different project stakeholders and for frame element unloading and installation management. Tekla BIMsight is a practical tool for making assembly plans and progress reports of site installation works. It can also be used for the supervision of <b>installation</b> works, for <b>frame</b> element unloading and grouping, and for on-site collaboration between structural and MEP works. Use of note files compatible to Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight enables BIM based communication between Structural Designers, Project Engineers and Site Supervisors throughout the project. The best way to ensure a practical frame element packing order is to attach an installation sequence number pointing out the required packing order for each steel assembly and to publish these numbers in an assembly list. It is also practical to divide an engine hall for modules and phases if needed using the Organizer tool in Tekla Structures, and to utilize this division for managing frame element delivery. Still, for developing installation logistics further, it is recommendable to seek better <b>frame</b> <b>installation</b> management through more integrated BIM based communication protocols...|$|R

40|$|Work {{structuring}} means {{developing a}} project's process design {{while trying to}} align engineering design, supply chain, resource allocation, and assembly efforts. The goal of work structuring is to make work flow more reliable and quick while delivering value to the customer. Current work structuring practices are driven by contracts, the history of trades, and the traditions of craft. As a result, they rarely consider alternatives for making the construction process more efficient. To illustrate current practice and the opportunities provided by work structuring, this case study discusses the installation of metal door frames at a prison project. Because the project is a correctional facility, the door <b>frame</b> <b>installation</b> process involves a special grouting procedure which makes the installation process less routine.

Their work {{from this period}} took many forms: performances incorporating the gestures and language of the political speech, exemplified in their political archetype, The Artist President; carefully choreographed performances that combined live action with prerecorded sound, projected film and slides (as exemplified by the stage performance, Great Moments); and interventions into public space (such as The Avant Guard Security - in one event Procter posed {{as part of the}} official security detail for President Ford’s visit to San Francisco on the day when Sara Jane Moore attempted his assassination).

30|$|Semi-rigid {{connections}} are receiving considerable {{interest in the}} research community because of their easy <b>installation</b> in steel <b>frames</b> and energy-dissipating capability under reversal loading (Elnashi et al. 1998; Shen and Astaneh-Asl 1999; Garlock et al. 2003; Pirmoz 2006; Cheol and Young 2007). Understanding the viability of these connections in practice, AISC (2001, 2010) adopted top- and seat-angle connections into the design specifications to transfer only the beam-shear force to the column. However, experimental evidences and the author’s past studies on the connections exposed that besides transferring beam-shear force, this type of connections transferred fairly significant beam-end-moment to the column. When transferring the moment through the top angle to the column, an increase in tensile force occurred in the bolts due to local deformation of the top angle’s vertical leg. This additional tensile force {{is commonly known as}} prying force. A few researchers have paid serious attention to this additional force in their mathematical representation of connection behaviour. The most recent stiffness modelling technique that includes individual elements behaviour reformed in equivalent T-stub connection model for both extended end plate connections and angle type of connections following the modelling technique of Weynand et al. (1995) has been adopted in Eurocode 3 (CEN 2005). However, the T-stub model is somehow different in respect to interaction with the actual deformation pattern of true angle type of connections at failure and may loose its efficiency in estimation of connection strength. So, precise understanding about interaction among connection components on moment–rotation behaviour is required to represent a straightforward and accurate mechanical model of the connection.|$|R
40|$|Building Sites In The Expanding Field is {{a two-part}} {{research}} project that examines, through art practice and theory components, relations between institutional critique and white cube gallery conventions {{at the start}} of the twenty-first century. The project responds to commentaries by critics such as John Roberts, David Beech and Stewart Martin, in which notions of participation, sociability and conviviality – modes of interaction identified by the curator Nicolas Bourriaud with relational <b>installation</b> – are <b>framed</b> as the institutional framework of the work's articulation. My project, in contrast, examines the relevance of earlier modes of institutional critique to this post-relational moment; it is intended also to bring focus to my own practice of architectural intervention. The project's core problematic is the way in which the ubiquitous frame of display known as the white cube gallery continues to inform gallery design and thus shapes the parameters of artistic reception and critical art practice. My thesis is that the architectural frames of gallery spaces continue to support an ideological construction of artistic reception as a mode of encounter indebted to the legacy of minimalist art and set apart from the instrumentality of capitalist production and consumption outside the gallery's walls. I argue that critical intervention within gallery architecture can prompt people to critically question the relation between the roles or identities they adopt in these spaces and the function that the spaces themselves perform. To this end, I examine historical debates that have linked institutional critique and architectural intervention with notions of allegory, focusing particularly upon the contributions of Michael Asher, Brian O'Doherty, Rosalind E. Krauss, Benjaimin H. D. Buchloh and Craig Owens, and presenting recent post-relational debates in relation to the legacy of the white cube gallery. The key contribution of both the practice and theory components of my project is my critical analysis of the legacy of the white cube gallery beyond the moment of relational installation, as a context open to re-appropriation through allegorical readings that draw forth the processes of its socio-historical construction. Whilst legacies of critical postmodernism figure in post-relational debates staged recently in journals and magazines such as Third Text and Art Monthly, my project draws explicit links between contemporary modes of artistic display and critique, and this moment...|$|R
