5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, {{who had joined}} in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>a</b> member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
5|$|LTP was {{discovered}} in the rabbit hippocampus by Terje Lømo in 1966 and <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>a</b> popular subject of research since. Many modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of clinical research, for example, {{in the areas of}} Alzheimer's disease and addiction medicine.|$|E

5|$|Although Elgar {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married {{the daughter of a}} senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and <b>has</b> <b>remained,</b> <b>a</b> core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.|$|E
5|$|Colleagues urged Charlton {{to stand}} for the state electoral {{district}} of Waratah, and on 5 December 1903 Charlton became the second member for the district in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. His representation of that district was short-lived, as the next year he transferred to Northumberland, replacing John Norton. Charlton became the unofficial spokesperson for the miners, speaking principally about mining matters in parliament. In 1909 a coal miners' strike struck New South Wales and Charlton was called upon by the Colliery Employees' Federation to represent {{it in front of}} a wage board. Charlton was unsuccessful in gaining better conditions for the miners but he did settle the dispute, talking to miners around the state and convincing them to return to work. He resigned from state politics and in 1910 Charlton wrested the federal Division of Hunter from the sitting Frank Liddell. Hunter <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> <b>a</b> safe Labor seat ever since.|$|E
