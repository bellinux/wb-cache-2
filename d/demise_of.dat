40|$|Both {{theoretical}} and applied economics {{have a great}} deal to say about many aspects of the firm, but the literature on the extinctions, or <b>demises,</b> <b>of</b> firms is very sparse. We use a publicly available data base covering some 6 million firms in the US and show that the underlying statistical distribution which characterises the frequency of firm demises- the disappearances of firms as autonomous entities- is closely approximated by a power law. The exponent of the power law is, intriguingly, close to that reported in the literature on the extinction of biological species. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide empirical evidence on the statistical distribution which appears to characterise the <b>demises</b> <b>of</b> US firms, across the entire universe of such firms using a publicly available data base. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the data follow a power law distribution. The observation of power-law distributions (fractal behaviour) in a system's macroscopically observable quantities is a characteristic property of many-body systems representing the effects of complex interactions amongst the constituents of the system. Recent evidence that related aspects of economic activity are consistent with power distributions at the aggregate level is given, for example, by [1] on the growth of firms, [2] on the sizes of firms and [3] on the duration of recessions in the Western market economies. Economic theory has a great deal to say about many aspects of the firm. Empirical studies of firm growth and size have emphasised the importance of stochastic influences, fro...|$|R
