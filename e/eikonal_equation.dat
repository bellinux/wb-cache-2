This lower run-time cost is obtained while keeping an error bound of the same order of magnitude as the original algorithm. This improvement is achieved introducing the straight forward untidy priority queue, obtained via a quantization of the priorities in the marching computation.

40|$|Seismic {{techniques}} incorporating {{high frequency}} asymptotic {{representation of the}} 3 D elastic Green's function require efficient solution methods for the computation of traveltimes. For finite difference eikonal solvers, upwind differences are requisite to sharply resolve discontinuities in the traveltime derivatives. In anisotropic media the direction of energy propagation is not in general tangent to the wavefront normal, while finite difference eikonal solvers compute the solution based on the traveltime gradients and wavefront normal. Local convexity of the wavefronts in transverse isotropic (TI) media is proved to show that wavefront normal determines the upwind direction of the energy propagation. The <b>eikonal</b> <b>equations</b> for the traveltimes in TI media of a generally inclined symmetry axis (ITI) are derived {{in a way that}} the eikonal solvers fit conveniently.

40|$|For {{the first}} time exact {{analytical}} solutions to the <b>eikonal</b> <b>equations</b> in (1 + 1) dimensions with a refractive index being a saturated function of intensity are constructed. It is demonstrated that the solutions exhibit collapse; an explicit analytical expression for the self-focusing position, where the intensity tends to infinity, is found. Based on an approximated Lie symmetry group, solutions to the <b>eikonal</b> <b>equations</b> with arbitrary nonlinear refractive index are constructed. Comparison between exact and approximate solutions is presented. Approximate solutions to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation in (1 + 2) dimensions with arbitrary refractive index and initial intensity distribution are obtained. A particular case of refractive index consisting of Kerr refraction and multiphoton ionization is considered. It is demonstrated that the beam collapse can take place {{not only at the}} beam axis but also in an off-axis ring region around it. An analytical condition distinguishing these two cases is obtained and explicit formula for the self-focusing position is presented. Comment: 25 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Rarefaction is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in <b>Eikonal</b> <b>equations,</b> which is known to degrade the rate of convergence of numerical methods. The "factoring" approach alleviates this difficulty by deriving a PDE for a new (locally smooth) variable while capturing the rarefaction-related singularity in a known (non-smooth) "factor". Previously this technique was successfully used to address rarefaction fans arising at point sources. In this paper we show how similar ideas {{can be used to}} factor the 2 D rarefactions arising due to nonsmoothness of domain boundaries or discontinuities in PDE coefficients. Locations and orientations of such rarefaction fans are not known in advance and we construct a "just-in-time factoring" method that identifies them dynamically. The resulting algorithm is a generalization of the Fast Marching Method originally introduced for the regular (unfactored) <b>Eikonal</b> <b>equations.</b> We show that our approach restores the first-order convergence and illustrate it using a range of maze navigation examples with non-permeable and "slowly permeable" obstacles.

This phenomenon has recently been observed in [13] in <b>eikonal</b> <b>equations.</b> We show in this paper that this relaxation is a common phenomenon {{for a wide range}} of Hamilton-Jacobi equations...|$|R

This inversion method follows a recurring linear schema, and ray paths are recalculated after each model update. The FMM and subspace combinations provide stable and robust results on highly diverse media (Rawlinson et al. 2010).
