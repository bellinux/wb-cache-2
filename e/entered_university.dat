5|$|Terence Tao (Australia) {{participated in}} IMO 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning bronze, {{silver and gold}} medals respectively. He {{won a gold medal}} when he just turned {{thirteen}} in IMO 1988, becoming the youngest person at that time to receive a gold medal (a feat matched in 2011 by Zhuo Qun Song of Canada). Tao also holds the distinction of being the youngest medalist with his 1986 bronze medal, alongside 2009 bronze medalist Raúl Chávez Sarmiento (Peru), at the age of 10 and 11 respectively. Representing the United States, Noam Elkies won a gold medal with a perfect paper at the age of 14 in 1981.

5|$|Ethel Frida Fraser's {{birth was}} {{recorded}} on 30 August 1899 in York, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to Helene (née Zahn) and William Henry Fraser. It is unknown when her name began being styled as Frieda Helen Fraser. Her {{father was a}} native Ontarian who had graduated from the University of Toronto (U of T) and taught at the Upper Canada College before being appointed as a lecturer in Italian and Spanish at U of T. He prolifically wrote textbooks which {{were used in the}} provincial schools for many years. Her mother was a native of Germany and the couple's children, William Kaspar, Donald and Frieda were fluent in German and French. Fraser was home schooled until 1914, when she enrolled in Havergal College. Soon thereafter, in 1916, her father died and her brother Donald became an encouraging influence for her. In 1917, Fraser <b>entered</b> <b>University</b> College to study physics and biology. During her college years, she joined the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority where she met Edith Williams. She completed her undergraduate degree in 1922 and enrolled in medical school, earning her Bachelor of Medicine in 1925. Hers was the first class that required students to complete six years of study and had quotas limiting the number of women who could attend. Because few hospitals would accept women doctors for internships, Fraser went to the United States in the summer of 1925 to begin her internship at the New York Infirmary for Women and Children.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1795, after {{deciding}} not to send Gheorghe and Petru to Moldavian Greek-language {{school in}} the capital city of Iaşi, Lazăr Asachi opted to give them a more modern education in Austrian lands, sending them to Lemberg, where they attended gymnasium. After completing seven terms of education in Latin, Polish and German, Gheorghe Asachi <b>entered</b> <b>university</b> (the present-day Lviv University) at the age of 14. He studied at the Faculty of Letters, Philosophy and Sciences (attending lectures in logic, metaphysics, ethics, mathematics, physics, natural history, and architecture), but, in 1804, after two years of studies, he withdrew and returned to Moldavia. Despite this, his level of familiarity with Western culture was arguably unparalleled in his native country {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. Over the following decades, he designed several lodgings in both his native country and Galicia.|$|E

He applied for a job with Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service, but was rejected for reasons of incompatibility.|$|E

He passed the 1st MB exam in 1851, receiving {{the gold medal in}} Dr. Sharpey's class of Physiology & Anatomy, and the silver medal in Zoology & Comparative Anatomy; the gold medal in the latter subject was taken by his fellow-student, Joseph Lister.
