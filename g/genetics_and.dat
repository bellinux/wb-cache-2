5|$|Stebbins wrote {{several books}} {{during his time}} at UC Davis. These {{included}} his follow-up to Variation and Evolution, , {{which was published in}} 1974, following his delivery of the Prather Lectures at Harvard. Stebbins discusses the origins, <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> developmental biology of the angiosperms. He argues for the role of adaptive radiation in the diversification of the angiosperms and the usefulness of applying our current understanding of species' <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> ecology to gain knowledge about the evolution of ancient species. He also wrote Processes of Organic Evolution, The Basis of Progressive Evolution, Chromosomal Evolution in Plants and the textbook Evolution with co-authors Dobzhansky, Francisco Ayala and James W. Valentine. His last book, Darwin to DNA, Molecules to Humanity was published in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Turrill thus {{explicitly}} excludes from alpha taxonomy {{various areas}} of study that he includes within taxonomy as a whole, such as ecology, physiology, <b>genetics,</b> <b>and</b> cytology. He further excludes phylogenetic reconstruction from alpha taxonomy (pp. 365–366).|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E

5|$|Animals such as {{the fruit}} fly Drosophila melanogaster, the zebrafish, the chicken and the house mouse, serve {{a major role in}} science as {{experimental}} models, both in fundamental biological research, such as in <b>genetics,</b> <b>and</b> in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year.|$|E
5|$|Differences in songs, <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> {{morphology}} {{suggests that}} the Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. It {{is likely that the}} initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E
5|$|Economically, animals {{provide much}} of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of {{mechanised}} transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of}} the power used for work and transport.

5|$|Laboratory {{processes}} need {{to adhere}} to regulations, for example Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Good Laboratory Practice, and Food and Drug Administration specifications in the United States. Laboratory Information Management Systems help by tracking these processes. Regulation applies to both staff and supplies. , twelve US states require molecular pathologists to be licensed; several boards such as the American Board of Medical <b>Genetics</b> <b>and</b> the American Board of Pathology certify technologists, supervisors, and laboratory directors.|$|E
5|$|Medaka and {{zebrafish}} {{are used}} as research models for studies in <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> developmental biology.

5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, <b>genetics,</b> <b>and</b> molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of biology at the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> biochemistry. Molecular biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important to}} humans, as {{is shown by}} their depiction in art over the centuries.

5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} rare genetic condition, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, is self-harm and may include biting and head-banging. Genetics {{may contribute to the}} risk of developing other psychological conditions, such as anxiety or depression, which could in turn lead to self-harming behaviour. However, the link between <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The section {{summarizes}} {{the concepts of}} population genetics, a branch of evolutionary theory combining Mendelian <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> natural selection in mathematical form to explain the pressures on animal societies. In particular, altruism, self-sacrificing behaviour, would die out unless something such as kin or group selection maintains it.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{important}} to the study of molecular and cell biology as they provide simple systems {{that can be used to}} manipulate and investigate the functions of cells. The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about aspects of cell biology. For example, viruses have been useful in the study of <b>genetics</b> <b>and</b> helped our understanding of the basic mechanisms of molecular genetics, such as DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing, translation, protein transport, and immunology.|$|E
