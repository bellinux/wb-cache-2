By using three {{different types of}} shielding gas compositions during the alloying process, the study investigated the effects of modified shielding gas composition on the microstructure, hardness, and abrasive wear resistance of specimens. The most homogenous microstructure and the highest wear resistance was obtained in the gaseous environment which included 3 % of H 2. Increasing this rate to 5 % in the shielding gaseous composition caused gaps and pores in the microstructure and caused {{a decrease in the}} wear resistance. The x-ray examinations of the specimens identified ferro-molybdenum and <b>ferro-titanium</b> solid solutions, ferrit, austenite and martensite phases in their microstructure as the first phase and FeC, Cr 7 C 3, Cr 3 C 2, Fe 3 C, Fe 7 C 3, MoC and TiC phases as the second phase. As a result, it was concluded that changes in shielding gas composition in surface alloying process affected specimens ’ microstructure and abrasive wear properties...|$|E

In the coating treatment, steel samples were pre-boronized in a slurry salt bath consisting of borax, boric acid and ferro-silicon at 900 C for 2 h, then titanized by thermo-reactive deposition technique (TRD) in a powder mixture consisting of <b>ferro-titanium,</b> ammonium chloride, alumina and naphthalene at 1000 C for 14 h. The coated samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) and micro-hardness tests. Coated layer formed on the pre-boronized AISI 1040 steel was compact and homogeneous. X-ray studies showed that the phases formed on the steel surfaces are TiB 2, TiC, TiN and Fe 2 B. The depth of the coating layer ranged from 3. 41 ± 0. 47 µm to 6. 59 ± 0. 51 µm, depending on treatment time. A higher treatment time resulted in a thicker boro-titanized layer.

40|$|The Late Triassic-Early Jurassic {{volcanic}} {{succession of}} the Berrechid and Doukkala basins (Western Meseta, Morocco) comprises two lava flow fields. At the base, the Sidi Mohamed Larbi-Sidi Saïd Mâachou Formation {{is composed of}} 1 to 5 flows, while the upper Aïn Bouhachad Formation presents 1 or 2 flows. Lavas are mainly compound pahoehoe flows showing evidence of endogenous growth by inflation, suggesting slow emplacement during sustained eruptive episodes. Textures vary vertically in each lobe (fine to medium-grained intergranular, subophitic to ophitic in the lava core, and aphanitic to glomeroporphyritic in the lava crust). The mineralogy is typical of continental tholeiites: plagioclase, clinopyroxene (augite and pigeonite), and minor amounts of olivine and <b>ferro-titanium</b> oxides. The major and trace element concentrations and/or ratios of the two formations match, respectively, the compositions described elsewhere for the Lower and Intermediate formations of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from the Central High Atlas and Argana basin. © 2011 LNEG - Laboratório Nacional de Geologia e Energia, IP...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this work, some surface {{properties}} of AISI M 2 steel were improved by a thermo-reactive deposition process. Gas nitriding was realized on AISI M 2 steel at 550 °C for 2 h in an ammoniac atmosphere and then, titanizing treatment performed on pre-nitrided steel in the powder mixture consisting of <b>ferro-titanium,</b> ammonium chloride and alumina at 1000 °C for 1 - 4 h. Structural characterization of titanium nitride layer formed {{on the surface}} of AISI M 2 steel was carried out by using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The hardness measurements of titanium nitride layer were conducted under 10 g loads by using Vickers microhardness indenter. Structural analysis studies showed that titanium nitride layers formed on the AISI M 2 steel samples were smooth, compact and homogeneous. XRD analysis show that the coating layer formed on the steel samples includes TiN, Fe 6 Mo 7 N 2, C 0. 7 N 0. 3 Ti, C 0. 3 N 0. 7 Ti and V 2 N phases. The hardness of titanium nitride layers formed on the steel samples is between 2040 ± 186 and 2418 ± 291 HV 0. 01. The thickness of titanium nitride layer formed on the steel samples ranged from 3. 86 ± 0. 43 µm to 6. 13 ± 0. 47 µm, depending on treatment time...|$|E

The temperature used in theliquid phase sintering was chosen just above the three phase region, Fe-TiB 2 -liquid inthe phase diagram, to get an adequate densification of the samples. However, thetemperature could not be too high because of the internal stress and deformation thesamples would have been exposed to. After sintering the material properties and microstructure were examined throughPalmqvist indentations, Fargo and Transverse-Rupture-Strength tests and SEM studiesincluding EBSD. Through these tests the hardness was measured to 1323 HV and the microstructureconsidered to be fine with well distributed phases. The EBSD also showed that thebrittle Fe 2 B phase is present close to the TiB 2 grains and that the porosity givesunreliable results for the Fargo and TRS-tests.

40|$|Laser {{surfacing}} in {{the form}} of cladding, alloying, and modifications are gaining widespread use because of its ability to provide high deposition rates, low thermal distortion, and refined microstructure due to high solidification rates. Because of these advantages, laser surface alloying is considered a prime candidate for producing ultra-hard coatings through the establishment or in situ formation of composite structures. Therefore, a program was conducted by the Applied Research Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop the scientific and engineering basis for performing laser-based surface modifications involving the addition of hard particles, such as carbides, borides, and nitrides, within a metallic matrix for improved wear, fatigue, creep, and corrosion resistance. This has involved the development of advanced laser processing and simulation techniques, along with the refinement and application of these techniques for predicting and selecting materials and processing parameters for the creation of new surfaces having improved properties over current coating technologies. This program has also resulted {{in the form}}ulation of process and material simulation tools capable of examining the potential for the formation and retention of composite coatings and deposits produced using laser processing techniques, as well as positive laboratory demonstrations in producing these coatings. In conjunction with the process simulation techniques, the application of computational thermodynamic and kinetic models to design laser surface alloying materials was demonstrated and resulted in a vast improvement in the formulation of materials used for producing composite coatings. The methodology was used to identify materials and to selectively modify microstructures for increasing hardness of deposits produced by the laser surface alloying process. Computational thermodynamic calculations indicated {{that it was possible to}} induce the precipitation of titanium carbonitrides during laser surface alloying provided there was sufficient amount of dissolved titanium, carbon, and nitrogen in the liquid steel. This was confirmed experimentally by using a powder mixture of 431 -martensitic steel, titanium carbide powder, and nitrogen shielding, during laser deposition to produce deposits exhibiting relatively high hardness (average surface hardness of 724 HV). The same approach was extended to direct diode laser processing and similar microstructures were attained. The above analysis was extended to develop an in-situ precipitation of Ti(CN) during laser deposition. The Ti addition was achieving by mixing the 431 martensitic steel powders with <b>ferro-titanium.</b> The dissolution of nitrogen was achieved by using 100 % nitrogen shielding gas, which was indicated by thermodynamic analysis. Demonstrations were also conducted utilizing the tools developed during the program and resulted in several viable composite coating systems being identified. This included the use of TiC and <b>ferro-titanium</b> in martensitic-grade stainless steel matrix material with and without the use of active N 2 shielding gas, WC hard particles in a martensitic-grade stainless steel matrix material, WC and BN in a nickel-based matrix material, and WC in highly alloyed iron-based matrix. Although these demonstrations indicated the potential of forming composite coatings, in certain instances, the intended industrial applications involved unique requirements, such as coating of internal surfaces, which hindered the full development of the improved coating technology. However, it is believed that the addition of common hard particles, such as WC or TiC, to matrix material representing martensitic grades of stainless steel offer opportunities for improved performance at relatively low material cost...|$|E
