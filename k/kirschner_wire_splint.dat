40|$|Background: Besides early diagnosis, an {{anatomical}} {{and stable}} reduction is paramount for obtaining a favorable outcome. The current study {{looked at the}} influence {{that the type of}} approach for tarsometatarsal injuries has on the accuracy of the reduction and the effect that the type of fixation has on stability. Methods: Consecutive patients treated surgically for an acute Lisfranc injury were included. All radiographs were reassessed for accuracy and secondary displacement following either a closed or an open approach {{and in terms of the}} type of fixation (<b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires</b> alone or a combination of screws and plates and <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires).</b> A total of 28 patients were included. Six patients were treated with closed reduction and percutaneous fixation and 22 with open reduction internal fixation. Sixteen patients were treated with <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires</b> only (6 closed, 10 open), 7 with screws with or without <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires,</b> and 5 with medial plating with or without <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires.</b> Results: In the closed reduction group, 2 of 6 (33 %) reductions were considered acceptable versus 19 of 22 (86 %) in the open group (P =. 021). All 6 secondary displacements occurred in the <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> fixation group (37. 5 %) versus none in the rigid fixation group (P =. 024).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the optimum period for <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> fixation and cast immobilization for displaced lateral condylar fracture of the humerus in children. We retrospectively reviewed 12 patients with displaced lateral condyle humerus fracture, ranging in age from 3 - 9 y, with injuries that occurred between Jan 2005 and Dec 2006. All patients were treated with two <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> fixation and elbow immobilization. In all except 2 patients, the <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires</b> were maintained for 3 to 4 weeks. Mean time for union was 3. 78 weeks and mean humeroulnar arch motion at last review was 138. 7 degrees. Only one patient had a 5 degree increased carrying angle in valgus as compared to the non-injured side, and 50 % had prominent scars > 4 mm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the topographic anatomy of the percutaneous anatomical lateral ankle stabilization {{in relation to the}} neurovascular hindfoot structures. The study should serve as an aid for performance of this new minimally invasive technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven cadaver specimens were dissected exposing the nerves, vessels, ligaments and tendons. The portals and transosseous tunnels were performed with <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires.</b> All distances of the <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires</b> and the neurovascular structures were measured with reference to clearly identifiable bony landmarks. RESULTS: On the medial side the average distance of the <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> to the medial calcaneal branch of the tibial nerve was found to be 7 mm (SD± 4). The medial calcaneal branch was hit twice by the transosseous <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire.</b> On the lateral side the mean distance of the fibular exit point of the <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> to the sural nerve was 13 mm (SD± 4). The closest distance of the superficial peroneal nerve to the footprint of the ATFL averaged 11. 5 mm (SD± 3) and its anterior location in relation to the tip of the fibula was 28 mm (SD± 8). The posterior tibial artery was found at a mean distance of 41 mm from the perforating <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> (SD± 6). CONCLUSION: The current study introduced a novel percutaneous approach to treat chronic ankle instability that had minimal risk to neurovascular structures in a cadaver model.

30|$|In 2014, {{again in}} a non {{orthopaedic}} journal, this time the British Medical Journal, {{the results of the}} DRAFFT trial were published. The trial is a multicentre two arm parallel group assessor blind randomised controlled trial with 1 : 1 treatment allocation. It included 461 adults with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius within 3  cm of the radiocarpal joint, all requiring surgical fixation. Patients were excluded if the surgeon thought that the articular surface of the wrist joint was so badly displaced it required open reduction. Either humble <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> fixation was implemented, or the more modern fashionable expensive locking volar plates were used. Contrary to the existing literature, and against the rapidly increasing use of locking plate fixation, the trial found no difference in functional outcome in patients with dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius treated with <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires</b> or volar locking plates. <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> fixation, however, was cheaper and quicker to perform [4]. The DRAFFT trial has {{had a profound impact on}} English orthopaedic surgery, and has resulted in a marked change of practice. In the 5  years preceding the publication of the trial, 75 % of patients with the index fracture were treated with plate fixation, and 12 % with <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires.</b> After its publication, the proportion of patients having <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires</b> fixation rose to 42 %, with a concurrent fall in the proportion having plate fixation to 48 % [5].|$|R

Setting: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Liaquat University of Medical and health science, Hyderabad/ Jamshoro. Period: 1 st January 2016 to 31 st December 2016. Methods: 124 patients with Colles' fractures were taken for this study. For operative procedure all patients were operated under general anaesthesia. Close manipulating was done, reduction was checked under Image Intensifier and fracture were fixed with 2 cross k-wires, one starting from radial steroid {{and engaging in}} medial cortex of the radius and one from medial side of distal radius tip and engaging lateral cortex of radius. Functional outcome was assessed after 3 months and recorded on preformed proforma. Results: functional outcome of percutaneous <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> fixation for Colles' fracture was observed in 80. 65 % (100 / 124) cases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} and radiographic results from osteosynthesis of fractures of the lateral {{third of the}} clavicle, using two methods: T plates or anchors together with <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires.</b> METHODS: Fifteen patients of mean age 34. 3 years (range: 19 - 57) and mean follow-up 22. 7 months (range: 14 - 32) were evaluated. In nine cases, a T plate was used; and in six cases, coracoclavicular fixation was used with anchors in the coracoid process and <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires</b> through the acromioclavicular joint. The evaluation included the Constant score, personal satisfaction and radiographic assessment. RESULTS: Both types of treatment achieved consolidation in all cases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE Proximal femoral {{osteotomy}} with stable fixation {{and sufficient}} correction. Low complication rates due to exact preoperative planning. INDICATIONS Congenital or traumatic femoral neck pseudarthrosis. Coxa vara. CONTRAINDICATIONS None. In severe deformities, a single femoral osteotomy may {{not solve the}} problem; thus, additional correction, e. g., a pelvic osteotomy, is required. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Correct planning of the correction angle. Lateral approach. Subperiosteal detachment of vastus lateralis muscle. Place guide wire on the femoral neck to judge anteversion. Insert positioning wire 5 mm distal to trochanteric physis. Insert 2. 8 mm <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> in the femoral neck.

Material and methodsEleven extremities (six patients) with Buerger's disease were treated with the intramedullary <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> technique. Inclusion criteria were chronic critical ischemia, Rutherford Grade II or III, with major arterial occlusion shown by Doppler examination and angiography; failure to respond to non-surgical and surgical treatment; and the need for strong analgesics.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Simultaneous supracondylar humerus {{fracture}} and ipsilateral {{fracture of}} the proximal humerus in children is rare. Case presentation A 10 -year-old Turkish boy with an extension type supracondylar humerus fracture and ipsilateral fracture at the proximal metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction of the humerus was treated by closed reduction and percutaneous <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> fixation. Closed reduction was performed using a <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> as a "joystick" {{to manipulate the}} humeral shaft after some swelling occurred around the elbow and shoulder. Conclusion The combination of fractures at the proximal and distal parts of the humerus can be termed as "floating arm" injury. Initial treatment of this unusual injury should {{be focused on the}} supracondylar humerus fracture. However, closed reduction can be difficult to perform with the swelling around the elbow and shoulder.

40|$|We {{describe}} a {{case with the}} highly unusual complication of attritional ruptures to both the extensor tendons to the index and middle finger following <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> placements for a distal radial fracture. This particular complication has never been previously described in the literature. We also review the literature, identifying certain techniques {{in the management of}} distal radial fractures with <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires</b> which are considered to increase the risk of tendonous or neurovascular injury. Finally, recommendations are made that should reduce the complications of iatrogenic soft tissue injury associated with this very common procedure...|$|R
40|$|Anatomically, {{metacarpal}} fractures, when reduced, are not spontaneously stable. They require {{maintenance of}} this reduction {{because of the}} forces acting on the fragments. Closed methods of maintaining this reduction are ideal, but in selected cases, intramedullary fixation of the fracture, using the <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire,</b> gives excellent results. The method under consideration does not disturb the fracture site itself, the <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> being introduced “blind. ” Correct placement of the site of insertion of the wire, coupled with the rigid immobilization thus attained, gives excellent results in {{a high proportion of}} selected cases...|$|R
30|$|<b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> {{deployment}} {{represents the}} most critical phase of the procedure, thus often requiring expert operators and advanced imaging guidance such as combined CT/fluoroscopy (Fig.  7) or cone-beam CT.|$|R
30|$|The {{treatment}} of displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children by closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation has consistently given satisfactory results [6, 7, 19]. A crossed pin construct {{in the form}} of a lateral and medial pin fixation method as popularized by Swenson [13] has the advantage of better biomechanical stability, although iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury is possible with the medial pin. Conversely, a lateral pinning entry method has the advantage of avoiding ulnar nerve injury, but this construct has been thought to be less stable. Biomechanical studies have shown that a medially and laterally crossed <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> configuration is 25  % more rigid than three lateral pins and 37  % stronger than two parallel lateral pins [11]. Redisplacement of the fracture has been reported to be a significant complication after using lateral <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wires</b> alone [9, 12]. A lateral <b>Kirschner</b> <b>wire</b> configuration may not allow full extension of the elbow, and, thus, prevents examination of the carrying angle during surgery [14].|$|R
