50|$|An {{automated}} highway system (AHS) or Smart Road is a proposed intelligent transportation system technology designed to provide for driverless cars on specific rights-of-way. It is most often recommended {{as a means of}} traffic congestion relief, {{on the grounds that it}} would drastically reduce <b>following</b> <b>distances</b> and headway, thus allowing a given stretch of road to carry more cars.|$|R
50|$|To further {{increase}} fuel economy, a 3.5L V6 {{became the}} base engine {{with the introduction}} of a 2.7L EcoBoost twin-turbo V6 alongside the 3.5L version; the 5.0L V8 remained available. The 2015 F-150 is the first pickup truck with adaptive cruise control, which uses radar sensors {{on the front of the}} vehicle to maintain a set <b>following</b> <b>distance</b> between it and the vehicle ahead of it, decreasing speed if necessary.|$|E
50|$|Peloton Technology uses 5.9 GHz DSRC to {{establish}} Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications between pairs of trucks. Combined with commercially-available radar-based forward collision avoidance systems on each truck, this allows two trucks {{to operate with}} a shorter minimum safe <b>following</b> <b>distance.</b> The result is that trucks are able to platoon, improving aerodynamics to reduce fuel consumption. This implementation of these technologies together {{for the purpose of}} maintaining a constant gap between vehicles is sometimes referred to as Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{elements}} of a vehicle traffic flow simulator are presented as a basis to model and improve traffic light control strategies. Traffic control simulators have been described (Haight 1963, Paal 1975, and Reitman 1971) for hardware using assembler and FORTRAN. This simulator is written in C, uses onesecond, discrete time steps for the traffic light controller agent and the simulation of vehicle movement. Vehicle movement is simulated with realistic velocity and acceleration limits and is constrained by minimum <b>following</b> <b>distances.</b> The speed limits on each lane are user specified and vehicles do not exceed these limits. The traffic environment occurs in a user defined grid of east-west and north-south streets. The simulator is fairly realistic: vehicles are stopped at red lights, vehicles maintain safe <b>following</b> <b>distances,</b> and the physics of motion of the traveling vehicles are closely approximated. Cars are inserted in the network with their starting and destinat...|$|R

2500|$|Since July 1, 2006, the Freeway and Expressway Traffic Control Regulation (...) {{applies the}} same traffic rules on the freeways to the expressways, {{including}} the same prohibited traffic and <b>following</b> <b>distances.</b> While motorcycles remain generally {{banned from the}} expressways, Article 19 of the Freeway and Expressway Traffic Control Regulation makes it officially possible to allow a motorcycle with a cylinder capacity of more than 550cm3 on certain expressways subject to the following restrictions: ...|$|R
50|$|Other {{options include}} power {{adjustable}} pedal, in which pedal positions {{can be adjusted}} to suit the drivers' driving posture and {{the position of the}} pedals, steering wheel and driver’s seat are memorized. There is also an electric rear sunshade and a radar cruise control system to ensure a safe <b>following</b> <b>distance</b> to the car ahead in correspondence to the traveling speed. All these are standard equipment. Also included are the Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system, ABS, and high intensity discharge HID headlamps.|$|E
50|$|ACC systems, {{like human}} drivers, may not exhibit string stability. This means that {{oscillations}} which are introduced into a traffic flow - by braking and accelerating vehicles - may be amplified in the upstream direction. This leads to so-called phantom traffic jams (in the best case) or head-tail collisions (in the worst case). It {{has been shown}} that ACC systems designed to maintain a fixed <b>following</b> <b>distance</b> will not be string stable. ACC systems designed to maintain a fixed following time {{may or may not be}} string stable.|$|E
50|$|The United States National Safety Council {{suggests}} that a three-second rule -- with increases of one second per factor of driving difficulty -- is more appropriate. Factors that make driving more difficult include poor lighting conditions (dawn and dusk are the most common); inclement weather (ice, rain, snow, fog, etc.), adverse traffic mix (heavy vehicles, slow vehicles. impaired drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, etc.), and personal condition (fatigue, sleepiness, drug-related loss of response time, distracting thoughts, etc.). For example, a fatigued driver piloting a car in rainy weather at dusk {{would do well to}} observe a six-second <b>following</b> <b>distance,</b> rather than the basic three-second gap.|$|E
