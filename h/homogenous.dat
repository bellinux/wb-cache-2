5|$|Although {{there are}} several {{historic}} religious communities in Belgrade, the religious makeup {{of the city is}} relatively <b>homogenous.</b> The Serbian Orthodox community is by far the largest, with 1,475,168 adherents. There are also 31,914 Muslims, 13,720 Roman Catholics, and 3,128 Protestants. There once was a significant Jewish community in Belgrade, but following the World War II Nazi occupation of the city, and subsequent Jewish emigration, their numbers have fallen from over 10,000 to just 295.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species <b>homogenous</b> yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the village}} of Borovo Selo, {{situated}} on the right bank of the Danube opposite Serbia, {{was a part of}} the Vukovar municipality. While the city of Vukovar itself had an ethnically mixed population (47.2 percent Croats and 32.2 percent Serbs), smaller settlements in the area were more <b>homogenous.</b> Fourteen were predominantly populated by Croats, ten (including Borovo Selo) by Serbs, two by Ruthenians and the remaining two were ethnically mixed.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of two populations of {{particles in the}} main ring explains why its appearance depends on the viewing geometry. The dust scatters light preferably in the forward direction and forms a relatively thick <b>homogenous</b> ring bounded by the orbit of Adrastea. In contrast, large particles, which scatter in the back direction, are confined {{in a number of}} ringlets between the Metidian and Adrastean orbits.|$|E
5|$|The sheep {{industry}} in Spain was {{an instance of}} migratory flock management, with large <b>homogenous</b> flocks ranging over the entire country. The management model used in England was quite different but had a similar importance to economy of the country. Up until the early 20th century, owling (the smuggling of sheep or wool out of the country) was a punishable offense, {{and to this day}} the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords sits on a cushion known as the Woolsack.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. Spores are {{elliptic}} (or narrowly so), and measure 8–12 by 4.8–6.2µm. There are clamp connections {{present in the}} hyphae. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 23–30 by 8–10µm. The hymenium lacks cystidia. The cap flesh comprises <b>homogenous,</b> interwoven hyphae that are 3–5µm in diameter, while the cap cuticle is a 200–300-micrometer thick layer of interwoven, gelatinous hyphae up to 4µm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} {{characteristics}} of each building that are distinctly English, these cathedrals {{are marked by}} their architectural diversity, both {{from one to another}} and also within each individual building. This is much more the case than in the medieval cathedrals of Northern France, for example, where the cathedrals and large abbeys form a relatively <b>homogenous</b> group and the architectural development can easily be traced from building to building.|$|E
5|$|As {{world opinion}} {{hardened}} against South Africa during the 1960s because of apartheid, international governing bodies in various sports introduced boycotts of South African teams and athletes. Until 1976, non-whites were legally {{barred from the}} South Africa cricket team, and, as the law required matches to be racially <b>homogenous,</b> this also applied to visiting squads. The South African government provoked overseas ire in 1968 when it refused entry to the England cricket team because its proposed tour party included Basil D'Oliveira, a Cape Coloured. Amid the ensuing scandal, Marylebone Cricket Club (which then governed English cricket) called off the tour. Two years later, a tour of England by the South Africa cricket team was cancelled by the English Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) at a week's notice following public protests and immense pressure from the UK government. South Africa did not play another official international cricket match until 1991.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there {{does not seem to have}} been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not <b>homogenous,</b> but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{immediately}} after the outbreak of war, parties of white Southern Rhodesians paid their own way to England to join the British Army. Most Southern Rhodesians {{who served in the}} war enlisted in this way and fought on the Western Front, taking part in many of the major battles with an assortment of British, South African and other colonial units, most commonly the King's Royal Rifle Corps, which recruited hundreds of men from the colony, and created <b>homogenous</b> Rhodesian platoons. Troopers from Southern Rhodesia became renowned on the Western Front for their marksmanship, a result of their frontier lifestyle. Some of the colony's men served in the Royal Flying Corps, one of the two predecessors of the Royal Air Force. The Rhodesia Regiment, the Rhodesia Native Regiment and the British South Africa Police served in the African theatre of the conflict, contributing to the South-West African and East African campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The far-infrared (24–70μm) and {{submillimeter}} (70–500μm) photometry {{performed by}} Spitzer and Herschel telescopes {{revealed that the}} surface of Makemake is not homogeneous. Although the majority of it is covered by nitrogen and methane ices, where the albedo ranges from 78 to 90%, there are small patches of dark terrain whose albedo is only 2 to 12%, and that make up 3–7% of the surface. These studies were made before S/2015 (136472) 1 was discovered; thus, these small dark patches may actually have been the dark surface of the satellite rather than any actual surface features on Makemake. However, another experiment has refuted these studies. Between 2006 and 2013, the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo acquired new visible and near infra-red spectra for Makemake that covered nearly 80% of its surface; this {{study found that the}} variation in the spectra were negligible, suggesting that Makemake's surface may indeed be <b>homogenous.</b>|$|E
5|$|The four Sachsen-class {{ships were}} {{transferred}} to the II Division before the winter cruise of 1894–1895, following {{the completion of the}} four s. The German fleet now possessed two <b>homogenous</b> squadrons of four ships each. The two divisions steamed to Orkney and the Shetland Islands in the spring of 1895. Bayern joined a massive fleet review on 21 July 1895 for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, which connected Kiel to the North Sea. The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high-seas battle between the I and II Divisions in the North Sea, followed by combined maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} fleet in the Baltic.|$|E

25|$|The Inuit group shares {{an average}} {{inclination}} of 46°. Their orbits are widely dispersed (Δv ≈ 350nbsp&m/s) {{but they are}} physically <b>homogenous,</b> sharing a light red colouring.|$|E
25|$|The Carme group shares {{an average}} {{inclination}} of 165°. It is dynamically tight (5 < Δv < 50nbsp&m/s). It is very <b>homogenous</b> in colour, each member displaying light red colouring {{consistent with a}} D-type asteroid progenitor.|$|E
25|$|The Gallic group shares {{an average}} {{inclination}} of 34°. Their orbits are dynamically tight (Δv ≈ 50nbsp&m/s), {{and they are}} light red in colour; the colouring is <b>homogenous</b> at both visible and near infra-red wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|The “Nationality Laws” came as corollaries to the “Fundamental Articles.” They created {{administrative}} areas {{which would}} be nationally <b>homogenous.</b> Furthermore, the Czech and German languages would become the official languages for all functions pertaining to all of Bohemia.|$|E
25|$|Recent studies, {{based on}} a larger data set, {{indicate}} the cut-off inclination of 12° (instead of 5°) between the cold and hot populations and confirm {{the distinction between the}} <b>homogenous</b> red cold population and the bluish hot population.|$|E
25|$|Most outcome {{research}} {{is carried out}} using time-limited therapy with diagnostically <b>homogenous</b> groups. However, long-term intensive interactional group psychotherapy assumes diverse and diagnostically heterogeneous group membership, and an open-ended time scale for therapy. Good outcomes have also been demonstrated for this form of group therapy.|$|E
25|$|Few {{organizations}} have a completely <b>homogenous,</b> seamless system environment. There is typically {{a mix of}} ERPs or multiple instances of one ERP, mainframe systems, off-the-shelf applications, and legacy systems—all of which may contain valuable data. Technology is available to access all of this data to gain a complete picture.|$|E
25|$|For many years, polarizable MD {{simulations}} {{have been}} {{touted as the}} next generation. For <b>homogenous</b> liquids such as water, increased accuracy has been achieved through the inclusion of polarizability. Some promising results have also been achieved for proteins. However, it is still uncertain how to best approximate polarizability in a simulation.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrian {{national}} {{question was}} taken to Geneva by the Assyrian Patriarch Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII again when he addressed the Permanent Mandate Commission meeting and urged the council to fulfill its obligations toward the Assyrian Nation. The League yet again granted the Assyrians their rights of <b>homogenous</b> community in Iraq with a local autonomy.|$|E
25|$|Dry {{statistics}} that confirm Knighton's slow growth {{since the early}} nineteenth century. The 2001 Census provides a snapshot of Knighton today and allows comparisons with the county and Wales as a whole. Knightononians {{are less likely to}} describe their identity as Welsh, compared with other parts of Wales. It is also more <b>homogenous</b> and enjoys higher rates of employment.|$|E
25|$|Expanded worldview: TCKs have an {{understanding}} {{that there is more}} than one way to look at situations that they are exposed to or experience. This can also be a challenge however, when third culture individuals return to a culture that is <b>homogenous</b> in their belief system, as an expanded worldview is perceived as offensive or useless.|$|E
25|$|Caused by {{characteristic}} behaviour of {{the phase}} space trajectory, a recurrence plot contains typical small-scale structures, as single dots, diagonal lines and vertical/horizontal lines (or {{a mixture of}} the latter, which combines to extended clusters). The large-scale structure, also called texture, can be visually characterised by <b>homogenous,</b> periodic, drift or disrupted. The visual appearance of an RP gives hints about {{the dynamics of the}} system.|$|E
25|$|The College of Cardinals was {{generally}} {{divided into two}} blocs: curial, pro-Jesuit (zelanti) and political, anti-Jesuit. The first one was formed by the Italian curial cardinals who opposed the secular influences on the Church. The second one included crown-cardinals of the Catholic courts. These two blocs were in no way <b>homogenous.</b> Zelanti were divided into moderate and radical factions. The anti-Jesuit bloc was divided into several national groups with different interests.|$|E
25|$|Molecules are the {{smallest}} particles into which a non-elemental substance {{can be divided}} while maintaining the physical properties of the substance. Each type of molecule corresponds to a specific chemical compound. Molecules are a composite {{of two or more}} atoms. See list of compounds for a list of molecules. A molecule is generally combined in a fixed proportion. It is the most basic unit of matter and is <b>homogenous.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lateral earth {{pressures}} are zero {{at the top}} of the wall and – in <b>homogenous</b> ground – increase proportionally to a maximum value at the lowest depth. Earth pressures will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed. Also, any groundwater behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes hydrostatic pressure on the wall. The total pressure or thrust may be assumed to act at one-third from the lowest depth for lengthwise stretches of uniform height.|$|E
25|$|The {{ganzfeld}} {{was originally}} introduced into experimental psychology {{due to the}} experiments of the German psychologist Wolfgang Metzger (1899–1979) on the perception of a <b>homogenous</b> visual field. In the early 1970s, Charles Honorton had been investigating ESP and dreams at the Maimonides Medical Center and began using the ganzfeld technique to achieve a state of sensory deprivation in which he hypothesised that psi could work. Honorton believed that by reducing the ordinary sensory input, psi conductive states may be enhanced and psi-mediated information could be transmitted.|$|E
25|$|In addition, even if {{the claim}} of a <b>homogenous</b> celebration of the Byzantine Rite could be claimed for the modern period, this has {{historically}} not been the case. During the period of separation of the Eastern and Western Churches, {{it would have been}} impossible to speak of the Byzantine Rite as being the only liturgy in use, even in the Eastern Church. The Rite of Constantinople only acquired dominance in the Eastern Church through a slow process that was not complete until at least the thirteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Point {{mutations}} {{have been}} observed in the coding and non-coding region of the mtDNA contained in cancer cells. In individuals with bladder, head/neck and lung cancers, the point mutations within the coding region show signs of resembling each other. This suggests that when a healthy cell transforms into a tumor cell (a neoplastic transformation) the mitochondria seem to become <b>homogenous.</b> Abundant point mutations located within the non-coding region, D-loop, of the cancerous mitochondria suggest that mutations within this region might be an important characteristic in some cancers.|$|E
25|$|By the 20th century, Muscadet {{began to}} fall out of favor in the global wine market and earned a {{reputation}} for being <b>homogenous</b> and simple. The late 20th century saw a revival in the Muscadet region as ambitious wine producers experimented with new winemaking techniques aimed at bringing out more flavor and complexity in the wine. The 1980s saw a rise in use of oak barrel fermentation and lees stirring while the 1990s introduced the widespread use of extended skin-contact (maceration) prior to fermentation. By the 20th century, the use of these techniques created a wide range of styles and quality of Muscadet wine.|$|E
25|$|In {{analysis}} of biological systems, Inorganic salts, {{which are also}} part of protein extracts, interfere with the ionization process. The salts can be removed by solid phase extraction or by washing the dried-droplet MALDI spots with cold water. Both methods can also remove other substances from the sample. The matrix-protein mixture is not <b>homogenous</b> because the polarity difference leads to a separation of the two substances during co-crystallization. The spot diameter of the target is much larger than that of the laser, which makes it necessary to make many laser shots at different places of the target, to get the statistical average of the substance concentration within the target spot.|$|E
25|$|In total 39-36% of 399-458 sampled Slovenian males {{belong to}} Y-DNA Haplogroup R1a, more {{frequent}} than in South Slavic peoples, constituting 41% {{in the capital}} region and greater in some regions. Slovenian population displays close genetic affiliations with West Slavic populations. The <b>homogenous</b> genetic strata of the West Slavic populations and the Slovenian population suggest {{the existence of a}} common ancestral Slavic population in central European region. The M458 branch constitutes 4%, while the dominant clade is Z280, specifically its R1a-CTS3402 clade, {{the same as that of}} their Slavic and not Slavic neighbours. The Z92 branch of Z280 which is significant among East Slavs is recorded as completely absent among Slovenes.|$|E
25|$|The {{religious}} and cultural definition requires Pashtuns to be Muslim and adhere to Pashtunwali codes. This is the most prevalent view among orthodox and conservative tribesmen, who refuse to recognise any non-Muslim as a Pashtun. Pashtun intellectuals and academics, however, {{tend to be more}} flexible and sometimes define who is Pashtun based on other criteria. Pashtun society is not <b>homogenous</b> by religion: the overwhelming majority of them are Sunni, with a tiny Shia community (the Turi and partially the Bangash tribe) in the Kurram and Orakzai agencies of FATA, Pakistan. Pakistani Jews and Afghan Jews, have largely relocated to Israel and the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{scarcity}} of archaeological evidence for Roman glass-making facilities {{has resulted in}} the use of chemical compositions as evidence for production models, as the division of production indicates that any variation is related to differences in raw glass making. However, the Roman reliance on natron from Wadi El Natrun as a flux, has resulted in a largely <b>homogenous</b> composition in the majority of Roman glasses. Despite the publication of major analyses, comparisons of chemical analyses produced by different analytical methods have only recently been attempted, and although there is some variation in Roman glass compositions, meaningful compositional groups have been difficult to establish for this period.|$|E
