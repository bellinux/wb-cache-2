40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} aimed at a {{comparison}} of tine and disc cultivators by several parameters which are most affecting {{the quality of a}} soil cultivation, and in the effect of the epigeic fauna, represented by ground beetles (Carabidae). Experiment was carried out twice during the season (after a harvest of wheat and rape) while soil was being cultivated with <b>disc</b> <b>cultivator</b> Lemken Rubin or tine cultivator Horsch Tiger. The experiment was carried out on the fields of ZD "Vysočina" Zbýšov and measured parameters were: plant residue decomposition, cultivation depth, diameter of aggregates, weed infestation and crop plant emergence, and abundance of ground beetles. Using the statistic tests, it was found, that almost every parameter describing the quality of the cultivation was influenced by the type of the cultivator. Tine cultivator had a higher decomposition of plant residues. This difference was more obvious when cultivating the field after rape harvest (P < 0. 001) than field after wheat harvest (P < 0. 01). Tine cultivator was more precise with keeping the cultivation depth as planned. <b>Disc</b> <b>cultivator</b> had a higher crumbling capacity. At the higher speed the machines were more inclining {{to come out of the}} ground at higher speeds (P < 0. 05). A cultivation had a very negative influence on Carabidae population. On a rape stubble there was a 193 specimens caught in traps before the cultivation with two dominant species - Pseudoophonus rufipes and Pterostichus melanarius. Only 41 specimens was found in the traps after the cultivation...|$|E
40|$|Because of fuel consumption, {{machinery}} and labor costs, tillage involves high expenses. In {{a project that}} {{was carried out in}} the autumn of 2001 and 2002, energy consumption and draught were studied for three tillage implements on a lighter and a heavier soil under wet, moist and dry conditions. Furthermore, aggregate size distribution and energy requirement for fracturing the soil were measured. The tillage implements used were mouldboard plough, chisel plough and <b>disc</b> <b>cultivator.</b> The effects of driving speed and depth of tillage were also studied. Soil strength was measured with both a penetrometer and a shear vane apparatus. The tractor used was a Valmet 6600 (100 hp) with equipment for measuring fuel consumption. The equipment was calibrated to give the PTO effect for any combination of fuel consumption and engine speed, and this was assumed to be the same as the effect available at the tractor wheels. The “tow bar power” was calculated by subtraction of power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. Average actual working depth was calculated by measuring bulk density before tillage and then weighing the cultivated soil. On the basis of the tillage depth and PTO effect measurements, it was possible to calculate energy requirement per kg cultivated soil and specific draught. The latter is defined as force per cross sectional area cultivated soil [kN/m 2]. After sieving samples of the cultivated soil, the approximate surface area of the fragmented soil and the energy requirement for fracturing were computed. Specific draught was lowest for the mouldboard plough, while the highest values were obtained for the chisel plough. Specific draught decreased with increasing soil water content. The lowest values of energy requirement for fracturing were measured under moist conditions for all tillage implements, and the <b>disc</b> <b>cultivator</b> produced the highest fracturing in relation to energy input. Both specific draught and energy requirement for fracturing were lower for the lighter soil. With the <b>disc</b> <b>cultivator,</b> specific draught increased with working depth, while depth had no influence on specific draught when the mouldboard plough was used. Some of these differences can be explained by differences in geometry between the tools. There was a tendency for specific draught to increase with increased driving speed. This was most obvious on the lighter soil and for the mouldboard plough. The increased draught can be explained by a higher acceleration of soil particles and by increased soil strength because of higher deformation rate. Soil strength and thereby draught requirement differed between soils and moisture contents. There was a strong correlation between soil cohesion and draught requirement, and cohesion was easily measured in the field with a shear vane. The penetrometer measurements did not correlate with draught measurements. Specific draught was lowest for the mouldboard plough. When considering the overall results of tillage, no one implement can be identified as being the most effective. Tillage at water content close to the plastic limit seems to be a good compromise as regards draught requirement and tillage result...|$|E

40|$|Preliminary {{results show}} that there is room for {{improvement}} within existing control methods of couch grass (Elymus repens (L.) Gould). It may be possible {{to reduce the number of}} stubble cultivations during autumn by timing the treatment, and to reduce the cultivation depth by using a goose foot cultivator (5 cm) instead of a <b>disc</b> <b>cultivator</b> (10 cm), without sacrificing couch grass control efficiency. The first year of the experiment, the use of a goose foot cultivator resulted in less nitrogen leaching than cultivation by disc. A reduced number of stubble cultivations potentially reduces nutrient loss, fuel consumption and the workload of the farmer. Our experiments with cover crops to control couch grass in cereals has yet to prove significant effects on couch grass control, but cover crops combined with goose foot hoeing did reduce nitrogen leaching by more than a third compared to cultivation by disc. Further data is necessary to see if the system can be used to effectively control couch grass without significant yield losses. Regardless, it can reduce nitrogen leaching and potentially provide other ecosystem services, e. g. control weeds other than couch grass. ...|$|E

Measuring was undertaken in viticulture region of South Moravia, at two experimental sites in Mikulov district. Soil surface between rows of vines is managed by regular cultivation (plow, <b>disc</b> <b>cultivator)</b> to a depth of 30 – 70 mm {{in the form of a}} black fallow. On each of vineyards is used a different type of energy resource to carry out working operations – New Holland TN 75 V, a multifunction carrier PELLENC OPTIMUM. While driving in between vine rows, the two machines in completely different tracks, which significantly influences the properties of the soil and its consolidation. The soil samples were analyzed for determining the soil structure, physical and chemical properties, whereby evaluated were also the mechanical properties of the soil profile in the inter-row using Penetrometry. The average structural coefficient in both variants ranged from 0. 96 to 2. 42. Soil with values ​​lower than 1. 0 is below the structural stability, thus reducing the quality of the soil environment in terms of both physical and chemical properties. The resulting values ​​of density of the soil at both sites are between 1. 35 to 1. 52 g. cm− 3, which also shows its unsatisfactory condition. Penetration resistance of soil located in the tire tracks on both sites values ​​from 2. 7 to 2. 9 MPa, which according to the scale of classes determined by (Arshad, 1996), corresponds with high values.

Farm mechanization has helped in increasing the cultivated area and yield of major crops like wheat, rice and maize to 0. 4 %, 10. 4 % and 27. 3 %, respectively, by bringing barren land under cultivation. To study the present status of farm mechanization in all the districts of Punjab using GIS, data of farm machines, sowing area and wheat crop production was collected from Census Organizations for 1994 - 95 to 2004 - 05.

40|$|Reduced tillage is {{interesting}} in many points of views and improved soil structure {{is a factor}} of great importance. In reduced tillage the labour intensive mouldboard plough is often replaced by <b>disc</b> or spring-tine <b>cultivators.</b> Tillage systems affect several soil properties, both biological and physical. Reduced tillage is often shown to improve soil structure and the method has in Sweden been best suited on strongly structured heavy clays. Weakly structured soils needs more loosening and reduced tillage has not been that successful on these types of soils. It can take several years with reduced tillage before the positive effects becomes beneficial. Measurements on soil properties affecting crop growth has been studied in field trials in south of Sweden on two farms. The randomized block designed trials consist of four tillage systems and they are listed as: (A 1) reduced tillage (15 cm), (A 2) reduced tillage (5 - 7 cm), (B) conventional ploughing (20 - 22 cm) and (C) shallow ploughing (12 - 15 cm). Measurements of dry bulk density, infiltration, penetration resistance and root development were performed under {{spring and early summer}} 2008. Furthermore preferential flow was studied with the dye tracer Brilliant Blue FCF using high resolution images. The measurements showed that the difference between the different tillage methods generally was small. The differences between ploughed and non-ploughed plots were more pronounced than between tillage depths. Dry bulk density in the topsoil does not always increase when conventional plough is replaced by reduced tillage systems. Increased tillage depth did not affect the penetration resistance in the non-ploughed plots. The ploughed plots generally had lower penetration resistance than the non ploughed plots and the shallow ploughed plot resulted in higher penetration resistance compared to the deep ploughed plots. On Charlottenlund root development was significantly higher in the non-ploughed plots which {{is interesting}} compared to other studies that have found higher root development in ploughed plots. Infiltration in the top soil was generally higher in the ploughed plots. At the depth of the plough pan the infiltration was higher in non-ploughed plots at Väby but no differences were found at Charlottenlund. The dye tracer experiment showed that there were no differences between ploughed and non-ploughed plots. The four different tillage methods did not significantly affect crop yields on Charlottenlund and Väby in 200...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{effects of}} any tillage method on soil properties, depends on {{location}} (soil, water and air) {{and the number}} of (years) their implementation. Soil compaction reduces yield through increased soil mechanical resistance against root growth and lower water and nutrient use efficiency (Gamda et al. 18 & Ishagh et al 23). Soil surface and sub surface compaction both reduce yield due to limited root growth and plant potassium uptake (Doulan et al. 14). Sabt et al. (50) reported that in the study area, which the lands are mostly illite clay (high specific surface area) with sufficient nitrogen, soil potassium is the most important limiting factor for the growth of wheat. Considering the point that loess soils in Golestan Province have a high specific surface area,they can provide potassium for plants to produce crop, but for a higher production, potassium fertilizers should be used. Previous studies indicated that production of wheat is limited due to potassium deficiency (4, 49, 54 and 57). In these soils with a high specific surface area, the speed of movement of potassium from the soil solution is low, and doing solimits wheat yield. In loess soils containing high illite and high specific surface area (eg, soilsin the series of Rahmat Abad of Gorgan), ammonium acetate measured potassium on exchange and solution surfaces, which is highly correlated with grain yield (54). There is a high correlation between grain yield with overload of potassium and Na TPB extraction (57). The aim {{of this study was to}} absorb potassium (limiting factor for plant growth) with different tillage systemsat different depths. International recommendations towards reducing the depth and intensity of tillage (from minimum tillage to no-tillage) in order to reduce erosion and oxidation of organic substances plays an important role in determining the amount of greenhouse gases. If potassium absorption does not reduceafter reducing tillage intensity,low or no-tillage methods are preferred. Otherwise no choice but to continue conventional tillage. The second objective is to assess the effects of the treatments (different tillage systems) on the growth and size of the roots and to predict nutrient uptake by plants. Materials and Methods: This research was a field experiment during 2009 - 2010 in estates of Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources (Seyed Miran Area) with 5 treatments and 4 replications which used completely randomized block design. Treatments were 5 tillage methods including moldboard-ploughing (20 - 25 cm depth) followed by disking, rotivator (12 - 17 cm depth), disking (8 - 10 cm depth), chisel (25 - 30 cm depth) and no-tillage. Row spacing, distance between seeds in a rowand the amount of seeding was 20 cm 1. 5 cm and 268. 5 kg ha respectively (planting was done by hands). The consumption of fertilizers based on soil test results and the results reported by other researchers were added to the soil surface before planting (54). In all treatments, 350 kg per hectare of ammonium phosphate and 200 kg of potassium sulfate before planting and by hands were added. For treated moldboard,rotary <b>cultivator,</b> <b>disc</b> and chisel were used, and for no-tillage system by disc plow and sweep were used. Main parameters measured were soil mechanical resistance at 6 stages during wheat growth using a cone penetrometer (0 - 8 cm soil depth), soil potassium at two stages during plant growth (before heading and harvest) using sodium tetraphenyl boron(12), ammonium acetate(28) and ammonium nitrate as extractents and using potassium surface excess(8) determination method and also bulk soil solution potassium concentration(2). Yield of wheat and its components were also determined at harvest. Data analysis include the analysis of variance and mean comparisons using LSD and correlations which carried out using SAS software. Results and Discussion: Results show there was a significant difference between treatments with respect to extractible soil potassium using sodium tetraphenyl boron at 5 percent level and ammonium acetate at 1 percent level, both before wheat heading. Soil potassium content did not differ significantly in this stage when potassium excess method was used. With all methods of soil potassium determination, soil potassium did not differ significantly at harvest. Soil potassium with moldboard-ploughing was less than all other tillage methods at before plant heading. Thomas et al. (55) and Martin Rhoda et al. (40) also stated that soil potassium was greater with no-tillage method. Lopez Phando & Pardo. (34) similarly stated that soil potassium with no-tillage method was greater than moldboard ploughing. According to results of the current experiment, soil mechanical resistance was further reduced as tillage intensity was increased. Soil mechanical resistance with moldboard ploughing was less than other tillage methods between early heading stage and harvest. Lower mechanical resistance with increased tillage intensity increased root growth and soil potassium uptake by wheat grain and straw, leading to greater yield production in accordance with results by Fakori (16). Conclusions Soil tillage with moldboard ploughing reduced mechanical resistance, increased root density (and possibly soil-root contact surface area) and soil potassium uptake which results a greater wheat head density and yield and also a lower soil potassium with different methods (potassium excess determination and bulk soil solution potassium concentration methods and also using soidium tetraphenyl boron, ammonium acetate extractants) at before heading which is the stage for maximal growth and nutrient accumulation rate. Soil extractants maybe used for plant nutrient uptake and yield predictions in a plant canopy, when plant nutrient uptake has a positive significant correlation with soil potassium and treatments do not affect root growth and the mentioned correlation...|$|R
