40|$|In present research, {{the effects}} of light quality on {{micropropagation}} of gerbera were investigated. The MS medium containing 1 mg L - 1 BAP and 0. 1 mg L - 1 NAA was used in proliferation stage and the MS medium containing 0. 05 mg L - 1 IBA was used in rooting stage of the study. Cultured plants were grown in cabinets illuminated with red, <b>blue,</b> <b>daylight</b> LED <b>lamps</b> separately and their various mixtures. Cool white fluorescent lamp was used as control treatment in the study. The highest ratio of explant with new shoots, the number of shoots per explant and shoot length values were obtained from cool white fluorescent lamps (90 %, 5. 35 shoots and 2. 63 cm, respectivey), 100 % <b>blue</b> LED <b>lamp</b> (95 %, 5. 24 shoots and 2. 40 cm, respectively), 100 % cool white LED lamp (90 %, 4. 18 shoots and 2. 21 cm, respectively) and 70 % red + 30 % <b>blue</b> LED <b>lamp</b> treatments (80 %, 4. 14 shoots and 2. 21 cm, respectively) in the proliferation stage of the study. These treatments also yielded the highest values in terms of plant fresh and dry weight. While the highest rooting percentage (75 %) was obtained from 100 % cool white LED light treatment, {{the differences between the}} treatments except for 100 % red LED light were not significant. Rooted plants were successfully acclimatized to outdoor conditions with 84 % survival rate in peat + perlite mixture (2 : 1) ...|$|R
