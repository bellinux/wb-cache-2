5|$|Albertosaurus is {{a member}} of the {{theropod}} family Tyrannosauridae, in the subfamily Albertosaurinae. Its closest relative is the slightly older Gorgosaurus libratus (sometimes called Albertosaurus libratus; see below). These two species are the only described albertosaurines; other undescribed species may exist. Thomas Holtz found Appalachiosaurus to be an albertosaurine in 2004, but his more recent unpublished work locates <b>it</b> <b>just</b> outside Tyrannosauridae, in agreement with other authors.|$|E

5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct <b>it</b> <b>just</b> prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E

The book covered topics such as her family, childhood years, wrestling career, relationship with Matt Hardy, and her neck surgery and subsequent rehabilitation.

5|$|The 55 Cancri {{system is}} located fairly {{close to the}} Solar System: the Hipparcos {{astrometry}} satellite measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 81.03 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 12.3 parsecs (40.3 light years). 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making <b>it</b> <b>just</b> {{visible to the naked}} eye under very dark skies. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of 1065 AU (one thousand times the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail {{station is}} officially named London Paddington, a name {{commonly}} used outside London but rarely by Londoners, who call <b>it</b> <b>just</b> Paddington, {{as on the}} London Underground map. This same practice applies to all the London mainline rail termini, except London Bridge. Parts of the station, including the main train shed, date from 1854, when it was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the London terminus for the Great Western Railway (GWR). It is one of nineteen stations managed by Network Rail.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in the United Kingdom on 8 July 1999 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 8 September 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Rowling found the book easy to write, finishing <b>it</b> <b>just</b> a year after she had begun writing it. The book sold 68,000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom and since has sold over three million in the country. The book won the 1999 Whitbread Children's Book Award, the Bram Stoker Award, the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, and was short-listed for other awards, including the Hugo.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing <b>it</b> <b>just</b> prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} specified {{a budget}} of £25,000 (previously figures of both £5,000 and £100,000 had been discussed), and the conditions of entry stated that the memorial was to be situated {{at the entrance to}} Government House on the corner of King William Street and North Terrace, placing <b>it</b> <b>just</b> behind the existing memorial to the South African War. This location was counter to previous suggestions: a 1919 survey of architects had proposed that the memorial should be built on Montefiore Hill, while in 1923 the plans for the memorial involved erecting it at the rear of Government House, rather than at the front.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} {{is problematic}} because passing freight trains often result in delays both on Route 126, {{as well as}} Route 135 which crosses <b>it</b> <b>just</b> south of the tracks. The frequent blockage of the crossing by passing trains reduces capacity in the intersection by 21% during the morning rush and 16% in the afternoon, resulting in delays and traffic jams in the downtown area. Increased service levels planned by the MBTA would result in morning capacity reduction of 34% and afternoon reduction of 28%.|$|E

5|$|The {{telescope}} became operational in {{the summer}} of 1957, {{just in time for the}} launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. While the transmissions from Sputnik itself could easily be picked up by a household radio, the Lovell Telescope was the only telescope capable of tracking Sputnik's booster rocket by radar; it first located <b>it</b> <b>just</b> before midnight on 12 October 1957. It also located Sputnik 2's carrier rocket at just after midnight on 16 November 1957.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the match, Lauren {{committed}} several fouls on Ronaldo, and {{confronted the}} Portuguese winger {{early in the}} second half, before finally being booked for persistent fouling in the 62nd minute. Ronaldo took the free kick himself but put <b>it</b> <b>just</b> over the bar from 30 yards. In the 64th minute, Arsenal were awarded a free kick for an O'Shea foul on Reyes; Bergkamp took the kick, which was headed away by Ferdinand, but only as far as Pirès, whose side-footed volley went over the bar. The free kick was to be Bergkamp's last contribution to the final, as he was then substituted by Ljungberg in the 65th minute.|$|E
5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews.
