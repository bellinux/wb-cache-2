25|$|Uniaxial {{birefringence}} {{is classified}} as positive when the extraordinary index of refraction ne {{is greater than the}} ordinary <b>index</b> <b>no.</b> Negative birefringence means that Δn = ne − no is less than zero. In other words, the polarization of the fast (or slow) wave is perpendicular to the optic axis when the birefringence of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In the case of biaxial crystals, all three of the principal axes have different refractive indices, so this designation does not apply. But for any defined ray direction one can just as well designate the fast and slow ray polarizations.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, Pope Paul VI succeeded John XXIII and, {{under his}} reign, the Holy Office, with its name changed to Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, {{abolished}} the Index altogether in 1965. Valtorta's followers {{argue that this}} in effect nullified the condemnation of 1959, since the <b>Index</b> <b>no</b> longer existed after 1965. Others consider {{the abolition of the}} Index as not reversing the Church's opinion of the work. In 1960, the Holy Office condemned the work, as well as placing it on the Index; and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), acting as head of the Congregation in 1985 wrote that [...] "the Index retains its moral force despite its dissolution." [...] Valtorta supporters point to the fact that at different times the list of forbidden books included writings by Jean-Paul Sartre, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, René Descartes, Francis Bacon, John Milton, and Blaise Pascal, among others, while other authors (such as Karl Marx or Adolf Hitler) were never put on the Index.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} type of birefringence {{is described}} as uniaxial, meaning {{that there is a}} single direction governing the optical anisotropy whereas all directions perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) are optically equivalent. Thus rotating the material around this axis does not change its optical behavior. This special direction is known as the optic axis of the material. Light whose polarization is perpendicular to the optic axis is governed by a refractive <b>index</b> <b>no</b> (for [...] "ordinary"). Light whose polarization is {{in the direction of the}} optic axis sees an optical index ne (for [...] "extraordinary"). For any ray direction there is a linear polarization direction perpendicular to the optic axis, and this is called an ordinary ray. However, for ray directions not parallel to the optic axis, the polarization direction perpendicular to the ordinary ray's polarization will be partly in the direction of the optic axis, and this is called an extraordinary ray. The ordinary ray will always experience a refractive index of no, whereas the refractive index of the extraordinary ray will be in between no and ne, depending on the ray direction as described by the index ellipsoid. The magnitude of the difference is quantified by the birefringence: ...|$|E

If he were only dead at Fiesole at that moment! This importunate selfish wish inevitably thrust itself before every other thought. It was true that Bardo's rigid will was a sufficient safeguard against any intercourse between Romola and her brother; but not against the betrayal of what he knew to others, especially when the subject was suggested by the coupling of Romola's name {{with that of the}} very Tito Melema whose description he had carried round his neck as an <b>index.</b> <b>No!</b> nothing but Fra Luca's death could remove all danger; but his death was highly probable, and after the momentary shock of the discovery, Tito let his mind fall back in repose on that confident hope.|$|E
