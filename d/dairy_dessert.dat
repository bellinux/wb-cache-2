40|$|A {{procedure}} {{was developed to}} entrap probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus MJLA 1 and Bifidobacterium spp. BDBB 2) into calcium alginate beads. The effects of sodium lauryl sulfate and Tween 80 on bead sizes {{and the release of}} the organisms from the encapsulated beads in the presence of acid and bile were investigated. The external and internal appearances of the bead were observed using scanning electron microscopy. The encapsulated beads were freezedried and incorporated into the mix for making frozen fermented <b>dairy</b> <b>desserts</b> prior to freezing. Two batches of fermented frozen <b>dairy</b> <b>desserts</b> were made with or without encapsulated probiotic bacteria and viable counts of probiotic bacteria were enumerated in fermented frozen <b>dairy</b> <b>desserts</b> at fortnightly intervals for 12 weeks. The mean diameter of the beads without any sodium lauryl sulfate and Tween 80 was 1. 17 mm, but the size of the beads decreased as the concentrations of sodium lauryl sulfate and Tween 80 increased. The average diameter of the beads with 1 % sodium lauryl sulfate and 0. 3 % Tween 80 was 0. 064 mm. The beads appeared to be ellipsoidal in shape and the microorganisms were located in the matrices formed in the beads. The entrapped bacterial cells were released by shaking in O. 1 M phosphate buffer for 5 min and in the presence of bile, but not in the presence of acid. In general, the survival of probiotic bacteria in fermented frozen <b>dairy</b> <b>desserts</b> was improved with encapsulation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{preference}} for healthier and convenience products {{has led to}} a growing demand for functional and ready-to-eat foods that present a suitable sensory acceptance. This study aimed to identify the drivers of liking of chocolate <b>dairy</b> <b>desserts.</b> A consumer test with 120 people was performed. The sensory profiling was carried out by 14 trained assessors using quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA). In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) identified two significant principal components that accounted for 73. 49 % {{of the variance in the}} sensory attribute data, and partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to identify the drivers of liking of chocolate <b>dairy</b> <b>desserts.</b> The results show that the most desired sensory properties of such products are sweetness, milk chocolate flavor, sweet aroma, and mouth fill, whereas bitterness and bitter aftertaste were considered undesirable. In this context, these attributes can be considered drivers of liking and disliking of chocolate <b>dairy</b> <b>desserts</b> and they should be taken into consideration by dairy processors at the development of new dairy products.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{initiate}} development of a nonrefrigerated <b>dairy</b> <b>dessert</b> product. Milk was concentrated by pressure-driven filtration and then sterilized using ultra-high temperature (UHT) processing. Following sterilization, samples were aseptically inoculated with rennet to coagulate the milk, which was then stored at room temperature. These processing steps produced a <b>dairy</b> <b>dessert</b> that did not require refrigeration. I investigated the influence of total solids, milk fat, rennet dosage, storage temperature, and storage time on curd firmness and syneresis. I investigated the effect on curd firmness and syneresis of giving the concentrate a heat treatment prior to UHT processing. Chocolate and vanilla dairy desserts were prepared, and a taste panel was conducted to compare the <b>dairy</b> <b>dessert</b> with a ready-to- eat starch-based pudding. Milk concentrate obtained by reverse osmosis did not form a gel, whereas concentrate obtained by ultrafiltration did gel. Increasing the solids content of the milk concentrate increased curd firmness, but increasing the fat content of the concentrate decreased curd firmness. Curd firmness and syneresis increased as the concentration of rennet was increased. Products stored at 21 °C yielded firmer gels with more syneresis than products stored at 4 °C. Moreover, products stored {{for longer periods of}} time produced firmer gels and greater amounts of syneresis. Concentrate that received a batch heat treatment prior to sterilization reduced syneresis. The addition of cocoa to the concentrate inhibited coagulation.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the behavior of Listeria innocua in a <b>dairy</b> <b>dessert</b> in the presence/absence of a probiotic microorganism and to assess the in vitro functionality of the probiotic <b>dairy</b> <b>dessert.</b> Three formulations of <b>dairy</b> <b>dessert</b> were prepared: F 1 – inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus La- 5, F 2 – inoculated with L.  innocua and F 3 – inoculated with both L.  innocua and L.  acidophilus La- 5. The dairy desserts were stored at 5  °C/ 28 days, following measurement of the pH and enumeration of L.  innocua and L.  acidophilus La- 5 on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. The {{results showed that the}} pH of the formulation inoculated with L.  acidophilus La- 5 (F 1) has decreased to 5. 6 {{at the end of the}} shelf life, while in F 2 (inoculated with L.  innocua only) and F 3 (inoculated with L.  innocua and L.  acidophilus La- 5) the pH increased. The counts of L.  acidophilus La- 5 decreased in F 1 throughout the shelf life, while in F 2 and in F 3, the populations of L.  innocua increased, reaching up to 108 – 9  CFU/g at the end of shelf life. The functionality tests indicated that the percentage of survivors decreased (p <  0. 05) from 89. 3 % to 58. 8 % in F 1 during storage shelf life, while an increase in the percentage of survival of L.  acidophilus La- 5 (94. 0 – 99. 1 %, p <  0. 05) was observed in F 3. The results of the present study highlight the needs to strictly ensure the microbiological safety of raw materials, control the pasteurization temperature and to guarantee that surfaces and environments are adequately cleaned and sanitized to avoid contamination by Listeria spp., and particularly, by Listeria monocytogenes. Further studies should be carried out to understand the interaction between L.  innocua and L.  acidophilus La- 5...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were (1) to {{optimize}} the formulation of a prebiotic chocolate <b>dairy</b> <b>dessert</b> and assess the extent to which sensory properties were affected by adding different concentrations of prebiotics (inulin and fructooligosaccharides) combined with different levels of xanthan and guar gums, and (2) to analyze the ideal and relative sweetness of prebiotic chocolate milk dessert sweetened with different artificial and natural sweeteners. Acceptability was evaluated by 100 consumers using a 9 -cm hedonic scale, and the level of sample creaminess was evaluated using a 9 -point just-about-right (JAR) scale. Data were subjected to a multivariate regression analysis and fitted to a model provided by response surface methodology. The optimal concentrations were 7. 5 % (wt/wt) prebiotic and 0. 20 % (wt/wt) gum (guar and xanthan, in a 2 : 1 ratio). The ideal sweetness analysis revealed that the ideal concentration of sucrose was 8. 13 %. The relative sweetness analysis showed that Neotame (NutraSweet Corp., Chicago, IL) had the highest sweetening power compared with the prebiotic chocolate <b>dairy</b> <b>dessert</b> containing 8 % sucrose, followed by sucralose, aspartame, and stevia.

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} <b>dairy</b> <b>desserts</b> with (11 g kg− 1) and without dietary fibres by instrumental measurements of texture and colour and sensory analysis. To maintain a similar texture {{to that of}} commercial desserts without fibres, the composition of thickening (corn starch, xanthan and guar gums) and gelling (carrageenan) agents in the basic formulation was also studied. Dietary fibres of bamboo, inulin, wheat, apple, Psyllium and chitosan were tested. Sensory characteristics were evaluated by a non-trained panel. Appearance, flavour, texture and preference were scored using an unstructured line scale. Texture and surface colour were analysed by a Texture Analyser-xT 2 i and a tristimulus colourimeter (Minolta CR 300). Sensory attributes showed significant differences among treatments. The dessert with chitosan gave the lowest sensory scores. For stress at rupture, the dessert with Psyllium fibre showed the highest value, while the one with chitosan gave the lowest.

In Turkey, a meal with family or friends traditionally ends with a dessert, which is a testimony to the hosts’ hospitality or to the housewife’s love and affection for her husband and children, since sweets and desserts are important elements of Turkish cuisine.
