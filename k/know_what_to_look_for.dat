60|$|Since {{this most}} Christian war {{includes}} laying mines in the fairways of traffic, and since these mines may be laid {{at any time}} by German submarines especially built for the work, or by neutral ships, all fairways must be swept continuously day and night. When a nest of mines is reported, traffic must be hung up or deviated till it is cleared out. When traffic comes up Channel it must be examined for contraband and other things; and the examining tugs lie out {{in a blaze of}} lights to remind ships of this. Months ago, when the war was young, the tugs did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> specially. Now they do. All this mine-searching and reporting and sweeping, plus the direction and examination of the traffic, plus the laying of our own ever-shifting mine-fields, is part of the Trawler Fleet's work, because the Navy-as-we-knew-it is busy elsewhere. And there is always the enemy submarine with a price on her head, whom the Trawler Fleet hunts and traps with zeal and joy. Add to this, that there are boats, fishing for real fish, to be protected in their work at sea or chased off dangerous areas whither, because they are strictly forbidden to go, they naturally repair, and you will begin to get some idea of what the Trawler and Auxiliary Fleet does.|$|E

50|$|One {{issue that}} has limited the growth of {{professional}} hamster racing is the difficulty in handicapping, or attempting to predict the winner, of a hamster racing contest. As with horse racing, the handicapping of hamsters relies on observations of the speed, pace, form, and class of the animal. However, while many bettors believe themselves to be good horse handicappers, few <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> in hamster handicapping as they are unfamiliar with the species. This means that the large population of horse racing bettors are often unwilling to migrate to hamster racing because {{to do so would}} require either placing uninformed, pure-chance bets or learning to judge and handicap an entirely new animal.|$|E
50|$|The {{difficulties}} {{facing the}} study are considerable. Sara Reardon wrote in Science in March 2011 that scientists {{were concerned that}} they did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for.</b> The delay between the workers' exposure in 2010 and the start of the study - the first interviews of participants took place in February 2011 - meant that short-term physical markers that could be directly related to the spill, such as rashes, had gone. There is also little information about the pre-spill baseline health of the workers, whose work involves regular exposure to environmental hazards. According to epidemiologist Maureen Lichtveld, the main health effects are likely to be psychosocial, such as depression and increased alcohol use resulting from job losses. Reardon wrote that, given how economically depressed the community is, {{it will be difficult to}} demonstrate what is causing the stress-related illnesses the workers report.|$|E
50|$|When {{a person}} expects certain things to happen, he/she tends {{to block out}} other possibilities. This can lead to inattentional {{blindness}}. For example, person X is looking for their friend at a concert, and that person knows their friend (person Y) was wearing a yellow jacket. In order to find person Y, person X looks around for people wearing yellow. It is easier to pick a color {{out of the crowd}} than a person. However, if person Y took off the jacket, there is a chance person X could walk right past person Y and not notice because he/she was looking for the yellow jacket. Because of expectations, experts are more prone to inattentional blindness than beginners. An expert knows what to expect when certain situations arise. Therefore, that expert will <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for.</b> This could cause that person to miss out on other important details that he/she may not have been looking for.|$|E

50|$|In Cold Days, Harry Dresden {{visits the}} Outer Gates with Mother Summer, {{where it is}} {{revealed}} that the Outer Gates are literally a pair of gates located on a wall that spans the outer boundaries of the Winter Court's territory in the faerie realm. They are implied to be the furthest limit of the universe, and bar the Outsiders from entering this universe. They are defended by millions, possibly billions of Unseelie Fae who wage constant war against the Outsiders. They are aided by some Seelie Fae medics, and the Gatekeeper, who helps protect the Gates from breaches from this universe by enforcing the Seventh Law, and he coordinates efforts with other trusted factions. The Dresden Files RPG has expanded upon this law in its publications, establishing that is illegal to attempt to even learn anything about what lies beyond the Outer Gates, though it acknowledges that there is obviously some grey area here or the Wardens wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for.</b> In Summer Knight, Harry is introduced to The Gatekeeper, one of the Senior Council. The Gatekeeper's job is to aid {{the forces of the}} Winter Fae in defending the universe from the Outsiders, and it is often suggested that this law does not apply to him to the same extent as it does to other wizards. It is stated in Ghost Story that DuMorne had broken the seventh law when he summoned one of the Outsiders to kill Harry.|$|E
5000|$|Already in the 18th century authors had {{criticized the}} use of introspection, both for knowing one's own mind and as a method for psychology. David Hume pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, Christian Gottfried Schütz, noted that introspection is often {{described}} as mere [...] "inner sensation", but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively - one needs to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for.</b> Immanuel Kant added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about {{what goes on in the}} mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind. Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between John Stuart Mill and Auguste Comte. Recent psychological research on cognition and attribution has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment. In some situations, these reports are clearly confabulated. For example, people justify choices they have not in fact made. Such results undermine the idea that those verbal reports are based on direct introspective access to mental content. Instead, judgements about one's own mind seem to be inferences from overt behavior, similar to judgements made about another person. However, it is hard to assess whether these results only apply to unusual experimental situations, or if they reveal something about everyday introspection. The theory of the adaptive unconscious suggests that a very large proportion of mental processes, even [...] "high-level" [...] processes like goal-setting and decision-making, are inaccessible to introspection.Indeed, it is questionable how confident researchers can be in their own introspections.|$|E
50|$|In India, the Code for Self-Regulation of Advertising in India, {{established}} by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), is applicable on Television Commercials (TVCs). If consumers see an advertisement which they consider misleading or offensive, they can write to ASCI.As per the provisions under The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995, and the Policy Guidelines for Uplinking of Television Channels from India (first introduced in 2000), give the government the power to block the transmission and re-transmission of any channel in the country. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has clear guidelines for TV advertising in India.The Indian television channels are widely segmented through Broadcast television, Cable television, Satellite television, Internet Protocol television. There are 857 permitted private satellite stations and also 190 government channels under the list of television stations in India. The TV advertising rate varies for TV ad spots, regional/national channels, prime/non-prime time and also on the media planning platform.The Advertising Standards Council Of India has defined the principles and guidelines for individuals, corporate bodies and associations engaged in or otherwise concerned with the practice of advertising for medium such as television. The principles include honest representations, non-offensive to public, against harmful products/situations, fair in competition. The guidelines include Automotives & Safety, Educational Institutions, Foods & Beverages, Disclaimers in an Advertisement.TV advertising means conveying a message, typically to market a product or service. TV advertising allows you to show and tell a wide audience about your business, product, or service. It allows you to actually demonstrate the benefits of ownership. You can show how your product or service works and how it’s packaged so prospective customers will <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> {{at the point of}} sale. Television advertising advantages are TV reaches a much larger audience than local newspapers and radio stations, and it does so during a short period of time. It reaches viewers when they’re the most attentive. It allows you to convey your message with sight, sound, and motion, which can give your business, product, or service instant credibility. It gives you an opportunity to be creative and attach a personality to your business, which can be particularly effective for small businesses that rely on repeat customers.|$|E

50|$|Joint {{attention}} is another cognitive capacity Tomasello explores. Joint {{attention is}} when two individuals {{share the same}} attention on a particular object. This could be done through an action, like pointing, gazing, or showing body movement directed toward another object or by verbally letting another organism <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at. Tomasello found evidence to prove that infants can begin to engage in joint attentional interactions because they understand that others around them are also agents of joint attention. This is unique because it means that infants {{have the capacity to}} identify with adults and distinguish the underlying goal of those around the infants through their actions. This is different from the idea that infants just acknowledge external motives and respond to these actions without true understanding.|$|R
