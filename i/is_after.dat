5|$|Several {{portraits of}} Octavius survive. Five portraits of him alone {{and one with}} his brother Alfred are housed in the Royal Collection of the United Kingdom. The first is the more famous {{painting}} by Thomas Gainsborough in 1782, {{which is part of}} a series of paintings of the younger royal children. The second one <b>is</b> <b>after</b> the 1782 portrait by Gainsborough (see above) and is dated to about 1782 or 1784. The third portrait is by Benjamin West and was painted shortly before Octavius's death. Furthermore, among these five portraits, there are two enamels, both after Gainsborough's 1782 portrait; one is by William Bone and the other one is by an anonymous master. The sixth and last portrait represents the apotheosis of Octavius and Alfred (see above) and was painted by West. Another portrait, this time of Queen Charlotte, features Octavius. Painted in 1779 by West, this is both a portrait of the Queen and her children, who are featured in the background. Prince Octavius is at the centre of the group, wearing baby clothes and riding in a little phaeton. He is pulled along by Prince Ernest and pushed by Prince Adolphus.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Æthelburg's {{marriage}} being dependent on Edwin {{allowing her to}} practice her faith has been questioned, since revising the chronology makes it likely, though not certain, that the marriage was arranged before Eadbald's conversion.

The story of Paulinus's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later, which <b>is</b> <b>after</b> the latest possible date for Æthelburg's marriage. However, it may be that he traveled to Northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop.|$|E
