5|$|There is some {{geographic}} variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of AML. In adults, {{the highest}} rates are seen in North America, Europe, and Oceania, while adult AML is rarer in Asia and Latin America. In contrast, childhood AML is less common in North America and India than {{in other parts of}} Asia. These differences may be due to population genetics, environmental factors, or a combination of the two.|$|E
5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

40|$|For {{different}} reasons cancers of the Prostate, Testis and Penis are important diseases for men. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> for prostate and testicular cancers are more commonly seen in developed countries, while penile cancer occurs more frequently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> developing countries. <b>In</b> Mumbai <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of prostatic and testicular cancers is low whereas penile cancer is high {{when compared with}} international reports. <b>In</b> Mumbai. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> of prostatic cancer increases only {{after the age of}} 50. <b>The</b> age specific <b>incidence</b> rates for testicular cancers are bimodal whereas <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of Penile cancer increases exponentially with age, after <b>the</b> age 30. <b>In</b> Mumbai. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> of Prostate cancer was six times higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Parsis as compared to other communities. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> of cancer of the testis is lowest in Hindus and cancer of penis is not seen <b>in</b> Muslims. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> of prostate cancer was highest among Gujrathis and there was an absence of penile cancer in Urdu speaking men. <b>In</b> Bombay <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of cancers of the prostate, testis and penis seem to be associated with marital status. <b>The</b> association between <b>incidence</b> and education level of the patients was only found in men having cancer of the testis.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E

25|$|However, {{before that}} point, {{criticism}} of the studies showing no connection and a few well-publicized anecdotal reports of permanent disability that were blamed on the DPT vaccine gave rise to 1970s anti-DPT movements.

25|$|The {{estimated}} risk {{of cancer}} {{to people who were}} children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at-risk group—infants. A thyroid ultrasound screening programme is currently (2013) ongoing in the entire Fukushima prefecture; this screening programme is, due to the screening effect, likely to lead to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases.|$|E

25|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} the most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease and {{is the most}} common form of dementia in the elderly. The disorder is characterized by progressive loss of memory and various cognitive functions. It is hypothesized that the deposition of amyloid-β peptide (40-42 amino acid residues) in the brain is integral <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulation is purported to block hippocampal long-term potentiation. It is also possible that a receptor for amyloid-β oligomers could be a prion protein.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possibility}} is that common diseases arise in part through the action of combinations of variants that are individually rare. Most of the disease-associated alleles discovered to date have been rare, and rare variants {{are more likely than}} common variants to be differentially distributed among groups distinguished by ancestry. However, groups could harbor different, though perhaps overlapping, sets of rare variants, which would reduce contrasts between groups <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} allergy {{can be placed}} in two general categories, namely host and {{environmental}} factors.
