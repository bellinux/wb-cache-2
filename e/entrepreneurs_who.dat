5|$|Folklorists see the jackalope {{as one of}} a {{group of}} fabled creatures common to American culture since Colonial days. These appear in tall tales about hodags, giant turtles, Bigfoot, and many other mysterious beasts and in novels like Moby-Dick. The tales lend {{themselves}} to comic hoaxing by <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> seek attention for their products, their persons, or their towns.|$|E
5|$|After the disincorporation, the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} former village was revitalized by artists and <b>entrepreneurs,</b> <b>who</b> purchased and restored Main Street buildings that had fallen into disrepair. Since the 1990s, Rosendale has hosted many street festivals. The former village has {{had a number of}} notable buildings, including four churches. Two notable bridges span the Rondout Creek in the village: a road bridge that carries Route32, and the Rosendale trestle, a former railroad bridge currently being renovated as a pedestrian walkway. Joppenbergh Mountain, named after Rosendale's founder, borders the village and has been the site of numerous ski jumping competitions and mine collapses.|$|E

5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by <b>entrepreneurs,</b> <b>who</b> were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} the new middle class in Syria fueled discontent since the {{traditional}} elite dominated the agrarian sector – the largest {{sector of the economy}} – and created most of the wealth. The new middle class consisted of capitalists and <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> opposed the traditional elite – the monopolisation of power by the traditional elite led to the radicalisation of the new middle class. The military, which in many countries is conservative and elitist, became radicalised in Syria because the military wanted greater power, believing that the traditional elite were unable to defend the country. A significant group of military personnel were recruited from the new middle class or from the hinterlands.|$|E
5|$|The iron {{industry}} was pursued by both private <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> owned their own smelters {{as well as}} government-supervised smelting facilities. The Song economy was stable enough to produce over a hundred million kilograms (over two hundred million pounds) of iron product a year. Large-scale deforestation in China would have continued {{if not for the}} 11th-century innovation of the use of coal instead of charcoal in blast furnaces for smelting cast iron. Much of this iron was reserved for military use in crafting weapons and armouring troops, but some was used to fashion the many iron products needed to fill the demands of the growing domestic market. The iron trade within China was advanced by the construction of new canals, facilitating the flow of iron products from production centres to the large market in the capital city.|$|E

5|$|The {{well-established}} {{textile processing}} and trading infrastructure, and the ready {{supply of water}} from the River Irwell and its tributaries, attracted <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> built cotton mills {{along the banks of the}} river in Pendleton and Ordsall. Although Salford followed a similar pattern of industrial development to Manchester, most businesses preferred to build their premises on the Manchester side of the Irwell, and consequently Salford did not develop as a commercial centre in the same way as its neighbour. Many of these earlier mills had been based on Arkwright-type designs. These relied on strong falls of water, but Salford is on a meander of the Irwell with only a slight gradient and thus mills tended to be built upstream, at Kersal and Pendleton. With the introduction of the steam engine in the late 18th century however, merchants began to construct mills closer to the centres of Salford and Manchester, where supplies of labour and coal were more readily available (the first steam-powered mill was built in Manchester in 1780). One of the first factories to be built was Philip's and Lee's Twist Mill in Salford, completed in 1801, the second iron-framed multi-story building to be erected in Britain. The large Salford Engine Twist Company mill was built to the west of Salford, between Chapel Street and the Irwell, and in 1806 was the first large cotton mill to use gas lighting. It was however outnumbered by the numerous smaller factories and mills throughout the area, including Nathan Gough's steam-driven mule spinning mill, near Oldfield Road, where a serious accident occurred on 13 October 1824 (see illustration).|$|E

25|$|In November 2006, Douglas was fired. An {{internal}} memo {{about the}} departure surfaced, suggesting Douglas {{had become too}} focused on {{a small group of}} Internet <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> had befriended him to get press coverage. The memo also quoted an interview he gave the R.U. Sirius Show (republished on a sister web site 10 Zen Monkeys) in which Douglas had joked that one of his goals for Valleywag was to get sued.|$|E
25|$|The {{raising of}} capital in Rotterdam did not go so smoothly. A {{considerable}} part originated from inhabitants of Dordrecht. Although it did not raise as much capital as Amsterdam or Middelburg-Zeeland, Enkhuizen had the largest input in the share capital of the VOC. Under the first 358 shareholders, there were many small <b>entrepreneurs,</b> <b>who</b> dared to take the risk. The minimum investment in the VOC was 3,000 guilders, which priced the Company's stock within the means of many merchants.|$|E
25|$|Tom Breitling and Tim Poster {{were the}} highest profile {{successful}} <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> profited in the downtown market during the last crisis. As recounted in Tom Breitling's book, Double or Nothing, the partners agreed to buy the Golden Nugget and had an agreement to sell the property after operating it for only one year. The partners made $113 million in profit called {{the highest rate of}} return {{in such a short time}} in the gaming industry. Amazingly enough the partners had a negative income for the year and the fortune was made while total revenue for downtown was still basically flat.|$|E

25|$|Most {{students}} who pursue the Executive MBA {{have been working}} in the business world for some time. Many are corporate executives who want to advance within their companies. Others are <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> want to advance their businesses, and still others are professionals who want to become managers rather than practitioners. The program requires 24 months. In 2009, incoming students began following an alternating Saturday schedule and two summer sessions. The change from an alternating Friday/Saturday schedule was made to accommodate students in a challenging economic environment. The first EMBA class graduated in the spring of 1980.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{thousands}} of Chinese Jamaicans fled {{a wave of}} inter-ethnic violence against them; at first, they went primarily to Canada, which was more open to immigration than the United States, with the U.S. becoming a major immigration destination later on. As a result, clusters of Chinese Jamaicans can be found outside Jamaica primarily in locales like Toronto, New York City, and South Florida. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, {{there was a new}} wave of Chinese migration to Jamaica, consisting of Hong Kong and Taiwanese <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> set up textile factories on the island targeting the U.S. market and often brought in migrant workers from China to staff their ventures.|$|E
25|$|The Klapmeier brothers, Alan Lee Klapmeier (born October 6, 1958) and Dale Edward Klapmeier (born July 2, 1961), are American {{aircraft}} designers, aviation businessmen, and <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> together {{founded the}} Cirrus Aircraft Corporation in 1984. Under {{the leadership of}} the Klapmeiers, Cirrus was the first aircraft manufacturer to install a whole-plane parachute recovery system as a standard on all its models—designed to lower the airplane (and occupants) safely to the ground in case of an emergency. The device is attributed with saving over 140 lives to date. Cirrus was also the first to use all-composite airframe construction and glass panel cockpits on production aircraft, which many say revolutionized general aviation for light aircraft pilots.|$|E

25|$|After the war, a {{vigorous}} debate among the civilian elites spawned {{the development of}} two new political parties. Silver mining <b>entrepreneurs,</b> <b>who</b> had {{become the most important}} economic group in the country, created the Conservative Party (Partido Conservador) led by Mariano Baptista, a vocal opponent of the War of the Pacific. Conservatives favored reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include a financial indemnity for the lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for continued mining exports. The Liberal Party (Partido Liberal) was founded in 1883 by the former chief of staff, General Eliodoro Camacho and was more hawkish, as it denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives and any peace treaty with Chile. Liberals also resented the dependence of the mining industry on Chilean and British capital and hoped to attract United States investments.|$|E
25|$|The {{state and}} its {{officials}} still dominated the economy, controlled supplies of essential goods, taxed and regulated businesses and markets, and awarded contracts. The stratification system of the Maoist period had been based on a hierarchy of functionally unspecialized cadres directing the labors of a fairly uniform mass of peasants. It was replaced in the 1980s by a new elite of economically specialized households and <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> had managed {{to come to terms}} with the administrative cadres who controlled access to many of the resources necessary for economic success. Local cadres still had the power to impose fees, taxes, and all manner of exactions. The norms of the new system were not clear, and the economic and social system continued to change in response to the rapid growth of rural commerce and industry and to national economic policies and reforms.|$|E
25|$|Alan and Dale are two {{of three}} {{children}} born to Larry and Carol Klapmeier. They come from an entrepreneurial family. The eldest brother, Ernie Klapmeier, opened his own accessory store of military reenactment goods and regalia in Aurora, Illinois and has managed the shop {{since its founding in}} 1997; their uncle, Jim Klapmeier, and grandfather, Elmer Klapmeier, were both entrepreneurs in the boat manufacturing industry and started as a small, two-person company building pontoon-like houseboats on Rainy Lake, Minnesota throughout the 1950s. Elmer ran a second business flying a single-engine 'puddle jumper' plane around Wisconsin delivering parts to dairy farmers, while Jim later moved the boat project to a facility in Mora, Minnesota where he grew and retained it for several decades, transitioning into the market of luxury yachts. Larry and Carol were also <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>who</b> founded a successful nursing home near Chicago, of which the three brothers worked at as kids doing janitorial chores during the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
