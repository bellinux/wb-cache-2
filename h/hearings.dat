5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the confirmation of charges <b>hearings</b> in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the <b>hearings</b> in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding the <b>hearings</b> in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the <b>hearings</b> in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the <b>hearings</b> in Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the <b>hearings</b> will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|As a California Assemblyman, Ryan {{also served}} as the Chairman of {{legislative}} subcommittee <b>hearings</b> and presided over <b>hearings</b> involving his later successor as Congressman, Tom Lantos. Ryan pushed through important educational policies in California and authored {{what came to be}} known as the Ryan Act, which established an independent regulatory commission to monitor educational credentialing in the state.|$|E
5|$|At {{the initial}} <b>hearings</b> the chamber set dates for the {{confirmation}} of charges <b>hearings</b> {{to take place in}} September 2011. An application by the Office of the Prosecutor to impose conditions on the suspects' summonses including that they provide details of all their home addresses and that they pay a bond to the Court was rejected by Judge Trendafilova.|$|E

5|$|Finally, defense {{asked for}} {{adjournment}} {{as a key}} witness fell ill.

Blythe committed to return when the trial resumed.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of appropriation bills into the Parliament, the expenditure proposed in those bills is referred to Senate legislation committees for inquiry. Such referrals result in what are generally known as budget estimates <b>hearings.</b> Senate standing committees will usually conduct eight days of <b>hearings</b> around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates).|$|E

THESE SOUNDS ARE GENERATED AS A BYPRODUCT OF THE AMPLIFYING PROCESSES THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE INNER EAR. THEIR PRESENCE INDICATES A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING COCHLEA. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEFINE BOTH THE CAPABILITY OF TRANSIENTLY EVOKED OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS (TEOAEs) -A MAJOR SUBCLASS OF OAEs-IN DETECTING <b>HEARING</b> DEFICITS IN CHILDREN AND THEIR CLINICAL APPLICABILITY. A TOTAL OF 529 CHILDREN (1042 EARS) WERE EXAMINED BY USING THE WELL-KNOWN METHODS OF AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSES AND/OR PURE TONE AUDIOMETRY AND THE NEW TEST OF TEOAEs AS WELL. TEOAEs WERE PROVED TO BE A HIGHLY ACCURATE AND SENSITIVE METHOD TO DIAGNOSE <b>HEARING</b> DEGICITS IN CHILDHOOD. MOREOVER TEOAEs RECORDINGS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY OBJECTIVITY,SIMPLICITY,NON-INVASIVENESS,TIME-SAVING AND LOW COST.

5|$|In early 1949, {{physicist}} Robert Bacher {{stepped down}} from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post.) Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending <b>hearings</b> of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the <b>hearings</b> inquired into a small amount of uranium that was alleged to be unaccounted for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned the <b>hearings</b> as grounded in misconceptions about the work of nuclear scientists.|$|E
5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the event is based on a month-long {{preliminary}} hearing held afterward, generally known as the Spicer <b>hearings.</b> Reporters from both newspapers covered the <b>hearings</b> and recorded the testimony there and at the coroner's inquest, but only the reporter from The Daily Nugget knew shorthand. The testimony recorded by the court recorder and the two newspapers varied greatly.|$|E

5|$|The {{outcomes}} of the confirmation of charges <b>hearings</b> were announced on 23 January 2012. Despite the ICC regulations requiring the Pre-Trial Chamber to normally issue a verdict on confirmation of charges within sixty days of the <b>hearings</b> taking place the chamber issued a ruling on 26 October 2011 to vary this time limit to allow both the results in both cases to be announced simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas <b>hearings</b> began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill <b>hearings,</b> and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate <b>hearings</b> were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera <b>hearings.</b> Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public <b>hearings</b> to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public <b>hearings)</b> is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public <b>hearings</b> and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{sometimes}} gruesome testimony {{it was generally}} believed the <b>hearings</b> were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only to Lang and Dorcas Williams, both {{of whom had been}} acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to an insane asylum. Both of the accused gendarmerie officers had been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to the <b>hearings.</b> A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed to Lang and Williams, the gendarmerie's conduct of the war had been justifiable.|$|E
