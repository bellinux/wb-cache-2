40|$|Wear and {{corrosion}} {{of structures}} cuts across industries {{and continues to}} challenge materials scientists and engineers to develop cost effective solutions. Industries typically seek mature technologies that can be implemented for production with rapid or minimal development and have little appetite for the longer-term materials research and development required to solve complex problems. The collaborative work performed in this project addressed the complexity of this problem in a multi-year program that industries would be reluctant to undertake without government partnership. This effort built upon the prior development of Advanced Abrasion Resistant Materials conduct by Caterpillar Inc. under DOE Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC 26 - 01 NT 41054. In this referenced work, coatings were developed that exhibited significant wear life improvements over standard carburized heat treated steel in abrasive wear applications. The technology used in this referenced work, arc lamp fusing of thermal spray coatings, {{was one of the}} primary technical paths in this work effort. In addition to extending the capability of the coating technology to address corrosion issues, additional competitive coating technologies were evaluated to insure that the best technology was developed to meet the goals of the program. From this, plasma transferred arc (PTA) welding was selected as the second primary technology that was investigated. Specifically, this project developed improved, cost effective surfacing materials and processes for wear and corrosion resistance in both sliding and abrasive wear applications. Materials with wear and corrosion performance improvements that are 4 to 5 times greater than heat treated steels were developed. The materials developed were based on low cost material systems utilizing ferrous substrates and stainless steel type matrix with hard particulates formed from borides and carbides. Affordability was assessed against other competing hard surfacing or coating techniques, balanced with overall materials performance. State-of-the-art design and simulation capabilities were used to guide materials and process refinement. Caterpillar was the lead of the multi-partner collaborative project. Specific tasks were performed by the partners base on their unique capabilities. The project team was selected to include leaders in the field of material development, processing, modeling, and material characterization. Specifically, industrial members include the suppliers Deloro Stellite and Powder Alloy Corporation., who provided the experimental alloys and who aided {{in the development of the}} costs for the alloys, the Missouri University of Science and Technology and Iowa State University, who provided help in the alloy development and material characterization, QuesTek Innovations, a small company specializing the microstructural modeling of materials, and the DOE laboratories, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and National Energy Technology Laboratory (Albany), who provided unique coating process capability and wear characterization testing. The technologies developed in this program are expected to yield energy savings of about 50 % over existing technologies, or 110 trillion BTUs per year by 2020 when fully implemented. Primary applications by Caterpillar are to replace the surface of machine components which are currently carburized and heat treated with new cladding materials with double the wear life. The new cladding technologies will consume less energy than carburizing. Thus, nearly 50 % energy savings can be expected as a result from elimination of the heat treat process and the reduce wear of the materials. Additionally, when technologies from this project are applied on titanium or other non-ferrous substrates to make lighter weight, more wear resistant, and more efficient structures, significant fuel savings can be realized. With the anticipated drastic reduction in cost for refining titanium-containing ores, the usage of titanium alloys in <b>earthmoving</b> and related <b>machinery</b> is expected to increase multiple folds in the next decade. A major technical hurdle associated with the implementation of titanium alloys for heavy machinery is that of overcoming poor wear resistance. Proof of concept of the technologies developed in this project has been demonstrated by both laboratory testing of coupons and field testing of selected components. Further development will be required in order to have fully validated materials and process for production introduction and several technical hurdles remain to be addressed particular for use of the arc lamp fusing technology. The current project has reduced the risk of failure and provided sufficient data to encourage further investment by industry...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{physical}} law {{governing the}} injection in Common Rail Systems is the compressibility of the fuel.

This type of coal-mining operation was undertaken at Rieespruit Opencast Colliery in the Eastern Transvaal. Adjacent to this colliery is an exiting underground coalmine, and it was feared that the large amount of energy released by the surface blasting would be sufficient to damage the coal pillars. The investigation of the above problem formed the basis of this dissertation. Moving-coil seismometers were installed underground in what was considered^ a representative pillar, and continuous records of ground particle motion due to blasting were obtained from these instruments. Further field instrumentation consist of tape-recording decks and electronic packages to amplify and record the seismic signals was located on surface in an instrument hut built specifically for this purpose. The object of obtaining the above records was to establish damage criteria, whereby change weight could be estimated, for given distances from the blast to the underground workings, which would not cause appreciable damage underground. Propagation laws were established relating peak particle velocity, which is widely used as an indicator of possible damage, to the distance from the blast and either the square root or cube-root of the maximum charge weight per delay. These results are presented graphically and could be used to determine allowable charge weights to ensure a certain particle velocity is not exceeded...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} lives and rituals of a community of informal waste reclaimers living on an active landfill site just outside Mamelodi, Pretoria. Their living conditions are poor and yet they deliver an important service by {{reducing the amount of}} garbage buried and recycling otherwise wasted resources. The intention is to acknowledge the importance of the informal waste reclaiming community that has evolved into a network of intricate exchanges and trading which in turn provides economic opportunity in a country that has a large percentage of unemployed people. Due to the evolving nature and scale of the project, the design approach considers a series of interventions that can be implemented during the various phases of the lifecycle of the landfill. The proposal utilises landscape architecture as an intrinsic component to initiate the fundamental infrastructure that can establish the foundation for a habitable environment and future public spaces. The initial phase considers an area where recycled materials can be processed and transformed after their extraction from the landfill. This creates an important node that supplements economic opportunities. It is here where a market space provides a platform for interactions and transactions between a variety of people passing through and working on the landfill site. In conjunction with the economic upliftment proposed, the project needs to address the access to basic human rights of clean water and dignified sanitation. The design of a 'water node' provides the core around which daily rituals are organised. To create a safe, stable environment where habitation may organically evolve, the strategy is to reorganise the way waste is buried at this landfill so that building rubble, demolition waste and inert materials are structured into platforms on a portion of the landfill site. Here waste reclaimers may construct their dwellings away from the dangers of <b>earthmoving</b> <b>machinery,</b> elevated out of the garbage whilst still maintaining surveillance over the incoming waste.

Methodology. Taking into account the value of existing methods of quality management of road production engineering companies, currently a particular attention requires improvement of the quality control functions: analysis, evaluation, planning and quality control during the operation of road-building equipment, because existing economic practices and quality management approaches are built on classical principles of ISO 9001, and in the practical application do not solve all of the drawbacks of traditional management models, but only smooth them a little. Therefore, the formation of the quality management strategy for the road production of mechanical engineering is essential to ensure the competitiveness of products and enterprises of the road-building complex in the period of development of market relations in the economy. The results showed that the current market conditions impose strict requirements to all production areas of the society. Especially stringent are requirements for the road construction, because the quality of the construction of the subgrade, covering roads and curbs, grading and soil compaction under different conditions of terrain and driving safety depends on people's lives. This factor determines the exceptional quality requirements for roadbuilding equipment, which must be reliable, functional and able to meet the totality of the design and operational characteristics of the road. Further European integration of Ukraine, deepening of external economic relations with the European countries are responsible for the growing needs of the national economy in the development and expansion of the transport network. However, large-scale road construction and repair of roads is impossible without the organization of effective operation of the road for mechanical engineering – heavy construction and <b>earthmoving</b> <b>machinery.</b> Currently in our country present its own engineering manufacturers of road construction equipment (among large – JSC "Kredmash"), however, the domestic production of road is significantly inferior in terms of domestic consumption of products of foreign manufacturers of the road.

40|$|This {{project was}} funded under the Department of Energy (DOE) Lab Call on Nanomanufacturing for Energy Efficiency and was {{directed}} toward the development of novel boron-based nanocolloidal lubrication additives for improving the friction and wear performance of machine components {{in a wide range}} of industrial and transportation applications. Argonne�s research team concentrated on the scientific and technical aspects of the project, using a range of state-of-the art analytical and tribological test facilities. Argonne has extensive past experience and expertise in working with boron-based solid and liquid lubrication additives, and has intellectual property ownership of several. There were two industrial collaborators in this project: Ashland Oil (represented by its Valvoline subsidiary) and Primet Precision Materials, Inc. (a leading nanomaterials company). There was also a sub-contract with the University of Arkansas. The major objectives of the project were to develop novel boron-based nanocolloidal lubrication additives and to optimize and verify their performance under boundary-lubricated sliding conditions. The project also tackled problems related to colloidal dispersion, larger-scale manufacturing and blending of nano-additives with base carrier oils. Other important issues dealt with in the project were determination of the optimum size and concentration of the particles and compatibility with various base fluids and/or additives. Boron-based particulate additives considered in this project included boric acid (H{sub 3 }BO{sub 3 }), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron oxide, and borax. As part of this project, we also explored a hybrid MoS{sub 2 } + boric acid formulation approach for more effective lubrication and reported the results. The major motivation behind this work was to reduce energy losses related to friction and wear in a wide spectrum of mechanical systems and thereby reduce our dependence on imported oil. Growing concern over greenhouse gas emissions was also a major reason. The transportation sector alone consumes about 13 million barrels of crude oil per day (nearly 60 % of which is imported) and is responsible for about 30 % of the CO{sub 2 } emission. When we consider manufacturing and other energy-intensive industrial processes, the amount of petroleum being consumed due to friction and wear reaches more than 20 million barrels per day (from official energy statistics, U. S. Energy Information Administration). Frequent remanufacturing and/or replacement of worn parts due to friction-, wear-, and scuffing-related degradations also consume significant amounts of energy and give rise to additional CO{sub 2 } emission. Overall, the total annual cost of friction- and wear-related energy and material losses is estimated to be rather significant (i. e., as much as 5 % of the gross national products of highly industrialized nations). It is projected that more than half of the total friction- and wear-related energy losses can be recovered by developing and implementing advanced friction and wear control technologies. In transportation vehicles alone, 10 % to 15 % of the fuel energy is spent to overcome friction. If we can cut down the friction- and wear-related energy losses by half, then we can potentially save up to 1. 5 million barrels of petroleum per day. Also, less friction and wear would mean less energy consumption as well as less carbon emissions and hazardous byproducts being generated and released to the environment. New and more robust anti-friction and -wear control technologies may thus have a significant positive impact on improving the efficiency and environmental cleanliness of the current legacy fleet and future transportation systems. Effective control of friction in other industrial sectors such as manufacturing, power generation, mining and oil exploration, and agricultural and <b>earthmoving</b> <b>machinery</b> may bring more energy savings. Therefore, this project was timely and responsive to the energy and environmental objectives of DOE and our nation. In this project, most of the boron-based materials with known and potential anti-friction and -wear properties have been manufactured as colloidal additives and tested for their effectiveness in controlling friction and wear. Unlike other anti-friction and -wear additives, which consist of zinc, molybdenum, sulfur, phosphorus, and even chlorine, lubricious boron compounds considered in this project are made of boron, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, which are more environmentally benign. Among others, boric acid is a natural mineral (known in mineralogy as �sassolite�). Based on our earlier exploratory research, it was found to offer the best overall prospect in terms of performance improvements, environmental friendliness, and ease of manufacturing and, hence, cost effectiveness. Hexagonal boron nitride and borax also offered good prospects for improving the tribological properties of lubricated sliding surfaces. Boron oxide particles were found to be rather hard and somewhat abrasive and, hence, were not considered beyond the initial screening studies. In our bench-top tribological evaluation, we also demonstrated that those additives which worked well with engine oils could work equally well with very common gear oils. When added at appropriate concentrations, such gear oils were found to provide significant resistance to micropitting and scuffing failures in bench-top tribological test systems. Their traction coefficients were also reduced substantially and their scuffing limits were improved considerably. Such impressive tribological behavior of boron-based additives may have been due to their high chemical affinities to interact with sliding contact surfaces and to form slick and protective boundary films. Indeed, our surface studies have confirmed that most of the boron-based nanoparticulate additives prepared in our project possess a strong tendency to form a boron-rich boundary film on sliding contact surfaces. It is believed that the formation of such slick and highly durable boundary films is perhaps one of the fundamental reasons for their superior anti-friction, -wear, and -scuffing performance. Boron-based additives developed under this project have shown potential to reduce or replace the uses of environmentally unsafe sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing anti-wear and �friction additives, such as zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZDDP) and molybdenum dialkyl dithiocarbamate (MoDTC), in current lubricating oils. Because ZDDP and MoDTC were suspected of adversely impacting the performance of after-treatment catalysts in current engines, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory agencies are demanding that the concentrations of these catalysts in current oils be curtailed drastically. The boron-based nano-additives developed in this project may help reduce the use of ZDDP and MoDTC additives and, hence, help ease the poisoning effects on after-treatment catalysts. When used as lubricity additives, these boron additives can chemically interact with sliding or contacting surfaces and form a protective and slick boundary film, which can, in turn, help reduce friction and wear and increase resistance to scuffing. In the cases of traditional anti-friction and -wear additives mentioned, such protective boundary films result from phosphorus, sulfur, and other elements in the additive package, and again they have been under increased scrutiny in recent years, mainly because of their adverse effects on after-treatment devices. Overall, the boron-based nano-additive technology of this project was shown to hold promise for a broad range of industrial and transportation applications where lower friction and higher resistance to wear and scuffing are needed. Due to more stringent operating conditions of modern machinery, rolling, rotating, and sliding components have been failing to meet the projected lifetimes, mainly because of failures related to mechanical wear, corrosion, and scuffing. The novel boron-based additive technology developed under this project may help such machine components to function reliably by cutting down the friction and wear losses and by increasing resistance to scuffing...|$|E
