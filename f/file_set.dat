5000|$|... exFAT {{introduces}} metadata integrity {{through the}} use of checksums. There are three checksums currently in use. The Volume Boot Record (VBR) is a 12 sector region that contains the boot records, BIOS Parameter Block (BPB), OEM parameters and the checksum sector. (There are two VBR type regions, the main VBR and the backup VBR.) The checksum sector is a checksum of the previous 11 sectors, with the exception of three bytes in the boot sector (Flags and percent used). This provides integrity of the VBR by determining if the VBR was modified. The most common cause could be a boot sector virus, but this would also catch any other corruption to the VBR. A second checksum is used for the upcase table. This is a static table and should never change. Any corruption in the table could prevent files from being located because this table is used to convert the filenames to upper case when searching to locate a file. The third checksum is in the directory file sets. Multiple directory records are used to define a single file and this is called a <b>file</b> <b>set.</b> This <b>file</b> <b>set</b> has metadata including the file name, time stamps, attributes, address of first cluster location of the data, file lengths, and the file name. A checksum is taken over the entire <b>file</b> <b>set</b> and a mismatch would occur if the directory <b>file</b> <b>set</b> was accidentally or maliciously changed. When the file system is mounted, and the integrity check is conducted, these hashes are verified. Mounting also includes comparison of the version of the exFAT file system by the driver to make sure the driver is compatible with the file system it is trying to mount, {{and to make sure that}} none of the required directory records are missing (for example, the directory record for the upcase table and Allocation Bitmap are required and the file system can't run if they are missing). If any of these checks fail, the file system should not be mounted, although in certain cases it may mount read-only.|$|E

There is no cross-platform ambiguity since line ending control codes are not used, and all data including numbers {{is represented in}} readable text form. There is no known binary analogue of the format, although it is common practice to compress the files with gzip.|$|E
5000|$|DCE/DFS {{uses the}} term fileset to define a tree {{containing}} directories, files, and mount points (links to other DFS filesets). A DFS fileset is also a unit of administrative control. Properties such as data location, storage quota, and replication are controlled at this level of granularity. The concept of a fileset in DFS is essentially identical {{to the concept of}} a volume in AFS. The glamor filesystem uses the same concept of filesets. Filesets are lightweight components compared to file systems, so management of a <b>file</b> <b>set</b> is easier.|$|E
50|$|Since WSDL {{files are}} an XML-based {{specification}} for describing a web service, WSDL files {{are susceptible to}} attack. To mitigate vulnerability of these files, limiting access to generated WSDL <b>files,</b> <b>setting</b> proper access restrictions on WSDL definitions, and avoiding unnecessary definitions in web services is encouraged.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{clustered}} computing {{could only}} be achieved by setting up individual rsh keys, creating NFS shares, editing host <b>files,</b> <b>setting</b> static IPs, and applying kernel patches manually. ClusterKnoppix effectively renders most of this work unnecessary.

5000|$|In DOS, a {{batch file}} can be started from the {{command-line}} interface by typing its name, followed by any required parameters and pressing the [...] "Enter" [...] key. When DOS loads, the file AUTOEXEC.BAT, when present, is automatically executed, so any commands {{that need to}} be run to set up the DOS environment may be placed in this file. Computer users would have the AUTOEXEC.BAT <b>file</b> <b>set</b> up the system date and time, initialize the DOS environment, load any resident programs or device drivers, or initialize network connections and assignments.|$|E
50|$|Target: A Target {{contains}} {{a set of}} tasks for MSBuild to execute. The focus of MSBuild is the result Target specified when invoking MSBuild with the project file. This is because a Project may contain several Target entries, each executed sequentially (and conditionally). Subsequent dependent Targets are executed before the requested Target. The execution flow of the current Target can be directed using the following attributes: Condition, BeforeTargets, AfterTargets, & DependsOnTargets. Each Target may be self-contained with the necessary Tasks to complete itself. A Target is typically an action executed on a <b>file,</b> <b>set</b> of files or directory.|$|E
5000|$|... exFAT and {{the rest}} of the FAT family of file systems does not use indexes for file names, unlike NTFS which uses B-trees for file searching. When a file is accessed, the {{directory}} must be sequentially searched until a match is found. For file names shorter than 16 characters in length, one file name record is required but the entire file is represented by three 32-byte directory records. This is called a directory <b>file</b> <b>set,</b> and a 256 MiB sub-directory can hold up to 2,796,202 file sets. (If files have longer names, this number will decrease but this is the maximum based on the minimum three-record <b>file</b> <b>set.)</b> To help improve the sequential searching of the directories (including the root) a hash value of the file name is derived for each file and stored in the directory record. When searching for a file, the file name is first converted to upper case using the upcase table (file names are case insensitive) and then hashed using a proprietary patented algorithm into a 16-bit (2 byte) hash value. Each record in the directory is searched by comparing the hash value. When a match is found, the file names are compared to ensure that the proper file was located in case of hash collisions. This improves performance because only 2 bytes have to be compared for each file. This significantly reduces the CPU cycles because most file names are more than 2 characters (bytes) in size and virtually every comparison is performed on only 2 bytes at a time until the intended file is located.|$|E

5000|$|In Mac OS X, {{system-wide}} configuration {{files are}} typically {{stored in the}} /Library/ folder, whereas per-user configuration files are stored in the corresponding ~/Library/ folder in the user's home directory, and configuration <b>files</b> <b>set</b> by the system are in /System/Library/. Within these respective directories, an application typically stores a property list file in the Preferences/ sub-directory.|$|R
30|$|The {{database}} {{was split}} randomly into five equal-sized <b>file</b> <b>sets,</b> with one set {{being used as}} test data and other four for training the system.

The evaluation results are presented as the average of the other four folds.|$|R
50|$|AdvFS uses a {{relatively}} advanced {{concept of a}} storage pool (called a file domain) and of logical file systems (called file sets). A file domain is composed of any number of block devices, which could be partitions, LVM or LSM devices. A <b>file</b> <b>set</b> is a logical file system created in a single file domain. Administrators can add or remove volumes from an active file domain, providing that there is enough space on the remaining file domain, in case of removal. This {{was one of the}} trickier original features to implement because all data or metadata residing on the disk being removed had to first be migrated, online, to other disks, prior to removal.|$|E
50|$|Multi-user {{communication}} is through TCP/IP, therefore no proprietary server hardware or software is required. Any computer can {{function as a}} NewViews server or workstation {{as long as it}} has access to a local area network and/or the internet.

A server is simply the NewViews program configured to run as a server and offer access to one or more sets of books. Both workstation and server functionality are included with each NewViews license. Any number of users can work in the same set of books simultaneously; accounts and reports are updated in real-time, even when the books are being accessed remotely.|$|E
