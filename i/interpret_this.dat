5|$|In 1997, a Victims' Rights Amendment {{was added}} to the Virginia Bill of Rights as §8-A. In Nobrega v. Commonwealth, the only case so far to <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> amendment, the Virginia Supreme Court used the Victims’s Rights Amendment to support its ruling that an alleged rape victim could not be {{compelled}} to submit to a psychiatric evaluation.|$|E
5|$|Python allows boolean {{expressions}} {{with multiple}} equality relations {{in a manner}} that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.|$|E
5|$|On Rubicun III, the Edo {{explain to}} Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Worf that capital {{punishment}} {{is used to}} enforce their laws. The away team rush to warn Wesley, only to discover he has accidentally broken a greenhouse while playing catch with the Edo youths. An Edo policeman attempts to give Wesley a lethal injection for this infraction of the law, but Yar and Worf draw their phasers. On the ship, the sphere leaves Data's body and departs. Picard, upon hearing of the situation with Wesley, transports to the surface. He meets {{with representatives of the}} Edo in a council chamber and explains that Earth no longer practices capital punishment. Some Edo <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> stance as an attempt by the Federation to push their superiority and suggest that Picard should mount a rescue effort for the boy. He says he cannot, quoting the Prime Directive.|$|E

25|$|Amillennialist belief {{can also}} <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> passage {{as the nation}} of Israel, however this belief as {{expressed}} by amillennialists refers, not to the modern Israel, but to the Ancient religious state of Israel(Judea) as it existed {{in the time of}} Christ.

25|$|Hostile {{attribution}} bias, or hostile {{attribution of}} intent, is {{the tendency to}} interpret others' behaviors as having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} human sacrifice in the Indian subcontinent {{dates back to}} the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. An Indus seal from Harappa depicts the upside-down nude female figure with legs outspread and a plant issuing from her womb. The reverse side of the seal depicts a man holding a sickle and a woman seated on the ground in a posture of prayer. Many scholars <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> scene as a human sacrifice in honor of the Mother-Goddess, although many historians doubt it.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{controversy}} arose {{over whether}} criticism {{of members of}} Bhumibol's privy council also constituted criticism of Bhumibol. Police Special Branch Commander Lt Gen Theeradech Rodpho-thong refused to file charges of lèse-majesté against activists who launched a petition to oust Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda, declaring that the law only applied {{to members of the}} royal family. Two days later, he was demoted by Police Commander Seripisut Temiyavet. During the Songkran 2009 unrest, Thaksin Shinawatra accused the privy council president of masterminding the 2006 military coup. Royalists chose to <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> as an attack on Bhumibol himself.|$|E
25|$|The idealist {{perspective}} {{on the number of}} the beast rejects gematria, envisioning the number not as a code to be broken, but a symbol to be understood. Because there are so many names that can come to 666 and that most systems require converting names to other languages or adding titles when convenient, it has been impossible to come to a consensus. Given that numbers are used figuratively throughout the book of Revelation, idealists <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> number figuratively as well. The common suggestion is that because seven is a number of completeness and is associated with the divine, that six is incomplete and the three sixes mean completely incomplete.|$|E

25|$|In humans, a mutant variant at {{a single}} site in the FY cis-regulatory region abolishes all {{expression}} of the gene in erythrocyte precursors. As a result, homozygous mutants are strongly protected from infection by P. vivax, and {{a lower level of}} protection is conferred on heterozygotes. The variant has apparently arisen twice in geographically distinct human populations, in Africa and Papua New Guinea. It has been driven to high frequencies on at least two haplotypic backgrounds within Africa. Recent work indicates a similar, but not identical, pattern exists in baboons (Papio cynocephalus), which suffer a mosquito-carried malaria-like pathogen, Hepatocystis kochi. Researchers <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> as a case of convergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|Six loci {{have over}} 100 alleles {{that have been}} {{detected}} in the human population. Of these, the most variable are HLA B and HLA DRB1. As of 2012, the number of alleles that have been determined {{are listed in the}} table below. To <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> table, it is necessary to consider that an allele is a variant of the nucleotide (DNA) sequence at a locus, such that each allele differs from all other alleles in at least one (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP) position. Most of these changes result in a change in the amino acid sequences that result in slight to major functional differences in the protein.|$|E
25|$|His lifework {{was based}} on his {{conviction}} that the Church was founded by God and entrusted {{with the task of}} embracing all mankind in a single society in which divine will is the only law; that, in her capacity as a divine institution, she is supreme over all human structures, especially the secular state; and that the pope, in his role as head of the Church, is the vice-regent of God on earth, so that disobedience to him implies disobedience to God: or, in other words, a defection from Christianity. But any attempt to <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> in terms of action would have bound the Church to annihilate not merely a single state, but all states.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} the 'Bridge' banknotes was initiated in 2006 by the Danish National Bank. The {{theme of the}} new banknotes is Danish bridges and the surrounding landscapes, or details from these landscapes. Danish artist Karin Birgitte Lund has chosen to <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> theme in two ways: bridges as links between various parts of Denmark and as links between {{the past and the}} present. The present is represented by the bridges, the past by five distinctive prehistoric objects found near the bridges. Among the new security features is a window thread ("Motion") with a moving wave pattern. Another feature is a new, sophisticated hologram that reflects light in different colors. The new banknotes also have the traditional security features such as the watermark and the hidden security thread.|$|E
25|$|In December 1938, only a {{month after}} he had taken up the post, Hore-Belisha had begun to {{consider}} the possibility of recalling Ironside to become Inspector-General of Overseas Forces. The position gave him overall responsibility for the readiness of forces based outside the United Kingdom, and many at the War Office worried that he might <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> as a precursor to being given formal command of the Expeditionary Force on the outbreak of war. However, after some debate, Hore-Belisha went ahead and offered Ironside the position in May, appointing a corresponding Inspector-General of Home Forces at the same time, both under Lord Gort's command. The decision to recall Ironside may have been helped by the fact that Hore-Belisha was particularly reliant on the advice of Liddell Hart, an old acquaintance of Ironside's, who was already beginning to fall out with Gort.|$|E
25|$|In this view, {{the beast}} {{from the sea}} is {{interpreted}} as the state or any human kingdom that is in opposition to God. This would include the Roman Empire but would broadly apply to all empires. Scholars take their cue from the parallels between Revelation 13 and Daniel 7, noting that in Daniel 7:17 that the beasts are revealed as kingdoms. Therefore, given that the beast of Revelation thirteen is a composite of the beasts of Daniel, one should similarly <b>interpret</b> <b>this</b> beast as a kingdom, more specifically a composite of all kingdoms. Similarly, in some idealist circles, {{it is suggested that}} the beast represents different social injustices, such as exploitation of workers, wealth, the elite, commerce, materialism, and imperialism. Various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques Ellul, have associated the State and political power as the beast.|$|E
