40|$|Accessibility is {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} a property of a point or region in space, and to be invariant over time (or at least over some computationally convenient time interval). How- ever, a locations accessibility can vary over time {{on a wide range of}} scales. This temporal variation is especially significant for schedule-based transportation systems. Current measures of accessibility generally reflect the accessibility only at points in time corresponding to the departures of one or more trips; accessibility between these time points remains unconsidered and undefined. Consequently, these measures are insensitive to changes <b>in</b> <b>route</b> <b>frequency</b> and the distribution of trip departure times. Furthermore, these approaches ignore the disutility experienced by a system user who is limited to departing or arriving at scheduled times rather than at preferred times. As a result, they systematically overestimate the accessibility experienced by users of scheduled transportation systems. We establish new methods for representing the accessibility provided by a schedule-based transportation system from a specific location as a continuously-defined accessibility function (CDAF) of desired departure time, defined for all time points. Using schedule and route information from metropolitan transit providers, we demonstrate the application of these methods to gain new insight into the accessibility provided by real-world transportation systems. Four examples are developed to represent common service types in metropolitan transit networks. The results confirm that accessibility is significantly overestimated by measuring single points and show that trip frequency is more valuable for sustained accessibility than high accessibility on individual trips.

AM-AOMDV extends AOMDV by including many route metrics, a new local route update, and route maintenance algorithm. The latter uses one-hop information exchange between one-hop nodes to improve route longevity. The modified technique improved packet delivery ratio and decreased end-to-end delay. Significant improvement {{was also found}} <b>in</b> <b>route</b> discovery <b>frequency</b> and routing overhead during node mobility.

40|$|Abstract Changes at the {{landscape}} scale associated with expansion in {{agricultural land use}} and changes in agricultural practices are common causes of alteration in patterns of abundance and composition of avian communities. Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata - Des Murs, 1847) {{is among the most}} common species in the Neotropics, considered both as game and pest in some countries. Here we characterized the regional and seasonal patterns of Eared Doves abundance in Southwestern Brazil and examined the relationship between landscape features and these abundance patterns. We counted Eared Doves using the point count system along <b>routes</b> <b>in</b> summer and winter and recorded land use at two scales. We used linear regressions to model the effect of landscape matrix and land use at local scale with Doves abundance in two seasons. At {{the landscape}} scale, in winter, the abundance was greater <b>in</b> <b>routes</b> crossing landscapes dominated by plantations. In summer, it was lower <b>in</b> <b>routes</b> with large tracts of forests and mixed farming. While in winter, at the local scale, the Doves abundance was greater <b>in</b> <b>routes</b> with higher <b>frequency</b> of maize plantations, in summer higher abundances were observed <b>in</b> <b>routes</b> with higher <b>frequency</b> of sugar cane and soybean plantations.

The decision makers of such expensive, out-of-focus and fuzzy undertakings seldom consider the life-threatening consequences of wrong and reductionist approaches to drug development for patients and the tremendous economic burden to the society. The irresponsible decision makers of such undertakings, either abandon data on failed outcomes or downplay and ignore the serious consequences of drugs that, at best, postpone patient’s death-sentence for a few months of remission [18 – 22, 33 – 39, 44 – 47]. Once such expensively developed drugs (poisons) failed patients the trials are suspended and soon drug manufactures and decision makers proceed to make minor or major changes to the same protocols (e.g., changes <b>in</b> dosage, <b>route</b> and <b>frequency</b> of drug administration or use of combination drugs). Such strategies are again highly publicized as “new” approaches to cancer drugs through control of media using the same empty promises to justify additional support for recruiting desperate patients in expensive schemes of clinical trials [2 – 5, 7, 13, 18, 22, 30 – 38, 41 – 44].|$|R

40|$|Airport {{infrastructures}} play {{an important}} role in the heart of the regions in which they are located, as well as in certain sectors of activity, such as tourism. In recent years, their positioning has been altered from a passive attitude to an active attitude due to new market demands and new trends which have arisen in associated sectors, such as the air transport sector. The 1997 deregulation of air transport in Europe led to major changes on the way people travel, with the inception of low cost and an increase in destinations in European air services. One of the most interesting results of deregulation, was caused by the fact that the low cost airlines appeared on the market with a business model distinct from the traditional scheduled and charter airlines, allowing for the opening up of new airports and new tourist destinations. Those airlines are also responsible for some of the main changes in the airports operations and market positioning. The increase <b>in</b> <b>routes</b> and <b>frequencies</b> offered by these airlines enabled the emergence of new tourist destinations in Europe that spread, later on, to other places all over the world. The ease of purchasing an airline ticket online, and the availability of attractive routes at affordable prices has allowed the development of new market segments, such as second home tourism. One of the main impacts of low cost operations has been the changing of airport's structures, mainly to the ones that traditionally received charter flights. Faro airport is an excellent example of this. During the last decades Faro's main operations depended on charter flights, operating on a seasonal basis and few frequencies a week. In 1996 charter passengers represented about 85, 3 % of Faro airport's users but in 2010 this came down to represent less than 20 %. In contrast, low cost passengers represented in 1996 about 1, 2 % of Faro airport's users and almost 70 % in 2010. ...|$|R

The objective is to maximize the <b>route</b> <b>frequencies</b> and mileage to provide good passenger service and simultaneously minimize crew overtime and meal-break delays. To mitigate unexpected delays due to uncertainties in operations, various mathematical models are proposed for revising the schedules in real time under a rolling-horizon framework.

The simulation results also identify {{the potential benefits of}} revising the schedule dynamically in real time using optimization models.

In particular, a detailed research on MoS routes calling at Italian ports, in the year 2015 is carried out; within MoS routes: ro-pax and only cargo ro-ro services are identified. MoS <b>routes</b> <b>in</b> the year 2015 are compared {{with those in the}} years: 2008, 2010 and 2012. The study highlights two main aspects. Firstly, the great majority of MoS <b>routes</b> <b>in</b> Italy are ro-pax ones: ro-ro routes are only 31 % of the total, but ro-pax service frequencies are highly variable during the year, from high to low season. Secondly, due to the economic crisis, carriers are trying to operate services with high load factors and trying to find new markets: in fact from 2008 to 2015 <b>routes</b> <b>frequencies</b> have decreased, while the number of port calls <b>in</b> each <b>route</b> has increased. Finally, the capability of ro-ro and ro-pax routes of being competitive versus all-road transport has been analyzed. The analysis has shown that both ro-ro and ro-pax routes show relevant problems as far as their competitiveness against all-road transport is concerned. Ro-pax routes are not reliable, ro-ro routes are not fast and frequent: consequently they both do not fulfill essential requirements for MoS services...|$|R
50|$|The severe {{recession}} {{of the early}} 1980s necessitated a major retrenchment, resulting <b>in</b> extensive <b>frequency,</b> <b>route</b> and staff cutbacks. This entailed the closure of bases at Bournemouth, Humberside and Stansted {{as well as a}} major reduction in operations at Southend. As a consequence of these cutbacks, ten turboprop aircraft (seven Heralds and three Bandeirantes) were withdrawn from service while the two F-28 jets were leased out to French regional carrier Air Alsace. This in turn resulted in the closure of the former BIA engineering base at Blackpool, accounting for 220 {{out of a total of}} 400 job losses. It also resulted in the suspension of scheduled passenger and cargo services to 14 points by late 1981. At the start of the 1981-82 winter timetable in November 1981, Air UK relaunched scheduled operations from Stansted by opening a new route to Amsterdam. This was the first international scheduled service from London's third airport in over ten years. The resulting network linked 20 points in the British Isles and six in Europe. Management hoped that these business realignments — including cutting the company's workforce in half over a two-year period — would reverse heavy losses Air UK had incurred during its first two years of operation, thereby stabilising the company and positioning it for future growth.|$|R
