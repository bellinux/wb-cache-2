40|$|Abstract Background Most European {{health care}} systems are {{suffering}} from the impact of demographic change. In short, aging of society is leading to higher costs of treatment per capita, while reproduction rates below 2. 1 children per woman lead to a reduced number of younger people {{to provide for the}} necessary contributions into the health insurance system. This research paper addresses the questions what impact the demographic development will have on one particular spending area, what are pharmaceutical expenditure in two of Europe’s largest {{health care systems}}, Germany and France, and what the implications are for pharmaceutical companies. Methods The research is based on publicly available data from German and French health ministries, the OECD, and institutes which focus on projection of demographic development in those countries. In a first step, data was clustered into age groups, and average spending on pharmaceuticals was allocated to that. In the second step, these figures were extrapolated, based on the projected change in the demographic structure of the countries from 2004 until 2050. This leads to a deeper understanding of demand for pharmaceutical products in the future due to the demographic development as a single driving factor. Results Pharmaceutical <b>expenses</b> per <b>head</b> (patient) will grow only slightly until 2050 (0. 5 % p. a. in both countries). Demographic change alone only provides for a slowly growing market for pharmaceutical companies both in Germany and in France, but for a relevant change in the consumption mix of pharmaceutical products, based on a shift of relevance of different age groups. Conclusions Despite demographic changes pharmaceutical <b>expenses</b> per <b>head</b> (patient) and the overall pharmaceutical markets will grow only slightly until 2050 in Germany as well as in France. Nevertheless, the aging of society implies different challenges for pharmaceutical companies and also for the health care system. Companies have to cope with the shift of relevance of different age groups and within the health care system new options for financing the slowly growing expenses have to be found. </p...|$|R

Despite the pivotal role of gastrulation in animal development, the cellular interactions underlying this process are poorly understood. In zebrafish, mesoderm and endoderm formation requires the Nodal signals Cyclops and Squint and their cofactor One-eyed pinhead (Oep) [10 – 14]. We found that marginal cells in maternal-zygotic oep (MZoep) mutants do not internalize during gastrulation and acquire neural and tail fates at the <b>expense</b> of <b>head</b> and trunk mesendoderm. The lack of internalization in MZoep embryos and the cell-autonomous requirement for oep in Nodal signaling enabled us to test whether internalization {{can be achieved by}} individual cells or whether it depends on interactions within a group of cells. We found that individual MZoep mutant cells transplanted to the margin of wild-type blastula embryos initially internalize with their neighbors but are unable to contribute to the mesendoderm. In the reciprocal experiment, single wild-type cells transplanted to the margin of MZoep mutant embryos autonomously internalize and can express the mesendodermal markers axial/foxA 2 and sox 17. These results suggest that internalization and mesendoderm formation in zebrafish can be attained autonomously by single cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{vertebrate}} gastrulation, a ventral to dorsal gradient of {{bone morphogenetic protein}} (Bmp) activity establishes cell fates. Concomitantly, convergent extension movements narrow germ layers mediolaterally while lengthening them anteroposteriorly. Here, {{by measuring}} movements of cell populations in vivo, we reveal the presence of three domains of convergent extension movements in zebrafish gastrula. Ventrally, convergence and extension movements are absent. Lateral cell populations converge and extend at increasing speed until they reach the dorsal domain where convergence speed slows but extension remains strong. Using dorsalized and ventralized mutants, we demonstrate that these domains are specified by the Bmp activity gradient. In vivo cell morphology and behavior analyses indicated that low levels of Bmp activity might promote extension with little convergence by allowing mediolateral cell elongation and dorsally biased intercalation. Further, single cell movement analyses revealed that the high ventral levels of Bmp activity promote epibolic migration of cells into the tailbud, increasing tail formation at the <b>expense</b> of <b>head</b> and trunk. We show that high Bmp activity limits convergence and extension by negatively regulating expression of the wnt 11 (silberblick) and wnt 5 a (pipetail) genes, which are required for convergent extension but not cell fate specification. Therefore, during vertebrate gastrulation, a single gradient of Bmp activity, which specifies cell fates, also regulates the morphogenetic process of convergent extension...|$|R

ABSTRACT: This document performs profile analysis of income inequalities in Cameroon, between 1996 and 2001. It concerns origin determination and the components of inequalities in Cameroon. The study is structured around the new subgroup decomposition of the Hirschman-Herfindahl index. The economic and empirical pertinence of this indicator holds on its tridecomposition into three components: the within group’s, the between group’s net and the between group’s transvariation. Inequalities are evaluated by grouping and lead to differents interpretations. The selected data for analysis are from the two Cameroonian Surveys to Households ECAM I and ECAM II. The dependent variable (total <b>expenses</b> per <b>head),</b> the independent variables (sex, place of residence and standard of living) and also the method (simulator H-H) have a particular interest in our work. The analyses results indicate that households present a very strong inequality of expenses on considered period. Heterogeneity is very important between groups while, homogeneity is quite considerable within the different groups. The contribution of the transvariation (or overlapping) to the total inequality revealed itself to be incontestable and varies depending on the dependent variable studied.

40|$|Xenopus Pitx 1 is a {{homeobox}} gene whose {{family members are}} structurally and functionary conserved in organisms as diverse as Drosophila, chick, mouse, human, and frog. Present as a maternal transcript, the gene is zygotically expressed during gastrulation in a dorsal streak of cells. This streak restricts to a small circular domain underlying the center of presumptive neural plate. Shortly thereafter, a crescent of expression develops at the border of anterior neural ectoderm, and as the central plate domain diminishes, the crescent coalesces to define the presumptive cement gland. Expression remains high throughout cement gland development, and subsequently expands to include ectodermal cells involved in stomodeal invagination. During early organogenesis, expression ensues in developing eye, posterior lateral mesoderm, and first branchial arch derivatives. Ectopic expression of xPitx 1 causes head deformities including enlarged cement gland, ectopic cement glands, and posterior deformities or, in extreme cases, inhibition of recognizable structures posterior to the cement gland. Expression of markers such as XCG- 1, xOtx 2, xPax 6, neural beta tubulin, and xTwist suggest that increases in cement gland and lower mandibular size are likely at the <b>expense</b> of other <b>head</b> tissues. Paradoxically, overexpression is sufficient to partially rescue embryos that are axially perturbed by ultraviolet irradiation or retinoic acid administration. Ectopic expression of xPitx 1 in ectodermal explants directly promotes cement gland development as {{there was no evidence}} that mesodermal or neural tissue was present in explants. genesis 29 : 18 - 90, 2001.

40|$|Among the {{creative}} contributions that the late Charles H.

Charles stood in firm opposition to recent trends that, in his view, had served to strengthen the policymaking role of administrative judges at the <b>expense</b> of agency <b>heads.</b> He insisted that ultimate control over the policy direction of a program should rest with the officials who have been appointed to administer that program. While adhering to this baseline, however, Charles gravitated over time toward a nuanced view that sought to define an affirmative role for administrative judges in the policymaking process. He suggested, for example, that these judges could be helpful to agencies by initiating proposals for new directions and by building records that would enable agencies to appraise those proposals. In this sense, he argued, administrative judges could work in collaboration with, rather than at cross-purposes with, the agencies {{to which they are}} answerable. This memorial essay aims to review Charles’s analysis of this generally neglected topic and to contribute a few additional insights to the discussion. After examining the background issue of where ultimate policy control should rest, the essay describes and evaluates several of Charles’s ideas for refinement of the role of administrative judges as policymakers.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if providing either enteral nutrition or oral nutrition to patients influenced nutritional parameters, length of stay (LOS) and cost. All patients who received enteral nutrition support between January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999 at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple, TX were evaluated in a retrospective chart review. Malnutrition- and disease-matched patients who received oral nutrition support were selected from the hospital's patient database. Of a total of 276 patients; 189 received enteral nutrition and 87 received oral nutrition. Admission and discharge laboratory values, functional ability, LOS, total medical expenses, and pharmaceutical expenses were compared between groups. Statistical analyses included Student's t-test, Chi-Square, and the General Linear Model. Results included the following: at admission enteral nutrition patients weighed significantly more (P < 0. 001) and had an increased body mass index (BMI) (P < 0. 01) compared to oral nutrition patients. Change between admission and discharge parameters related to nutrition were not significantly different between the two groups. Values at discharge for prealbumin, albumin, and total lymphocyte count were within ranges considered malnourished as they had been at admission. Initial financial analysis indicated that enteral nutrition patients had a significantly longer LOS and greater medical expenses. Both groups of surgical patients had increased total cost (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 01 for enteral and oral nutrition groups, respectively) as compared to medical patients. Additionally, the enteral and oral nutrition groups were not significantly different for LOS or medical <b>expenses</b> for <b>head</b> and neck cancer patients receiving radiation treatment or chemotherapy. Results of this study have demonstrated several points. First, appropriate nutrition intervention, both through enteral or oral nutrition, may maintain a patient's nutritional status; and even if outcomes are not significantly improved, nutrition support may prevent further nutritional decline during the hospital stay. Secondly, based on laboratory values, patients may not have made a full nutritional recovery by discharge. Finally, malnourished head and neck cancer patients should receive nutrition intervention based on individual needs; according to our data, providing enteral nutrition does not increase LOS or medical expenses...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} head {{development}} {{is complex and}} {{with the exception of}} the hindbrain region, it is unlike trunk development in as much as it does not involve discrete segmentation. Recent evidence suggests that the paired-like family of genes play a role in regulating anterior development. To further understand the role that these genes possess, we have cloned the Xenopus homolog of Prix 1. XPitx 1 is present as a maternal transcript with expression observed as a dorsal streak during gastrulation. This streak restricts to a small circular domain underlying the centre of presumptive neural plate. Concomitantly, a crescent of expression is observed at the border of anterior neural ectoderm. Expression of xPitx 1 persists throughout the cement gland anlage during gastrulation. At the onset of organogenesis, xPitx 1 is expressed within the cement gland, eye, lateral plate mesoderm, and first branchial arch derivatives. Misexpression of xPitx 1 in whole embryos leads to the formation of enlarged or ectopic cement glands. In addition, variable posterior deficits are observed with extreme cases where the embryo exhibits no recognizable structures posterior to the cement gland. Expression of markers such as XCG- 1, xOtx 2, xPar 6, and xTwist suggest that increases in cement gland and lower mandibular size are likely at the <b>expense</b> of other <b>head</b> tissues. Conversely, antagonization of xPitx 1 with a mutant form of the gene results in cement gland inhibition and head malformations. Animal cap assays show that xPitx 1 can directly induce cement gland formation and that induction requires DNA binding by xPitx 1.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the job-related {{expenditures}} of female household heads. Also examined were levels of education, occupations, presence of dependent children, employment benefits and reasons for working. A random sample of 75 female household heads was drawn from the 1973 Polk's Corvallis City Directory. The sample was composed of 28 divorced, 3 separated, 15 single and 28 widowed women living in Corvallis, Oregon. The interviews were conducted during March and April of 1974. The median age for the 75 household heads was 51 years. They had completed a mean of 15 years of schooling. Single household heads were both younger, with a median age of 32, and had a higher level of education, 17 years, than widows and divorced women. Forty-nine percent of the female household heads were professional workers; 39 percent were clerical and sales workers; and the remaining 12 percent were semiskilled workers. Eighty percent of the single household heads were employed in professional occupations, compared with 45 percent of the widows and 38 percent of the divorced and separated women. Median employment income for all 75 household heads was 7, 249. For the 68 women who had worked the entire year, the median employment income was 7, 500 and the mean, 8, 162. Hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 1, there is no relationship between level of education of the female household head and amount of earnings, was not supported by the data and it was rejected. As the level of education increased, the employment income also increased. Household heads who had not completed high school were employed in the lowest-paying occupations. Full-time workers who were college graduates earned 52 percent more than high school graduates and 14 percent more than household heads with some college education. Household heads who had master's degrees earned 36 percent more than college graduates. Household heads with doctoral degrees earned 28 percent more than those with master's degrees. Hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 2, between 40 and 50 percent of the employed female household heads' income from gainful employment was absorbed by job-related expenditures, was not supported by the data. There was a significant difference at the. 01 level and the hypothesis was rejected. Female household heads in the study reported 35. 8 percent of their cash employment income was used for job-related expenditures or a mean of 2, 930. Payroll deductions absorbed the highest percentage of employment income, 26. 5 percent or a mean of 2, 164. Federal income taxes were the highest reported expense, 13. 7 percent, with a mean of 1, 122 and a range of 1. 15 to 4, 441. Directly-related expenses were reported as 5. 2 percent of the employment income. Education related to the job and transportation were the highest directly-related expenses, 1. 5 and 1. 6 percent, respectively. Indirectly-related expenses amounted to 4. 1 percent of the employment income. Clothing needed for work was the most expensive indirectly-related expense reported, 1. 5 percent. Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 3, there is no difference in percentage of employment income spent for job-related expenses of female household heads with dependent children aged 18 and under and those without dependent children, was accepted since no significant difference in the percentage of income spent was found at the. 025 level in a two-tailed "t" test. Female household heads with dependent children reported 36. 9 percent of their employment income was spent on job-related expenses and those without children reported 35. 8 percent. Hypothesis 4. For female household heads with dependent children aged 18 and under, there is no difference in the percentage of employment income spent for job-related <b>expenses</b> of household <b>heads</b> with preschool children and those with no preschool children. Hypothesis 4 was not tested. Only two household heads in the study had children of preschool age. Female household heads reported receiving a mean dollar value of 168 in employment benefits. Eighty-three percent of the 75 workers reported receiving health insurance with a mean value of 79. Cash bonuses were valued at a mean of 22 and employer discounts at 21 for all workers. A combined mean dollar value of 44 was received for meals, coffee and snacks, life insurance, gifts from the employer, laundering and drycleaning of work clothing and discounts from other organizations. Only two reasons for working were given by more than 50 percent of the 75 household heads, These reasons were to pay for current living expenses and because they enjoyed working...|$|R
