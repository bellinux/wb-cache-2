40|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} tumors, {{it is necessary}} to kill <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancer</b> cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the "vascular niche" synergistically. Although nanoparticles (NPs) have been used to deliver drugs to the action sites, inert materials with high toxicity may reduce the drug loading content and cause side-effects to kidneys and other organs in the course of degradation and excretion. Here, we report hypoxia-responsive drug-drug conjugated NPs to deliver three drugs to kill <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancer</b> cells, CSCs and the "vascular niche" synergistically, which could selectively release the drugs to treat cells in hypoxic tumors. For this purpose, an azobenzene (AZO) bond imparting hypoxia sensitivity and specificity as a crosslinker conjugated hydrophobic combretastatin A- 4 (CA 4) with hydrophilic irinotecan (IR) to form IR-AZO-CA 4 amphiphilic molecules. These molecules self-assembled into NPs, which could encapsulate hydrophobic anti-CSCs drug cyclopamine (CP). The drug-drug conjugated NPs had high drug loading content. As expected, the AZO linker could be broken under hypoxia conditions and the NPs were disassembled to release drugs quickly. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) results indicated that the IR-AZO-CA 4 /CP NPs could enhance the cellular uptake of drugs and the permeability of drugs to the inner of CSCs, beneficial for tumor therapy. Furthermore, the IR-AZO-CA 4 /CP NPs could inhibit the migration, invasion and mammosphere formation capacity of CSCs. More importantly, only IR-AZO-CA 4 /CP NPs could simultaneously inhibit <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancer</b> cells, CSCs and endothelial cells without interference on the cell under a normoxic environment. The present study suggests that the IR-AZO-CA 4 /CP NPs provide a promising therapeutic approach for anticancer treatment...|$|E

40|$|The {{release of}} {{urokinase}} plasminogen activator (uPA) from endometrial stromal cells decreased after progesterone stimulation, due to upregulation of PA inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1) and uPA receptor (uPAR). Subsequently, the uPA:PAI- 1 complex was internalized and degraded via uPAR. Predecidual {{cells in the}} late secretory phase expressed PAI- 1 and uPAR, supporting a specific role for predecidual cells in the down-regulation of uPA. The tissue content of uPA protein and mRNA did not vary over the menstrual cycle. The tissue distribution of uPA and uPAR mRNAs and proteins indicated that the proteins bind in a paracrine way to epithelial cells. All factors were strongly expressed in the menstrual phase, suggesting a function in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and blood clot lysis during menstruation. Malignant endometrial tissue had a higher content of uPA protein than normal tissue. Also, the uPA content gradually increased from simple hyperplasia to poorly <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancer.</b> In contrast, the content of tPA mRNA and protein gradually decreased from simple hyperplasia to poorly <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancer.</b> The tumor tissue content of PAI- 2 was a marker of poor postoperative prognosis in patients with endometrial cancer (HR= 3. 0; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 7. 1), whereas the content of uPAR {{was not associated with}} survival.

METHODS: GA tissues in different pathological gradings and normal tissues {{were subjected to}} tissue arrays. Expressions of 15 major tumor-related genes were detected by RNA in situ hybridization along with 3 ' terminal digoxin-labeled anti-sense single stranded oligonucleotide and locked nucleic acid modifying probe within the tissue array. The data obtained were processed by support vector machines by four different feature selection methods to discover the respective critical gene/gene subsets contributing to the GA activities of different pathological gradings. RESULTS: In comparison of poorly differentiated GA with normal tissues, tumor-related gene TP 53 plays a key role, although other six tumor-related genes could also achieve the Area Under Curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic independently by more than 80 %. Comparing the well differentiated GA with normal tissues, we found that 11 tumor-related genes could independently obtain the AUC by more than 80 %, but only the gene subsets, TP 53, RB and PTEN, play a key role. Only the gene subsets, Bcl 10, UVRAG, APC, Beclin 1, NM 23, PTEN and RB could distinguish between the poorly differentiated and well differentiated GA. None of a single gene could obtain a valid distinction.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between radioiodine therapy and risk of nonsynchronous second primary malignancy and to examine whether the risk of nonsynchronous second primary malignancy in <b>differentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> survivors treated with radioiodine therapy is increased relative to the general population. Methods: Among 895 radiation-naïve patients with <b>differentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer,</b> 643 (71. 8 %) received ≥ 1 course of radioiodine therapy (radioiodine therapy-positive group) and 252 (28. 2 %) received no radioiodine therapy (radioiodine therapy-negative group). After a median follow-up of 93. 5 months (range, 23. 4 - 570. 8), 64 (7. 2 %) patients developed ≥ 1 nonsynchronous second primary malignancy. Potential risk factors for nonsynchronous second primary malignancy were entered into a multivariable regression model and cancer incidence in the radioiodine therapy-positive and -negative groups were compared to that of the general population by estimating the standardized incidence ratios. Results: The 20 -year cumulative nonsynchronous second primary malignancy risk in radioiodine therapy-positive group was significantly higher than radioiodine therapy-negative group (13. 5 % vs 3. 1 %; P =. 015). Cumulative radioiodine therapy activity of 3. 0 to 8. 9 GBq (relative risk, 2. 77; 95 % CI, 1. 079 - 7. 154; P =. 034) was the only independent risk factor for nonsynchronous second primary malignancy after adjusting for age, sex, period of <b>differentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> diagnosis, and stage of <b>differentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer.</b> For females, the standardized incidence ratio in the radioiodine therapy-positive group was 1. 54 (95 % CI, 1. 11 - 2. 08) and in the radioiodine therapy-negative group it was 0. 92 (95 % CI, 0. 37 - 1. 90). Conclusion: <b>Differentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> female survivors treated by radioiodine therapy appeared to be at elevated risk of nonsynchronous second primary malignancy when compared to the general population and this risk was not apparent in those not previously treated by radioiodine therapy. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} Her- 2 /Neu-cerbb- 2 in the gastric mucosa of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma in a brazilian patient group. METHODS: The immunohistochemical expression of Her- 2 /Neu was studied in 37 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. RESULTS: The immunohistochemical reaction produced by the anti-HER- 2 /Neu antibody was positive in two cases (5. 4 %). CONCLUSION: The low prevalence of Her- 2 /Neu observed in these southern brazilian cases is {{probably due to the}} great number of poorly <b>differentiated</b> <b>cancers</b> in this serie...|$|R
