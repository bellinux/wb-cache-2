40|$|Abstract—New {{applications}} {{based on}} cloud computing, such as data synchronization for large chain departmental stores and bank transaction records, require very high-speed data transport. Although {{a number of}} high-bandwidth networks have been built, existing transport protocols or their variants over such networks cannot fully exploit the network bandwidth. Our experiments show that the fixed-size application level buffer employed in the receiver side is {{a major cause of}} this deficiency. A buffer that is either too small or too large impairs the transfer performance. Due to the varied natures of network conditions and of real-time packet processing (i. e., consuming) speed at the receiver, it is important to ensure that the buffer size is dynamically adjusted according to the perceived execution situation during runtime. In this paper, we propose Rada, a dynamic receiving buffer adaptation scheme for high-speed data transfer. Rada employs an Exponential Moving Average aided scheme to quantify the data arrival rate and consumption rate in the buffer. Based on these two rates, we develop a Linear Aggressive Increase Conservative Decrease scheme to adjust the buffer size dynamically. Moreover, a Weighted Mean Function is employed to make the adjustment adaptive to the available memory in the receiver. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the rationale and parameter bounds of Rada. The performance of Rada is also theoretically compared with potential alternatives. We implement Rada in a Linux platform and extensively evaluate its performance in a variety of scenarios. Experimental results conform to the theoretical results, and show that Rada outperforms the static buffer scheme in terms of throughput, memory footprint, and fairness.

SNR's design incorporates a novel feature, specifically, periodic and frequent exchange of state information to coordinate {{the actions of the}} transmitter and receiver. This innovation exploits the higher bandwidth of modern fiber optic networks to increase data transmission rates. Traditional methods used to verify SNR have been largely unsuccessful because of the protocol's inherit complexity. The protocol functions as an asynchronous concurrent system and for that reason we apply a mechanical verification tool called Murphi. The Murphi Verification System is used to verify two phases of SNR, the connection establishment phase and <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> phase operating under Mode 0 (no error or flow control) and Mode 1 (flow control only).

We conducted our experiments with two representative applications on two flavors of Unix, viz., Solaris and Linux. There are several interesting insights coming from this study. First, memory allocation does not take up a significant amount of the execution time despite the interactive and dynamic nature of the application domain. Second, the Stampede runtime adds a minimal overhead over raw messaging for structuring such applications.

40|$|Abstract—The high {{mobility}} of vehicles and the unreliable wireless communication significantly degrade {{the performance of}} data access in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). To address this problem, we propose a novel vehicle-platoon-aware data access solution called V-PADA. In V-PADA, vehicles contribute part of their buffers to replicate data for others in the same platoon and share data with them. When a vehicle leaves the platoon, it prefetches interested <b>data</b> and <b>transfers</b> its <b>buffered</b> <b>data</b> to other vehicles in advance {{so that they can}} still access the data after it leaves. To achieve this goal, V-PADA consists of two components: First, a vehicle-platooning protocol is designed to identify platoon formation and predict platoon splits. We use stochastic time series analysis to detect platoon and mobility anomalies and further introduce a two-step split prediction method to reduce the false alarm rate due to road curves. Second, a data management component is designed to guide platoon members to replicate and prefetch the most suitable data so that both high data availability and low data access overhead can be achieved. Extensive simulation results show that V-PADA can effectively improve the data access performance in VANETs. Index Terms—Data replication, platoon, vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Due to {{the high}} vehicle mobility, the {{topology}} of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) dynamically changes, and disconnections may frequently occur. When two vehicles are disconnected, they {{are not able to}} access data from each other. Data replication has been widely used to reduce the effect of intermittent connectivity and improve data access performance in distributed systems. However, many nodes in VANET may only have limited storage space, and thus cannot replicate all the data such as large music files or video clips. To address this problem, we propose an efficient data replication method for data access applications in VANETs. In this method the vehicles are grouped into a platoon and they contribute part of their buffers to replicate data for others in the same platoon and share data with them. When a vehicle leaves the platoon, it prefetches interested <b>data</b> and <b>transfers</b> its <b>buffered</b> <b>data</b> to other vehicles in advance so that they can still access the data after it leaves.
