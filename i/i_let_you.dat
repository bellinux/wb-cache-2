500|$|Choosing to self-title the album, Lazzara said: [...] "We haven’t had , {{and going}} back to the {{original}} lineup, it seems appropriate." [...] Nolan mentioned a recurring theme throughout the album: [...] "The issue of being an adult with a real life and a long-term relationship or marriage, and trying to make that work." [...] The album's sound has been described as rock. Band members made up their own sequences for the track listing, then noted the similarities. Lazzara said [...] "...with El Paso ... Why not come out swinging?" [...] The track {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, and Lazzara said it encapsulates [...] "both the mood of the environment we were in down there and the mood we were in about being back together again and writing new music". Lazzara called it [...] "probably the heaviest rock song we've ever written". After the group finished the track, they listened to it 15 or 16 times in a row, and proceeded to exclaim: [...] "Holy shit." [...] "When everybody's like 'Holy shit' about something, you're onto something. It's a total motorcycle-raging-down-the-highway kind of song." [...] Lazzara said [...] "Faith (When <b>I</b> <b>Let</b> <b>You</b> Down)" [...] matches a [...] "huge, punishing" [...] chorus with a soft verse, which comes across as a [...] "roller coaster" [...] to him. Lazzara mentioned that the track took longer to work on compared to the other songs on the album, going through 4 or 5 sets of lyrics.|$|E

I [...] {{like to see you}} do better than I." [...] Thiệu continually predicted the demise of the Vietnamese Communist Party's grip on power and warned against the United States establishing diplomatic relations with the communist regime. [...] (Relations between the U.S. and the communist regime in Hanoi were formally established in 1995.) Thiệu said that when the communists were deposed and when [...] "democracy is recovered" [...] that he would return to his homeland, but their hold on Vietnam remained unchallenged during his lifetime. He futilely offered to represent the refugee community in reconciliation talks with Hanoi to allow exiles to return home.|$|E
