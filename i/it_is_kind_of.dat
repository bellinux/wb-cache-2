So, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a cute way of putting it out there. You know, like, 'You want a piece of me?', you know, in a cool, cute and clever way. It is a cute song [...] I like it".|$|E

As {{they began to}} read, the duo noticed {{that it had a}} {{tendency}} to take [...] "readers on a lot of side trips"—"from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists," [...] professed The Hollywood Reporter Gregg Kilday. Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was just wondering what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E

5000|$|Interviewed in 2007, Paul Anka said he {{had been}} [...] "somewhat destabilized by the Sex Pistols' version. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> curious, but I felt he (Sid Vicious) was sincere about it." ...|$|R
500|$|Will Smith {{signed on}} to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like [...] "Gladiator [...] Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [...] always felt like it had those {{possibilities}} to me." [...] The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that [...] "when you're on your own, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hard to find conflict." [...] The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with {{a person who had}} been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, [...] "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" [...] He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000).|$|E

2500|$|Film {{director}} Edgar Wright {{and actor}} Simon Pegg are big fans of Assault. [...] "You wouldn't really {{call it an}} action film," [...] claims Pegg, [...] "because it was pre- the evolution {{of that kind of}} film. And yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> an action film in a way." [...] "It's very much his [...] kind of urban western", adds Wright, [...] "in the way it is staging Rio Bravo set up in downtown 70s LA... And the other thing is, for a low-budget film particularly, it looks great." [...] In October 2011, artist Tyler Stout premiered his mondo-style poster of Assault. Stout's poster would later serve as the cover on the Region B Blu-ray of Assault.|$|E

6000|$|... "But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mean to Harriet," [...] said Anne rebukingly, [...] "to go {{with her}} and get her talked about and then drop her as you did. Don't you think so yourself, Jerome?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In early August 2005, leaked emails {{from former}} US {{prosecutors}} criticised the legal process, accusing it of being [...] "a half-hearted and disorganised effort by a skeleton group of relatively inexperienced attorneys to prosecute fairly low-level accused {{in a process}} that appears to be rigged" [...] and [...] "writing a motion saying that the process will be full and fair when you don't really believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hard, particularly when you want to call yourself an officer and lawyer". Ruddock responded by saying that the emails, written in March 2004, [...] "must be seen as historic rather than current." [...] In October 2005, the US government announced that if Hicks was convicted, his pre-trial detention would not count as time served against his sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Building 20 {{was erected}} hastily during World War II as a {{temporary}} building to house part of the now-historic Radiation Laboratory. Over the course of fifty-five years, its [...] "temporary" [...] nature allowed research groups to have more space, and to make more creative use of that space, than was possible in more respectable buildings. Professor Jerome Y. Lettvin once quipped, [...] "You might regard it as the womb of the Institute. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> messy, but by God it is procreative!" [...] Building 20 was always regarded as [...] "temporary", and thus never received a formal name over its half-century of existence. [...] The structure was removed in 1996–98 {{to make way for}} the Stata Center. [...] Some of its previous occupants moved into the Stata Center upon its completion, while other [...] "Building 20 refugees" [...] moved to Building N51/N52 or dispersed to other locations on campus.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to Matt Hullum's {{statement}} made on August 15, 2014 about RWBY {{being an}} anime has been mixed. Lindsay Jones said [...] "Funnily enough, we showed our Japanese cohorts RWBY {{and they started}} arguing about whether it was anime or not! But seeing the reception from audiences is so surreal, and we never expected it." [...] A Movie Pilot blog listed the RWBY as anime topic among its [...] "flame wars you don't {{want to be part}} of. Anime News Network writers Paul Jensen and James Beckett wrote: [...] "We don't have any formal reviews of RWBY here on ANN, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cool to see an American production make it to the release encyclopedia." [...] Michael Mauer of The Cornell Daily Sun wrote that the issue was still being debated among the anime community, while Sabrina Pyun of ComicsVerse wrote [...] "The show is known for many things, from its dubious status as an anime to its unique 3D animation style." [...] However, mainstream news articles dated after Hullum's statement and previewing later seasons and the franchise have referred to RWBY as an American anime, including Variety, Collider, iDigitalTimes, Entertainment Weekly, Adweek, and Deadline.com.|$|E
