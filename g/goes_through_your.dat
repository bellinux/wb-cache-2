5000|$|The Associated Press quoted Ahmed {{following}} the US {{announcement of the}} deaths of three detainees at Guantanamo in June 2006, who were alleged to have committed suicide. He said, “There is no hope in Guantanamo. The only thing that <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> mind day after day is how to get justice or how to kill yourself. It is the despair - not the thought of martyrdom - that consumes you there.” He went on, [...] "A Saudi detainee in the cell {{in front of us}} had had enough. We could hear him rip up his sheets and tie it to the wire mesh roof of the cell. He jumped off his sink and tried to hang himself. We shouted to the military police and they came and saved him.” Last, he said, [...] "It’s weird because when we left we weren't even that religious, We were young - average British lads.

5000|$|The {{range of}} {{training}} exercises and rehearsal {{practices that are}} designed to encourage and support [...] "experiencing the role" [...] resulted from many years of sustained inquiry and experiment. Many may be discerned as early as 1905 in Stanislavski's letter of advice to Vera Kotlyarevskaya on how to approach the role of Charlotta in Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard:First of all you must live the role without spoiling the words or making them commonplace. Shut yourself off and play whatever <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> head. Imagine the following scene: Pishchik has proposed to Charlotta, now she is his bride... How will she behave? Or: Charlotta has been dismissed but finds other employment in a circus of a café-chantant. How does she do gymnastics or sing little songs? Do your hair in various ways and try to find in yourself things which remind you of Charlotta. You will be reduced to despair twenty times in your search but don't give up. Make this German woman you love so much speak Russian and observe how she pronounces words and what are the special characteristics of her speech. Remember to play Charlotta in a dramatic moment of her life. Try to make her weep sincerely over her life. Through such an image you will discover all the whole range of notes you need.|$|E

40|$|When {{you hear}} the word "{{homeless}} " what comes to your mind? When you see {{out of the side}} of your eye a person holding a sign asking for money, what <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> mind? Do you wonder if the homeless person is an addict or even crazy? Do you wonder if the person holding the sign is a scammer trying to prey on people's sympathy? Or do you feel compassion, but just are not sure how to help? These are all questions I have at one time or another thought. And while it is good to question what you see, I also think it is good to take the time to learn about what you are seeing and do something to help. It may be true that some people are homeless due to poor choices or that some people try to scam others. But if you think about it, how humbling it is to hold a sign and ask strangers for help, you will find yourself giving that homeless person the benefit of the doubt. Now take this thought a step further and put yourself in the place of a homeless person. A homeless person is just like you and me- they just don't have a roof over their head. According to the last biennial survey released by the Champaign County Continuum of Care for January 2013, there were 214 homeless people in Champaign County. The number has gone down from 549 homeless in January of 2011. But these numbers are just estimates that depend on the openness of the individuals asked. Plus the term homeless can cover a broad spectrum of individuals- from those with no shelter at all to those who stay on a friend’s couch. Another factor taken into account is how long the person has been homeless. A person is deemed chronically homeless if they have been homeless for over a year or been homeless four or more times in three years and have a disabling condition...|$|E
