50|$|The Landsat {{program is}} the longest-running {{enterprise}} for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. On July 23, 1972 the <b>Earth</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Satellite</b> was launched. This was eventually renamed to Landsat. The most recent, Landsat 8, was launched on February 11, 2013. The instruments on the Landsat satellites have acquired millions of images. The images, archived in the United States and at Landsat receiving stations around the world, are a unique resource for global change research and applications in agriculture, cartography, geology, forestry, regional planning, surveillance and education, and can be viewed through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 'EarthExplorer' website. Landsat 7 data has eight spectral bands with spatial resolutions ranging from 15 to 60 meters; the temporal resolution is 16 days. Landsat images are usually divided into scenes for easy downloading. Each Landsat scene is about 115 miles long and 115 miles wide (or 100 nautical miles long and 100 nautical miles wide, or 185 kilometers long and 185 kilometers wide).|$|E
50|$|The {{exploration}} of outer space started in earnest with {{the launch of}} Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. This was the first man-made satellite orbiting the Earth. Subsequent successful launches, both in the Soviet Union (e.g., the Sputnik and Cosmos programs), and in the U.S. (e.g., the Explorer program), quickly led to the design and operation of dedicated meteorological satellites. These are orbiting platforms embarking instruments specially designed to observe the Earth's atmosphere and surface {{with a view to}} improve weather forecasting. Starting in 1960, the TIROS series of satellites embarked television cameras and radiometers. This was later (1964 onwards) followed by the Nimbus satellites and the family of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) platforms. The latter measures the reflectance of the planet in red and near-infrared bands, {{as well as in the}} thermal infrared. In parallel, NASA developed the <b>Earth</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Satellite</b> (ERTS), which became the precursor to the Landsat program. These early sensors had minimal spectral resolution, but tended to include bands in the red and near-infrared, which are useful to distinguish vegetation and clouds, amongst other targets.|$|E

To determine whether the analysis was correct, U. S. Air Force targets with various contrasts were utilized to simulate those contrasts and radiance levels that the RBV cameras would see in the actual ERTS scenes. Although the RBV camera used in this test had a somewhat lower signal-to-noise ratio than the flight cameras, the simulation still proved the validity of the theoretical analysis in predicting resolving power performance for any set of input parameters...|$|R

In 1975, the name was changed to Landsat. In 1979, President of the United States Jimmy Carter's Presidential Directive 54 transferred Landsat operations from NASA to NOAA, recommended development of a long term operational system with four additional satellites beyond Landsat 3, and recommended transition to private sector operation of Landsat. This occurred in 1985 when the Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT), a partnership of Hughes Aircraft and RCA, was selected by NOAA to operate the Landsat system with a ten-year contract. EOSAT operated Landsat 4 and Landsat 5, had exclusive rights to market Landsat data, and was to build Landsats 6 and 7.|$|R

Note that these early Landsat images covered a footprint {{on the surface of the}} earth of about 20 nmi km on a side They also had a picture element (pixel) footprint of 80 m and could only detect features near that size. The original Landsat Multispectral Scanners (MSS) (On Landsat/ERTS 1-5) imaged the earth with several spectral bands. Each band provides a black-and-white image that is taken through a spectral filter. It has two non-thermal infrared bands for sensing plant vigor. These bands have very limited water penetration. Landsat also has two visible wavelength bands: red and green. Although the red band penetrates clear water to only about 8 m , the green band has been proven to see through clear ocean waters to depths of about 30 - 40 m [...] Since light is exponentially attenuated through the water column, given clear water and similar bottom reflectances, deeper water will appear darker on the Landsat images.|$|E

Preliminary discussions regarding additional experiments indicate a need for at least 150 DCS platforms within the EROS Program for ERTS experimentation. Results from the experiments will be used to assess the DCS suitability for satellites providing on-line, real-time, data relay capability. The rationale of the total DCS network of ground platforms and the relationship of each experiment to that rationale are discussed...|$|R
