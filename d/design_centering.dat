The subtitle of the book, A new Foundation for Design, suggests a redesign of design practices in a human-centered design culture.

50|$|In {{fabrication}} {{the yield}} {{is one of}} the most important measures. Also in the design phase engineers already try to maximize the yield by using simulation techniques and statistical models. Often the data follows the well-known bell-shaped normal distribution, and for such distributions there is a simple direct relation between the design margin and the yield. If we express the specification margin in terms of standard deviation sigma, we can immediately calculate yield Y according this specification. The concept of worst-case distance (WCD) extends this simple idea for applying it to more complex problems (like having non-normal distributions, multiple specs, etc.). The WCD is a metric originally applied in electronic design for yield optimization and <b>design</b> <b>centering,</b> nowadays also applied as a metric for quantifying electronic system and device robustness.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> {{problems in}} their reformulation as gen-eral semi-infinite optimization problems. The main goal of the arti-cle {{is to show that}} the Reduction Ansatz of semi-infinite programming generically holds at each solution of the reformulated <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> problem. This is of fundamental importance for theory and numerical methods which base on the intrinsic bilevel structure of the problem. For the genericity considerations we prove a new first order necessary optimality condition in <b>design</b> <b>centering.</b> Since in the course of our anal-ysis also a certain standard semi-infinite programming problem turns out to be related to <b>design</b> <b>centering,</b> the connections to this problem are studied, too...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} {{a method for}} the <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> of analog circuits, based on worstcase {{distances}} (WCD) is presented. In {{order to keep the}} linearization error small, only the WCDs and not the strongly nonlinear objective function itself is linearized. For the resulting nonlinear trust-region problem the generalized boundary curve (GBC) is derived as a method to determine a solution with a good ratio between error reduction and norm of the parameter correction. This parameter correction is used in a standard iterative trust-region optimization algorithm. Results calculated on a circuit example show a signifcant reduction of iterations compared to a standard gradient-based optimization algorithm. Thus, <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> becomes applicable within industrial analog circuit design...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the sizing rules method for analog CMOS circuit design that consists of: first, {{the development of}} a hierarchical library of transistor pair groups as basic building blocks for analog CMOS circuits; second, the derivation of a hierarchical generic list of constraints that must be satisfied to guarantee the function of each block and its reliability with respect to physical effects; and third, {{the development of a}}n automatic recognition of building blocks in a circuit schematic. The sizing rules method efficiently captures design knowledge on the technology-specific level of transistor pair groups. This reduces the preparatory modeling effort for analog circuit synthesis. Results of industrial applications to circuit sizing, <b>design</b> <b>centering,</b> response surface modeling and analog placement show the significance of the sizing rules method.

40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the problem of}} <b>design</b> <b>centering.</b> Geometrically, this {{can be thought of}} as inscribing one shape in another. Theoretical approaches and reformulations from the literature are reviewed; many of these are inspired by the literature on generalized semi-infinite programming, a generalization of <b>design</b> <b>centering.</b> However, the motivation for this work relates more to engineering applications of robust design. Consequently, the focus is on specific forms of design spaces (inscribed shapes) and the case when the constraints of the problem may be implicitly defined, such as by the solution of a system of differential equations. This causes issues for many existing approaches, and so this work proposes two restriction-based approaches for solving robust design problems that are applicable to engineering problems. Another feasible-point method from the literature is investigated as well. The details of the numerical implementations of all these methods are discussed. The discussion of these implementations in the particular setting of robust design in engineering problems is new...|$|E

40|$|Part One proposes an {{application}} for experimental design in the <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> process. <b>Design</b> <b>centering</b> is commonly used to find optimal design parameter levels for products such as integrated circuits, and mechanical assemblies that have correlated performance characteristics. The most computationally expensive step in the <b>design</b> <b>centering</b> process {{involves the use of}} simulation for estimating yield. We propose a less computationally expensive strategy where simulation is replaced by experimental design. An additional contribution of this research is the derivation of experimental design levels based on the beta distribution. ^ Part Two presents a computationally efficient strategy for allocating tolerances that only requires information of the means, and variances of the design parameter distributions. After parameter design, {{the next step in the}} product design process is tolerance allocation. Often tolerances are allocated among design parameters in an ad-hoc manner. ^ Part Three presents a mathematical programming model for allocating continuous improvement targets among suppliers. The allocation is done using a minimum cost rationale, where the cost of the allocation decision to the supplier, manufacturer, and consumer is considered. For some test problems, the solution using a minimum cost rationale is contrasted with an ad-hoc policy where all suppliers are allocated the same rate of continuous improvement. ^ Part Four presents a combinatorial optimization model that can be used to improve product quality when it is not possible, in the short run, to alter the settings of raw material design parameters. For many manufacturers, variation in the quality of incoming raw materials is the most significant factor affecting outgoing product quality. Since the combinatorial optimization model is NP-complete for most realistic problems, a heuristic called simulated annealing is used to find good solutions to the raw material matching problem. We demonstrate the applicability of the model by testing it on some real data provided by a pharmaceutical manufacturer. ...|$|E
