In addition, heat soak from the hot exhaust gases spinning the turbine will also heat the intake air. The warmer the intake air, the less dense, and the less oxygen available for the combustion event, which reduces volumetric efficiency. Not only does excessive <b>intake-air</b> temperature reduce efficiency, it also leads to engine knock, or detonation, which is destructive to engines.|$|E

40|$|<b>Intake-air</b> {{manifolds}} {{have a major}} {{effect on}} a vehicle’s engine performance and emission of noise and pollutants. Differences in engine outputs and applications require different designs of <b>intake-air</b> manifolds {{in order to achieve}} the best volumetric efficiency and thus the best engine performance. In the present work, the flow characteristics of air flowing in various designs of air-intake manifold of a 200 -cc four-stroke Go-Kart engine are studied. The study is done by three dimensional simulations of the flow of air within six designs of air-intake manifold into the combustion chamber by using commercial CFD software, Fluent version 6. 2. The simulation results are validated by an experimental study performed using a flow bench. The study reveals that the variations in the geometry of the air-intake system can result in a difference of up to 20 % in the mass flow rate of air entering the combustion chamber...|$|E
40|$|Preignition-limited {{performance}} {{data were obtained}} on a supercharged CFR engine at two sets of operating conditions {{over a wide range}} of fuel-air ratios to determine the preignition characteristics for the following five fuels: s- 3 reference fuel, s- 3 plus 4 ml. tel per gallon, afd- 33 (140 -p), benzene, and diisobutylene. Maximum thermal-plug temperatures at constant <b>intake-air</b> pressures were also determined to correlate the preignition characteristics of each fuel with its ability to increase general engine-temperature levels. Additional runs were made to compare the preignition-limited performance of triptane, triptane plus 4 ml. tel per gallon, and an-f- 28 r fuel...|$|E
40|$|A 4 -stroke-cycle test {{engine was}} {{equipped}} with a glass cylinder and the air movements within it were studied while the engine was being motored. Different types of air flow were produced by using shrouded intake valves in various arrangements and by altering {{the shape of the}} <b>intake-air</b> passage in the cylinder head. The air movements were made visible by mixing feathers with the entering air, and high-speed motion pictures were taken of them so that the air currents might be studied in detail and their velocities measured. Motion pictures were also taken of gasoline sprays injected into the cylinder on the intake stroke. The photographs showed that: a wide variety of induced air movements could be created in the cylinder; the movements always persisted throughout the compression stroke; and the only type of movement that persisted {{until the end of the}} cycle was rotation about the cylinder axis...|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{auto-ignition}} (CAI) combustion – {{also described}} as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion – was investigated. The primary experiments concerned a direct-injection single-cylinder gasoline engine {{equipped with a}} poppet valve combustion system. This engine was operated with both the two-stroke working cycle and the four-stroke cycle. The engine experiments were used to establish combustion characteristics and the envelope of operation for CAI combustion, and to investigate {{the influence of a}} number of engine parameters including engine speed and load, air-fuel ratio, <b>intake-air</b> heating and exhaust-port throttling. Results from one-dimensional fluid-dynamic calculations were used to support the main data set and to develop hypotheses concerning CAI combustion in practical gasoline engines. Images from parallel investigations using an equivalent optical-access engine, and three-dimensional fluid-dynamic calculations, were used to supplement the results generated by the author and to further develop and test understanding of gasoline CAI processes. Finally practical implementation of CAI combustion in passenger vehicles was considered, including possible routes to series production of CAI engines...|$|E
40|$|The {{generated}} {{power and}} efficiency of gas turbine plants depend on {{the temperature of the}} inlet air. At high ambient temperatures, a power loss of more than 20 %, combined with a significant increase in specific fuel consumption, compared to ISO standard conditions (15 degreesC), can be observed. The purpose of this work is to present a computer simulation of the integration of an innovative technology for reducing the <b>intake-air</b> temperature in gas turbine plants. Following a description of the air-cooling system, simulation results for two test cases are presented: a simple cycle gas turbine and a combined cycle plant. First, the effect of ambient air temperature variation on the power output and efficiency is presented for both cases. Next, the results from the integration of an evaporative cooler and of the air-cooling system under consideration are presented and discussed, demonstrating the gain in power output and efficiency that can be achieved.

40|$|Six 100 -octane and two 87 -octane {{aviation}} engine fuels {{were tested}} in a modified C. F. R. variable-compression engine at 1, 500, 2, 000 and 2, 500 rpm. The mixture temperature was raised from 50 to 300 F in approximately 50 degree steps and, at each temperature, the compression ratio was adjusted to give incipient knock as shown by a cathode ray indicator. The results are presented in tabular form. The results are analyzed {{on the assumption that}} the conditions which determine whether a given fuel will knock are the maximum values of density and temperature reached by the burning gases. A maximum permissible density factor, proportional to the maximum density of the burning gases just prior to incipient knock, and the temperature of the burning gases at that time were computed for each of the test conditions. Values of the density factors were plotted against the corresponding end-gas temperatures for the three engine speeds and also against engine speed for several and end-gas temperatures. The maximum permissible density factor varied only slightly with engine speed but decreased rapidly with an increase in the end-gas temperature. The effect of changing the mixture temperature was different for fuels of different types. The results emphasize the desirability of determining the anti knock values of fuels over a wide range of engine and <b>intake-air</b> conditions rather that at a single set of conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the project is to apply a unique ice thermal storage (ITS) technology to cooling the intake air to gas turbines used for power generation. In Phase I, the work includes theoretical analysis, computer simulation, engineering design and cost evaluation of this novel ITS technology. The study includes two typical gas turbines (an industrial and an aeroderivative type gas turbine) operated at two different geographic locations: Phoenix, AZ and Houston, TX. Simulation runs are performed to generate data for both power output (KW) and heat rate (Btu/KWh) as well as water recovery (acre ft/yr) in terms of intake air temperature and humidity based on weather data and turbine performance curves. Preliminary engineering design of a typical equipment arrangement for turbine inlet air-cooling operation using the ITS system is presented. A cost analysis has been performed to demonstrate the market viability of the ITS technology. When the ITS technology is applied to gas turbines, a net power gain up to 40 % and a heat rate reduction as much as 7 % can be achieved. In addition, {{a significant amount of}} water can be recovered (up to 200 acre-ft of water per year for a 50 MW turbine). The total cost saving is estimated to be $ 500, 000 /yr for a 50 MW gas turbine generator. These results have clearly demonstrated that the use of ITS technology to cool the <b>intake-air</b> to gas turbines is an efficient and cost effective means to improve the overall performance of its power generation capacity with an important added benefit of water recovery in power plant operation. Thus, further development of ITS technology for commercial applications in power generation, particularly in coal-based IGCC power plants is warranted...|$|E
