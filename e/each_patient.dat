5|$|Another non-animal {{research}} method is in silico or computer simulation and mathematical modeling {{which seeks to}} investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug affects in humans without using animals. This is done by investigating test compounds on a molecular level using recent advances in technological capabilities with {{the ultimate goal of}} creating treatments unique to <b>each</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the use of Fleiss' kappa may be the following: Consider {{fourteen}} psychiatrists are asked to look at ten patients. Each psychiatrist gives one of possibly five diagnoses to <b>each</b> <b>patient.</b> These are compiled into a matrix, and Fleiss' kappa can be computed from this matrix (see example below) to show the degree of agreement between the psychiatrists above the level of agreement expected by chance.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} the optimal {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources to be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of <b>each</b> <b>patient</b> before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E

5|$|The {{physician}} André du Laurens (1558–1609) {{claimed that}} Clovis I (r. 481–511) {{was the first}} king who touched for scrofula, but the medievalist Marc Bloch (1886–1944) {{argued that it was}} probably Philip I. Modern scholars, most notably Frank Barlow (1911–2009), agree that the French practice most likely originated from Saint Louis IX (r. 1226–1270). The earliest direct evidence of the royal touch in England are the financial records dating from the reign of Edward I (r. 1272–1307). The crusading Edward I did not arrive in England until 1274 but the custom of giving one penny to <b>each</b> <b>patient</b> had become well established by 1276, suggesting that the practice dated at least from the reign of his father, Henry III (r. 1216–1272). Henry III, known for insisting on his arbitrary decisions, loved public displays and was as pious as his beloved brother-in-law, Saint Louis IX, all of which makes it likely that he introduced the practice in England.|$|E

30|$|We {{exported}} {{images from}} the PET-CT workstation in DICOM format and converted to ANALYSE file format [46] using MRIConvert [47]. To ensure reproducibility and facilitate direct comparison, we co-registered <b>each</b> <b>patient’s</b> follow-up scans with the baseline CT, using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 8) [48] with MATLAB 2013 b (Mathworks Inc.). During the co-registration (using within-subject rigid-body model), CT images were re-sliced to the voxel matrix of the corresponding PET scan (using trilinear interpolation). This allowed direct voxel-based comparison of <b>each</b> <b>patient’s</b> PET and CT images.|$|R
25|$|Oncologists {{are already}} individualizing dosing of some cancer drugs based on exposure. Carboplatin and {{busulfan}} dosing rely upon results from blood tests {{to calculate the}} optimal dose for <b>each</b> <b>patient.</b> Simple blood tests are also available for dose optimization of methotrexate, 5-FU, paclitaxel, and docetaxel.|$|E
25|$|This system enables {{hospitals}} and labs {{to order the}} correct test requests for <b>each</b> <b>patient,</b> keep track of individual patient or specimen histories, and help guarantee {{a better quality of}} results as well as printing hard copies of the results for patient charts and doctors to check.|$|E
25|$|If a {{diagnosis}} of megalencephaly is confirmed, the child is referred to a specialist who focuses on managing the symptoms and improving lifestyle. Since megalencephaly is usually presented with autism, the goal of treatment is to improve deficiencies associated with autistic causes. Additionally, since <b>each</b> <b>patient</b> has unique symptoms, {{there is no one}} specific treatment method and therefore is heavily reliant on symptoms associated with an individual.|$|E
30|$|<b>Each</b> <b>patient’s</b> age, sex, {{predominant}} anatomical {{pattern of}} CP (diplegia, hemiplegia or total body involvement) and predominant physiological type (grouped into spasticity, dystonia, athetoid and ‘other’ types) were noted.|$|R
30|$|Results: During {{the course}} of the study, about 450 {{children}} were admitted in each center. The collected data allow to describe and compare both populations in terms of severity of <b>each</b> <b>patient’s</b> condition.|$|R

25|$|To provide {{culturally}} sensitive patient-centered care, physicians should treat <b>each</b> <b>patient</b> as an individual, recognizing and respecting {{his or her}} beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors. However, many physicians lack the awareness of or training in cultural competence. With the constantly changing demographics, their patients are increasingly getting diverse as well. It is utterly important to educate physicians to be culturally competent {{so that they can}} effectively treat patients of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|During its {{development}} for fibromyalgia, milnacipran was evaluated utilizing a composite responder approach. To {{be considered as}} a responder for the composite ‘treatment of ﬁbromyalgia’ endpoint, <b>each</b> <b>patient</b> had to show concurrent and clinically meaningful improvements in pain, physical function and global impression of disease status. A systematic review in 2015 showed moderate relief for a minority of people with fibromyalgia. Milnacipran was associated with increased adverse events and discontinuing use of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and {{controversial}} within homeopathy even in modern times. The theory of miasms {{has been criticized}} as an explanation developed by Hahnemann to preserve the system of homeopathy {{in the face of}} treatment failures, and for being inadequate to cover the many hundreds of sorts of diseases, as well as for failing to explain disease predispositions, as well as genetics, environmental factors, and the unique disease history of <b>each</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|E

25|$|Variable-contour cuffs are contour cuffs {{that can}} be {{adjusted}} {{to the shape of}} the limb. They have pivoting fastening straps that allow the proximal and distal circumferences to be adjusted, allowing the cuff to conform to a variety of limb shapes, and thus be personalized to <b>each</b> <b>patient.</b> Variable-contour cuffs enhance comfort in patients with tapered limbs, decrease the risk of mechanical shearing, and can occlude blood flow at lower pressures due to the improved fit to the limb.|$|E
25|$|<b>Each</b> <b>patient</b> {{with the}} {{susceptible}} genotype accumulates iron {{at different rates}} depending on iron intake, {{the exact nature of}} the mutation, and the presence of other insults to the liver such as alcohol and viral disease. As such {{the degree to which the}} liver and other organs is affected is highly variable and is dependent on these factors and co-morbidities as well as age at which they are studied for manifestations of disease. Penetrance differs between populations.|$|E
25|$|Further {{variability}} {{is introduced}} by the degree of enzyme inefficiency produced by the specific alleles <b>each</b> <b>patient</b> has. Some alleles result in more severe degrees of enzyme inefficiency. In general, severe degrees of inefficiency produce changes in the fetus and problems in prenatal or perinatal life. Milder degrees of inefficiency are usually associated with excessive or deficient sex hormone effects in childhood or adolescence, while the mildest forms of CAH interfere with ovulation and fertility in adults.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} age on the dose of fentanyl or alfentanil {{required to produce}} the same electroencephalographic (EEG) stage was studied in adult male patients. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic components of <b>each</b> <b>patient’s</b> dose-re-sponse relationship were evaluated simultaneously. Frequent arterial blood samples drawn during and after an infusion of fentanyl or alfentanil were assayed by radloimmunoassay and permitted determination of <b>each</b> <b>patient’s</b> pharmacokinetic pro-file. The EEG was analyzed by power spectral analysis and a parameter (spectral edge frequency) chosen to quantitate the narcotic-induced EEG slowing. An inhibftory nigmoki E phar-macodynamic model related spectral edge frequency to narcotic serum concentrations.

25|$|Physiotherapy {{is vital}} in the {{treatment}} of many rheumatological disorders. Occupational therapy can help patients finding alternative ways for common movements which would otherwise be restricted by their disease. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often need a long term, coordinated and a multidisciplinary team approach towards management of individual patients. Treatment is often tailored according to the individual needs of <b>each</b> <b>patient</b> which is also dependent on the response and the tolerability of medications. Rheumasurgery has also played an integral part {{in the treatment}} of rheumatic disorders.|$|E
25|$|What {{made this}} trial novel {{was that the}} {{subjects}} were randomly allocated to their test groups. The up-to-that-time practice was to allocate subjects alternately to each group, based on {{the order in which}} they presented for treatment. This practice could be biased, because those admitting <b>each</b> <b>patient</b> knew to which group that patient would be allocated (and so the decision to admit or not admit a specific patient might be influenced by the experimenter's knowledge of the nature of their illness, and their knowledge of the group to which they would occupy).|$|E
