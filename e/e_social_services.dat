40|$|This study {{examines}} aid fungibility of Japan's {{official development assistance}} (ODA) to Indonesia for the period 1973 to 1994. Aid fungibility, often known as switching of aid money into non-development purposes, {{is one of the}} most controversial issues that impinges upon the macroeconomic effectiveness of foreign aid. In this study Japan's foreign aid to Indonesia is analysed, since Indonesia is one of the largest recipients of Japan's aid, and also since Japan is the largest aid donor to Indonesia. Using the maximum likelihood cointegration econometric procedure and the error correction mechanism (ECM), the study analyses aid fungibility for non-development current expenditure, development expenditure and domestic revenue for Indonesia. The results indicate that none of Japan's total sectoral aid, other donors' total sectoral aid, and non-sectoral aid from all donors, leaks into non-development current expenditure or reduces domestic revenue. Hence, no evidence of aid fungibility at the aggregate level is found. The study further analyses aid fungibility at the sectoral level for four major sections, i. <b>e.</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> sector, economic services sector, production sector, and other sectors. The empirical results provide no evidence that Japan's aid to the social services and production sectors is fungible. However, Japan's aid to the economic services sectors and other sectors is fungible. Furthermore, other donors' sectoral aid to all four sectors is fungible. Also, there is diversion of resources into the other sectors from other three combined sectors, i. <b>e.</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> sector, economic services sector, and production sector. This suggests that Japan's aid to the economic services sector and other donors' sectoral aid to the social services sector, economic services sector, production sector, may diverge into the other sectors. This study concludes by speculating the importance of aid sources and sectors to which aid is allocated as some of the factors that explain aid fungibility in Indonesia...|$|E

Interviewees were asked to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of policy implementation, including: changing priorities, planning arrangements, agency roles, central guidance and financial mechanisms, consumer participation, and the impact of more recent policy or structural developments. Despite recognition of the leadership of the Welsh Office, the shift in thinking achieved, the developments made in joint agency collaboration and in consumer participation in planning, and an increasing competence to plan effectively over time, the overriding perception was that more could have been made of the opportunity afforded by the clearest and best resourced central government policy within the UK in this area. At the heart of this judgement lay concerns about pragmatic rather than strategic planning, a failure to link annual service developments to a final comprehensive end point and a related failure to integrate planning to meet community needs with hospital resettlement. Factors which may have contributed to these weaknesses are discussed, as are lessons for subsequent community care policy...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} a distributed medical system meant to bring a modern approach and {{enhance the quality of}} medical services offered to patients with chronic cardio-vascular diseases, via the latest IT&C technologies. The proposed system provides online interaction between the main actors of a medical system: patients, doctors, medical entities (e. g. hospitals, clinics) and medical authorities (<b>e.</b> g. <b>social</b> <b>services).</b> With the aid of widely accepted medical standards, the system supplies storage for medical records and offers services for data integration between different kinds of healthcare applications and entities. The proposed ontological approach allows for the interchange of medical knowledge and best practices with conceptually organized patients’ records. The proposed solution allows computer assisted diagnoses and multi-criteria medical data analysis, with the possible extent of building a data warehouse for complex medical data mining...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to detail the human or <b>social</b> <b>service</b> needs and service use {{patterns}} (i. <b>e.,</b> healthcare, education, <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> child welfare, mental health, and substance abuse) that influence youth's entry and prolonged involvement with the juvenile justice system. What emerged from the literature was a pattern of service needs and prior service usage that placed youth at risk of juvenile justice involvement. Extralegal factors, such as individual characteristics (e. g., race/ethnicity, gender, and mental health and trauma histories) and social/environmental characteristics (e. g., family conflict, unmet service needs, and prior <b>social</b> <b>service</b> use) influenced how youth traveled across the sectors of care. The authors present a social justice systems model that depicts the varied service pathways that youth may concurrently or sequentially travel across the social and justice systems of care.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the views of a {{community}} sample of 428 parents with primary school-aged children. In a previous study parents had identified that they needed 'support'. This {{study was designed to}} try to understand what types of support parents already have and what support they think needs to be available to them. Most parents use informal support of family and friends and have limited awareness of what is available to them in the way of locally based services. They propose services which are already available, like Parentline, but of which they are unaware. There seems to be a need for universal, non-stigmatising services which design their programmes with parents and can refer to more specialised <b>services,</b> <b>e.</b> g. <b>Social</b> <b>Services</b> or Family Centres. These services need to be located in agencies which parents frequent and are comfortable with, such as schools and health settings...|$|R

We argue that PREVENT is representative of increasing securitised social policies, that serve to firstly, view people within particular individualised neo-liberal discourses and thin narratives, and, secondly, serves to coerce the profession of social work into hitherto unknown areas, namely, national security and counter-terrorism. We note the unapologetic linkage of traditional forms of what we term here, “welfare safeguarding” customarily the domain of social work, with what we term “security safeguarding”. If the profession of social work in the UK, and we suspect other Western regimes, wishes to avoid becoming a profession of “downpressor men”, the uncritical incursion into issues of national security and counter-terrorism must be highlighted...|$|R

Further, I tried to find out the most frequent source of information about <b>social</b> <b>services</b> for families with children in the region, what sort of services are preferred by families with children, and whether the offer of services in the region corresponds to the needs of parents. The offer of <b>social</b> <b>services</b> in the region has been mapped. It was found out that families with children are provided with three types of services, i. <b>e.</b> with the <b>social</b> <b>services</b> of registered providers, with the services to support functioning families and with the services within the framework of social and legal protection of children. The knowledge of these services in Moravské Budějovice is relatively high, unlike the village communities in the region where the knowledge of them is considerably low.

40|$|Italian law only {{provides}} the general {{conditions for the}} institution of recall. It follows that significant discretionary powers are enjoyed by the surveillance judges (and in particular by the Surveillance Tribunal) who evaluate {{on a case-by-case basis}} whether the commission of another offence or the infringement of parole conditions demonstrate the offenders‟ negative attitude to reintegrate into society. However, especially with reference to the commission of serious crimes, the judges‟ discretionary assessment can result in a restrictive application of the law on recall with the consequence that parolees are returned to prison even when they commit minor violations. The Italian penitentiary system is currently undergoing a serious crisis mainly caused by prison overcrowding. This article argues that reform of the system is thus urgently needed. Such reform should be aimed, among other objectives, at strengthening the role of the bodies which are involved in the different phases of recall (<b>e.</b> g. <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> prison staff, etc.), in order to assist and support judges in their difficult task of decision making in an area – such that of recall – full of social implication...|$|R
40|$|Minor child {{physical}} abuse has decreased in Sweden since 1979, when a law banning corporal punishment of children was passed, but more serious forms have not decreased. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine risk and background factors in cases of severe child abuse reported to the police. Files from different agencies (<b>e.</b> g., <b>Social</b> <b>services,</b> Adult and Child psychiatry and Pediatric clinic) for 20 children and 34 caretakers were studied. An accumulation of risk factors was found. It is concluded that when the following four factors are present, there is a risk for severe child abuse: 1) a person with a tendency to use violence in conflict situations; 2) a strong level of stress on the perpetrator and the family; 3) an insufficient social network that does not manage to protect the child; 4) a child that does not manage to protect him or herself. Thus, multiple sources of information must be used when investigating child abuse.

About half of these collocations appeared frequently in the British National Corpus (BNC); one-quarter failed to appear in the BNC at all, while another quarter had a very low BNC frequency. Based on frequency data and mutual information (MI) scores, it was discovered that around 45 % of all learner collocations were, in fact, appropriate collocations, that is, frequent and strongly associated English word combinations. When the study data were compared to data from native speakers, very little difference was found between native speakers (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS) in the use of appropriate collocations. Unfortunately, the high percentage of appropriate collocations does not mean that NNSs necessarily develop fully native-like knowledge of collocation. In Study 2, NNSs demonstrated poorer intuition than NS respondents regarding the frequency of collocations. Likewise, Study 3 showed that NNSs were slower than NSs in processing collocations. Overall, the studies reported here suggest that L 2 learners are capable of producing a large number of appropriate collocations but that the underlying intuitions and the fluency with collocations of even advanced learners do not seem to match those of native speakers...|$|R

Next chapters clarify the zootherapy practising, i. e. what animals are used for this method, what techniques are applied and what ways is possible to exploit while practising the zootherapy. The chapter analyzing the organizations covering the zootherapy is important as well. In following chapter the author tracks the zootherapy in legislation wraps up important laws related to the work with animals. Next part of the bachelor thesis is dedicated to the canistherapy. It explains the term evolution, introduces the history of canistherapy and its development in the Czech Republic. She focuses here on the conditions of canistherapy both from the dog?s side {{as well as from the}} therapist, the facility and the client?s point of view. The author opens practical part of the bachelor thesis with its goal, describes methods and techniques of research. To realize the bachelor thesis research the author has chosen quantitative research and questioning. The outcome is elaborated in form of descriptive statistics and results of questionnaire inquiry is amended with diagrams for clarity. The research goal was to realize the extent of the canistherapy awareness amongst secondary schoolteachers in Jindřichův Hradec and employees (social workers and <b>social</b> <b>services</b> workers) of <b>social</b> <b>services</b> facilities and institutions in Jindřichův Hradec. Two hypothesis were established for the survey purposes. Hypothesis 1 : Level of the canistherapy awareness is higher in case <b>social</b> <b>services</b> facilities workers to compare with secondary schoolteachers in Jindřichův Hradec. Hypothesis 2 : Respondents with a dog in their possession are better informed than those without. To prove or disprove them, the hypothesis were tested by statistical significance test (T-test) and the result was composed of outcoming levels of significance. For the purposes of T-test zero hypothesis were established. H 0 (1) : Level of the canistherapy awareness is the same in case of <b>social</b> <b>services</b> facilities workers as well as in case of secondary schoolteachers in Jindřichův Hradec. H 0 (2) : Level of the canistherapy awareness is the same in case of respondents with own dog as well as those without. To each of thesis related question were prescribed points and each respondent has reached average score. This average score could prove or disprove T-test. Total amount of the questionnaire inquiry respondents was 100. 60 of them were secondary schoolteachers and 40 <b>social</b> <b>services</b> facilities workers. Results of the survey revealed that majority of respondents already had met the auxiliary method, though just at theoretical level, in their life. That is the reason for right answers of respondents to the key question, according the author, what the canistherapy was. Questionnaire included more the canistherapy related questions and as the results revealed, respondents are informed on the auxiliary method. Statistic calculation proved hypothesis, i. <b>e.</b> the <b>social</b> <b>services</b> facilities workers are better informed on the canistherapy than secondary schoolteachers and the respondents owning their own dog, or planning to have, are better informed as well than those without dog.

Three research questions were used to achieve the goal. Semi-structured interviews with fourteen senior citizens who utilize <b>social</b> <b>services</b> in Prachatice were used to identify how seniors are informed about <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> Further I wanted to identify how elderly people are content with the offer and availability of <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> and how they are satisfied with the provision of <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> and what could be proposed to improve the offered and delivered <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> The acquired data were analysed using an open data coding method. The collected information indicates that awareness of <b>social</b> <b>services</b> for senior citizens in Prachatice is sufficient. A few proposals were raised by respondents that could increase awareness of available <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> Seniors are partly satisfied with the offer and availability of <b>social</b> <b>services</b> while they are not content with the number of vacancies in the Senior Home. They consider the provision of <b>social</b> <b>services</b> in Prachatice to be sufficient.
