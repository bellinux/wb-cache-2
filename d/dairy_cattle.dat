5|$|Sheep {{farming is}} practiced {{extensively}} in Wales, with lamb and mutton being the meats most traditionally {{associated with the}} country.

5|$|About 78% of {{the land}} surface of Wales is given over to {{agricultural}} use.), Wales area 20,779 km2 However, very little of this is arable land; the vast majority consists of permanent grass pasture or rough grazing for herd animals such as sheep and cows. Although both beef and <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle</b> are raised widely, especially in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, Wales is more well known for its sheep farming and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Welsh cooking.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries a ferme ornée was established, with {{planting}} of various tress and the damming of streams to form ponds with paths and seating around them. Tenant farmers leased {{the majority of}} the land and during most of the 20th century it was used for <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle,</b> sheep and pigs. Much of the estate was sold in 1987 to the Avon Wildlife Trust who established their Folly Farm nature reserve on the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} homestead block {{faced an}} uncertain future for many years, until {{it was given to}} the Department of Agriculture in 1924. Initially intended for the production of pure seed wheat and oats, very little was produced for several years. Avondale was used as an assembly and holding ground for <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle,</b> prior to them being sent to group settlers in the state's South West. During this period, the silo was built with a capacity of 100 tonnes; the silo is now heritage listed.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses {{pasteurized milk}} and {{operates}} a high-volume modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk. When Beecher's encountered problems in guaranteeing the standard {{flavor of the}} milks they were using to make cheese, the company bought their own herds of <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle</b> and farms to ensure control of the cheese products from beginning to end. Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a cheddar cheese produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for cheddar cheese production.|$|E
5|$|Pardelup Prison Farm {{opened in}} 1927, near Mount Barker, while Barton's Mill, though {{planned to be}} a {{temporary}} measure, remained open as a prison after World War II. Pardelup operated as a working farm, with a large-scale <b>dairy,</b> <b>cattle</b> and pig raising, and crops, and Barton' Mill prisoners cut timber to supply hospitals, houses, and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme's pumping station at Mundaring. In both cases, the only aspects resembling a prison were the presence of guards, and the compulsion to remain there – enforced by the remoteness of the facilities {{and the integrity of}} prisoners chosen to be transferred there. Escapees were generally punished with extended sentences at the harsher Fremantle Prison, which had little change over the four decades from 1920 to 1960.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, {{the quality}} of the ponies was noted to be declining, a result of poor choice of {{breeding}} stallions, and the introduction of Arab to improve the breed was recommended. The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest, and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2,250. Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years. The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or to the increase in the profits from running <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle</b> instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies' natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result of demand for more refined-looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles. Later, the Second World War drove up the demand for, and thus, the market value of, young animals for horse meat.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of dairy production {{in a factory}} farm environment has been criticized by animal welfare activists.

25|$|When used as feed for <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle,</b> alfalfa {{is often}} made into haylage {{by a process}} known as ensiling. Rather than being dried to make dry hay, the alfalfa is chopped finely and {{fermented}} in silos, trenches, or bags, where the oxygen supply can be limited to promote fermentation. The anaerobic fermentation of alfalfa allows it to retain high nutrient levels similar to those of fresh forage, and is also more palatable to <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle</b> than dry hay. In many cases, alfalfa silage is inoculated with different strains of microorganisms to improve the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of the silage.|$|E
50|$|Berrigan Shire {{is a local}} {{government}} area in the southern Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. The Shire lies on the New South Wales State border with Victoria formed by the Murray River. The Shire is adjacent to the Newell and Riverina Highways. The Shire is a mainly agricultural region, with <b>dairying,</b> <b>cattle</b> raising, woolgrowing and cropping the main activities. The {{vast majority of the}} Shire is irrigated.

50|$|In 1925 {{when the}} Wonglepong {{branch of the}} QCWA was formed, Beaudesert Shire was a prosperous {{district}} of small farmers and timber workers. Closer settlement of the district began in the 1860s after {{the opening of the}} Logan Agricultural Reserve. From the early 1900s to the 1930s, the district boomed, sustained by <b>dairying,</b> <b>cattle</b> grazing and the timber industry. Dairying and grazing continued through the mid-20th Century although restructuring of the dairy industry led to diversification and the development of larger properties.|$|R

25|$|Alfalfa, {{like other}} leguminous crops, is a known source of phytoestrogens, {{including}} spinasterol, coumestrol, and coumestan. Because of this, grazing on alfalfa has caused reduced fertility in sheep and in <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Dairy</b> <b>cattle</b> housing systems {{vary greatly}} {{throughout}} the world depending on the climate, dairy size, and feeding strategies. Housing must provide access to feed, water and protection from relevant environmental conditions. One obvious issue for humanely housing cattle is temperature extremes. Heat stress can decrease fertility and milk production in cattle. Providing shade is a very common method for reducing heat stress. Barns may also incorporate fans or tunnel ventilation into {{the architecture of the}} barn structure. Overly cold conditions, while rarely deadly for cattle, cause increases in maintenance energy requirements and thus increased feed intake and decreased milk production. During the winter months, where temperatures are low enough, <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle</b> are often kept inside barns which are warmed by their collective body heat.|$|E
25|$|They are {{especially}} suitable for tilling rice fields, and their milk is richer {{in fat and}} protein than that of <b>dairy</b> <b>cattle.</b> The large feral population of northern Australia became established in the late 19th century, and smaller feral herds are in New Guinea, Tunisia, and northeastern Argentina.|$|E
