5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> Ueno to pursue photography as a career, {{but he was so}} overwhelmed by the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E
5|$|Pitt became Prime Minister in December 1783, with Wilberforce a key {{supporter}} of his minority government. Despite their close friendship, {{there is no}} record that Pitt offered Wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments. This may have been due to Wilberforce's wish to remain an independent MP. Alternatively, Wilberforce's frequent tardiness and disorganisation, as well as the chronic eye problems that at times made reading impossible, may <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> Pitt that his trusted friend was not ministerial material. When Parliament was dissolved in the spring of 1784, Wilberforce decided to stand as a candidate for the county of Yorkshire in the 1784 general election. On 6 April, he was returned as MP for Yorkshire at the age of twenty-four.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} against the king {{at the general}} council had shown Atholl that James was {{not only on the}} back-foot but his political standing had received a huge set-back and may <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> the earl that James's death was now a viable course of action. Atholl had seen how assertive action by two of his brothers at different times had allowed them {{to take control of the}} kingdom and that as James's nearest adult relative, the earl must have considered that decisive intervention on his part at this time could prove to be equally successful.|$|E

5|$|Vermigli had a {{profound}} influence on the English Reformation through his relationship with Thomas Cranmer. Before his contact with Vermigli, Cranmer held Lutheran Eucharistic views. Vermigli seems to <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> Cranmer to adopt a Reformed view, which {{changed the course of}} the English Reformation since Cranmer was primarily responsible for revisions to the Book of Common Prayer and writing the Forty-two Articles. Vermigli had a direct role in the modifications of the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. He is also believed to have contributed to, if not written, the article on predestination found in the Forty-two Articles of Religion of 1553. In Elizabethan Oxford and Cambridge, Vermigli's theology was arguably more influential than that of Calvin. His political theology in particular shaped the Elizabethan religious settlement and his authority was constantly invoked in the controversies of this period.|$|E

25|$|The {{threat of}} new {{religious}} persecution in Bosnia reappared {{within a few}} years of the war. Pope Innocent IV began urging the Hungarians to undertake another crusade in late 1246 and 1247, and they appeared willing. Matthew Ninoslav argued that he only associated with heretics to defend Bosnia against Hungarian invaders. He appears to <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> Innocent, who suspended the crusade in March 1248.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{persecution}} of Christians by past Roman Emperors had seemingly only strengthened Christianity, many of Julian's actions were designed to harass and undermine the ability of Christians to organize resistance to the re-establishment of paganism in the empire. Julian's preference for a non-Christian and non-philosophical view of Iamblichus' theurgy seems to <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> {{him that it was}} right to outlaw the practice of the Christian view of theurgy and demand the suppression of the Christian set of Mysteries.|$|E

25|$|Kamber {{subsequently}} {{was forced}} {{to take responsibility for}} a scandal which involved the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), another AFL-CIO affiliate. In February 1985, Albert Shanker, then president of the AFT, announced at a news conference his union <b>had</b> <b>convinced</b> the New York State Teachers Retirement System to withdraw $450 million from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company because the bank had poorly administered workers' pension funds. Shanker also announced that the union <b>had</b> <b>convinced</b> the Pennsylvania School Employees' Retirement System to withdraw $300 million from the same bank, and that five other state teachers' retirement funds were expected to do the same. AFL-CIO officials said the AFT <b>had</b> <b>convinced</b> the retirement systems to withdraw the funds to protest loans Manufacturers Hanover had made to the Phelps Dodge mining corporation, which was involved in a bitter strike with the steelworkers.|$|R
25|$|On about August 9 Armijo {{called a}} meeting {{with a number of}} {{respected}} New Mexicans. He did not want to fight, but the priests present did, as did the young regular-army commander, Diego Archuleta, and the young militia officers Manuel Chaves and Miguel Pino. According to a refugee from the war, Armijo would have done nothing toward defense if the latter two had not threatened to shoot him. Then on August 12 or 13 he received an American named James Magoffin, the husband of a relative of his, who later claimed to <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> Armijo not to fight. An unverified story says that Magoffin bribed them. Magoffin later requested a reimbursement from the U. S. Treasury of $50,000, of which he received $30,000.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{violence}} of the second intifada and the political success of Hamas (a group dedicated to Israel's destruction) <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> many Israelis that peace and negotiation are not possible and a two state system is not the answer. Hardliners believe that Israel should annex all Palestinian territory, or at least all minus the Gaza Strip. Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and do not trust Palestinian leadership to maintain control. In fact, Pedahzur goes as {{far as to say that}} suicide terrorism succeeded where peace negotiations failed in encouraging withdrawal by Israelis from cities in the West Bank. A common theme throughout the peace process has been a feeling that the Palestinians give too little in their peace offers.|$|E
25|$|Ewi Ajimudaoro Aladesanmi I (1886-1910) had a {{peaceful}} reign devoid of Ikere attacks. This {{was made possible}} by the fact that Ado wars with Ikere ended through the peace covenant initiated by a Prince - Oba Oyinbolaja (Oba Dadi). He was reported to <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti and the Ogoga of Ikere-Ekiti to accept colonial rule of the white man and to stop human sacrifices. When the Ewi accepted colonial rule, he sent emissaries to Captain R.L Bower (the Resident and Travelling Commissioner of Interior Yoruba in 1894) through the help of Ifamuboni (later Babamboni) and then Ado-Ekiti was regarded as a territory within the British Protectorate. It was recorded that Mr. Campbell was the first Briton to visit Ado-Ekiti for situation assessment and report in respect of Kiriji Proclamations at the termination of the Yoruba wars.|$|E

25|$|Earlier, as General Ridgway {{was about}} to open Operation Courageous, the gains he already had {{registered}} in his Killer and Ripper advances had influenced a decision in Washington by which operations above the parallel assumed new importance as a political question. The decision centered on {{how and when to}} approach the desired cease-fire. Notwithstanding the building evidence of North Korean offensive preparations, officials of the Departments of State and Defense believed that Ridgway's recent successes might <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> the Chinese and North Koreans that they could not win a military victory and, if this was the case, that they might agree to negotiate an end to hostilities. On the advice of these officials, President Harry S. Truman planned to make a public statement suggesting the United Nations' willingness to end the fighting. The statement was carefully worded to avoid a threatening tone and so to encourage a favorable reply. Truman intended to deliver the appeal as soon as his statement had been approved by officials of all nations that had contributed forces to the U.N. Command.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} of Malin Matsdotter {{did in fact}} signify {{the end of the}} Katarina witch trial in Stockholm {{and the end of the}} national 1668-76 witch hunt in Sweden. Some of the judges in the commission, notably Urban Hjärne and Eric Noraeus, begun to express skepticism toward the child witnesses and instigate a different interrogation technique against them by asking them to repeat their testimonies rather than to affirm their already given testimonies. This was particularly brought about since the child witnesses had started to accuse people from the upper classes, such as the Captains wife Margareta Staffansdotter Remmer and Maria Sofia De la Gardie. This resulted in the break down of one witness, Annika Thomsdotter, in court on 11 September 1676, which snowballed into other witnesses to retract their testimonies and blamed the leading witnesses, the Gävle Boy, Lisbeth Carlsdotter and the Myra Maids to <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> them to perjure themselves. Seventeen child- and teenage witnesses admitted perjury. This efficiently discontinued the Katarina witch trial. The remaining accused, Margareta Staffansdotter Remmer, Karina Ambjörnsdotter and Margareta Matsdotter Dufva, were freed, and the courts instead prosecuted the witnesses for perjury, leading to both executions and physical punishments.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} revocation, Hoover {{experienced}} serious engine {{problems in a}} North American T-28 Trojan {{off the coast of}} California. During his return to Torrance, he was able to keep the engine running intermittently by constantly manipulating the throttle, mixture, and propeller levers. The engine seized at the moment of touchdown. Hoover believed his successful management of this difficult emergency should <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> the FAA that he hadn't lost any ability. Meanwhile, Hoover was granted a pilot's license, and medical certificate by Australia's aviation authorities. Hoover's medical certificate was restored shortly afterward and he returned to the American air show circuit for several years before retiring in 1999. At 77 years old Hoover still felt capable of performing and passed a rigorous FAA physical post retirement, but he was unable to obtain insurance for air shows. Although he had had free insurance for several years as part of air show sponsorship deals, he was forced in 1999 to pay for it out of his own pocket and could not get coverage under $2 million. His final air show was on November 13, 1999 at Luke Air Force base. His last flight in his famous Shrike Commander was on October 10, 2003 from Lakeland, Florida to the Smithsonian Air and Space museum in Washington D.C. with long time friend Steve Clegg.|$|E

25|$|Important {{contributions}} {{were made}} by Ibn al-Haytham (965–1040), a mathematician from Basra (in present-day Iraq) {{considered one of the}} founders of modern optics. Ptolemy and Aristotle theorised that light either shone from the eye to illuminate objects or that light emanated from objects themselves, whereas al-Haytham (known by the Latin name Alhazen) suggested that light travels to the eye in rays from different points on an object. The works of Ibn al-Haytham and Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī, a Persian scientist, eventually passed on to Western Europe where they were studied by scholars such as Roger Bacon and Witelo."The combination of the dynamic approach with Archimedean hydrostatics gave birth to a direction in science which may be called medieval hydrodynamics.""Archimedean statics formed the basis for creating the fundamentals of the science on specific weight. Numerous fine experimental methods were developed for determining the specific weight, which were based, in particular, on the theory of balances and weighing. The classical works of al-Biruni and al-Khazini can by right be considered as the beginning of the application of experimental methods in medieval science.""Arabic statics was an essential link in the progress of world science. It played an important part in the prehistory of classical mechanics in medieval Europe. Without it classical mechanics proper could probably not have been created."}} Omar Khayyám (1048–1131), a Persian scientist, calculated the length of a solar year and was only out by a fraction of a second when compared to our modern day calculations. He used this to compose a calendar considered more accurate than the Gregorian calendar that came along 500 years later. He is classified as one of the world's first great science communicators, said, for example to <b>have</b> <b>convinced</b> a Sufi theologian that the world turns on an axis.|$|E
