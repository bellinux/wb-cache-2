25|$|The Department of National Defense {{is working}} for the {{immediate}} delivery of at least 4 of the total 12 FA-50 fighter jets plans to purchase from South Korea. The Department of National Defense has begun negotiations with the Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) while it is waiting for Malacañang's final approval of the sales agreement. It will be a <b>government-to-government</b> procurement that requires multi-year obligational authority from the Department of Budget and Management. After the confirmation of the sales agreement and the multi-year obligational authority from DBM, the formal negotiations can start and schedule the delivery of at least 4 fighter jets. The government is moving closer to acquiring 12 FA-50 fighter jets {{for the air force}} after the defense department’s Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) approved the terms of reference for the project. Once the terms of reference are approved with finality, the defense department could begin negotiations with the aircraft supplier, the state-run Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI). The negotiations are hoped to be finished by August. The negotiations were completed on Feb. 21, 2014. The Department of National Defense Special Bids and Awards Committee approved the offer of Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) in a meeting that was held in Camp Aguinaldo. On Mar. 28, 2014, it was announced by the state arms procurement agency of South Korea that South Korea signed a US$420 million contract Friday to export 12 FA-50 fighter jets built by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to the Philippines under a <b>government-to-government</b> deal.|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{years after}} World War II, South Korea and Japan re-established {{diplomatic}} relations with the 1965 signing of the Treaty on Basic Relations. In 2005, South Korea disclosed diplomatic documents that detailed {{the proceedings of the}} treaty. Kept secret in South Korea for 40 years, the documents revealed that Japan provided 500 million dollars in soft loans and 300 million in grants to South Korea as compensation for the reign of Japan. South Korea agreed to demand no more compensation after the treaty, either at a <b>government-to-government</b> level or an individual-to-government level.

25|$|Initially a {{separate}} project from the Strategic Sealift Vessel, the Department of National Defense (DND) was rushing {{the acquisition of}} one or two multi-role vessels (MRV) for the Philippine Navy through <b>government-to-government</b> contract at a cost of 5 to 10billion pesos. Initially the reported source of the said ships is either South Korea or Singapore. Previous statements and news reports indicate that the multi-role vessels are comparable to landing platform docks operated by foreign navies like the Singaporean Endurance class or the Spanish Galicia class. It was later confirmed that the ship would be from South Korea and is a variant of the Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL) Makassar class LPD, and is packaged with four units Samsung Techwin KAAV-7 amphibious assault vehicles (AAV), two units Daesun 23-meter landing craft utility LCU-23, four units 9.8-meter rigid-hulled inflatable boats, one unit truck-based mobile hospital, two units Kia KM-250 2-ton troop trucks, two units Kia KM-450 1-ton troop trucks, two units Kia KM-450 ambulances, two units Kia Retona 1/4-ton utility vehicles, and one unit forklift/cargo handling equipment.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the First Opium War in 1842, Britain and China {{signed the}} Treaty of Nanking, which {{effectively}} overthrew the original mercantilist system and forced open the ports of Guangzhou, Xiamen ("Amoy"), Fuzhou ("Foochow"), Ningbo ("Ningpo"), and Shanghai to British trading. Seeing that Britain could easily eliminate foreign competition in China with its new privileges and considerable trading prowess, Americans found the need to reestablish their diplomatic relations and commercial equality in China. For the previous fifty-nine years, Americans had been interacting with China merely through their business transactions, without <b>government-to-government</b> communication. As a result, the administration of President John Tyler sent the commissioner Caleb Cushing to negotiate a treaty in which America would receive the same privileges as Britain. Cushing, in the Treaty of Wanghsia in 1844, not only achieved this goal but also won the right of extraterritoriality, which meant that Americans accused of crimes in China were to be tried by American courts only. This treaty was monumental in that it laid the foundation for a more extensive and regulated American trade with China; American ships would no longer make the sporadic—and somewhat reckless—voyages to China so characteristic of the Old China trade.|$|E

They also agreed on finding a solution for health insurance coverage for Taiwanese students studying in Mainland China, on pragmatically establishing SEF and ARATS offices in their respective territories and on studying the feasibility of allowing visits to detained persons once these offices have been established. Before shaking hands, Wang addressed Zhang as [...] "TAO Director Zhang Zhijun" [...] and Zhang addressed Wang as [...] "Minister Wang Yu-chi" [...] without mentioning the name Mainland Affairs Council. However, China's Xinhua News Agency referred to Wang as the [...] "Responsible Official of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council" [...] (...) in its Chinese-language news and as [...] "Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Chief" [...] in its English-language news.

[...] Energy Transfer Partners responded by criticizing the Obama administration for [...] "political interference" [...] and said that [...] "further delay in the consideration of this case would add millions of dollars more each month in costs which cannot be recovered."
