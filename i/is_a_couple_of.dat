25|$|The Natal Aquarium {{was founded}} and {{is run by}} a family of {{biologists}} and retired environmentalists. Besides the exhibit, the aquarium also serves as a surgery center for sea animals. The Aquarium is located between the Oceânica Avenue and the beach. The Aquarium exhibits about 60 marine species. There are about 30 small aquariums, where the species are put individually or in small groups of two or three species. Most species were collected at the Brazilian and Rio Grande do Norte coast. Species include several kinds of fish (including piranhas), sea horses, shrimps, lobsters, stingrays, octopus, etc. In a refrigerated aquarium, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> penguins.|$|E
25|$|St John sub Castro (Latin for St. John-under-the-Castle) is {{the northernmost}} {{church in the}} old town. The {{surrounding}} town quarter is called St. John's. The church's boundaries are actually protected on one side by the Town Walls, although originally St. John's was a small Saxon building. It was destroyed in the 19th century but the main door was kept and used as an east door for the large new church, built in 1839 by George Cheeseman in flint and brick. In the graveyard there is a memorial to the Finnish prisoners kept in the old naval prison in the 19th century.

25|$|The soaring {{temperature}} in Chennai, especially during summer, demands extra care for {{residents of the}} zoo. Fortunately, the {{temperature in}}side the zoo campus <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> degrees lower than outside {{any time of the}} year, primarily due to the lush greenery. The park also maintains an exclusive summer management schedule. All animal enclosures have thatched roofs and fresh river sand spread on the floor to make it cooler for the animals. Water is sprinkled on the sand to provide extra cooling. Roofs of water birds' enclosures are covered with coconut leaves and wet gunny bags. Caves that are exposed directly to the sun are put under a shower twice a day. The enclosure for the king cobra has an air conditioner in order to provide an environment similar to its natural habitat as the species cannot withstand the summer heat. For birds, the topmost part of the cage is covered with jute bags, and water is sprinkled three times a day. Based on the temperature, cucumber, buttermilk, apple and banana are also served to herbivores. The zoo has also set up sprinklers to help animals beat the summer heat and is planning to set up about 20 more sprinklers at the deer safari.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of Elephant Odyssey is the Fossil Portal, an artificial tar pit that periodically drains to reveal man-made Pleistocene-era bones. The path turns {{a corner and}} opens up at the Mammoth Passage Plaza, with exhibits for jaguars and African lions to the left, an exhibit that has housed two-toed sloths to the right, and {{the tip of the}} elephant exhibit, with a large wading pool, straight ahead. The path continues to the left along the pool, passing by the jaguar exhibit on the left. The northern end of the elephant pool drains into the Mixed Species Exhibit, which houses tapirs, capybaras, and guanacos. The path meets up with the elephant exhibit again before it reaches the Elephant Care Center, where visitors can watch keepers care for the animals. Next is an exhibit for secretarybirds with grasses, a tree and a statue of the extinct Daggett's eagle nearby. Afterwards, the path goes down a crevasse with a wall embedded with vivaria for dung beetles and diving beetles, among other aquatic insects. The path tunnels below the elephant exhibit to reach the other side, where it continues between the elephant exhibit and a creek for native reptiles and amphibians. Just past the source of the stream is a restaurant and gift shop, and after that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> exhibits for pronghorns, horses, and camels. Next the path splits between a playground, a rattlesnake terrarium, and a California condor aviary with artificial rock spires and a stream. The paths then reunite and join the rest of the zoo.|$|E

2500|$|Deerwood is now mostly built out, with {{approximately}} 900 families in homes priced above $400,000.

The Tinseltown commercial center <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> miles north. The Avenues Mall is [...] south. And there are {{tens of thousands of people}} living in dozens of developments off Southside Boulevard and Baymeadows Road. Many homes in Deerwood are over forty years old, so it is not unusual for someone to demolish an older home and build a new custom home. Many of the larger properties are located on the east side of the development in a community known as [...] "The Estates". The entrances are adorned with life-size bronze bucks and does; a reminder of a time when deer were plentiful and people were scarce.|$|E

Mathematically brilliant but less than adept at other subjects in school, Meg is [...] "awkward", unpopular, and defensive around authority figures as well as her peers. Although she has the brains to accomplish difficult tasks, she rarely puts her strengths to use. She adores her mother and three brothers especially her youngest brother, Charles Wallace, and weeps much for her missing father. Like many adolescent girls, Meg is unhappy with her physical appearance, particularly her mouse-brown, unruly hair, braces and glasses, and considers herself a [...] "monster" [...] in comparison with her mother.

2500|$|Kushner's {{criticism}} of Israel's {{treatment of the}} Palestinians and of the increased religious extremism in Israeli politics and culture has created some controversy with U.S. Jews, including some opposition to his receiving an honorary doctorate at the 2006 commencement of Brandeis University. [...] The Zionist Organization of America unsuccessfully lobbied the university to rescind its invitation to Kushner. During the controversy, quotes critical of Zionism and Israel made by Kushner were circulated. Kushner {{said at the time}} that his quotes were [...] "grossly mischaracterized." [...] Kushner told the Jewish Advocate in an interview, [...] "All that anybody seems to be reading <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> right-wing Web sites taking things deliberately out of context and excluding anything that would complicate the picture by making me seem like a reasonable person, which I basically think I am." [...] In an interview with the Jewish Independent, Kushner commented, [...] "I want the state of Israel to continue to exist. I've always said that. I've never said anything else. My positions have been lied about and misrepresented in so many ways. People claim that I'm for a one-state solution, which is not true." [...] However, he later stated that he hopes that [...] "there might be a merging of the two countries because [...] geographically kind of ridiculous looking on a map," [...] although he acknowledged that political realities make this unlikely in the near future.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{previous}} race in Italy, {{the gap between}} Rosberg and Hamilton had closed by seven points. Hamilton had started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but had a poor start off the line and fell to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship battle and was pleased to make an improvement after his Monza victory: [...] "Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship and that is something that gives me huge motivation for the final six races - starting in Singapore." [...] Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous but it was something the latter was not concerned over and would focus on himself: [...] "At the moment, I am enjoying the moment more than I ever have in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where I know I can be on pole and I can win," [...] Ricciardo stated that while he was aware his chances of winning the championship were not realistic, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win either of the season's next two races to draw closer in the title battle: [...] "All it takes <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again.
