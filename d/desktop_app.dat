2500|$|In a December 2016 {{review of}} the {{software}} suite, Edward Mendelsohn of PC Magazine wrote that the suite was [...] "visually elegant" [...] with [...] "effortless collaboration", but that Docs, Sheets and Slides were [...] "less powerful than desktop-based suites". Comparing Google's office suite with Microsoft's and Apple's, he stated that [...] "Docs exists only in your Web browser", meaning that users have [...] "more limited feature set" [...] than [...] "the spacious, high-powered setting of a desktop app". He wrote that offline support required a plug-in, describing it as [...] "less convenient than a <b>desktop</b> <b>app,</b> {{and you have to}} remember to install it before you need it". Mendelsohn praised the user interface, describing it as [...] "elegant, highly usable" [...] with [...] "fast performance", and that the revision history [...] "alerts you to recent changes, and stores fine-grained records of revisions". Regarding the Explore functionality, he credited it for being the [...] "niftiest new feature" [...] in the suite and that it surpassed comparable features in Microsoft Office. He described the quality of imports of Office files as [...] "impressive fidelity". In summarization, he praised the suite for having [...] "the best balance of speed and power, and the best collaboration features, too", while noting that [...] "it lacks a few features offered by Microsoft Office 365, but it was also faster to load and save in our testing". In 2011, Paul Sawers of The Next Web described Google Docs as a [...] "pretty robust set of free tools that are improving every month". In a 2016 review of Google's G Suite business subscription service, Eric Grevstad of PC Magazine stated that Google Docs follows the [...] "80/20" [...] rule: [...] "that is, 80 percent of users will never need more than 20 percent of the features".|$|E
