25|$|Once the IF/B12 {{complex is}} {{recognized}} by specialized ileal receptors, it is transported into the portal circulation. The vitamin is {{then transferred to}} transcobalamin II (TC-II/B12), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B12 and <b>infantile</b> megaloblastic <b>anemia,</b> and abnormal B12 related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B12 levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B12 complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be endocytosed. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a lysosome, and free B12 is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{hemolytic}} anemia {{is a rare}} hematologic entity in children. Etiologies are mainly viruses or bacteria. We describe here a case of severe warm autoimmune {{hemolytic anemia}} (IgG- and C 3 d-positive direct antiglobulin test) in an immunocompetent 6 -month-old infant with acute Cytomegalovirus infection that responded well to corticotherapy and intraveneous immunoglobulins without using blood component transfusion. This case demonstrates the importance of recognizing CMV in <b>infantile</b> Autoimmune Hemolytic <b>Anemia,</b> especially because hemolysis can be severe and lethal...|$|R
40|$|Background: Choriocarcinoma {{is a rare}} highly {{malignant}} trophoblastic neoplasm. It can be {{preceded by}} any form of gestation including a complete or a partial mole, miscarriage and normal pregnancy. Simultaneous intraplacental choriocarcinoma involving both mother and infant is extremely rare. Hepatomegaly, anemia, elevated ßHCG is the diagnostic triad. Here we report a 6 weeks old Afghan girl infant with intraplacental choriocarcinoma presented by severe anemia and widespread multiple metastatic lesions in liver, lung and brain with an elevated level of ßHCG. According to rarity of the disease, rapid progression and the high mortality rate with delay in diagnosis and intervation, choriocarcinoma {{should be one of}} the differential diagnosis in severe <b>infantile</b> and maternal <b>anemia</b> without any antecedent reason. According to highly vascular and friable nature of tumor, biopsy can be dangerous for diagnosis. As choriocarcinoma secrets ßHCG, measurement of serum ßHCG is the most common method used to diagnose choriocarcinom...|$|R
40|$|Objective—Maternal iron needs {{increase}} 6 -fold during pregnancy, but obesity {{interferes with}} iron absorption. We hypothesized that maternal obesity impairs fetal iron status. Study Design— 316 newborns with {{risk factors for}} <b>infantile</b> iron deficiency <b>anemia</b> (IDA) were studied to examine obesity during pregnancy and neonatal iron status. Erythrocyte iron was assessed by cord blood hemoglobin (Hb), zinc protoporphyrin/heme (ZnPP/H) and reticulocyte-ZnPP/H and storage iron by serum ferritin. Results—Women with body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2, as compared with non-obese women, delivered larger offspring with higher reticulocyte-ZnPP/H, and lower serum ferritin concentrations (p< 0. 05 for both). With increasing BMI, estimated body iron was relatively lower (mg/kg) and the ratio of total Hb-bound iron (mg) /total body iron (mg) increased. Maternal diabetes compromised infant iron status, but multivariate analysis demonstrated that obesity was an independent predictor.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the weight-height {{development and the}} nutritional status of a sickle cell <b>anemia</b> <b>infantile</b> sample in relation to zinc seric levels and to bone age in comparison to a control group of eutrophic children of the same Brazilian region. Methods: There were studied 66 sickle cell children (GE) and 50 eutrophic ones (GC). The nutritional status was assessed using Rohrer Index, Z-score analysis of weight/age, height/age and body mass index (BMI). Zinc seric level (SZn), growth velocity (VC) and bone age (IO) were assessed using {{the standards of the}} National Center for Health Statistic (NCHS) data and the results obtained from the GC evaluation. Results: Both groups had similar Rohrer Index. GE presented weight/age and height/age Z scores and BMI of underdevelopment levels with significant statistical difference. VC and IO were also lower in GE. The mean SZn in GE was significantly lower than in GC. Conclusion: The studied sickle cell children were born with normal stature, after that an important decrease in weight-height development occurred, which may be related to under-nourishing status, bone age delay, smaller growth velocity and worse zinc seric levels...|$|R
50|$|Infantile pyknocytosis is {{the most}} {{commonly}} associated condition, and is a rare pediatric hematological condition. It is a potential cause of neonatal hemolytic <b>anemia.</b> <b>Infantile</b> pyknocytosis typically presents with neonatal jaundice and severe anemia, often requiring blood transfusions. The associated hemolytic anemia is often transient with peak incidence at 3-4 weeks, with spontaneous and complete resolution by {{four to six months}} of life. An etiology for this condition has not been established but some evidence, including the presence of dehydrated red cells on peripheral blood smear that seem to have undergone oxidative stress, points to causes that include deficiency of antioxidants such as vitamin E or the presence of an oxidative factor. The diagnosis of infantile pyknocytosis is essentially based on the peripheral blood smear, with additional diagnostic investigations to rule out similarly presenting conditions such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and pyruvate kinase deficiency. Both of these conditions can also result in pyknocytes observable on the blood smear. Treatment involves phototherapy if blood bilirubin levels are greater than normal for the age of the infant, and blood transfusion if hemoglobin is found to be unacceptably low or decreasing based on clinical judgement of laboratory values.|$|R
40|$|To clarify {{developmental}} outcone and {{its relationship}} to risk factors for high risk newborn infants, a longitudinal prospective study was done on 72 infants, Subjects aged from one through seven had been admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Nara Medical University Hospital. The follow up evaluations were performed every half year for the infants aged under three, and every year for those over that age, and consisted of five examinations. They were assessments of risk factors, developmental quotient (DQ), early infantile behavioral problems, physical measurement and home envi- ronment estimated by Japanese Home Screning Questionnarie (JHSQ). The results were summarized as follows : 1. The DQ of the subjects at each age was within the normal range. On the subjects of four years and up, the DQ's were high in 'Self-help' and low in 'Language'. 2. The weight of the subjects at each age was lower than the median value of the Japanese. The head circumference was roughly equal to the median value. Height, weight and head circumference measurements significantly correlated with the DQ in the subjects aged three. 3, The significant risk factors for DQ were abnormalities of parents' characters, maternal stress during pregnancy, <b>infantile</b> heart disease, <b>anemia</b> and long-term endotra- cheal intubation. As the result of quanification method I, the effects of each risk factor on the DQ were put in order as follows : (1) infantile heart disease, (2) past abortions, (3) birth weight, (4) abnormalities of brain CT, and (5) family illness. 4. About early infantile behavioral problems, little babble and lost speech significantly affected the DQ in a negative way. 5. Home envimonment of subjects aged three correlated well with the DQ...|$|R
50|$|Significant {{historical}} events related to zinc deficiency began in 1869 when zinc was first discovered to {{be essential to}} the growth of an organism (Aspergillus Niger). In 1929 Lutz measured zinc in numerous human tissues using the dithizone technique and estimated total body zinc in a 70 kg man to be 2.2 grams. Zinc was found to be essential {{to the growth of}} rats in 1933. In 1939 beriberi patients in China were noted to have decreased zinc levels in skin and nails. In 1940 zinc levels in a series of autopsies found it to be present in all tissues examined. In 1942 a study showed most zinc excretion was via the feces. In 1950 a normal serum zinc level was first defined, and found to be 17.3-22.1 micromoles/liter. In 1956 cirrhotic patients were found to have low serum zinc levels. In 1963 zinc was determined to be essential to human growth, three enzymes requiring zinc as a cofactor were described, and a report was published of a 21-year-old Iranian man with stunted growth, <b>infantile</b> genitalia, and <b>anemia</b> which were all reversed by zinc supplementation. In 1972 fifteen Iranian rejected army inductees with symptoms of zinc deficiency were reported: all responded to zinc. In 1973 the first case of acrodermatitis enteropathica due to severe zinc deficiency was described. In 1974 the National Academy of Sciences declared zinc to be an essential element for humans and established a recommended daily allowance. In 1978 the Food and Drug Administration required zinc to be in total parenteral nutrition fluids. In the 1990s there was increasing attention on the role of zinc deficiency in childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries. In 2002 the zinc transporter protein ZIP4 was first identified as the mechanism for absorption of zinc in the gut across the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte. By 2014 over 300 zinc containing enzymes have been identified, as well as over 1000 zinc containing transcription factors.|$|R
