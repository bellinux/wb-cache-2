500|$|Eventually, {{the dispute}} between Burger King and its franchises came {{to center on}} the 2009-2010 {{promotion}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Buck</b> Double sandwich. The Buck Double was a quarter-pound double cheese burger designed to compete against the McDonald's McDouble sandwich. The primary issue was financial in nature, the franchises claimed that Burger King forced them to sell the sandwich at a loss of 10¢ per sandwich. [...] Franchisees sued the parent company claiming {{that it did not}} have the authority to dictate pricing structures for the independently held franchises. The court dismissed the case in a decision that stated the company could legally dictate pricing structures over its franchises objections, but found that there was enough evidence to allow the franchises to move forward with their claims of dealing in bad faith in a separate case. In response to the decision, the franchise group filed a second suit that claimed the deal was not properly structured and was implemented without the franchises' consent. The NFA suit claimed BK acted in bad faith by implementing the deal after the franchises had twice voted down the deal.|$|E
500|$|Response to Episode One was {{generally}} positive, and reviewers praised {{the game for}} having more intricate, well-paced gameplay than Half-Life 2. The game's interactivity, particularly {{in the form of}} Alyx and her reactions to the player's actions and the events of the game, was also singled out for praise. PC Gamer commented that [...] "while this inaugural episode may not be the essential FPS that Half-Life2 is, I can't imagine any shooter fan who'd want to miss it." [...] In its review, PC Gamer UK directed particular praise to the balance between puzzle-oriented and action-oriented challenges throughout the game. In Australia, the magazine PC PowerPlay awarded the game 10 out of 10. Edge praised the [...] "deftness" [...] with which the game was able to direct the player's eyes, and the strength of Alyx as a companion, concluding, [...] "In an interactive genre bound to the traditions of the pop-up gun and invisible hero, it simply doesn't get more sophisticated than this." [...] Episode One earned a scores of 87/100 and 85.59% on review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. IGN awarded Episode One with the title of [...] "Best PC FPS of 2006" [...] and described it as a [...] "great bang <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> using Valve's new episodic plan", although it did not offer [...] "the complete experience that Half-Life2 was". GameSpy ranked Episode One ninth on its 2006 [...] "Games of the Year" [...] list, and it also noted the implementation of Alyx as a believable and useful companion.|$|E

2500|$|Early reviews {{praised the}} Insight's futuristic styling, handling, and price but {{noted that it}} was less powerful, less fuel efficient, and less {{comfortable}} than other more expensive hybrids. The Insight performed well in comparison tests administered by Motor Trend and Car and Driver. In their comparison test against the 2010 Toyota Prius, Car and Driver stated [...] "...the Insight proved more visceral, connected, and agile than the Prius. The Insight represents a lot of engineering bang <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>buck,</b> {{and the majority of}} its dynamics are more satisfying than the Prius’s" [...] citing the benefits of the Insight's firm brake feel, accurate steering, and tight suspension (the latter borrowing heavily from the latest Honda Fit). It did not perform as well in Edmunds or Popular Mechanics tests. Despite a high reliability rating in Consumer Reports testing, the Insight was assigned a low score, stating that it fell short in ride quality, handling, interior noise, acceleration, refinement, rear seat access and rear visibility.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Beaumont of NME gave it {{a rating}} of six out of ten, a higher score than the {{original}} album version review by the same publication, claiming that [...] "the Aussie rapper offers a slight improvement on her debut LP with this reissue." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator gave the album a 4/5 rating calling it [...] "as good an opportunity as any {{to acknowledge that the}} femcee's debut is actually relentlessly enjoyable," [...] adding that [...] "there isn't a dud track" [...] and [...] "of the other new cuts, [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] stands out as another future hit". Rory Cashin of State gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "the new additions are mostly winners," [...] but [...] "just like her first time out with this album, Iggy has a problem; trying too hard to please herself and please commercial radio." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic, who had also reviewed The New Classic, gave it three and a half out of five stars and said, [...] "In the end, Reclassified is a better effort than The New Classic and offers more bang <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>buck,</b> but this [...] "release it until you get it right" [...] blueprint is concerning for consumers, who now have a choice between rebuying it all or seeking out the new numbers on their own." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Bucks' {{official}} mascot is Bango. The word [...] "Bango" [...] {{was originally}} coined by Eddie Doucette, the longtime play-by-play announcer <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bucks.</b> Doucette used <b>the</b> word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket. It was {{often used for}} sharpshooter Jon McGlocklin. When it came time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bucks</b> to choose a name for their new mascot, the name [...] "Bango" [...] won the contest.|$|R

60|$|To {{this plan}} Ralph at length agreed, and having ridden round the pan, {{which was not}} more than fifty yards across, he {{dismounted}} from his horse and hid himself behind a bush in {{the neck of the}} kloof. Then Suzanne rode in among the reeds, shouting and singing, and beating them with her sjambock in order to disturb anything that might be hidden there. Nor was her trouble in vain, for suddenly, with a shrill whistle of alarm by the sound of which this kind of antelope may be known even in the dark, up sprang two riet-buck and dashed away towards the neck of the kloof, looking large as donkeys and red as lions as they vanished into the thick cover. So close were they to Suzanne that her mare took fright and reared; but the girl was the best horsewoman in those parts, and kept her seat, calling the while to Ralph to make ready <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>buck.</b> Presently she heard a shot, and having quieted the mare, rode out of the reeds and galloped round the dry pan to find Ralph looking foolish with no riet-buck in sight.|$|E
60|$|But {{they are}} all hunters and their game is the deadly chase in the open or the wild. There are hunters who hate action, who hate to walk and climb and toil and wear {{themselves}} out to get a shot. Such men are hunters still, but still not men! There are hunters who have game driven up to them. I heard a story told by an officer whom I believe. In {{the early days of}} the war he found himself somewhere on the border between Austria and Germany. He was invited to a hunt by personages of high degree. They motored to a sequestered palace in the forest, and next day motored to a shooting-lodge. At daylight he was called, and taken to the edge of a forest and stationed in an open glade. His stand was an upholstered divan placed high in the forks of a tree. His guide told him that pretty soon a doe would come out of the forest. But he was not to shoot it. In fifteen minutes a lame buck would come out. But he was not to shoot that one either. In ten more minutes another buck would come out, and this third deer he was to kill. My informant told me this was all very seriously meant. The gun given him was large enough in calibre to kill an elephant. He walked up the steps to the comfortable divan and settled himself to await events. The doe trotted out exactly on schedule time. So did the lame buck. They came from the woods and were not frightened. The third deer, a large buck, was a few moments late--three minutes to be exact. According to instructions the American killed this buck--a matter that took some nerve he said, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> walked out like a cow. That night a big supper was given in the guest's honor. He had to eat certain parts of the buck he had killed, and drink flagons of wine. This kind of hunting must be peculiarly German or Austrian, and illustrates the peculiar hunting ways of men.|$|E
