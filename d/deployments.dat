40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and the amount of combat exposure were predictors for burnout in a military sample. The CAR and burnout scores before and six months after <b>deployment</b> were also examined. Based on previous research, participants were hypothesized to have a lower CAR and higher burnout scores after <b>deployment.</b> We also expect that the number of combat related events during <b>deployment</b> is a significant predictor for burnout scores after <b>deployment.</b> Finally we expect that the CAR is a significant predictor for burnout scores after <b>deployment.</b> Method Participants are measured before <b>deployment</b> and six months after <b>deployment.</b> The sample consisted of 62 participants from the Dutch military who left for <b>deployment</b> to Afghanistan between April 2005 and November 2006. Burnout was assessed with the Utrechtse Burnout Schaal (UBOS) and combat exposure was measured with the <b>Deployment</b> exposure Scale (DES). The cortisol awakening response was analyzed from saliva. Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to perform statistic analysis. Results The prevalence of burnout was 9. 84 % before <b>deployment</b> and 20 % after <b>deployment.</b> The CAR was significantly lower after <b>deployment</b> than before. After <b>deployment,</b> the CAR (AUC) explained 9. 3 % of the variance in UBOS-subscale exhaustion. The DES explained 7. 8 % of the variance in UBOS-subscale competence. Discussion The prevalence of burnout in our sample doubled after <b>deployment.</b> One out of every five participants met the criteria for burnout after <b>deployment.</b> A higher cortisol awakening response before <b>deployment</b> is a predictor for higher burnout scores six months after <b>deployment.</b> Furthermore, the more combat related events a person experienced, the less competent they felt six months after <b>deployment...</b>|$|R
40|$|Internet {{protocols}} {{spread to}} potential adopters through several successive phases of implementation, com-mercialization, acquisition, and {{adoption of the}} protocol. This process of protocol <b>deployment</b> involves several stakeholders and varies depending on the <b>deployment</b> environment and the protocol in question. This complexity {{and the lack of}} comprehensive measurement studies call for a further conceptualization of measuring protocol diffusion along the whole <b>deployment</b> process. Therefore, this article develops a framework for measuring the <b>deployment</b> of Internet protocols, consisting of <b>deployment</b> steps, <b>deployment</b> models, <b>deployment</b> measures, and data sources. The measures are further linked to each other through <b>deployment</b> gaps and delays. In order to demonstrate the framework, it is used to assess how a set of pre-installed protocols spread in the Finnish mobile market. The framework highlights the differences between the <b>deployment</b> models and the importance to use both the <b>deployment</b> measures and gaps in the analysis of protocol success. Furthermore, the illustrative results indicate that protocol <b>deployment</b> is driven by applications, and show the existence of large <b>deployment</b> gaps between the protocol possession and usage. The results are relevant especially to researchers interested in holistically analyzing protocol <b>deployment</b> and protocol developers for measuring and improving the success of their protocols.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6 for the WCT, {{initially}} prototype SCOPE uses the Cassandra-X <b>deployment</b> setup for write operations and the Cassandra-Y <b>deployment</b> setup is inactive (i.e., the write latency of the Cassandra-Y <b>deployment</b> setup is 0). Then, when the Cassandra-X <b>deployment</b> setup is stressed with the write-heavy workload (starting {{at the time}} scale of 20 min) and the latency has increased from 0.02 to 0.05 ms (at time interval between 30 and 38 min), which exceeds the specified threshold value (i.e., 0.04 ms), the SCOPE middleware observes this behavior of the <b>deployment</b> setup and starts redirecting all write operation requests to the Cassandra-Y <b>deployment</b> setup (satisfy R 1 discussed in Section 2.3). However, as shown in Fig.  6, the latency of the Cassandra-X <b>deployment</b> setup keeps on increasing even after SCOPE switches to the Cassandra-Y <b>deployment</b> setup. The increase is mainly caused by a number additional processes started to generate the write-heavy workloads on the Cassandra-X <b>deployment</b> setup. These additional processes are not stopped immediately after SCOPE switches to the Cassandra-Y <b>deployment</b> setup. As a result, the Cassandra-X <b>deployment</b> is stressed with write-heavy workloads even after SCOPE switches to the Cassandra-Y <b>deployment</b> setup.|$|R

To optimize RSU <b>deployment,</b> we introduce the notion of centrality in a social network to RSU <b>deployment,</b> {{and use it to}} measure the importance of an RSU position candidate in RSU <b>deployment.</b> Based on the notion of centrality, we propose a centrality-based RSU <b>deployment</b> approach and formulate the RSU <b>deployment</b> problem as a linear programing problem with the objective to maximize the total centrality of all position candidates selected for RSU <b>deployment</b> under the constraint of a given <b>deployment</b> budget. To solve the formulated problem, we analogize the problem to a 0 - 1 Knapsack problem and thus employ a 0 - 1 Knapsack algorithm to solve the problem. In the analogy, the budget in the RSU <b>deployment</b> problem is analogous to the bag's capacity in the Knapsack problem, the cost of deploying an RSU is analogous to an item's weight, and the centrality of a position candidate is analogous to an item's value.

5|$|From March 1965 until mid-1967, Melbourne {{underwent}} a regular pattern of <b>deployments</b> to Southeast Asia, exercises, and flag-showing visits to {{nations in the}} Asia-Pacific region. Several of the Southeast Asian <b>deployments</b> {{were related to the}} Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, and involved participation in show of force exercises off the coast of Malaysia. During 1965 and 1966, Melbourne escorted sister ship , which had been recommissioned as a troop transport, for short periods during the latter's first, third, and fourth transport voyages to Vietnam. Despite the carrier being the centrepiece of several plans to involve Australian forces in the Vietnam War, the escort runs were the extent of Melbournes participation in the conflict, and the carrier remained outside the Market Time area while Sydney and her other escorts proceeded to Vũng Tàu. As the carrier was optimised for anti-submarine warfare, there was little need for her {{at the start of the}} war. Utilising the carrier was suggested again by RAN officials in March 1966, when the United States Seventh Fleet was having difficulties maintaining anti-submarine patrols around Yankee Station, but Melbourne could only remain on station for a single, ten-day period, a third of the time that US carriers were operational for on rotating <b>deployments.</b> Seventh Fleet staff suggested in April 1967 that Melbourne deploy in the anti-submarine role, but nothing came of these talks. Consideration was also given to using Melbourne as a floating helicopter base, but only ten Wessex helicopters could be provided, and modifications were required for them to operate as troop carriers. Both options were made more prohibitive by the need to supply at least two escorts for the carrier at a time when the RAN was having difficulty meeting deployment commitments with the available destroyers and destroyer escorts.|$|E
