40|$|Because conduit {{systems in}} maturely {{developed}} karst aquifers {{have a low}} hydraulic resistance, aquifers drain easily and karst aquifers are subdivided into well-defined <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins.</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>water</b> elevations are highest at basin boundaries; lowest at the spring where the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is discharged. Parameters that control the type of conduit development are (1) the effective hydraulic gradient, (2) {{the focus of the}} drainage basin, and (3) the karstifiability of the bedrock. Moderate to highly effective hydraulic gradients permit the runaway process that leads to single conduit caves and well ordered branchwork systems. Low hydraulic gradients allow many alternate flow paths and thus a large degree of fuzziness in the basin boundaries. Low gradient <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> also tend to merge due to rising water tables during periods of high discharge. Focus is provided by geological constraints that optimize discharge at specific locations that can evolve into karst springs.

The new approach utilizes a two-step nonlinear optimization. A test problem typical of a semiarid river basin with a seasonal agricultural demand and an increasing municipal and industrial demand is presented. Seasonal variations in demand, precipitation and recharge are handled by dividing each modeling year into a wet season and a dry season in the management model. Sustainable pumping and injection rates that would satisfy both the head and water quality constraints are obtained in the management model for each demand-supply scenario. An iterative technique is then used to solve the optimal pumping and injection rates within the planning horizon using the sustainable rates as upper bounds.

40|$|Cooperation Agreement No. CA 8000 - 2 - 9001 Work Order No. 8039 - 2 - 9001 Within Saguaro National Park only Rincon Mountain District {{contains}} significant riparian areas. The geologic {{framework of}} the Tanque Verde Ridge and Rincon Valley exerts strong control on the hydrology of these riparian systems. Pantano fault constitutes a line of hydrogeologic separation between the occurrence and utilization of groundwater in the Rincon Valley and the main Tucson basin. No known, comparable fault isolates the upper Tanque Verde Creek alluvium from downstream pumping effects. However, east of the confluence with Agua Caliente Wash, the highly permeable alluvial materials are much thinner, and serve to dampen such downstream effects. Therefore, the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> reservoirs supporting the riparian areas within Rincon Mountain District are not directly connected to the Tucson basin aquifer. In what is described herein as upper basin areas, high gradient tributary streams to Tanque Verde Creek and Rincon Creek have discontinuous bodies of shallow alluvium interspersed with bedrock channel. Alluvium has accumulated behind small faults or resistant bedrock ledges and contains shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> that support small pockets of riparian or xeroriparian vegetation. The <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in these small basins is sustained by seeps or springs, and by runoff from precipitation and {{is not likely to}} be connected to a regional <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> system.

A series of laboratory experiments and field investigations were carried out to characterize the dominant chemical forms of dissolved iodine, i. e., iodide (I-), iodate (IO 3 -), and organic iodine (DOI) in natural waters. Sensitive methods were developed for the analysis of nanomolar quantities of 127 I species in a variety of environmental systems using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and an organic iodine decomposition technique, dehydrohalogenation. The potential use of 129 I/ 127 I as a hydrological tracer was evaluated through measurements of 129 I and 127 I, which were carried out in wells in the artificially recharged <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> of Orange County, California. Literature values of aquifer ages based on 3 H/ 3 He and &# 948; 18 O tracer data, as well as time-series data of chloride and Santa Ana River flow rates over the past decade were compared to values for 129 I and 127 I. The iodine isotopes demonstrated a conservative behavior in these aquifers, suggesting that the observed variations of these isotopes reflect past river flow conditions during the time of recharge. The feasibility of using 129 I/ 127 I ratios to trace terrestrial organic matter across an estuary was tested. A novel analytical technique to determine 129 I/ 127 I ratios in DOI was developed for this investigation. The results of a Galveston Bay transect clearly show that 129 I/ 127 I ratios in DOI can remain elevated up to salinity of about 15, but that 129 I/ 127 I values of inorganic iodine species do not show any trend with change in salinity gradient due to fast isotopic and chemical equilibration in the estuarine waters...|$|E

Salt enters the Murray-Darling system through saline <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> aquifers and from irrigation and drainage of saline land. Irrigation and drainage generate benefits from improved agricultural productivity and impose costs through increased salt loads to the Murray-Darling system. The salinity of the River Murray {{can be reduced}} by pumping highly saline <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> into evaporation <b>basins</b> before it enters the River Murray. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model {{which is used to}} determine the mix of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> interception schemes and land improvement schemes that minimises the net present value (over a time horizon of 30 years) of total Murray-Darling Basin costs due to salinity and waterlogging. By varying a target salinity level, the mix of works that yields various salinity targets in the River Murray at minimum cost is obtained. The sensitivity of the optimal solution to prescribed changes in costs and benefits of projects and to a longer planning horizon is examined.

To improve the understanding of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> occurrence, movement, and sustainability, an investigation was conducted using a number of complementary methods, including major ion geochemistry, iso-tope hydrology, analysis of gases dissolved in <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> aquifer testing, geophysics, and an examination of surface and subsurface geology. By combining information from multiple lines of investigation, a more complete picture of the basin hydrogeology was assembled than would have been possible using fewer methods. The results show that the hydrogeology of the San Bernardino Valley is markedly different than that of its four neighboring basins in the United States. The differences include water quality, chemical evolution, storage, and residence time. The differences result from the locally unique geology of the San Bernardino Valley, which is due to the presence of a magmatically active accommodation zone (a zone separating two regions of normal faults with opposite dips). The geological differences and the resultant hydrological differences between the San Bernardino Valley and its neighboring basins may serve as a model for the distinctive nature of chemical evolution of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in other <b>basins</b> with locally distinct tectonic histories...|$|R

40|$|Three {{aquifers}} {{of diverse}} lithology and hydraulic character form the ground-water reservoir in the Roswell basin. The main aquifer, the carbonate aquifer, is developed in carbonate rocks of Permian age. It {{is the source}} of about two-thirds of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> pumped in the basin and receives more than 90 percent of the recharge to the basin. The second most important aquifer is the shallow aquifer which lies near the Pecos River in beds of sand and gravel of both Permian and Holocene age. About one-third of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> pumped in the basin comes from the shallow aquifer. Prior to pumping, the main source of recharge to the shallow aquifer was probably <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> leaking upward from the carbonate aquifer. Since pumping began, the main source of recharge to the shallow aquifer is probably return flow of irrigation water pumped from the carbonate aquifer. Natural discharge of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> from the shallow aquifer into the Pecos River causes a gain in th. e base flow of the Pecos River in the Roswell basin. The third aquifer, the shallow-artesian aquifer, is in red beds and evaporite beds of Permian age. This aquifer overlies the carbonate aquifer and underlies the shallow aquifer. The shallow-artesian aquifer acts as a minor aquifer and also as a semi-permeable unit which partly confines <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in the carbonate aquifer. Vertical permeability of the shallow-artesian aquifer is variable and depends on the lithology and thickness of the aquifer. Hydraulic head in the shallow-artesian aquifer also varies quite widely depending on the depth to which a well penetrates the aquifer. All ground-water aquifers in the basin transect formational boundaries and are therefore not closely related to the named geologic formations. A flow net analysis of the carbonate aquifer and of the shallow aquifer imply that geologic structure is important in the movement of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in the <b>basin</b> by limiting the transmissivity of the shallow and carbonate aquifers, by forming the present pattern of surface water drainage, and possibly by the contamination of fresh <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> by highly saline <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> The flow net analysis also shows areas of recharge to the shallow and carbonate aquifers, and areas where the carbonate aquifer looses water to the shallow-artesian aquifer and to the shallow aquifer...|$|R
