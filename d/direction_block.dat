Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 73 - 74). 74 leaves, bound 29 cmPurpose: To {{examine the}} biomechanics of volleyball block-jump landings of adolescent female athletes to determine injury risk {{factors associated with}} this age group. The independent variables were skill level, knee injury history, and lower extremity involvement. Dependent variables were lower extremity kinematics and kinetics. Methods: We used a causal-comparative retrospective research design to identify associated knee injury risk factors. Prior {{to the start of}} the competitive club season a retrospective injury questionnaire was administered to all participants to determine injury history status. Participants were 40 highly trained adolescent female club volleyball athletes who were divided into low (U 13) and high (U 17, VIS) skill level groups. Six high-speed three dimensional motion capture cameras and two force plates were used to collect kinematic and kinetic data. Three-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) linear model were used to analyze three independent variables and six dependent variables of right direction and left <b>direction</b> <b>block</b> jumps. Results: Findings indicated higher maximal vertical ground reaction forces (F= 4. 71, P=O. 03) on the right leg when subjects performed right <b>direction</b> <b>block</b> jump landings, regardless of ski 11 level or previous injury history.

40|$|Cinder cones {{are common}} on Banks Peninsula and this study {{concentrates}} on eleven sites {{situated on the}} Lyttelton Volcano. The study focuses on the structure, petrology and geochemistry of cinder cones and discusses their eruptive history. Lyttelton volcanism began in the Miocene (10. 8 Ma) with early (L 1) activity centred near "Head of the Bay". Constant replenishment of the main chamber caused L 1 lavas to be dominantly basaltic with limited differentiation. The development of a large cone resulted in distension which caused the development of horizontally fed radial dikes. Initial dike activity was low and lavas were dominantly fed from the central conduit with little flank activity. As L 1 grew though, dikes became more common and so did cinder cone activity on the flanks. Cinder cones would have been fed by volatile rich magmas quickly reaching the surface via dikes and hence erupting explosively. The increase in dikes during L 1 also caused the increasing development of more evolved magmas that fed lavas. Then during a quiescent period there was large-scale collapse of the eastern flank, followed by erosion and weathering of the L 1 volcanic edifice during which activity shifted north-east to "Charteris Bay". Renewed (L 2) activity after the quiescent period gave rise to more evolved lavas due to the large increase in dike activity, caused by the large amounts of stress acting on the edifice. Hence cinder cone activity on the flanks was also very common. Cinder cone samples are dominated by phenocrysts of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine and Ti-magnetite and show {{a wide range of}} mineral textures. This suggests that crystals have grown under a variety of temperatures and pressures and/or been derived from magmas of different compositions. Geochemically the cones are part of an alkaline basalt-hawaiite-mugearite- benmoreite-trachyte association. The deposits in this study are all inferred to have formed by Strombolian and Hawaiian type eruptions due to their small dispersal areas. These eruptions formed cinder cones whose morphology depended on numerous factors, all of which contributed to their overall development: In this study the deposits have been classified into four facies based on welding, dip <b>direction,</b> <b>block</b> and bomb size, colour and {{the presence or absence of}} some clasts. The Vent Facies consists of densely welded grey/black fused spatter and represents vent and early formed products. Vesicularity is 80 % flattened clasts with deposits inferred to be welded due to their flattened nature. Spatter flows are common in the facies due to the rapid accumulation of spatter and its flowage. The Medial Facies consist of crudely bedded bomb, block and lapilli beds. Clasts are undeformed and non-welded. The Distal Facies consist of lapilli, ash, and crystals. Rare bombs occasionally occur and the deposits are generally well sorted and bedded. Overall, throughout each of the facies, clast size and welding decreases with increasing distance from the vent area...|$|E

40|$|Image {{interpolation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} elementary imaging research topics. A number of image interpolation methods have been developed for uncompressed images in the literature. However, a lot of videos have already been stored in MPEG- 2 format or have to be transmitted in MPEG- 2 format due to bandwidth limitation. The image interpolation methods developed for uncompressed images may not be effective when directly applied to compressed videos, because on the one hand, they do not utilize the information existed in the coded bitstreams; on the other hand, they do not consider quantization error, which may be dominant in some cases. Inspired by the success of the intra prediction in H. 264 /AVC and the edge-directed image interpolation methods (such as LAZA and NEDI), we propose a directional frame interpolation for MPEG compressed video. In the proposed method, 8 × 8 intra blocks in I frames are first classified to the nine <b>block</b> <b>directions</b> in transform domain. Then the interpolation on each block is performed along its <b>block</b> <b>direction.</b> For each <b>block</b> <b>direction,</b> an optimal Wiener filter is trained based on the representative video sequences and then used for its interpolation. In the similar way, for each pixel in an inter block in P or B frames, the interpolation is performed along the direction of its corresponding reference block. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the traditional linear methods such as Bicubic and Bilinear and the edge-directed methods such as LAZA and NEDI, while keeping low computational complexity which meets the requirement of practical applications. © 2012 SPIE-IS&T...|$|R
