30|$|The use of {{cellulase}} enzyme in denim washing is very effective. The tensile strength, {{stiffness and}} color shade decrease after cellulase treatment. Hydrolysis {{of the cotton}} denim garments caused enhanced color fading, softness, water absorption and elongation; meanwhile, tensile strength is decreased. The rate of denim softness, water absorption and moisture regain increase due to catalytic hydrolysis by the cellulase (fibers are loosened by the enzyme). The fabric GSM obtained with cellulase washing is a little {{higher than those of}} pre-washing due to more fabric shrinkage in the warp direction, although Koo et al. (1994) found GSM decreased <b>for</b> <b>mercerized</b> cotton than unmercerized cotton fabrics. Examination of the cellulase treated fibers by SEM shows more cracked cellulose on the surface; as a result, fibers are loosened and resulting rougher surface on those denim fabrics. It is further noted that pre-washed denim samples were stiff and harder than cellulase treated cotton denim garments.|$|R

Apparatus for controlling the variables was built and yarns were mercerized with it under systematically varied conditions of tension, time, temperature, and concentration of caustic soda. The strongest conclusion to be drawn from this work is that the strongest mercerized yarn of a given count from a given quality of cotton is obtained under the following conditions: 1. use of low-twist yarn obtained with twist multipliers from 2. 2 to 3; 2. thorough pretreatment of the yarn to remove all extraneous materials; 3. mercerization at a temperature of 0 C or lower; 4. use of sufficient tension during mercerization to prevent the yarn from contracting more than 3 percent. 5. Use of caustic solution having a concentration of 10 percent or higher; 6. the time of mercerization to be 5 minutes. The resulting yarn should be 40 to 100 percent stronger than the original yarn of the same weight...|$|R

40|$|Anisotropic {{nanostructures}} such as nano-wires, nano-tubes, nano-rods, nanoribbons, nano-layers, etc. {{are extremely}} attracted {{due to their}} larger surface area as compared to nano-particles. This research has targeted at fabrication of the metallic nano-wires through a simple one-step pad-dry method. The effects of mercerizing {{as one of the}} most common and important finishing treatments on cotton fabrics have been investigated. Mercerized and un-mercerized fabrics with the same structures have been treated and compared. SEM micrographs confirmed fabrication of the nano-wires with a high aspect ratio on the fiber surfaces oriented parallel with fiber axes. An enhanced potentiality for growing nano-wires with higher level of orientation has been observed <b>for</b> <b>mercerized</b> fabrics compared to un-mercerized ones. As it is well known, mercerizing can cause some structural changes in cotton fibers. Reduction of crystallinity as a result of this process (mercerizing) leads to increasing the amorphous regions which have a good potentiality for growing nano-structured materials. The higher moisture regains, absorbency, smoother morphology, etc. caused by mercerizing can direct the better growth of nano-structures on mercerized fabrics.
