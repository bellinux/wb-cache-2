25|$|The Alumni Walk was {{launched}} in U.P.’s centennial year in 2008. A project of the UPD administration under then Chancellor Sergio S. Cao, the project sought to transform the inner sidewalk of the Academic Oval into a tile-paved footpath with commemorative slabs bearing UPD alumni-donors’ names, and whose donations went to the UPD <b>Faculty</b> <b>Development</b> Fund. On March 2008, however, the Academic Oval was turned into one-way in order to lessen traffic volume entering the university. According to then Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs Cynthia Grace Gregorio, the policy also promotes lessening air pollution by creating biking lanes {{on the inner side}} of the circle.|$|E

Attending many of the ESC's open rituals and festivals, she was introduced to a [...] "diverse group" [...] of Wiccans and other Pagans, and developed a contact base in the community. Berger and Arthen subsequently embarked on a project entitled [...] "The Pagan Census" [...] in an attempt to gain sociological data from the Pagan community across the U.S. Receiving funding from the <b>Faculty</b> <b>Development</b> Fund at West Chester University, Berger was aided in this project by over 15 students who helped her to code and enter data for the survey. Together, Berger and Arthen wrote and distributed their survey through Wiccan and Pagan organizations across the country, as well as in journals, on the internet and at festivals. The duo received over 2000 responses, providing Berger with one of her main sources of information.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the perceptions of occupational education officers concerning the willingness of part-time instructors in community colleges in the United States to attend professional development opportunities and the best methods and times to deliver these activities. The findings indicate that community colleges should consider providing at least one part-time <b>faculty</b> professional <b>development</b> activity per academic year, scheduling these activities to occur in the evening or at night, during the Fall of the year, as well as factor in the distance and travel times which part-time faculty may encounter when choosing to participate. Community colleges should also consider other sources outside of their own institution to teach part-time <b>faculty</b> professional <b>development</b> activities depending on the topic and the level of expertise required. Intrinsic rewards to promote and maintain participation in part-time <b>faculty</b> professional <b>development</b> programs and activities should continue to be emphasized to encourage involvement with consideration given to possible remuneration of per diem and travel expenses...|$|R

40|$|Research into <b>faculty</b> members' {{instructional}} <b>development</b> has primarily {{focused on}} individual skills and knowledge. As collegial interactions may support or constrain <b>faculty's</b> professional <b>development</b> in higher education, this study compared and contrasted the networks {{of faculty members}} in different stages of instructional development (novice, experienced non-expert, and experienced expert teachers). Faculty networks comprised the relations that teaching faculty members used to communicate about their teaching practice. To capture these networks, a total of 30 faculty members were interviewed. We used an egocentric network approach to examine {{the differences between the}} networks in network size, tie strength, and network diversity. Results based on analyses of variance and multilevel analyses suggested three key findings: (a) Faculty members in different stages of instructional development varied in the size of their network; (b) faculty members in different stages of development had access to different types of networks in terms of tie strength; and (c) faculty members in different stages of development varied in the diversity of teaching experience in their networks. Experienced expert teachers had larger, stronger, and more diverse networks compared with experienced non-experts. Novices also had larger networks, but they were characterized by lower tie strength and less diversity. These findings demonstrate that network development is not just a time-age effect, but suggests arrested development for experienced non-experts linked to limited network input. This provides important evidence for the role of collegial interactions throughout <b>faculty's</b> <b>development</b> as a teacher. We further discuss the implications of this study in light of <b>faculty</b> members' instructional <b>development...</b>|$|R
