50|$|Butter knives have a <b>dull</b> <b>cutting</b> {{edge and}} are {{generally}} used for spreading. They are typically thought of more as servingware (used more {{as part of}} a table setting), to be used by diners to serve and/or spread butter or other soft spreadable foods, i.e. soft cheeses or jams, than as a kitchen or food preparation tool.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{numerical}} systems of CNC programming {{it is possible}} for the code generator to assume that the controlled mechanism is always perfectly accurate, or that precision tolerances are identical for all cutting or movement directions. This is not always a true condition of CNC tools. CNC tools with a large amount of mechanical backlash can still be highly precise if the drive or cutting mechanism is only driven so as to apply cutting force from one direction, and all driving systems are pressed tightly together in that one cutting direction. However a CNC device with high backlash and a <b>dull</b> <b>cutting</b> tool can lead to cutter chatter and possible workpiece gouging. Backlash also affects precision of some operations involving axis movement reversals during cutting, such as the milling of a circle, where axis motion is sinusoidal. However, this can be compensated for if the amount of backlash is precisely known by linear encoders or manual measurement.|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the problem of cutting {{conditions}} effect on a formation of surface layers, which influences the attributes of the final component surface. The effect of cutting the tension in surface layers examination was carried out. The observation of the surface layer tensions in the component machined by sharp and <b>dull</b> <b>cutting</b> edge was compared. The steel ČSN 41 1500 (E 295) was chosen as the tested material. After cutting the components were exposed to the corrosive medium and subsequently their resistance to corrosion was mutually compared. On the basis of this observation was raised a conclusion that the components machined by <b>dull</b> <b>cutting</b> edge show a lower corrosive resistance than the components machined by sharp cutting edge. This fact corresponds with the statement that the measurement of the surface layers tension in these components was provided pa­rallel to the technical literature without reference to the corrosion damage...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a new method {{to evaluate the}} geometry of <b>dull</b> <b>cutting</b> tools in order to verify the necessity of tool re-sharpening and to decrease the tool grinding machine setup time, based on a laser scanning approach. The developed method consists {{of the definition of}} a system architecture and the programming of all the algorithms needed to analyze the data and provide, as output, the cutting angles of the worn tool. These angles are usually difficult to be measured and are needed to set up the grinding machine. The main challenges that have been dealt with in this application are related to the treatment of data acquired by the system’s cameras, which must be specific for the milling tools, usually characterized by the presence of undercuts and sharp edges. Starting from the architecture of the system, an industrial product has been designed, with the support of a grinding machine manufacturer. The basic idea has been to develop a low-cost system that could be integrated on a tool sharpening machine and interfaced with its numeric control. The article reports the developed algorithms and an example of application...|$|E
40|$|Inorganic {{materials}} and acidity {{in the wood}} has been proved to affect the wood properties. The previous paper in this series reported on the {{physical and chemical properties}} of teak wood from community forests. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the content of inorganic {{materials and}} acidity of teak wood grown in the 3 sites (Panggang, Playen, Nglipar) with different ecological attributes from community forests in Gunungkidul. The evaluated parameters were pH values, the contents of ash (ASTM D- 1102), silica and silicates (SNI 14 - 1031 - 1989), and inorganic matters (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe, Mn, and Cu) by means of Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The ranges of ash and silica-silicates content were 0. 38 - 2. 62 %, and 0. 01 - 1. 17 %, respectively. The ranges of inorganic element content for Ca, K, Mg, Na, and Fe were 408 – 2919 ppm; 69 – 23705 ppm; 947 – 1653 ppm; 4 – 31 ppm; and 0 – 326 ppm, respectively whereas Mn and Cu were not detected in any samples. Further, the obtained pH values range was 5. 23 – 6. 98. On the basis of analysis of variance, the contents of ash, silica-silicates, and Na were affected significantly by site and radial direction (sapwood, outer heartwood, and inner heartwood) factors. The woods from Playen (middle zone/Ledok Wonosari) had significantly high in ash and silica-silicate contents. By Kruskal-Wallis test, radial direction factor affected significantly the levels of Ca, K, and Mg. As defined by Pearson’s correlation analysis, it was found a strong correlation between the ash and silica-silicates contents (r= 0. 77 - 0. 88), as well as between the ash-Ca content (r=- 0. 51) and the ash-Mg content (r= 0. 59) in the heartwood part. In the inorganic element levels, the strongest correlation was measured between Ca-Mg content (r=- 0. 46). Special attention should be given to the comparatively high amounts of the silica-silicates content in the observed samples as it would <b>dull</b> <b>cutting</b> tools considerably...|$|E

2500|$|After a {{year and}} a half in Spain, Hunt {{returned}} to his assignment at DODS. Following a brief tenure on the Special Activities Staff of the Western European Division, he became Chief of Covert Action for the region (while remaining based in the Washington metropolitan area) in July 1968. Although he was lauded for his [...] "sagacity, balance and imagination" [...] and received the second-highest rating of Strong (signifying [...] "performance... characterized by exceptional proficiency") in a performance review from the Division's Chief of Operations in April 1969, this was downgraded to the third-highest rating of Adequate in an amendment from the Division's Deputy Chief, who recognized Hunt's [...] "broad experience" [...] but opined that [...] "a series of personal and taxing problems" [...] had [...] "tended to <b>dull</b> his <b>cutting</b> edge."

40|$|AbstractThe {{state of}} {{a cutting tool}} is a {{critical}} factor in any metal <b>cutting</b> process because <b>dull</b> or damaged <b>cutting</b> tool reduces surface quality and dimensional accuracy of workpiece and damages the machine tool. This paper proposes a novel vision-based approach for determining tool wear in metal cutting. The surface irregularity changes caused by tool wear are used as a criterion for estimating the cutting tool wear. Undecimated Wavelet Transform is used to decompose the surface image of the workpiece into sub-images in which the cutting tool wear can be indicated. The texture of sub-images is analyzed using GLCM texture features. The experimental results showed that the combination of undecimated wavelet decomposition and GLCM texture features {{can be used as a}} robust method for determining tool wear in the turning process...|$|R
40|$|Diamond disks are {{indispensable}} for dressing CMP pads. However, {{due to the}} poor leveling of diamond tips, only a few percents of diamond grits can penetrate the pad. As these few crystals are worn out, the plastic deformation of the pad becomes large relative {{to the amount of}} pad is cut. The polishing rate will then decline; and the scratch rate, increase. A novel technique has been developed to identify the cutting tips and their <b>dulling</b> process. The <b>cutting</b> paths become widen and shallow with more and more deformed pad material. Eventually, fewer and fewer scratch lines are present with most touching diamond pushing deformed pad around. Because there are only a handful of diamond grits that are engaged in cutting pad, the number of working crystals can increased substantially by improving the leveling of diamond tips. This improvement can increase the longevity of diamond disks that paves the way for future CMP of 18 inches wafers scheduled to make the debut in 2012...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} in the micro-route grinding of ceramics with electroplated diamond quill: fracture of quill, elastic deformation of quill, <b>dulling</b> of the <b>cutting</b> grain edges, large roughness of the cut-off surface and so on. These all come from the thinness of the quill. For the purpose of solving these problems, cutoff experiments were carried out under two kinds of grinding conditions. One was under oscillating workpiece in the spinde axis direction {{and the other was}} under swinging the spindle in its axis direction. The experimental results are summarized as follows. (1) Under no oscillation of workpiece, the grinding force doesn't decrease with the reduction of the tabl speed. (2) When oscillating workpiece, the grinding force becomes remarkably small with the increase of workpiece frequency if the table speed is small. (3) However, the effect of workpiece oscillation becomes small when the table speed is high. (4) The roughness of cut-off surface is improved by increasing the workpiece frequency. (5) When swinging the spindle at low frequency and in large amplitude, the roughness of cut-off surface in the table feed direction becomes large because of the cyclic changing of the tool deformation...|$|R
40|$|Cordia alliodora is {{a fast-growing}} tree with a {{high-quality}} wood. The species is widely distributed in continental tropical America from central Mexico to northern Argentina, a range in latitude of some 50 ° from approximately 25 °N to 25 °S. There {{is also a}} wide occurrence among the Caribbean islands. Not only does the tree produce high-quality timber but the persistent, tall, straight stem, self-pruning habit and compact crown make it suitable for growing in combination with many agricultural crops. This, combined with {{the ease with which}} the species regenerates naturally on cleared sites, has led to its incorporation in numerous agroforestry systems throughout its natural range. C. alliodora can also readily be regenerated artificially by using either seedlings or stumps. Good growth as a plantation species has been achieved in the neotropics, trials in Africa have been promising and it is the basis ofa plantation programme in Vanuatu. On suitable sites dimensions of 30 - 35 m height and 40 - 55 cm diameter breast height are predicted for rotations of 20 - 25 years. However, the choice of provenance is important. Provenance variation over the whole of the species' natural range has not been assessed but substantial data are available for Central America. These show that, in exotic environments, provenances from the seasonally-dry Pacific watershed develop more rapidly at the seedling stage than do provenances from the more humid Atlantic watershed, but within two years of planting in the field this ranking is reversed. The Atlantic group then shows superior growth rates up to 10 years, the greatest age for which information is available. Evidence from plantations exposed to hurricanes and cyclones indicates that C. alliodora probably has above average resistance to stembreak and windthrow, compared with other plantation species, especially during the early years. In the species' natural range, stem canker caused by the rust fungus Puccinia cordiae is economically damaging on some sites. Other pests and diseases have been recorded as problematical locally but not sufficiently to detract from the tree's widespread popularity. Outside its natural range C. alliodora appears to have few serious pests and diseases but mortalities due to a root disease attributed to the fungus Phellinus noxius have given rise to concern in Vanuatu. The timber seasons easily with little degrade. It is dimensionally stable when dry, moderately durable compared with other tropical hardwoods when exposed to fungus attack, and resistance to termites is good. The wood works easily with little <b>dulling</b> of <b>cutting</b> edges to give a very smooth finish. Polishing and staining characteristics are satisfactory. The decorative heartwood has somewhat similar mechanical properties to Swietenia macrophylla. These characteristics have resulted in the timber being widely used in the countries where the species occurs naturally. The wood is popular for light construction, as well as for furniture- and cabinetmaking. It is also used for veneer manufacture, turnery and a wide variety of carvings. As many of the properties of C. alliodora wood {{are similar to those of}} S. macrophylla, it might be an acceptable substitute in uses such as boat planking and other boat parts. The resistance to decay indicates a possible role as an alternative timber to several species of cedar in situations requiring durability. An investigation of plantation grown samples from Vanuatu concluded that although the wood is not strong for construction purposes, the combination of stability and durability make it suitable for both indoor and outdoor work. The appearance suggests a use in furniture construction and panelling, and it should be acceptable for flooring where there is light traffic. </p...|$|R
