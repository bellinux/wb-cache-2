50|$|Fitted at {{the ends}} of the vehicle frames, one at each corner, the buffers are projecting, {{shock-absorbing}} pads which, when vehicles are coupled, are brought into contact with those on the next vehicle. The <b>draw</b> <b>chain</b> used between each pair of vehicles includes a screw which is tightened after coupling to shorten the chain and keep the buffers pressed together. Such is known as a 'screw coupling'. Historically, coupling chains were no more than that, a short length of heavy chain (typically three links long) with no adjustment. These would result in a 'loose-coupled train' in which the buffers of adjacent vehicles would only touch when the coupling chain was fully slack, such as when being pushed or going down hill.|$|R

40|$|Company- was {{completing}} a massive remodeling campaign in 250 of its Chicago-area stores. The new "super food stores " carried produce, delicatessen meats, fresh fish, and refrigerated meat, all {{in addition to}} the typical stock of dry groceries. The presentation of foods was at least as impressive as the range of foods. Customers in these stores found "sparkling " chrome casing on new refrigerated cases and illuminated shelving in the produce department. "Truly," National Tea's director proclaimed, this was "a housewife's paradise" [Rassmussen, 1932, p. 644]. In the midst of rampant unemployment and relentless deflation, at a time when city officials worried that public riots would undermine any semblance of order, the NationalTea Company invested in highend, large stores. That seemingly counter-intuitive move cannot be explained simply by economies of scale or internal efficiencies.

40|$|YesHighly-oriented poly (lactic acid) (PLA) with bionic fibrillar {{structure}} and micro-grooves was fabricated through solid hot drawing technology for further improving the mechanical properties and blood biocompatibility of PLA as blood-contacting medical devices. In order {{to enhance the}} melt strength and thus obtain high orientation degree, PLA was first chain branched with pentaerythritol polyglycidyl ether (PGE). The branching degree as high as 12. 69 mol% can be obtained at 0. 5 wt% PGE content. The complex viscosity, elastic and viscous modulus for chain branched PLA were improved resulting from the enhancement of molecular entanglement, and consequently higher draw ratio can be achieved during the subsequent hot stretching. The stress-induced crystallization of PLA occurred during stretching, and the crystal structure of the oriented PLA {{can be attributed to}} the α′ crystalline form. The tensile strength and modulus of PLA were improved dramatically by <b>drawing.</b> <b>Chain</b> branching and orientation could significantly enhance the blood compatibility of PLA by prolonging clotting time and decreasing hemolysis ratio, protein adsorption and platelet activation. Fibrous structure as well as micro-grooves can be observed for the oriented PLA which were similar to intimal layer of blood vessel, and this bionic structure was considered to be beneficial to decrease the activation and/or adhesion of platelets.

40|$|European {{agricultural}} policy has undergone profound changes {{during the past}} decade. The nucleus of this reform has been {{the transformation of the}} agricultural and food policy from a producer centred perspective of agriculture to a more market and consumer oriented food chain approach. Such a systemic perspective calls for a stronger and systematic integration of the more demand-oriented policy fields of food, consumer and public health policy as well as of elements of politics of sustainable development along the whole food chain. The paper analyzes the reasons and consequences of these developments, and calls for an integrated â€œfood chain politicsâ€ approach.

40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} the problem of estimating {{the parameters of the}} Fréchet distribution from both frequentist and Bayesian points of view. First we briefly describe different frequentist approaches, namely, maximum likelihood, method of moments, percentile estimators, L-moments, ordinary and weighted least squares, maximum product of spacings, maximum goodness-of-fit estimators and compare them with respect to mean relative estimates, mean squared errors and the 95 % coverage probability of the asymptotic confidence intervals using extensive numerical simulations. Next, {{we consider}} the Bayesian inference approach using reference priors.
