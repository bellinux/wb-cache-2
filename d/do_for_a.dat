Morricone's score is considered {{as an example of}} an absolute pinnacle of what music can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> film, and what a soundtrack album can do to enrich the listener's life. At one point the score was one of the world's best-selling film scores, selling over 3 million copies worldwide.|$|E

Already proficient in Latin and Greek, he studied Hebrew and Arabic in Padua with Elia del Medigo, a Jewish Averroist, and read Aramaic manuscripts with him as well. Del Medigo also translated Judaic manuscripts from Hebrew into Latin for Pico, as {{he would continue to}} <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of years. Pico also wrote sonnets in Latin and Italian which, because of the influence of Savonarola, he destroyed {{at the end of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|Columbia University Professor John McWhorter {{has pointed}} out that Shakespeare’s {{language}} is no longer entirely ours. Granted, he says, with the help of notes and time to study them, you can work out the sense of some of the obscure dialogue, but not in a theatre {{in a matter of seconds}} while the action speeds by and the actors deliver the lines with all the urgency of the moment then move on. Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions that will <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.|$|E

25|$|On September 21, 1849, the Oregon Baptist Educational Society {{was started}} {{in what was then}} the Oregon Territory. On September 27, 1849, a meeting of the group was held and they decided to build a school on the east bank of the Willamette River, {{approximately}} eight miles north of its confluence with the Calapooia River, and established a board of trustees. The Rev. Ezra Fisher was asked to start the school, but {{when he went to the}} planned site it was not available, and instead he started to teach school inside the Oregon City Baptist Church while leaders contemplated what to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> permanent site. Meanwhile, the Rev. Richmond Cheadle was tasked with raising $2,000 to pay for construction of a school building.|$|E
25|$|Innovia Metro {{lines are}} {{designed}} to run on elevated structures, and indeed the systems that use these trains include such sections, with most being predominantly elevated. Using a grade-separated guideway, though, allows them to perform equally well on ground level and in tunnels, as they in fact <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> portion of both Vancouver's Expo and Millennium Lines (using a converted freight tunnel for the Expo line, and a bored tunnel under Clarke Road for the Evergreen Extension), Kuala Lumpur's Kelana Jaya Line, and Beijing's Airport Express. (The Scarborough RT in Toronto also includes a short tunneled section, though there are no stations within it.) The latter two systems, along with New York's Airtrain JFK, also incorporate platform screen doors commonly found in automated people movers around the world.|$|E
25|$|Faced with {{a dilemma}} {{of what to}} <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rhythm section, Mulligan decided to build on earlier {{experiments}} and perform as a pianoless quartet with Baker on trumpet, Bob Whitlock on bass and Chico Hamilton on drums (later Mulligan himself would occasionally double on piano). These early live dates were recorded by Dick Bock on a portable reel-to-reel tape deck. Bock along with Roy Harte would soon after, start the Pacific Jazz label and release Mulligan's records. Mulligan's first recording sessions in Los Angeles were produced by Bock for Pacific Jazz. These three informal sessions took place in June, July, and August 1952 at the Hollywood Hills cottage of recording engineer Phil Turetsky. At these sessions, Mulligan, Chet Baker, and others recorded the material that was released as Pacific Jazz PJ LP-1 and later on PJ-8.|$|E

25|$|As for the ultra-orthodox Cubists such as M. Gleizes, {{they are}} {{becoming}} very tiresome. Someone who knows M. Eugène Figuière assured me that he saw a strong resemblance in M. Gleizes's portrait of that eminent publisher, who must, in that case, be made of gun-metal or some similar substance. It may be my stupidity, but I cannot understand what {{this sort of thing}} means or what the artist is driving at. There are a few other paintings which may, presumably, be called Cubist in default of any better name, which are merely patterns in bright colours, such as M. Picabia's and M. Metzinger's. One of M. Metzinger's pictures is a puzzle made up of a leg, an arm, a hat, a parasol, and various other objects, and is called En Canot. These patterns have certain decorative qualities and might <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> carpet or a hanging, but they are absurd in frames, and it is a mere affectation to give them titles.|$|E

Wilson writes that Christian Science healing is [...] "not curative... on its own premises, but rather preventative of ill health, accident and misfortune, since it claims {{to lead to a}} state of consciousness where these things do not exist. What heals is the realization that there is nothing really to heal." [...] It is a closed system of thought, viewed as infallible if performed correctly; healing confirms the power of Truth, but its absence derives from the failure, specifically the bad thoughts, of individuals.|$|E
