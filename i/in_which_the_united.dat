5|$|Solo is {{regarded}} as one of the top female goalkeepers in the world and currently holds the U.S. record for most career clean sheets. She was the starting goalkeeper for the majority of the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup and helped lead the U.S. national team to the semifinals having given up only two goals in four games, including three consecutive shutouts. After a controversial move made by head coach Greg Ryan to bench Solo in favor of veteran goalkeeper Briana Scurry for the semifinal, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States was defeated 4–0 by Brazil, Solo made headlines with post-game remarks that resulted in many teammates shunning her.

40|$|Despite {{a longstanding}} and varied body of {{literature}} on suburban difference, a simplified narrative of the suburbs persists that is represented by a city–suburb binary.

This article looks at the reasons for the persistence of a city–suburb binary. It engages with suburban housing as a Bourdieuian field in order to show how simplified characterisations of the suburban serve the interest of particular groups, including within planning. Bourdieu’s field theory offers a powerful means to understand how judgements of the suburbs are naturalised and so become common-sense truths. As field theory indicates ‘within-planning’ power relations that support particular truths, it offers the possibility of challenging these by exposing the taken-for-granted norms of the city-suburb binary...|$|R
