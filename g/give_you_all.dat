25|$|When Beresford {{departed}} {{as commander}} of the channel fleet he commented, I 'heartily <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> the credit you so richly deserve for making Caesar the most brilliantly smart ship on the water', and 'you are certain of a most brilliant career in the service and are sure {{to become one of}} Britain's most efficient admirals'. Evan-Thomas was now also in a position to himself assist other officers up the career ladder, and received formal thanks from Commander Michael Culme-Seymour, son of his previous commander, for help in obtaining promotion. A note from Lord Knollys to Beresford commended Evan-Thomas for good results in gunnery trials.|$|E
25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E

500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] {{has been}} noted as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. Louis Virtel from NewNowNext listed the song at number 94 on their Top 100 Madonna Songs list, stating, [...] "Copping both new-age maxims and Beatle sentiments ('Everything I <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> comes back to me'), 'Nothing Really Matters' is as queer and curious as a red patent-leather geisha costume." [...] The Gaultier kimono has been cited by several {{publications}} as one of Madonna's most notable re-inventions and looks, including fashion magazines like InStyle, Elle and Harper's Bazaar. Alongside this, the kimono has been {{recognized as one of}} the Grammy's best and worst looks.|$|E
500|$|K. M. Munshi had {{a totally}} {{different}} take on the myth in his Krishnavatara series. Though Putana came with evil intentions, she is portrayed as being happy to see Krishna and her maternal instinct rises, telling her [...] "Take this lovely boy to your breast. You are a wicked and miserable woman. You have never seen joy before, joy which thrills your whole body and mind with mad delight." [...] Overjoyed and forgetful of her poisoned breasts, she took Krishna {{in her lap and}} suckled him. In the process, she surrenders to Krishna saying [...] "I <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>all,</b> my beloved child... I am yours." [...] Further, Putana is purified and liberated from her mortal body by Krishna.|$|E

500|$|The company's online {{advertising}} program in Spain described the BK XXL line as being made [...] "with two enormous portions of flame-broiled meat that will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> the energy {{you need to}} take the world by storm." [...] This claim combined with the television advertising were the prime motivators behind the Spanish government's concerns with the XXL sandwich line. The government claimed that campaign violated an agreement with the government to comply with an initiative on curbing obesity by promoting such a large and unhealthy sandwich. In response to the government's claims, Burger King replied in a statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all." [...] The company {{went on to say that}} it offers other healthier items such as salads and that customers are free to choose their own foods and modify them as they desire.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons. West rhymes about [...] "swag sauce" [...] and [...] "swagu" [...] in the introductory lines, [...] "You a bad girl, your friends bad too / You got the swag sauce, you're drippin' Swagu", before passing the torch to Beyoncé, who begins to sing the first verse slowly and steadily, [...] "I may be young but I'm ready / To <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> my love / I told my girls {{you can get it}} / Don't slow it down, just let it go / So in love / I'll give it all away / Just don't tell nobody tomorrow". In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E

2500|$|To {{time the}} drop, Norden used an idea already in use on other bombsights, the [...] "equal distance" [...] concept. This {{was based on}} the {{observation}} that the time needed to travel a certain distance over the ground would remain relatively constant during the bomb run, as the wind would not be expected to change dramatically over a short period of time. If you could accurately mark out a distance on the ground, or in practice, an angle in the sky, timing the passage over that distance would <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> the information needed to time the drop.|$|E

Club, {{described}} the album as a [...] "slick throwback to melodramatic ’80s and ’90s pop." [...] The album's tracks include EDM, hip hop tunes and piano-driven ballads. The album opens with [...] "Intro", in which Grande addresses her fans: [...] "I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> I have and nothing less, I promise". The second track {{is the lead}} single [...] "Problem", an uptempo dance-pop song influenced by R, jazz, hip hop and funk. Rap-Up described the track as an [...] "infectious horn-heavy jam" [...] that features a [...] "carefree" [...] Grande [...] "declaring her independence". It includes [...] "an empowering verse from Iggy Azalea and a whispering Big Sean on the hook." [...] "One Last Time" [...] is a dance-pop and EDM-light song. The album continues with [...] "Why Try", co-written and co-produced by Ryan Tedder and Benny Blanco and features the lyrics [...] "Now we're screaming just to see who's louder".

2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> the money I have and my own house, but please let us go." [...] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E
