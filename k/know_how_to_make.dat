5|$|Shortly afterwards, a {{group of}} monkeys kidnap Mowgli and take him to their leader, King Louie the orangutan. King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire like other humans. However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli does not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fire. Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the ensuing chaos, King Louie's palace is {{demolished}} to rubble. Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli so long as Shere Khan is there. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village {{is best for the}} boy, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol. However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.|$|E

[...] Traub concludes that [...] "Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the British Hurricane {{device was}} more {{advanced}} than the American Fat Man bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology, and while British and Soviet advances had taken much of the heat out of American opposition to renewed cooperation with the British, the United States Congress saw little benefit {{in it for the}} United States. The McMahon Act was amended by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations, on 30 August 1954, but it fell far short of what the British government wanted. Churchill, who had replaced Attlee as prime minister, turned to Lord Cherwell for advice on the prospect of producing a British hydrogen bomb. Cherwell reported that [...] "We think we <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an H-bomb", but Penney did not agree with this sanguine assessment.|$|E
500|$|The Director Task Force was {{concentrated}} at Goodenough Island {{in early}} December 1943. The 112thCavalry was notified {{that it had}} been selected for the Arawe operation on 24November, and departed Woodlark for the short voyage to Goodenough Island in two convoys that sailed on 30 and 31November. All elements of the regiment were ashore at Goodenough by 2December. A full-scale rehearsal of the landing was held at the island on 8December; this revealed problems with coordinating the waves of boats and demonstrated that some of the force's officers were insufficiently trained in amphibious warfare. There was insufficient time for further training to rectify these problems, however. At Goodenough, the troopers of the 112thCavalry were issued with several types of infantry weapons with which they had not previously been equipped. Each of the regiment's rifle squads received a Browning Automatic rifle and a Thompson submachine gun, and a number of [...] bazookas, rifle grenades and flame throwers were also issued. The cavalrymen received little training on the use of these weapons however, and did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the best use of them in combat.|$|E

500|$|Her second collection, The Rosary (or Beads – Chetki) {{appeared}} in March 1914 and firmly established her {{as one of}} the most popular and sought after poets of the day. Thousands of women composed poems [...] "in honour of Akhmatova", mimicking her style and prompting Akhmatova to exclaim: [...] "I taught our women how to speak, but don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them silent". Her aristocratic manners and artistic integrity won her the titles [...] "Queen of the Neva" [...] and [...] "Soul of the Silver Age," [...] as the period came to be known in the history of Russian poetry. [...] In Poem Without a Hero, the longest and one of the best known of her works, written many decades later, she would recall this as a blessed time of her life. [...] She became close friends with Boris Pasternak (who, though married, proposed to her many times) [...] and rumours began to circulate that she was having an affair with influential lyrical poet Alexander Blok. In July 1914, Akhmatova wrote “Frightening times are approaching/ Soon fresh graves will cover the land"; [...] on August 1, Germany declared war on Russia, marking the start of [...] "the dark storm" [...] of world war, civil war, revolution and totalitarian repression for Russia. The Silver Age came to a close.|$|E
500|$|Following the battle, the {{commander}} of the Numidian cavalry, Maharbal, urged Hannibal to seize the opportunity and march immediately on Rome. It is told that the latter's refusal caused Maharbal's exclamation: [...] "Of a truth the gods have not bestowed all things upon the same person. You know how to conquer, Hannibal; but you do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of your victory." [...] Hannibal had good reasons to judge the strategic situation after the battle differently from Maharbal. As the historian Hans Delbrück pointed out, due to the high numbers of killed and wounded among its ranks, the Punic army was not in a condition to perform a direct assault on Rome. It would have been a fruitless demonstration that would have nullified the psychological effect of Cannae on the Roman allies. Even if his army was at full strength, a successful siege of Rome would have required Hannibal to subdue a considerable part of the hinterland to cut the enemy's supplies and secure his own. Even after the tremendous losses suffered at Cannae and the defection of a number of her allies, Rome still had abundant manpower to prevent this and maintain considerable forces in Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and elsewhere despite Hannibal's presence in Italy. Hannibal's conduct after the victories at Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae, {{and the fact that he}} first attacked Rome only five years later, in 211 BC, suggests that his strategic aim was not the destruction of his foe but to dishearten the Romans by carnage on the battlefield and to wear them down to a moderate peace agreement by stripping them of their allies.|$|E
500|$|Before any {{director}} {{was attached to}} Hard Target, Universal Pictures saw the film as a potential vehicle for actor Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van Damme had already been {{a huge fan of}} Woo's films and arranged to meet with him in Hong Kong where the two got along despite both Woo and Van Damme's difficulty with their English. Woo originally wanted actor Kurt Russell for the lead role, but found Russell to be booked for two years with other film projects. On working with Van Damme, Woo stated that he was [...] "sure of [...] abilities and I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an actor look good on screen, make him look like a hero. I thought I could do the same for Van Damme". Despite early misgivings of working with Van Damme, Woo changed many action scenes in the film to make them more spectacular on finding that Van Damme was up for it. While working with Van Damme, Woo stated that Van Damme had [...] "a pretty big ego, but he's still professional and always tries to do a good job." [...] Woo had some control over the film's casting including casting minor characters and finding a cinematographer. Actress Yancy Butler was cast as Natasha Binder in her feature film debut. The role led Butler to other starring roles in action films such as Drop Zone [...] and Fast Money. Actor Lance Henriksen accepted the role of Emil Fouchon stating he was a great fan of Woo, noting that his earlier films [...] "were so creative, so balletic, and had this incredible philosophy in them. The violence was only a container for the philosophy".|$|E

500|$|There was {{a strong}} and varied {{reaction}} to the episode by reviewers. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone described it as [...] "an emotional rollercoaster that at times may have been jarring or heavy-handed, but overall did what a winter finale should: gave us plenty of surprises, while setting things up for the future". IGN's Robert Canning was [...] "won over by a powerfully acted and directed story" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8.0 out of 10; he noted that [...] "as is often the case, the smaller stories involving Karofsky and Quinn were more successful than larger arcs like Rachel and Finn's". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said that rather than [...] "a million different storylines" [...] {{there were a few}} [...] "really good ones" [...] and added, [...] "It was chaos, but controlled chaos." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "The sequence in which Karofsky prepared himself for death was, unquestionably, {{one of the best things}} Glee has ever done." [...] He added that it was [...] "all the more a shame" [...] that it occurred in an episode that did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> effective use of [...] "the impact of that moment", and he gave the episode as a whole a [...] "D" [...] grade. In a similar vein, James Poniewozik of Time said, [...] "the beginning of the episode was a very effective 15 minutes or so of television", but said that was also the episode's problem. Michael Slezak of TVLine noted that the show's [...] "audacity" [...] allowed it [...] "to tackle some of the most important issues of the day with a headiness and honesty that aren’t merely refreshing, but absolutely necessary", and added, [...] "If I’ve got any complaint with the episode, it would have to be that for a show that’s billed as a musical comedy, there certainly weren’t many laughs, and the musical interludes seemed like something of an afterthought". In a similar vein, Billboard Rae Votta wrote, [...] "Any thoughts that Glee is, in fact, a comedy should be soundly crushed by now. It's a fantastical reality, and sometimes you laugh at that, but other times you cry." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{collapse}} of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying [...] "that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> hardware. They don’t <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> software either. Why would we want to do this?". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the [...] "Play Station", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.|$|E
