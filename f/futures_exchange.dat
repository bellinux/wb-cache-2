5000|$|In {{the first}} few years after the {{introduction}} of commodity markets, new exchanges opened with wild abandon, and speculative volume ballooned. Soon a directive titled The Notice of Firmly Curbing the Blind Development of the Futures Market was launched. In October 1994, the State Council rectified over 50 <b>futures</b> <b>exchanges</b> down to 15 <b>futures</b> <b>exchanges,</b> delisted 20 <b>futures</b> contracts (leaving 35), began issuing licenses to futures commission merchants for the first time while lopping their number by over 70%, restricted trading on foreign <b>futures</b> <b>exchanges,</b> introduced new rules and regulations, and shifted the control of the exchanges from local governments to regulatory authorities. DCE's market share then ranked No. 9 in China with Dry kelp as a pilot product. DCE traded soybeans and corn back then. [...] Continued abuse in the market brought forth the Second Rectification in 1998, most of the surviving 15 <b>futures</b> <b>exchanges</b> were restructured, and subsequently closed. Three national level <b>future</b> <b>exchanges</b> emerged: Shanghai Metal Exchange, Dalian Commodity Exchange, Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. The number of futures contracts was cut back further to 12 from 35, and more brokers were closed, leaving just 175 standing from the early 1990s peak of 1,000. Margins were standardized and regulations further toughened. Trading on foreign <b>futures</b> <b>exchanges</b> was further restricted to a small number of large, global entities. Soybeans, soy meal and beer barley were traded at DCE.|$|R

First, {{the environment of}} commodity <b>futures</b> <b>exchanges</b> is examined. Second, the threats and opportunities of commodity <b>futures</b> <b>exchanges</b> are analysed. Our analysis demonstrates that market orientation is {{an important element in}} the market strategies of commodity <b>futures</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Our market strategic framework is applied to the Dutch hog futures market. It is concluded that market penetration is an appropriate strategy. Consequently, to identify the variables that distinguish between farmers who initiate futures positions and farmers who do not, we conducted a discriminant analysis on data gathered from 418 Dutch hog farmers. The discriminant analysis shows that latent variables, such as farmers' perceived performance, farmers' reference price and farmers' market orientation, are important discriminating variables. Furthermore, farmers' cash market behaviour (in terms of the frequency of selling in the spot market) is an important discriminating variable as well. The usefulness of these results as input for a penetration policy is demonstrated...|$|R

5000|$|In practice, <b>futures</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{are usually}} {{commodity}} exchanges, i.e., all derivatives, including financial derivatives, are usually traded at commodity exchanges.

25|$|Although futures {{contracts}} are oriented towards a future time point, their main {{purpose is to}} mitigate risk of default by either party in the intervening period. In this vein, the <b>futures</b> <b>exchange</b> requires both parties to put up initial cash, or a performance bond, known as the margin. Margins, sometimes set {{as a percentage of}} the value of the futures contract, must be maintained throughout the life of the contract to guarantee the agreement, as over this time the price of the contract can vary as a function of supply and demand, causing one side of the exchange to lose money at the expense of the other.|$|E
