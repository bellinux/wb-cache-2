5|$|The main {{treatment}} for obesity consists of <b>dieting</b> and physical exercise. Diet programs may produce weight loss over the short term, but maintaining this weight loss is frequently difficult and often requires making exercise {{and a lower}} food energy diet a permanent part of a person's lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors affect whether <b>dieting</b> will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, younger women are likely to {{experience}} menstrual irregularities due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, anovulatory cycles can occur {{as a result of}} adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise. Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E
5|$|In early 1987 Djajakusuma's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} heart disease, which led Djajakusuma to begin <b>dieting</b> and stop smoking. He {{continued to be}} highly respected in Indonesian film circles, but was displeased with {{the condition of the}} country's film industry, which he considered {{to be on the verge}} of collapse. This he blamed on American cultural imperialism, which meant that most cinemas preferred screening foreign films, especially those from Hollywood, and that Indonesian youth were no longer creating a uniquely Indonesia identity.|$|E

40|$|The {{digestibility}} and utilisation of two fresh {{soybean milk}} concentrate based <b>diets,</b> two stale soybean milk concentrate based <b>diets</b> and two Fishman based <b>diets</b> serving as control, at optimal (30 %) and suboptimal (20 %) protein levels were evaluated in Oreochromis niloticus. The <b>diets</b> were as follows: <b>Diet</b> I (control) - fishmeal based <b>diet</b> at 30 % crude protein, <b>Diet</b> II (control) Fishman based <b>diet</b> at 20 % crude protein, <b>Diet</b> III - fresh soybean milk concentrate based <b>diet</b> at 30 % crude protein, <b>Diet</b> IV - fresh soybean milk concentrate based <b>diet</b> at 20 %, <b>Diet</b> V - stale soybean milk concentrate based <b>diet</b> at 30 % crude protein, <b>Diet</b> VI-stale soybean milk concentrate based <b>diet</b> at 20 %. Dry matter digestibility differed not significantly with variation in <b>diets</b> (P: 0. 05). A significant variation {{was recorded in}} the protein, lipid and ash digestibility. Proteins were more digestible at optimum than suboptimum level. Ash digestibility was lowest of all the nutrients. Variations in the utilisation of the <b>diets</b> in terms of weight gain, specific growth rate, food conversion ration, protein efficiency ration and apparent net protein utilization were insignificant (P: 0. 05). All <b>diets</b> compared favourably with the standard control <b>diet</b> <b>Diet</b> I.

40|$|A high {{cholesterol}} <b>diet</b> induces dyslipidemia. This study investigated whether isoflavone aglycones in lactic acid-fermented soy milk (LFS) improve lipid metabolism in rats fed a {{high cholesterol}} <b>diet.</b> Male Sprague-Dawley rats aged seven weeks were fed an AIN- 93 G <b>diet,</b> a 1 % cholesterol <b>diet</b> (a high cholesterol <b>diet),</b> a high-cholesterol <b>diet</b> containing 4 % isoflavone extract of LFS (LFS extract <b>diet),</b> a high-cholesterol <b>diet</b> containing 19. 4 % ethanol-washed LFS (ethanol-washed LFS <b>diet,</b> isoflavone-poor <b>diet),</b> or a high cholesterol <b>diet</b> containing 23. 2 % intact LFS (intact LFS <b>diet)</b> for five weeks. The plasma total cholesterol (TC) level was {{increased in the}} rats fed the LFS extract <b>diet</b> compared with those fed the high cholesterol <b>diet.</b> The TC level was decreased by the intact LFS and ethanol-washed LFS <b>diets.</b> The cholesterol-lowering effect was stronger in the rats fed the intact LFS <b>diet</b> than those fed the ethanol-washed LFS <b>diet.</b> The plasma triglyceride (TG) level was unchanged in the rats fed the LFS extract <b>diet,</b> but it decreased in rats fed the intact LFS and ethanol-washed LFS <b>diets.</b> Although, compared with the high cholesterol <b>diet,</b> the LFS extract and ethanol-washed LFS <b>diets</b> did not reduce hepatic cholesterol and TG, both levels were remarkably lowered by the intact LFS <b>diet.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} improvement in lipid metabolism of rats fed a high-cholesterol <b>diet</b> containing LFS isoflavone aglycones is not due to an independent effect but due to a cooperative effect with soy protein...|$|R

40|$|The {{digestibility}} and utilisation of two soybean bran-based <b>diets</b> and two fishmeal-based <b>diets</b> {{serving as}} control, at optimal (30 %) and suboptimal (20 %) protein levels were evaluated in Oreochromis niloticus. These were <b>Diet</b> I (Control) -fishmeal based <b>diet</b> at 30 % crude protein, <b>Diet</b> II (Control) - fishmeal based <b>diet</b> at 20 % crude protein, <b>Diet</b> III - hydrolysed Soybean Bran based <b>diet</b> at 30 % crude protein, <b>Diet</b> IV - hydrolysed Soybean Bran based <b>diet</b> at 20 %. Dry matter digestibility differed insignificantly with variation in <b>diets</b> (P< 0. 05). There was significant {{variation in the}} protein (p 20. 05), lipid and ash digestibility. Protein was more digestible at optimum level than sub-optimum level, while lipid and ash digestibility did not vary with their inclusion levels.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of different levels of germinated barley (GB) on live performance and carcass traits in broiler chickens. The experiment lasted for 5 weeks starting from 7 days of age and ending at 42 days of age. Chicks (Ross 308) were fed six dietary treatments including a corn–soy <b>diet</b> (corn <b>diet),</b> a barley–soy <b>diet</b> (barley <b>diet),</b> a barley <b>diet</b> plus enzymes (enzyme barley <b>diet),</b> and 3 other <b>diets</b> in which GB was replaced with barley at levels of 33 %, 66 %, and 100 % in the barley <b>diet</b> (33 % GB <b>diet,</b> 66 % GB <b>diet,</b> and GB <b>diet,</b> respectively). Data were analyzed in a completely randomized design. Results indicated that birds fed a barley <b>diet</b> had significantly lower performance than those fed other <b>diets</b> (P). Supplementing of the barley <b>diet</b> with β-glucanase enzyme as well as replacing GB with barley improved the performance of broilers. Birds fed a GB <b>diet</b> had a significantly higher carcass yield those fed other <b>diets</b> (P). The lowest abdominal fat percentage was observed in birds fed a barley <b>diet</b> or a corn <b>diet.</b> Thus, it is concluded that replacing GB with barley, especially at 33 % level, {{is more effective than}} supplementing barley <b>diets</b> with β-glucanase enzyme in improving live performance of broiler chickens...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{replacement}} of ricebran by mushroom stalk (Pleurotus florida), an agriculture waste on growth performance of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) fingerlings was investigated for 42 days. Three isonitrogenous (32 % crude protein) experimental <b>diets</b> containing 100 % (<b>Diet</b> 1), 50 % (<b>Diet</b> 2) and 0 % (<b>Diet</b> 3) mushroom meal were formulated. Each <b>diet</b> was randomly allocated to triplicate groups of fingerlings in experimental tanks, with each tank stocking 12 fishes.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the precipitating {{effects of the}} westernized <b>diet</b> on diabetes mellitus, glucose tolerance and insulin response to oral glucose load (1. 5 g/kg body weight) and insulin sensitivity to exogenous insulin (0. 2 U/kg) were studied in rats fed an experimental <b>diet</b> for 8 weeks. Four experimental <b>diets</b> were used : low fat-no sugar <b>diet</b> (energy ratio of 10 % fat, 70 % starch, {{a model of the}} traditional Japanese <b>diet),</b> high fat-high sugar <b>diet</b> (40 % fat, 20 % starch, 20 % sugar, a model of the westernized <b>diet),</b> low fat-high sugar <b>diet</b> (10 % fat, 50 % starch, 20 % sugar) and high fat-no sugar <b>diet</b> (40 % fat, 40 % starch). In high fat-high sugar <b>diet</b> rats, the body weight increased more, plasma glucose and insulin levels were higher while fasting and after oral glucose load, and insulin sensitivity was lower than in low fat-no sugar <b>diet</b> rats. Similar impaired glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia were present both in low fat-high sugar <b>diet</b> rats and in high fat-no sugar <b>diet</b> rats. However, insulin sensitivity was decreased in low fat-high sugar <b>diet</b> rats, but not in high fat-no sugar <b>diet</b> rats. 　These data indicate that the high fat-high sugar composition of the westernized <b>diet</b> has some precipitating effects on diabetes mellitus and that the diabetogenic mechanisms of the high fat <b>diet</b> and high sugar <b>diet</b> may be different...|$|R
