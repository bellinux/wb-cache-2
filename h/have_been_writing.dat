25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Fabius Fulgentius, who is traditionally thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> in the late fifth and early sixth centuries may have borrowed a line from Corippus’s Iohannis in his Mythologies, which indicates that he was writing after 550. This discovery has called into serious doubt the possibility of identifying the bishop and the mythographer, as Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe is known to have died in 533.|$|E
25|$|Though {{typical of}} epic, his {{vocabulary}} features some significant differences from Homer's. One scholar has counted 278 un-Homeric words in Works and Days, 151 in Theogony and 95 in Shield of Heracles. The {{disproportionate number of}} un-Homeric words in W & D is due to its un-Homeric subject matter. Hesiod's vocabulary also includes {{quite a lot of}} formulaic phrases that are not found in Homer, which indicates that he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> within a different tradition.|$|E
25|$|Though {{some critics}} have argued against the series being shown in this format, {{programme}} makers and commentators defended their decision by saying that Dickens's writings were long, complex, very popular stories told over {{a series of small}} installments, just like a soap-opera and claiming that if he had been alive in 2005 he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> for big signature dramas. Bleak House was indeed originally published in monthly installments, with cliffhangers used to maintain the continuing interest of the readership.|$|E

25|$|In 1635, Năsturel {{published}} a Slavonic ode to the Basarab family, {{included in the}} standardized prayer book, or Molitvenic. These lyrics endure as the first Wallachian example of the genre called blason (la stemă) poetry. According to George Călinescu, {{they are also the}} first known rhymes in Romanian literature, although the part-Wallachian Nicolaus Olahus is known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> Latin poetry before 1510. The first lay poems in Romanian appeared some 40 years after Năsturel's blason, and were composed by a Saxon, Valentin Franck von Franckenstein. Năsturel's piece is also an incidental record for heraldists studying the coat of arms of Wallachia, describing the bird as a raven rather than as a standard golden eagle. This may also indicate his familiarity with legends about Radu Negru as the founder of Wallachia.|$|E
500|$|When asked, in an {{interview}} for Spin that same month, {{about the possibility of}} another A Perfect Circle album, Keenan stated, [...] "Maybe, someday, a song on a soundtrack.

No." [...] A year later, on December 9, 2008, blabbermouth.net reported that Keenan had announced on The Pulse of Radio that he and Howerdel <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> new music for A Perfect Circle. Keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume full-scale touring, or even to write and record a new album. Instead, they will focus on [...] "one or two songs at a time", which will most likely be released via the Internet.|$|E
500|$|The {{language}} featured {{prominently in}} Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy, {{as well as}} in his posthumously published history of Middle-earth The Silmarillion. The longest text in Quenya published by Tolkien during his lifetime is the poem [...] "Namárië", and other published texts are generally no longer than a few sentences. At his death, Tolkien left behind a number of unpublished writings on Quenya, and later Tolkien scholars have prepared his notes and unpublished manuscripts for publication in the journals Parma Eldalamberon and Vinyar Tengwar, also publishing scholarly and linguistic analyses of the language. Tolkien never created enough vocabulary to make it possible to converse in Quenya, although fans <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> poetry and prose in Quenya since the 1970s. This has required conjecture and the need to devise new words, in effect developing a kind of neo-Quenya language.|$|E

500|$|During {{his first}} term at Arnold House Waugh found few {{opportunities}} to continue his writing. He was tired {{by the end of}} the day, his interest in The Temple flagged, and from time to time his attention wandered to other subjects; he contemplated a book on Silenus, but he admitted that it [...] "may or may not ... be written". After the Easter holidays he felt more positively about The Temple: [...] "I am making the first chapter a cinema film, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> furiously ever since. I honestly think that it is going to be rather good". He sometimes worked on the book during classes, telling any boys who dared to ask what he was doing that he was writing a history of the Eskimos. By June he felt confident enough to send the first few chapters to his Oxford friend Harold Acton, [...] "asking for criticism and hoping for praise". Earlier that year Waugh had commented warmly on Acton's book of poems, An Indian Ass, [...] "which brought back memories of a life [...] infinitely remote".|$|E
500|$|From the 1990s onward an {{increasing}} amount {{of literature on}} Canadian comics has appeared, in both official languages. [...] Books such as Guardians of the North (1992) and Invaders from the North (2006) appeared by comics historian John Bell, who became senior archivist at Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa. [...] American magazine Alter Ego ran a special issue on Canadian comics in 2004. [...] In French, Michel Viau wrote a book on francophone comics called BDQ: Répertoire des publications de bandes dessinées au Québec des origines à nos jours (2000). [...] Bart Beaty and Jeet Heer <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> about comics academically and professionally, and regularly have articles educating the public on comics published in newspapers such as the National Post and the Boston Globe, as well as comics and literary magazines. [...] Canadian feminist scholars such as Mary Louise Adams, Mona Gleason, and Janice Dickin McGinnis have done research into the anti-crime comics campaigns of the late 1940s and 1950s, {{from the point of}} view of the moral panic and social and legal history of the era, and the sociology of sexuality.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the album, Madonna was {{dismissed}} by some critics. They called her voice sounding as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium", while the other detractors suggested that she was [...] "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers." [...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very beginning of my career, people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and I am grateful for their resistance." ...|$|E

2500|$|All of his {{surviving}} secular {{works are}} {{in the form of}} the virelai, one of the formes fixes. [...] Most of the composers of the period wrote in another of formes fixes, the rondeau, but Legrant seems to have preferred the virelai, which had been set widely the century before. By 1420 few composers are known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> virelais, suggesting that Legrant's compositions may predate 1420 (the virelai was to return to favor later in the 15th century, in the music of Antoine Busnois and Johannes Ockeghem).|$|E

With Return to Base we were really pleased with the album, we thought that it turned out really well, but it didn't sell. Everyone around the band was saying to us that we weren't coming up with as good songs as we used to, but me and Jim knew that we were, we knew that we were coming up with strong songs. Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written. There only seemed to be me and Jim that had confidence in the songs; people like Chas, Dave and Don said that they didn't think our songs were as strong, some of them they did but some of them they didn't. But we ourselves thought that they were. Thus it was a case of getting the album down; and in our minds it turned out to be a great album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thallus, of whom {{very little}} is known, and none of whose {{writings}} survive, wrote a history allegedly around the middle to late first century CE, to which Eusebius referred. Julius Africanus, writing c 221, links a reference in the third book of the History to the period of darkness described in the crucifixion accounts {{in three of the}} Gospels [...] It is not known whether Thallus made any mention to the crucifixion accounts; if he did, it would be the earliest noncanonical reference to a gospel episode, but its usefulness in determining the historicity of Jesus is uncertain. The dating of Thallus is dependent on him writing about an event during the 207th Olympiad (49-52 AD), which means he wrote after that date, not near that date. This depends on the text being corrupt, which would mean Thallus could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> after the 217th Olympiad (89-92 AD), or even the 167th Olympiad (112-109 BC). He is first referenced by Theophilus, writing around 180 AD, which means Thallus could have written any time between 109 BC and 180 AD. [...] All we know is Thallus mentioned a solar eclipse, and as solar eclipses are not possible at Passover, that would mean Thallus was not talking about the crucifixion of Jesus at all.|$|E
2500|$|The gospels {{were written}} for an {{audience}} already Christian– their purpose was to strengthen the faith of those who already believed, not to convert unbelievers. Christian [...] "churches" [...] were small communities of believers, often based on households (an autocratic patriarch plus extended family, slaves, freedmen, and other clients), and the evangelists often wrote on two levels, one the [...] "historical" [...] presentation {{of the story of}} Jesus, the other dealing with the concerns of the author's own day. Thus the proclamation of Jesus in Mark 1:14 and the following verses, for example, mixes the terms Jesus would have used as a 1st-century Jew ("kingdom of God") and those of the early church ("believe", [...] "gospel"). More fundamentally, some scholars believe Mark's reason for writing was to counter believers who saw Jesus in a Greek way, as wonder-worker (the Greek term is [...] "divine man"); Mark saw the suffering of the messiah as essential, so that the [...] "Son of God" [...] title (the Hellenistic [...] "divine man") had to be corrected and amplified with the [...] "Son of Man" [...] title, which conveyed Christ's suffering. Other scholars think Mark might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> as a Galilean Christian against those Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who saw the Jewish revolt against Rome (66–73 CE) as the beginning of the [...] "end times": for Mark, the Second Coming would be in Galilee, not Jerusalem, and not until the generation following the revolt.|$|E

2500|$|I {{think it}} was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I {{discovered}} a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course , which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up {{there is no way of}} examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... fraudulent poem.|$|E
