5|$|After {{about two}} hours, Marines reached and climbed Hill 148. Working from the top, the Marines began {{clearing}} the Japanese fighting {{positions on the}} hill, most of which still remained, with explosive charges, grenades, and hand-to-hand combat. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the hill, the Marines were also able to put increased suppressive fire on Tanambogo.

5|$|After the 1963 season, {{the team}} fell apart.

5|$|Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, fought Lance Hoyt in the following encounter. D'Amore interfered in the contest several times by distracting Hoyt, the referee, or aiding Roode in some way. Roode won the bout after performing his signature Northern Lariat maneuver at 7 minutes and 24 seconds. After the bout, Hoyt performed a backflip splash <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a padded turnbuckle onto a prone D'Amore in the ring.|$|E

5|$|Herne Mill, a late 18th-century Kentish smock mill {{overlooking}} {{the village of}} Herne from a hilltop, is usually open to visitors on Sunday afternoons between April and September.

5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. Devine tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up a table for Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him {{and set up the}} table for himself outside the ring, placing Devine on top. Guerrero then climbed a padded turnbuckle and jumped onto Devine with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the table. In the ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing Homicide into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because Homicide was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a turnbuckle. Homicide followed with a splash <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a padded turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

San Martín watched the enemy ships <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the convent during the night. The royalists disembarked at dawn, ready to pillage and the regiment charged into battle. San Martín employed a pincer movement to trap the royalists. He led one column and Justo Bermúdez the other.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Mary Rose began in 1510 in Portsmouth and she was launched in July 1511. She was then towed to London and fitted with rigging and decking, and supplied with armaments. Other than the structural details needed to sail, stock and arm the Mary Rose, she was also equipped with flags, banners and streamers (extremely elongated flags that were flown <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the masts) that were either painted or gilded.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the event was between The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide; LAX) and The Rock 'n Rave Infection (Jimmy Rave and Lance Hoyt), who were {{accompanied}} by Christy Hemme.

5|$|With {{construction}} finally proceeding once more, the Palace Hotel {{closed in}} June 1986.

5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{pieces were}} stolen {{at an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. One of the paintings, The Concert, was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze finial was taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves. The museum is offering a $100,000 reward for this piece alone.|$|E
5|$|Christian Cage fought Monty Brown next to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This bout lasted 12 minutes and 32 seconds. In the beginning the two fought at ringside, until Cage jumped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a padded turnbuckle onto Brown with an aerial splash. After this, Cage removed the padding {{from one of the}} turnbuckles. Brown gained a two-count on Cage after slamming him against the mat with his signature Alpha Bomb maneuver and covered for the pin, but the referee had a delayed reaction. Later, Cage caused Brown to run into the exposed turnbuckle, he then followed by forcing Brown's face into the mat with his signature Unprettier maneuver. He then pinned Brown to become the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
