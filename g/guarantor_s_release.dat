40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a newly {{recognized}} gasotransmitter. Studies {{have demonstrated}} that the production of endogenous H 2 S and the exogenous administration of H 2 S can regulate many physiological and/or pathological processes. Therefore, H 2 <b>S</b> <b>releasing</b> agents (also known as H 2 S donors) are important research tools in advancing {{our understanding of the}} biology and clinical potential of H 2 S. Among currently available donors, GYY 4137 is probably the most well-known and has been used in many studies in the past 10 years. Recently, a number of GYY 4137 derivatives (e. g., phosphonothioate-based compounds) have been developed as H 2 S donors. In this review, we summarize the development and application of these donors, which include Lawesson’s reagent, substituted phosphorodithioates, cyclic phosphorane analogs, and pH-controlled phosphonamidothioates (JK donors). These donors have advantages such as good water-solubility, slow and controllable H 2 <b>S</b> <b>release</b> capability, and a variety of reported biological activities. However, {{it should be noted that}} the detailed H 2 <b>S</b> <b>release</b> profiles and byproducts under real biological systems are still unclear for many of these donors. Only after we figure out these unknowns we will see better applications of these donors in H 2 S research and therapy...|$|R

40|$|The H 2 <b>S</b> <b>release</b> {{profiles}} of five important Colombian coals have been monitored using temperature programmed pyrolysis. It {{was found that}} there was no correlation between the amount of H 2 S and the sulphur content of the original coals. Coals which had been treated to remove all of the mineral matter and inorganic sulphur showed a good correlation with the free swelling index of the coals. This was explained by the physical trapping of H 2 S in closed porosity formed during pyrolysis. A similar result was found for demineralised coals with pyrite present. The H 2 S for untreated coals showed no systematic variation with rank, the coal sulphur content or free swelling index. This was because certain coals were rich in finely dispersed calcium which could chemically prevent H 2 <b>S</b> <b>release...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is an {{endogenous}} modulator {{that plays}} significant physio-pathological roles in several biological systems. In this research field {{there is a}} large interest in developing selective CBS and CSE inhibitors and H 2 <b>S</b> <b>releasing</b> moieties, that could be either used as therapeutic agents or linked to known drugs. One of the major problem is the limited availability of chemicals that ensure a controlled release of H 2 S in vitro as well in vivo. Aiming to obtain novel H 2 <b>S</b> donors, whose <b>release</b> properties could be appropriately modulated, we have synthesized a series of 1, 2, 4 -thiadiazolidine- 3, 5 -diones (THIA 1 e 10) as innovative donors that could <b>release</b> H 2 <b>S</b> in controlled manner. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their H 2 <b>S</b> <b>releasing</b> properties by an amperometric approach and for their vasorelaxant ability on aorta rings. In order to rationalize the obtained results, a detailed study on the release mechanism has been performed using the most efficient H 2 S donor, THIA 3 (Cmax 65. 4 mM and EC 50 1. 7 mM) ...|$|R
