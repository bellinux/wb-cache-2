Conventional and innovative ultrasonic techniques were applied to the flaw size measurement problem. Advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Flaw size data obtained ultrasonically were compared to radiographic data and to real flaw sizes determined by destructive measurements. Considerable success was achieved with pulse echo techniques and with 'pitch and catch' techniques. The radiographic work described demonstrates that careful selection of film exposure parameters for a particular application must be made to obtain optimized flaw detectability. Thus, film exposure techniques can be improved even though radiography is an old weld inspection method...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this effort was to {{evaluate}} penetrant methods {{for their ability to}} detect surface-breaking cracks in monolithic ceramic materials with an emphasis on detection of cracks generated by machining. There are two basic penetrant types, visible and fluorescent. The visible penetrant method is usually augmented by powder developers and cracks detected can be seen in visible light. Cracks detected by fluorescent penetrant are visible only under ultraviolet light used with or without a developer. The developer is basically a powder that wicks up penetrant from a crack to make it more observable. Although fluorescent penetrants were recommended in the literature survey conducted early in this effort, visible penetrants and two non-standard techniques, a capillary gaseous diffusion method under development at the institute of Chemical Physics in Moscow, and the {open_quotes}statiflux{close_quotes} method which involves use of electrically charged particles, were also investigated. SiAlON ring specimens (1 in. diameter, 3 / 4 in. wide) which had been subjected to different thermal-shock cycles were used for these tests. The capillary gaseous diffusion method is based on ammonia; the detector is a specially impregnated paper much like litmus paper. As expected, visible <b>dye</b> <b>penetrants</b> offered no detection sensitivity for tight, surface-breaking cracks in ceramics. Although the non-standard statiflux method showed promise on high-crack-density specimens, it was ineffective on limited-crack-density specimens. The fluorescent penetrant method was superior for surface-breaking crack detection, but successful application of this procedure depends greatly on the skill of the user. Two presently available high-sensitivity fluorescent penetrants were then evaluated for detection of microcracks on Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } and SiC from different suppliers. Although 50 X optical magnification may be sufficient for many applications, 200 X magnification provides excellent delectability...|$|R

50|$|Manufacturers and {{operators}} of aircraft have a financial interest in ensuring that the inspection schedule is as cost-efficient as possible. Because aircraft are often revenue producing, {{there is an opportunity}} cost associated with the maintenance of the aircraft (lost ticket revenue), in addition to the cost of maintenance itself. Thus, this maintenance is desired to be performed infrequently, even when such increased intervals cause increased complexity and cost to the overhaul. Crack growth, as shown by fracture mechanics, is exponential in nature; meaning that the crack growth rate is a function of an exponent of the current crack size (see Paris' law). A desire for infrequent inspection intervals, combined with the exponential growth of cracks in structure has {{led to the development of}} non-destructive testing methods which allow inspectors to look for very tiny cracks which are often invisible to the naked eye. Examples of this technology include eddy current, ultrasonic, <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant,</b> and X-ray inspections. By catching structural cracks when they are very small, and growing slowly, these non-destructive inspections can reduce the amount of maintenance checks, and allow damage to be caught when it is small, and still inexpensive to repair.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the tensile fatigue behavior of a carbon fiber / epoxy composite material. Specifically, the stress levels at which cracks initiated in static and fatigue loading in the 90 degree plies of a "quasi-cross ply layup" [0 / 905]S was investigated. For layups which contain them, cracks in composite laminates initiate and propagate from 90 degree plies (including the ubiquitous "quasi-isotropic layup" 0 /± 45 / 90). Thus, this work provides valuable insight into the fatigue behavior of the plies which originate fatigue damage. Unidirectional off-axis 90 degree and 10 degree specimens were also tested, but the bulk of testing was done on the cross-ply laminates. The project sponsors, Boeing, {{were in the process of}} extending a failure model to the case of fatigue. The body of work presented here provided empirical data for that effort. Several different inspection techniques were used to investigate for cracking in the 90 degree plies, including: x-ray images, edge replicates, <b>dye</b> <b>penetrants,</b> and optical microscopy. Plots of the stress level at which crack initiation occurred will be presented, as well as images illustrating damage development in these layups. Comparisons are made to the experimental results of other investigations of this type of layup. Explorations of the effect of R-ratio (including R = 0. 1 and 0. 5), loading frequency (including 3, 10, and 30 Hz), and surface roughness (hand polished specimen edges to 1500 grit smoothness) on fatigue crack initiation were also performed. For the most damaging case (10 Hz, R = 0. 1, no polishing), the crack initiation strain (0. 00276) was one half of the strain at which cracks initiated in static monotonic loading (0. 0054), and was 16 % of the cross-ply specimen's (0 degree fiber dominated) ultimate strain value of (0. 018).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to improve the ability to detect hidden impact damage in thick {{composites}} caused by low velocity impact and to predict the remaining strength of those materials. An impact study has been undertaken on filament wound graphite/epoxy casings, such as those proposed for NASA's space shuttle solid fuel rocket boosters. In thick composite materials, low-velocity impact damage may not be visually evident, depending on the impacter shape; yet the damage may compromise the compo-site's ultimate strength. A model of a filament wound casing was fabri-cated with one fifth of the diameter (30 inches) but with the full'thickness (1. 4 inches) of the full rocket motor (12 feet and 1. 4 inches, respectively). It was impacted with various masses and energy levels using a one inch diameter ball as the indenter. This casing was subsequently cut into coupons of 2 in. width by 12 in. length. These samples were nondestruc-tively examined for the degree of damage. Next, these samples were loaded in tension until failure. Efforts to accurately detect the damage with <b>dye</b> <b>penetrants</b> and x-ray methods have proven unsatisfactory in the samples that displayed no visible damage. In spite of the high attenuation of this material, ultrasonic phase velocity and attenuation images show promise in predicting the residual strength of the coupons. Predictions of the damage profile, and therefore the cross-section of the damage in the direction of loading, were obtained by assuming an "effective" value for the attenuation of the damaged part of the filament wound casing material OS dB/MHz-cm) and an "effective " value for the velocity of the damaged part. of the filament wound casing material (2250 m / s). These estimates were based partially on measurements made on impact damaged thin composite material. The remaining strength predictions from these ultrasonic data showed a significant improvement over the x-ray predictions of remaining strength and the method may be usable for predictions of remaining strength of full scale rocket motors that may have suffered impact damage...|$|R

40|$|Carbon fiber based {{composites}} are {{an essential}} material in weight-critical {{applications such as}} in the aerospace industry. However, these materials are susceptible to damage such as matrix microcracking and fiber/matrix debonding (diffuse damage), which occurs at stresses much lower than the failure stress. A T 700 /M 21 [0 / 90]s laminate was tensile loaded to introduce diffuse damage and prepared for a study on the initiation of transverse microcracks. The material was tensile loaded in a [+ 45 /- 45]s orientation to induce diffuse damage. A diffuse damage indicator was developed by measuring the decrease in shear stiffness. Samples with diffuse damage levels of 0, 0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 15, 0. 20, and 0. 25 were prepared to be tensile tested in a [0 / 90]s orientation to induce microcracks. A successful development of the microcracking test procedure was performed. The edge of the material was studied with optical microscopy and x-ray to establish the structure of the fiber bundle geometry when undamaged. A sample containing microcracks was treated with diiodomethane <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant,</b> which successfully highlighted microcracks during x-ray imaging.
