40|$|Abstract] With the {{development}} of applications of XML and the publication of XML schema recommendation by W 3 C, XML+XMLschema-based EDIFACT is becoming a good solution to the electronic commerce applications. Now a lot of large-scale enterprises {{want to make the}} traditional electronic commerce systems migrated to XML schema-based EDIFACT. At the same time many small and medium-scale enterprises want to implement electronic commerce systems with XML schema-based EDIFACT. The design and implementation of <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>message</b> structures based on XML schema is the most important work and the base of applying XML +XML schema-based EDIFACT to electronic commerce systems and implementations of new electronic commerce systems. In this paper we present a method of design and implementation of <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>message</b> structures based on XML schema and illustrate it with examples.

50|$|Recommendation 25 and the UN/EDIFACT Standard {{represent}} {{a set of}} internationally agreed standards, directories, and guidelines for the electronic interchange of structured data, between independent computerized information systems. UN/EDIFACT is the international standard for Electronic Data Interchange and is used throughout the commercial and administrative world. UN/EDIFACT accounts for over 90% of all electronic data interchange (EDI) messages exchanged globally. UN/EDIFACT messages are used by almost all national customs administrations, all major seaports and a large range of companies (including over 100 000 in the retail sector), and throughout international supply chains. For example, more than 7 million <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages</b> are exchanged {{each year in the}} French agricultural supply chain.|$|E

The complexity of the task, however, does make demands on the information-processing capacities of GPs.

This paper describes the setup of the Communication Project Apeldoorn (COPA), the aim {{of which is to}} examine the contribution of EDI to quality, efficiency and reduction in costs in Medical Health Care.

30|$|The {{use of the}} Internet {{for trade}} {{facilitation}} became the catalyst {{that led to the}} replacement of EDI in the medium term. An important facilitating role was played by the rapid rise of the XML (eXtensible Markup Language) standard as a means to encode semantic structures pertinent to a domain in a form, which is both machine-readable (well formed) and human-readable (marked up with meaningful tags). XML has become today the most important data interchange format for e-business. An XML document can be displayed by software (for example, by a standard Internet browser) {{but it can also be}} processed by domain-specific applications in the same way as <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages.</b> There are now conversion tools such as the XML-Edifact 12 which offer an open path for migration between XML and UN/EDIFACT, turning the complex <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages</b> into a human-readable format.|$|E

R. 3. 1 PRINCIPLES The RETANN message is sent from a customer to a supplier, to notify an intention to return books to the supplier and to request authorisation where needed. Overstock returns and returns due to discrepancies or defects in delivered items are all handled as part of a single process and may be listed in a single message. The message also allows a customer to notify a delivery shortage or an invoiced price or discount discrepancy, though this does not of course lead to a return – it simply alerts the supplier to take appropriate action. Like all <b>EDIFACT</b> transaction <b>messages,</b> RETANN has a header, a variable number of message lines (up to a maximum of 9, 999 in a single message), and a trailer.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{collaboration}} within value chains is rapidly increasing and drives enterprise to align and electronically integrate their business processes with their business partners. As technologies evolve, manifold forms of B 2 B integration have emerged – from e-mail communication to customer or supplier portals, {{the exchange of}} EDIFACT- to XML documents, and Web Services. Although serviceoriented architectures (SOA) are considered the future of inter-organizational linkages, no empirical studies have been found which surveyed the impact of SOA on B 2 B integration costs and benefits. From a research perspective, we still lack a systematic analysis that explains how a specific B 2 B integration technology impacts the effectiveness of B 2 B integration. Building on transaction cost theory, this research analyzes the different forms of B 2 B integration {{with regard to their}} impact on connectivity and coordination costs. Based on a field study from the automotive industry, it demonstrates that there is economic rationale for preferring supplier portals to machine-to-machine integration based on <b>EDIFACT</b> or XML <b>messages.</b> Compared to prior technologies, SOA reduces the costs of external integration by eliminating separate B 2 B integration infrastructures and improving connectivity of internal applications. However, we find that prior literature tends to overestimate the impact of open Internet and Web service technologies on connectivity costs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{standards}} for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), such as EDIFACT and ANSI X 12, have been employed in Business-to-Business (B 2 B) e-commerce for decades. Due to their wide industry coverage and long-standing establishment, they will presumably {{continue to play}} an important role for some time. EDI systems are typically not “process-aware”, i. e., messages are standardized but processes simply “emerge”. However, to improve performance and to enhance the control, it is important to understand and analyze the “real ” processes supported by these systems. In the case study presented in this paper we uncover the inter-organizational business processes of an automotive supplier company by analyzing the <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages</b> that it receives from its business partners. We start by transforming a set of observed messages to an event log, which requires that the individual messages are correlated to process instances. Thereby, we make use of the specific structure of <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages.</b> Then we apply process mining techniques to uncover the inter-organizational business processes. Our results show that inter-organizational business process models can be derived by analyzing EDI messages that are exchanged in a network of organizations...|$|E

40|$|EDI is {{expected}} to be the dominant form of business communication between organisations moving to the Electronic Commerce era of 2000. The emergence of world-wide EDI standards (like EDIFACT) is a key driver towards this direction. However, the design of new <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages</b> is a tedious and complicated task, due to the strict restrictions imposed by the standard. This paper reports on the development of an EDIFACT message generator, i. e. a tool which automatically designs new messages according to input data flows.

The paper also proposes a new methodology for business analysis and modeling while integrates all aspects of message development and discusses the idea of automated tools that could assist this effort. 1...|$|E

40|$|Objective of {{this paper}} is to {{elaborate}} the impact of the administrative and regulatory framework and the measures within the TEDIS program (Trade Electronic Data Interchange Systems) on the diffusion of EDI. The diffusion of highly standardized EDI solutions, based on EDIFACT and OSI standards, faces two major obstacles: Firstly, companies hesitate to invest in the development of public goods, while other companies and the state can become free riders. Secondly, the economic rationale of EDI solutions is based on a critical mass of participants. Therefore, the role of the CEC to create incentives for companies to invest in an area where part of the results will be public goods (<b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages)</b> and to collaborate and cooperate with other companies in setting-up EDI networks will be scrutinized. The impact of TEDIS activities on companies are evaluated on the background of the transaction cost theory: How do specific measures in particular and the policies in general affect the costs [...] ...|$|E
