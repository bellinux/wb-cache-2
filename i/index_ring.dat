5000|$|Two leaf-shuttered lenses {{were also}} made available, first the 90mm 2.8 {{and later a}} 165mm 2.8 that both {{allowing}} flash sync at all speeds, thereby solving many mirror and shutter vibration problems as well as allowing for fast shutter speeds for use with strobes and portable flashes while in bright shooting conditions. Lenses {{are linked to the}} body by the operation of the aperture stop-down lever being tripped. The camera body is set to the [...] "time-exposure" [...] setting. The through-the-lens (TTL) metering pentaprism viewfinder and included a knurled shutter dial ring with fitted case. The TTL-metered Pentaprism is the same coverage as the non-metered pentaprism, a coverage of 90% of frame and has a sensitivity pattern of 60% center-weight and 30% inner field sensitivity. The TTL Metering Pentaprism has no internal power of its own, instead, the operating power comes from one of the three contacts found in the finder bay of the body as well as grounding to the body. Only two of the three contacts are utilized and depending on the two modes: Normal as 'AUTO' mode and in an override to stopdown mode in the 'MAN' mode as found on many equipped lenses. In 'AUTO' is where the lens is fully opened and adjustments are read from the coupled index from the lens-through the <b>index</b> <b>ring</b> of the body mount-to the chain and index shuttle, the TTL-Meter receives the position information via a protruding tab facing the finder bay. The tab operates a linear potentiometer. In 'MAN' or manual mode with so equipped lenses, the sliding of the lens switch will move an internal lever that then presses down on the activating switch in the body. The switch is located inside the pin of the lens release pin. This inner pin is connected to an electrical toggle inside the body and switches the current from body grounded to bay connector to activate the secondary circuit. The installation of the TTL-Meter into the finder bay requires first the removal or turning of the lens to remove tension on the aperture chain. When the lens is rotated to allow the index on the chain to properly match up with the tab under the meter, the finder can then be seated and firmly pressed until the locks {{on either side of the}} finder latch. Removal of the finder is the reverse by first removing the lens and then pressing in the locks on the sides of the finder and lifting out. The physical difference of the TTL-Meter to the regular prism is the bulky arm that extends to the shutter speed dial. The dial covers the body dial and is coupled via a spring loaded index to the shutter speed dial. The included knurled ring assists the reach of the shutter speed dial due to the bulk of the TTL-Meter prism. The stop-down mode or direct metering through while the aperture is allowed to operate and change the amount of light, is similar to the 'MAN' mode, but activates when a non-auto-aperture lens is mounted causing <b>index</b> <b>ring</b> to be positioned to place the meter's linear potenioment into a bypass mode to activate the secondary circuit in the meter. The lens is allowed to stop-down and the light is directly measured, however, the shutter speed dial link operates the same in 'MAN' mode. As did the body receiving improvements over time, so did the TTL-Meter have had some changes. Although the image coverage remained unchanged, the type of metering and the circuitry received some upgrades. CdS (cadmium sulfide) to Gpd (gallium photo diode) photo cells and a two part circuit to a single board to improve response time and reliability. The early version is identified by the single marked 'ON' switch and the meter needle starts from UP to down and the later model has a 'ON' & 'OFF' marked switch and the meter needle starts from BOTTOM to top. The later model would also have the sole PENTAX badge by 1986.|$|E

40|$|A variational {{analysis}} of weakly guiding optical fibers is described. series expansion of Laguerre-Gauss functions and a modified Bessel function {{have been used}} to describe the field in the fiber core and in the uniform cladding, respectively. A numerical procedure optimizing the field parameters (the expansion coefficients, the Gaussian spot-size and the normalized transverse propagation constant) has been developed which allowed highly accurate field representations to be obtained through few-term expansions. Low-order LP modes have been analyzed for refractive index profiles with a power-law variation in the core for which reference solutions (either exact or approximate) are available. A modified profile exhibiting a high <b>index</b> <b>ring</b> around the core has also been analyzed. For power-law profiles, the results are in excellent agreement with the reference solutions and show that the proposed variational analysis also appears to be appropriate for determining the field at wavelengths near to cutoff. Moreover, the comparison with other field representations which use series expansions, shows that our solution needs a noticeably lower number of terms.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} demand for {{assistance}} in rehabilitation therapies for hand movements, a robotic system is proposed to mobilize the hand fingers in flexion and extension exercises. The robotic system is composed by four, type slider-crank, mechanisms that {{have the ability to}} fit the user fingers length from the index to the little finger, through the adjustment of only one link for each mechanism. The trajectory developed by each mechanism corresponds to the natural flexoextension path of each finger. The amplitude of the rotations for metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) varies from 0 to 90 ° and the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) varies from 0 to 60 °; the joint rotations are coordinated naturally. The four R-RRT mechanisms orientation allows a 15 ° abduction movement for <b>index,</b> <b>ring,</b> and little fingers. The kinematic analysis of this mechanism was developed in order to assure that the displacement speed and smooth acceleration into the desired range of motion and the simulation results are presented.

40|$|Researchers {{studying}} {{the relationship of}} consciousness to the brain often ask, “Which comes first, changes in conscious awareness or changes in the brain? ” (e. g., Libet, Gleason, Wright, & Pearl, 1983). To find out, people are asked to indicate {{when they decided to}} perform a spontaneous action, and neural activity before the indicated decision times is examined. This activity sometimes suggests that the brain starts getting ready to act before the decision is made consciously, implying that the decision is made subconsciously by the brain and that people’s subjective impression of free will for these actions is an illusion. The interpretation of such studies depends crucially on knowing how accurately people report their decision times. But how can this accuracy be assessed? Decision times are not directly observable, so there is no objective measure against which to compare people’s reports. Conclusions 3. Decision time reports are inaccurate. a. The reports are not appropriately sensitive to experimental manipulations. b. Reported decision times are often impossibly early (before the onset of the stimulus about which the decision was made) or late (after the key press response reflecting the outcome of the decision). 4. Inaccuracy of decision time reports casts doubt on previous claims that changes in the brain come before changes in conscious awareness. 5. We may have free will after all. Experiment 2 We varied the complexity of the motor response to manipulate post-decision processing times. RT should increase with more complex responses, but will people’s decision time reports increase comparably? They should not, if people can report their decision times accurately.

The <b>index</b> and <b>ring</b> finger ratio is found to be higher in females. <b>Index</b> and <b>ring</b> finger ratio ⩽ 0. 976 is suggestive of males, and ratio > 0. 976 is suggestive of females.

Cycloalkanes are desirable components of advanced jet fuels, in terms of having higher thermal stability and density than n-alkanes of the same carbon number.
