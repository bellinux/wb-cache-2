5|$|The Walk of Fame {{was first}} {{conceived}} in 1996 when Peter Soumalias suggested {{the idea of}} a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his idea but he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians. Canada's Walk of Fame runs an annual contest in which Canadians can nominate potential inductees. In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, fax and <b>e-mail.</b> <b>The</b> committee then analyzes the nominees based on the following criteria: the nominee was born in Canada or has spent their formative or creative years in Canada; they have had a minimum of 10 years experience in their field; they have had a national or international impact on Canada’s Cultural heritage. Following the Selection Committee's evaluation, the nominees that meet all of the requirements are forwarded to the board of directors, who then select the inductees.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{system log}} (syslog) files of <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> and <b>the</b> DNS cache servers in Kumamoto University were {{statistically}} investigated when receiving {{a lot of}} spam mails. The DNS query traffic between <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> and <b>the</b> DNS cache servers increases when many traces of spam and/or junk mails are found in syslog file of <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server. <b>The</b> DNS query traffic decreases when preventing access between <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server and <b>the</b> spam/junk transferring SMTP clients. This is because the DNS query between <b>the</b> DNS and <b>E-mail</b> servers are mainly driven by the SMTP access in <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server. Therefore, we can detect abnormality of <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server by monitoring the DNS query traffic from <b>the</b> <b>E-mail</b> server to <b>the</b> DNS server and get access-controlling list by analysis of the SMTP syslog files...|$|R

On 14 July, Lashkar-e-Qahhar, a terrorist organisation possibly linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), {{claimed responsibility for the}} bombings. In an e-mail to an Indian TV channel, the outfit says it organised the bombings using 16 people who are all [...] "safe". According to the <b>e-mail,</b> <b>the</b> main motive {{seems to have been a}} retaliation to the situation in the Gujarat and Kashmir regions, possibly referring to the alleged oppression of Muslim minorities in certain parts of the region. It also says that the blasts were part of a series of attacks aimed at other sites such as the Mumbai international airport, Gateway of India, the Taj Mahal in Agra and the Red Fort in New Delhi. The authorities are investigating this claim and are trying to track the location of the e-mail sender. However, on 17 July, the forensic science laboratory Mumbai has confirmed the use of a mixture of the highly explosive RDX and Ammonium Nitrate for the bombings. The presence of these explosives in the post explosive debris was confirmed by modern techniques such as Liquid Chromatography with mass detector (LCMS), Gas Chromatography with mass detector (GCMS) and Ion Scan Chromatography. They have indicated a strong possibility of all explosives being planted at the Churchgate railway station, which was the starting point for all affected trains.|$|E
2500|$|In {{comparison}} with other sectors, IT organisations may be offering equal salaries to women and the density of women in technology companies may be relatively high {{but this does not}} necessarily ensure a level playing field.

In 1999, Juno Online faced two separate suits from former employees who alleged that they were told that they would be fired if they broke off their ongoing relationships with senior executives. Pseudo Programs, a Manhattan-based Internet TV network, was sued in January 2000 after male employees referred to female employees as [...] "bimbos" [...] and forced them to look at sexually explicit material on the Internet. In India HR managers admit that women are discriminated against for senior Board positions and pregnant women are rarely given jobs but only in private. In addition to this, {{it has been suggested that}} there are less women in the IT sector due to existing stereotypes that depict the sector as male-orientated. In a recent book, Own It: Leadership Lessons From Women Who Do, author Aparna Jain interviewed 200 women in senior management and leadership positions in India about the problems they face at the workplace and noted that 86% of the women she spoke to experienced harassment in one form or the other. Among the issues she notes are bias, bullying, sexual harassment and the impact of motherhood on women’s career. Recently a sexual harassment suit against a senior member shocked the Indian IT sector, as was the sexual harassment case against the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces' (Taj Group) CEO, Rakesh Sarna [...] A startling example of institutional mechanisms that allow for an unfettered environment for sexual harassment to fester is the Rajendra K. Pachauri scandal at The Energy and Resources Institute in India. Improvements in the education system could be the key to encouraging women to take up roles in this sector.|$|E
