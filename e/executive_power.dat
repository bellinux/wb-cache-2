5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of <b>executive</b> <b>power.</b> Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding {{the reach of the}} limitations on legislative and <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection of due process rights as implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar is a semi-presidential {{representative}} democratic multi-party republic, {{wherein the}} popularly elected {{president is the}} head of state and selects a prime minister, who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet, the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.|$|E
5|$|Politically, the {{new state}} had a semi-presidential constitution, known as the Loi Fondamentale, in which <b>executive</b> <b>power</b> was shared between President and Prime Minister in a system known as bicephalisme.

The members of the Bundesrat represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.|$|E

This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E
