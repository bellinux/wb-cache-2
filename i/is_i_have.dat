I watch him on tapes and it's just ridiculous how good he was compared to the guys he was playing against. He's a great guy and you don't even know it's Bobby Orr, the way he talks to you." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2012, Simon was {{diagnosed}} with terminal colorectal cancer which later metastasized to his other organs, including his liver and kidneys. He had been feeling ill {{for some time and}} had earlier been misdiagnosed. He was given between three and six months to live; chemotherapy treatment reduced the size of his tumors over the following six months.

His remains were interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Since 2016, Chabon {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} Donald Trump, both during his {{campaign}} for the presidency (signing a petition with over 400 other writers against his presidency in May 2016), and during his administration. During an interview with The Guardian before Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Chabon remarked of the incoming president, [...] "I really have no idea what to expect. He’s so unpredictable. He’s so mercurial. You know, I would be no more surprised if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the United States than if {{he said he was going}} to take them all out to be shot. He’s like a random impulse generator." [...] In a 2017 radio interview, Chabon spoke of President Trump and said: “Every morning I wake up and in the seconds before I turn my phone on to see what the latest news <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> this boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that he’s going to have a massive stroke, and, you know, be carted out of the White House on a gurney." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with IGN in June 2013, [...] Blomkamp said, [...] "I {{really want to make}} a District 9 sequel. I genuinely do. The problem <b>is</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a bunch of ideas and stuff that I want to make. I'm relatively new to this – I'm about to make my third film, and now the pattern that I'm starting to realise is very true is that you lock yourself into a film beyond the film you're currently working on. But it just doesn't work for me." [...] Referring to a potential sequel, Blomkamp said [...] " [...] want to make District 10 at some point".|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} {{register}} (in older speakers, {{in rural areas}} speakers or in speakers with little exposure to Portuguese) {{there are only two}} forms for the verbs: one for the present (ê , stâ , têm , tenê , crê , sabê , podê , devê , mestê [...] ) and one for the past (éra , stába , têmba /tẽ, tenêba , crêba , sabêba , podêba , devêba , mestêba [...] ). However, on the contrary of regular verbs, when the base form is used alone it represents the imperfective aspect and not the perfective aspect. Therefore, mí ê, m’ têm, m’ crê, m’ sabê mean “I <b>am,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>I</b> want, I know”, and not “I’ve been, I’ve had, I’ve wanted, I’ve known”, as it would be expected. Parallelly, mí éra, m’ têmba, m’ crêba, m’ sabêba mean “I <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> <b>I</b> wanted, I knew”, and not “I <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> wanted, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known”, as would be expected.|$|R

2500|$|On June 20, 2008, at {{a concert}} in New York's Carnegie Hall, Scott shared a long on-stage kiss with her drummer, Li'l John Roberts; the couple then told the {{audience}} that they were engaged. Their son, Jett Hamilton Roberts, was born on April 20, 2009. On June 23, 2009, Scott announced that she and Roberts had broken up, with Scott breaking the news to Essence magazine. Despite the break-up, Scott hopes for both parents to have {{an active part in}} their child's upbringing, stating that [...] "We definitely love our son and we are co-parenting and working on being friends. It is what it <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a lot of support, so I want for nothing as far as that's concerned." [...] Scott referenced the break up as some of her latest music's inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|Long-standing {{familiarity}} with DC characters and staff, coupled with high demand have {{combined with other}} factors to mean {{that the vast majority}} of Bolland's work has been for DC Comics. In The Art of Brian Bolland, he also mentions in passing that a bad experience with a Marvel UK Hulk cover and a later oddity with a She-Hulk cover featuring Howard the Duck have given him a mild [...] "phobia about Marvel... the laws of the production line" [...] that overrule [...] "whatever it <b>is</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to give." [...] He has however, produced odd covers for Marvel, First Comics, Continuity Comics, Eclipse Comics, New Comics and a dozen other companies, large and small, as well as book, magazine and record covers. For Dark Horse Comics, Bolland has produced several diverse covers, including a couple for Michael Chabon's The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist at the behest of editor Diana Schutz. He recalls that [...] "the cover for number ten was done in the style of Hergé's The Adventures of Tintin... but the book was cancelled after number eight." ...|$|E
