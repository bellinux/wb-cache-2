Its task is that of adapting the signal that enters the multiplexer to the rate at which this signal is transmitted within the output frame (its highest clock value). This type of justification is called positive justification.Justification bits, together with other overhead bits, make the output rate higher than the total of the input signals.|$|E

Where a typical Java Virtual Machine uses static heap sizes and reaches a practical size limitation due to garbage collection pauses, Zing implements Azul's C4 (Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector) garbage collection software technology, allowing heap sizes of hundreds of GBs without pauses. Zing also utilizes Azul's technology for <b>elastic</b> <b>memory,</b> which allows memory heaps for Java instances to grow and shrink based on load. This dynamic heap scaling removes the need for most JVM and GC tuning. Zing also incorporates ReadyNow! technology to shorten warm-up time and avoid de-optimization during runs.|$|E

To recapitulate: A CHEM structure is fabricated from a shape-memory polymer (SMP) foam. The structure is compressed to a very small volume while in its rubbery state above its glass-transition temperature (Tg). Once compressed, the structure can be cooled below Tg to its glassy state. As long as the temperature remains <Tg the structure remains compacted (in a cold hibernated state), even when the external compressive forces are removed. When the structure is subsequently heated above Tg, it returns to the rubbery state, in which a combination of elasticity and the SMP effect cause it to expand (deploy) to its original size and shape. Once thus deployed, the CHEM structure can be rigidified by cooling below Tg to the glassy state. The structure could be subsequently reheated above Tg and recompacted. The compaction/deployment/rigidification cycle could be repeated as many times as needed...|$|E

40|$|Super <b>elastic</b> shape <b>memory</b> alloys (SESMA) are {{promising}} materials for damping applications {{due to their}} inherent hysteresis associated solid–solid reversible phase transformations. These transformations induce a large recoverable strain in the material. In most of the applications, SMA {{is used in the}} form of thin wires subjected to low cycle fatigue. This report presents experimental studies on low cycle fatigue (LCF) life of super <b>elastic</b> shape <b>memory</b> alloy (SESMA) wires. The effect of frequency of the loading and amplitude of the strain on the fatigue life has been studied individually. Various loading frequencies have been considered to study the effect of frequency, by keeping the amplitude constant. From the experimental data, {{it was found that the}} low cycle fatigue life of the SESMA reduces with increase in the frequency. The effect of amplitude on the low cycle fatigue life of SESMA has also been studied and it was found that the SESMA cycled at lower net strain has more fatigue life than the one cycled at higher net strain. Further, the plastic strain accumulation is also more in the samples tested at the higher net strain loadings. The modulus of austenite is found to be by and large independent of the frequency and amplitude of the loading. Further, martensitic unloading modulus is by and large independent of change in minimum strain amplitudes. An attempt is also made to estimate the low cycle fatigue life of SESMA. The dissipated energy during the transformation is used as the key parameter to estimate the life cycles. From the results it can be seen that the estimation of the life cycles are well in agreement with the experimental fatigue life of the SESMA samples...|$|R

This paper presents recent advances in characterizing the shape memory mechanics of a thermoset shape memory polymer resin for <b>Elastic</b> <b>Memory</b> Composite (EMC) materials. In particular, heretofore undocumented response behavior is characterized through a series of thermo-mechanical tests of a commercially available EMC resin, and a lumped parameter model is adapted to accurately correlate this behavior.

According to the instant proposal, a CHEM sensor structure would be fabricated at full size from SMP foam at a temperature below its glass-transition temperature (Tg).

At landing, the inelastic yielding of the rigid compacted foam would absorb impact energy, thereby enabling the structure to survive the landing. The structure would then be solar heated above Tg, causing it to revert to its original size and shape. Finally, the structure would be rigidified by cooling it below Tg by the cold planetary or space environment.

Some of the areas affected are permeability, cleanability and strength. The shrinkage can be chemical of nature. This is related to the cyclisation of the PAN fibers due to heat or chemical attack. The shrinkage could also be physical of nature, which means the shrinkage is caused by the <b>elastic</b> <b>memory</b> of the fibers and stresses induced in the felt during manufacturing. Heat setting of the fabric is very important and differences of parameters during the heat setting process are responsible for differences in the shrinkage behaviour of adjacent bags in the same bag house, constructed of the same fibre and in the same needling loom.

Yet, the classical transactional model limits concurrency and many relaxed transactional models have been recently proposed. We show in this paper that, maybe surprisingly, {{a closer look at}} these models reveals that, in general, they hamper composition. While doing so, we highlight, for the first time, an inherent trade-off between transactional concurrency and composition. More specifically, we present in this paper a framework to precisely reason about concurrent software composition and we show that, strictly speaking, relaxed transactional models do not enable composition.

Two types of reflectors are dominant for satellite RF systems today, rigid, single-piece reflectors and deployable mesh reflectors.

Many substances of multi-phase nature and/or of high molecular weight are frequently encountered in disciplinary fields such as chemical engineering, food stuff, bio-medicine and so forth, and are also closely related to industrial processes. Typical non-Newtonian characteristics include shear-thinning, shear-thickening, viscoelasticity, viscoplasticity (i.e., the exhibition of an apparent yield stress) and so on. In particular, polymer melts and solutions, liquid crystals or biological fluids exhibit such properties which lead to non-linear viscoelastic behavior that cannot be simply described by the classical Navier-Stokes theory. Non-Newtonian fluids form a broad class of fluids in which the relation connecting the shear stress and shear rate is non-linear and hence there is no universal constitutive model available which exhibits the characteristics of all non-Newtonian fluids. Moreover, due to the flow behavior of these fluids, the governing equations become more complex to handle as additional non-linear terms appear in the equations of motion. Numerous models have been proposed to describe the response corresponding to non-Newtonian fluids. They are usually classified as fluids of differential, rate and integral type. Amongst the non-Newtonian fluids, the rate type fluids are those which {{take into account the}} <b>elastic</b> and <b>memory</b> effects. The simplest subclasses of rate type fluids are those of Maxwell and Oldroyd-B fluids.
