Meanwhile, Messala organizes his own huge campaign, revealing Judah Ben-Hur's former identity to the community as an outcast and convict. Malluch challenges Messala and <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> to a large wager, which, if the Roman loses, would bankrupt him.|$|E
25|$|Julian is a {{decorated}} war hero {{because of his}} contributions as a Union officer during the Civil War. However, he finds himself unexpectedly dismissed from the service because of accusations of treason. He is mistaken for his father who has been accused {{on the basis of}} rumors {{brought to the attention of}} President Lincoln by <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> who also happen to be Dr. Norval's political enemies. Through Julian's character, the novel exposes the corruption within the government and demonstrates how democracy can degenerate to demagoguery.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} as acting president, Burnet {{dismissed}} several of Lamar's appointees, angering the president. At the conclusion of Lamar's term, Burnet agreed to run for president. Lamar and <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> only reluctantly supported Burnet after they could not entice Rusk to run. Burnet's primary competition was Houston, and the campaign was dominated by insults and namecalling. Houston questioned Burnet's honesty, accusing him of taking a $250,000 bribe from Santa Anna and calling him a 'political brawler' and a 'canting hypocrite.' Houston also accused Burnet of being a drunk. Burnet again challenged Houston to a duel, and, again, Houston refused. Houston won the election, with 7,915votes to Burnet's 3,619.|$|E
25|$|There were no cartels at {{that time}} in Mexico. Félix Gallardo was the lord of Mexican drug smugglers. He oversaw all operations; there was just him, <b>his</b> <b>cronies,</b> and the {{politicians}} who sold him protection. However, the Guadalajara Cartel suffered a major blow in 1985 when the group's co-founder Rafael Caro Quintero was captured, and later convicted, for the murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena. Félix Gallardo afterwards kept a low profile and in 1987 he moved with his family to Guadalajara. According to Peter Dale Scott, the Guadalajara Cartel prospered largely because it enjoyed the protection of the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS), under its chief Miguel Nazar Haro.|$|E
25|$|Mobutu was infamous for embezzling the {{equivalent}} of billions of US dollars from his country. According to the most conservative estimates, he stole US$4–5billion from his country, and some sources put the figure as high as US$15billion. According to Mobutu's ex-son-in-law, Pierre Janssen—the ex-husband of Mobutu's daughter Yaki—Mobutu had no concern {{for the cost of}} the expensive gifts he gave away to <b>his</b> <b>cronies.</b> Janssen married Yaki in a lavish ceremony that included three orchestras, a US$65,000 wedding cake and a giant fireworks display. Yaki wore a US$70,000 wedding gown and US$3million worth of jewels. Janssen wrote a book describing Mobutu's daily routine—which included several daily bottles of wine, retainers flown in from overseas and lavish meals.|$|E

25|$|Cokayne now {{began to}} acquire a degree of {{influence}} and recognition in Deryshire society. In March 1392 he received a commission of array. In February 1393 he received a commission of arrest to pursue a fugitive in a case brought to attention by his uncle John. Rituals of social solidarity and political responsibility did not make Cokayne markedly less inclined to consort with criminals. In May John Cokayn, probably the uncle, obtained a pardon for a man involved in a rampage of housebreaking and murder at Ashbourne. Although there is no suggestion in the text that Sir John himself was present on this occasion, the list of those involved overlaps substantially with that of <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> who had terrorised the area in 1388, including Edmund Harthill, presumably a cousin. Moreover, when Sir John was returned to Parliament {{for the first time}} in 1395, he had another indictment for felony hanging over him. While he was at Westminster he had the case transferred to Derbyshire by a writ of nisi prius, which covered also Thomas Lache and William Walsh, both of Normanton, presumably his accomplices. The other knight of the shire in 1395 was Peter Melbourne or Fauconer, a one-time MP who was a close and devoted adherent of Gaunt. It was rare for the Derbyshire gentry to send two inexperienced men to Parliament: generally at least one would have served before.|$|E
500|$|After {{failing to}} receive any {{satisfactory}} response {{from those in}} power over the hospital, Baillie published a pamphlet in 1778 detailing the problems and corruption, which had {{gone so far as}} to include denying food to the sailors. The publication of the pamphlet reflected badly on the Earl of Sandwich, who was at the time First Lord of the Admiralty. In his efforts to gain votes and pay off political debts Sandwich had given many of the positions in the hospital to <b>his</b> <b>cronies,</b> who had never served as sailors. Although he publicly ignored Baillie's allegations, Sandwich ensured through back channels that he was suspended from his job, and had associates go to the Court of King's Bench and secure a writ allowing them to sue him for criminal libel.|$|E
500|$|As Bacon's work {{moved from}} the extreme subject matter of his early {{paintings}} to portraits of friends in the mid-1960s, Dyer became a dominating presence in the artist's work. Bacon's treatment of his lover in these canvasses emphasises his subject's physicality while remaining uncharacteristically tender. More than any other of the artist's close friends portrayed during this period, Dyer came to feel inseparable from his effigies. The paintings gave him stature, a raison d'être, and offered meaning to what Bacon described as Dyer's [...] "brief interlude between life and death". Many critics have cited Dyer's portraits as favourites, including Michel Leiris and Lawrence Gowling. Yet as Dyer's novelty diminished within Bacon's circle of sophisticated intellectuals, the younger man became increasingly bitter and ill at ease. Although Dyer welcomed the attention the paintings brought him, he did not pretend to understand or even like them. [...] "All that money an' I fink they're reely 'orrible", he observed with choked pride. He abandoned crime but soon descended into alcoholism. Bacon's money allowed Dyer to attract hangers-on who would accompany him on massive benders around London's Soho. Withdrawn and reserved when sober, Dyer was insuppressible when drunk, and would often attempt to [...] "pull a Bacon" [...] by buying large rounds and paying for expensive dinners for his wide circle. Dyer's erratic behaviour inevitably wore thin—with <b>his</b> <b>cronies,</b> with Bacon, and with Bacon's friends. Most of Bacon's art world associates regarded Dyer as a nuisance—an intrusion {{into the world of}} high culture to which their Bacon belonged. Dyer reacted by becoming increasingly needy and dependent. By 1971, he was drinking alone and was only in occasional contact with his former lover.|$|E

500|$|Noman spoke over Radio San'a, {{offering}} {{reconciliation and}} inviting [...] "all tribes of all persuasions" [...] {{to meet with}} him the following week at Khamir, 50 miles north of San'a, to achieve [...] "the one thing which we all prize over anything else: peace for the nation." [...] In order to convince al-Badr to come the conference, Noman announced that he personally would head the republican delegation at Khamir, and that Sallal would stay in San'a. Al-Badr and his ranking chiefs did not attend the conference, but a handful of pro-royalist sheiks were present. The conference named a committee of five tribal and four religious leaders who were charged with seeking out the [...] "beguiled brothers", al-Badr and his friends. Noman's effort, including a private promise to reach a withdrawal of Egyptian troops, was backed by Nasser. Radio Cairo hailed the Khamir conference as the [...] "dawn of a new era." [...] Sallal called the talks [...] "a complete success", while al-Badr stated that [...] "It is essential that the conflict which has devastated our beloved country be brought to an end by peaceful negotiations between the Yemeni people themselves." [...] However, by early June, when Noman said that Egypt's 50,000 troops would have {{to be replaced by a}} joint royalist-republican [...] peace force, the Nasserites lost interest in the deal. After Noman flew to Cairo to protest directly to Nasser, Sallal threw seven civilian [...] Cabinet ministers into jail. Noman resigned, saying [...] "It is obvious that Sallal and <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> are more interested in war than [...] peace". Sallal soon named a new Cabinet to replace Noman's, with 13 military men and two civilians.|$|E
500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly rated [...] "Irresistible" [...] a B+, {{saying it was}} based on [...] "an unsettling concept to begin with" [...] that was reinforced by [...] "Chinlund's skin-crawling one-man show". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode A, praising the acting, particularly of Chinlund as Pfaster, and describing it as [...] "legitimately scary, a sign of a show that was pushing itself in new and interesting directions". The only criticism was for the scenes where Scully hallucinates Pfaster shapeshifting as [...] "pretty silly, almost feeling like an attempt to make sure something vaguely paranormal is in the episode so the fans don't get bored with what is ultimately a very good episode". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+ grade. Writing for Den of Geek, Nina Sordi ranked [...] "Irresistible" [...] the sixth best X-Files episode, saying that [...] "excluding CSM and <b>his</b> <b>cronies,</b> Pfaster has got to be the most disturbing villain that our favorite agents have encountered". Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named it the [...] "finest" [...] stand-alone episode of the second season, describing it as [...] "a genuinely creepy 45-minute horror movie". Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Pfaster among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, and IGN's Christine Seghers ranked Chinlund the seventh best guest star {{in the history of the}} show, considering that [...] "what makes him all the more frightening is how downright passive and polite he is up until the moment he's going to kill; the perfect camouflage for a modern-day monster." [...] TV Guide listed Pfaster among the [...] scariest X-Files monsters describing him as [...] "evil incarnate".|$|E

2500|$|Hazlitt never mellowed in his {{attitude}} toward Gifford {{as he did}} toward his [...] "apostate" [...] former friends, {{but as a result}} he created a sketch that has come to be recognized as a [...] "masterpiece of invective". Some have thought of Hazlitt as merely [...] "getting even" [...] in this essay. But, increasingly, his treatment of Gifford has come to be seen as understandable as it is accurate, in view of the savage nature of the politically motivated criticism of that age as well as the damage inflicted by Gifford and <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> on Hazlitt and other liberal-minded literary figures. To the critic Walter Jackson Bate, who named the attack on Gifford in the Letter to William Gifford as [...] "one of the half-dozen most sustained pieces of invective in English", the sketch of Gifford in The Spirit of the Age is [...] "even more effective".|$|E

2500|$|Aquino's death {{transformed}} the Philippine opposition {{from a small}} isolated movement to a massive unified crusade, incorporating {{people from all walks}} of life. The middle class got involved, the impoverished majority participated, and business leaders whom Marcos had irked during martial law endorsed the campaign—all with the crucial support of the military and the Catholic Church hierarchy. The assassination showed the increasing incapacity of the Marcos regime—Ferdinand was mortally ill when the crime occurred while <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> mismanaged the country in his absence. It outraged Aquino's supporters that Marcos, if not masterminding it, allowed the assassination to happen and engineered its cover-up. The mass revolt caused by Aquino's demise attracted worldwide media attention and Marcos's American contacts, as well as the Reagan Administration, began distancing themselves. There was a global media spotlight on the Philippine crisis, and exposes on Imelda's extravagant lifestyle (most infamously, her thousands of pairs of shoes) and [...] "mining operations", as well as Ferdinand's excesses, came into focus.|$|E

I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E
