5|$|Tuatara {{were removed}} from Stanley, Red Mercury and Cuvier Islands in 1990 and 1991, and {{maintained}} in captivity to allow Polynesian rats to be eradicated on those islands. All three populations bred in captivity, and after successful eradication of the rats, all individuals, including the new juveniles, were returned to their islands of origin. In the 1991–92 season, Little Barrier Island was found to hold only eight tuatara, which were taken into in situ captivity, where females produced 42eggs, which were incubated at Victoria University. The resulting offspring were subsequently held <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure</b> on the island, then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there.|$|E

25|$|Driver design—including the {{particular}} way {{two or more}} drivers are combined <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure</b> to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of timbre and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments. Adjusting a design to improve performance is done {{using a combination of}} magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an anechoic chamber to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{which are}} {{considered}} too slow moving to be 'free' {{are not included}} in this category, as trapping them doesn't change their legal status of being able to grab them in 'one hand swoop' (a term used by the Rambam to define this law). One is therefore allowed to confine a snail or tortoise, etc. as you can grab them just as easily whether they are <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure</b> or unhindered in the wild. For these purposes trapping them serves no change to their legal status regarding their ease of capture, and they are termed legally pre-trapped due to their nature. Trapping is therefore seen not as a 'removal of liberty', which caging even such a slow moving creature would be, but rather the confining of a creature {{to make it easier to}} capture in one's hand.|$|E

500|$|The {{smallest}} subwoofers {{are typically}} those designed for desktop multimedia systems. [...] The largest common subwoofer enclosures are those used for concert sound reinforcement systems or dance club sound systems. [...] An {{example of a}} large concert subwoofer enclosure is the 1980s-era ElectroVoice MT-4 [...] "Bass Cube" [...] system, which used four 18-inch (45cm) drivers. An example of a subwoofer that uses a bass horn is the Bassmaxx B-Two, which loads an 18-inch (45cm) driver onto an [...] long folded horn. Folded horn-type subwoofers can typically produce a deeper range with greater efficiency than the same driver <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure</b> that lacks a horn. Some experimental fixed-installation subwoofer horns have been constructed using brick and concrete to produce a very long horn that allows a very deep sub-bass extension.|$|E
500|$|Legal, formal hare {{coursing}} {{has a number}} of variations in how it is undertaken. Open coursing takes place in the open field, and closed coursing (or park or Irish style) takes place <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure</b> with an escape route. Open coursing is either run as walked-up coursing, where a line of people walk through the countryside to flush out a hare, or as driven coursing, where hares are driven by beaters towards the coursing field. In each case, when a suitable hare appears, a person known as a slipper uses a slip with two collars to release two dogs at the same time, in pursuit of the hare which is given a head start (known as fair law), usually between [...] (...)

500|$|The {{next major}} {{redevelopment}} occurred in 1928, after Rangers had won their first double. A new Main Stand, {{to the south}} side of the ground, was opened on 1 January 1929. The Main Stand, which has the familiar Leitch style criss-cross balcony and a red-brick facade, seated 10,000 people and provided standing accommodation <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Simon Inglis, a writer on football stadia, commented in 2005 that the Main Stand is Leitch's [...] "greatest work" [...] and is [...] "still resplendent today in its red brick glory under a modern mantle of glass and steel". The architectural significance of the Main Stand was reflected when it became a Category B listed building in 1987. Original seats in the Main Stand were made of cast iron and oak. When one was auctioned in 2011, it raised a sale price of £1,080.|$|E

500|$|Thirty to 45 foals {{are born}} into the Chincoteague herd each year. The annual Pony Pennings are used to {{maintain}} the herd size at around 150 animals. Since 1943, the FWS {{has been working on}} the island to protect and increase the wildfowl population, and their efforts have sometimes endangered the Chincoteague herd. Due to the placement of fences by the FWS, a reduced amount of land is available for grazing by the ponies. The fencing also prevents them from reaching the sea, where they often went to escape biting insects, including mosquitos. [...] In 1962, several ponies were trapped <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure</b> by high water and died when they were carried out to sea during a storm. Unlike the Maryland herd, ponies on the Virginia side of the island are fenced off from roadways to prevent auto accidents and to discourage visitors from feeding the ponies.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{loudspeaker}} systems {{consist of}} drivers mounted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure,</b> or cabinet.

[...] The sound waves emitted from the back are 180° out of phase with those emitted forward, so without an enclosure they [...] typically cause cancellations which significantly degrade the level and quality of sound at low frequencies.|$|E

At the reservation, visitors can observe the Philippine tarsier in its natural habitat, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure,</b> or conduct research at the Philippine Tarsier Research and Development Center.

2500|$|While Farasi {{has been}} [...] "saved" [...] from being Basel-lion food, ironically, he was {{attacked}} by a lion in South Africa. As Farasi was at first too small to defend himself against predators, he was kept in a large enclosure on the reserve. However, in 2011, Farasi broke out of this protected area and was eventually attacked by a lion during a night on land. The wounds were not severe, but a veterinarian was called; Farasi had to be tranquilized and was brought back to safety <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure</b> with an electric fence. According to Sylvia Sussens, of the reserve, Farasi should have been large enough to defend himself by 2012 and {{was scheduled to be}} released into the wild.|$|E

[...] In May Van Gogh wrote to Theo, [...] "Through the iron-barred window I see a square field of wheat <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure,</b> a perspective like Van Goyen, above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory."

[...] On August 9, 1975, Steiger went to investigate the complaints and found a group of 14 burros that had been placed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosure</b> along a highway, until their owner could come to claim them. [...] Entering the enclosure with a [...]30 caliber carbine, the Congressman went to check the animals' brands to determine who owned them. [...] In {{a report to the}} local sheriff, Steiger later claimed the burros charged him and he shot the two lead animals in self-defense. [...] The incident was forwarded to the county attorney's office for consideration before the burros' owner brought a pair of civil suits against Steiger.|$|E
