40|$|Purpose: The {{primary goal}} of this {{introductory}} article is to highlight important contemporary themes in <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy {{from the perspective of}} Sub-Saharan African firms. Design/methodology/approach: The approach adopted is a review and synopsis of the existing body of research on <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> research in Sub-Saharan African, and a discussion of the manuscripts included in the special issue. Findings: <b>International</b> <b>marketing</b> in Sub-Sahara Africa is growing steadily, driven largely by rapid changes in socio-economic and demographic characteristics of consumers in this market. The growing appetite of multinational enterprises to explore new growth opportunities on this continent and the increasing intra-Africa cross-border transactions is driving unique approaches to <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> that are predicated on using non-traditional means to produce, communicate and distribute products and services.

40|$|The Internet has the {{capability}} to generate <b>international</b> <b>market</b> expansion and future growth for firms, a concept known as Internetalisation.

30|$|The Uppsala model {{uses only}} two factors (i.e., market knowledge, market commitment), {{which may be}} {{insufficient}} to explain international expansion (Forsgren 2002). There is a compelling need for a more in-depth investigation of the firm-, retail-, and market-specific antecedents that may influence the <b>international</b> <b>market</b> involvement of SME apparel retailers. This study posits that the Uppsala model can better explain current <b>international</b> <b>market</b> involvement by incorporating antecedents related to SME apparel retail firms and current domestic apparel markets. In this study, firm age, product uniqueness, and domestic growth opportunity are selected as key influences. Firm age can affect <b>international</b> <b>market</b> involvement (Chen and Sternquist 1995). Unlike manufacturing firms, apparel retailers differentiate themselves largely through intangible assets (Quinn and Doherty 2000); thus, their <b>international</b> <b>market</b> involvement may depend on the product’s being sufficiently unique. Another antecedent, firms’ perceived domestic growth opportunities, can influence their <b>international</b> <b>market</b> involvement because firms that perceive limited domestic growth {{are more likely to}} expand into <b>international</b> <b>markets</b> (Lopez and Fan 2009).|$|R

This paper aims to identify factors that influence internationalmarket selection and to develop an <b>international</b> <b>market</b> selection model for construction firms. The market entry choices of 39 large international Chinese contractors across 87 countries were investigated through logistic regression analysis. The results indicate that international contractors prefer to enter countries with large market potential, small culture distance, and, surprisingly, high country risk and high competitive intensity. Moreover, large, experienced contractors are more willing to compete in <b>international</b> <b>markets.</b> Contrary to generally accepted belief, geographic distance is not revealed to have any significant influence on <b>international</b> <b>market</b> selections by Chinese contractors.

50|$|Global {{marketing}} {{is not a}} revolutionary shift, it is an evolutionary process. While the following {{does not apply to}} all companies, it does apply to most companies that begin as domestic-only companies. <b>International</b> <b>marketing</b> has intensified and is evident for approximately nearly all aspects of consumer’s daily life. Local regions or national boundaries no longer restricted to the competitive forces. To be successful in today's globalized economy, it is a must for the companies to simultaneously be responsive to local as well as global market conditions and varying aspect’s related to the <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> process. Hence, <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> skills are an important ingredient for every company, {{whether or not it is}} currently involved in exporting the activities for the endorsement of the brand or the company. The internationalized marketplace has been transformed very quickly in recent years by shifts in trading techniques, standards and practices. These changes have been reinforced and retained by new technologies and evolving the economic relationships between the companies and the organizations which are working for the trade across the globe. This assignment project work is just an attempt to get integrate these developments and attempts in the field of the market journalism into the burgeoning literature on <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> process as well as on recent research findings on the <b>International</b> <b>marketing.</b> The research emphasis within the subject has evolved alongside changes in the stress given to key aspects of <b>international</b> trade <b>market.</b> The pre-occupation of early researchers with exports and selling is being replaced by a more balanced view which gives increasing weight to other aspects of <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> such as licensing, joint ventures, and overseas subsidiaries. In effect, the traditional ethnocentric conceptual view of <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> trade is being counterbalanced by a more accurate global view of markets. This process of change is tracked in this paper and the growing importance of a strategic and organizational approach to <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> is emphasized in this article theory. Focused attention is paid to the heterogeneous nature of <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> process.

Analysis of micro data present that contrasting evolutionary patterns in gender wage gap emerged over the period, showing a widened wage gap in China but a dramatically reduced gap in India. In both countries, female workers’ increased skill levels contributed to reducing the gender wage gap. However, increases in observed prices of education and experience worked unfavorably for high-skilled women, counterbalancing their improvement in labor <b>market</b> <b>qualifications.</b> Decomposition analyses show that China’s widened gap was attributable to gender-specific factors such as deteriorated observable and unobservable labor <b>market</b> <b>qualifications</b> and increased discrimination, especially against low- and middle-skilled female workers.
