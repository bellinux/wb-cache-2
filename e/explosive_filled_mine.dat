50|$|Cut and <b>fill</b> <b>mining</b> is {{a method}} of short-hole mining used in steeply dipping or {{irregular}} ore zones, in particular where the hanging wall limits the use of long-hole methods. The ore is mined in horizontal or slightly inclined slices, and then filled with waste rock, sand or tailings. Either fill option may be consolidated with concrete, or left unconsolidated.

The normal process for steaming, by remote control was deemed too risky.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Valley <b>fill</b> <b>mining</b> has the {{potential}} to alter headwater stream habitat in many areas in the eastern United States. In valley <b>fill</b> <b>mining,</b> overburden is removed to expose underlying coal seams. The overburden is then deposited in the adjacent valley. The deposited overburden from mining increases sedimentation, increases stream conductivity, and alters hydrologic regimes downstream of the fill. Changes in downstream communities are not well documented. However, it was suspected the increased sedimentation and conductivity would have deleterious effects upon the downstream macroinvertebrate communities. In southern West Virginia, four pairs of streams, each consisting of a fill and a reference stream, were selected as representative of watersheds experiencing valley <b>fill</b> <b>mining.</b> Stream pairs were selected for similar environmental conditions, with one stream having a valley fill in its headwaters. Each stream was sampled by replicate Surber samples (N = 9 per stream). Water chemistry and sediment measurements also were taken at each location. Valley fill streams had significantly higher specific conductance (p< 0. 01), but did no...|$|R
