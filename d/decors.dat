Both Anna and Elsa appear as playable characters in Disney Infinity through the use of their corresponding figurines.|$|E

During his tenure (1897–1907), Mahler cultivated a new generation of singers, such as Anna Bahr-Mildenburg and Selma Kurz, and recruited a stage designer who replaced the lavish historical stage <b>decors</b> with sparse stage scenery corresponding to modernistic, Jugendstil tastes. Mahler also introduced the practice of dimming the lighting in the theatre during performances, which was initially not appreciated by the audience.

25|$|Although {{the dances}} of the {{ballerina}} Preobrajenska {{were a great}} success, the first performance was not. The editor-publisher of the Saint Petersburg Gazette, Sergei Khudekov, himself a ballet expert and noted for co-authoring the librettos for several ballets staged at the Mariinsky, {{was one of several}} critics who complained that the Ivanov/Gerdt choreography was of poor quality, and that the libretto was extremely slight. Another element that contributed to the ballet's failure {{was the fact that the}} direction did not allow any new <b>décors</b> to be created, and instead sets were utilized from works that were no longer being performed. After only five performances Sylvia was taken out of the company's repertory. In spite of this, excerpts from the ballet were included in gala events.|$|E

25|$|The Mariinsky Theatre's {{production}} was originally {{planned for the}} 1900–1901 season in a staging supervised by Sergei Diaghilev, with <b>décors</b> and costumes designed by Alexandre Benois and choreography by the brothers Sergei and Nikolai Legat. But differences between Diaghilev {{and the director of}} the Imperial Theatres, Prince Volkonsky, led to the project's cancellation as well as the end of Diaghilev's association with the Imperial Theatres, an event that led Diaghilev to eventually form the original Ballets Russes in 1909. Nevertheless, the ballet was re-scheduled for the 1901–1902 season in a version mounted by the Imperial Theatre's Deuxieme Maître de Ballet Lev Ivanov, whose death in December 1901 caused the direction to hand the project over to the noted Premier danseur Pavel Gerdt. Perhaps Ivanov's most lasting contribution to the ballet's history was the change of title from Sylvia, ou la nymphe de Diane to simply Sylvia.|$|E

Of the filming arrangements, Warren comments: [...] "This really was quite a unique situation because ... here we were in a studio looking at a real house and real rooms as if shooting on location." [...] The crew were permitted to redecorate the rooms as necessary and, to this end, make use of any of the items in the studios' prop store. Warren states that this resulted in a [...] "crazy" [...] mixture of <b>decors</b> that [...] "certainly helped create the right atmosphere" [...] for the film.|$|E

Abel Gance called it [...] "superb" [...] and wrote, [...] "What a lesson to all directors!" [...] and René Clair said [...] "overthrew the realist dogma" [...] of filmmaking. Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm: [...] "At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate. Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning, the pace leaps forward, agitato, accelerando, and leaves off only at the word 'End', as abruptly as {{a slap in the}} face." [...] Jean Epstein, however, called it [...] "a prize example of the abuse of décor in the cinema" [...] and said it [...] "represents a grave sickness of cinema". Likewise, Jean Cocteau called it [...] "the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric <b>decors,</b> instead of obtaining surprise by means of the camera". [...] French critic Frédéric-Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film: [...] "It has the odor of tainted food. It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth." [...] The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein especially disliked Caligari, calling it a [...] "combination of silent hysteria, partially coloured canvases, daubed flats, painted faces, and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras".|$|E
