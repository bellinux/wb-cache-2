5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage into reality. Early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a high-pressure steam engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high-pressure and the elimination of the condenser—a central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four steam valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E

25|$|Up to that time, British iron {{manufacturers}} {{had used}} considerable amounts of imported iron to supplement native supplies. This came principally from Sweden from the mid-17th century and later also from Russia {{from the end}} of the 1720s. However, from 1785, imports decreased because of the new <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> technology, and Britain became an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured wrought iron consumer goods.|$|E
25|$|The major {{disadvantage}} {{of the process}} {{is that it can}} only be used with lower melting temperature non-ferrous materials, such as aluminium, copper, magnesium, and zinc. The most commonly used materials are aluminium and copper. The maximum working temperature of plaster is , so higher melting temperature materials would melt the plaster mold. Also, the sulfur in the gypsum reacts with <b>iron,</b> <b>making</b> it unsuitable for casting ferrous materials.|$|E

Other industries would be established during this period, such as shipbuilding, lumber, paper and furniture making. These small-scale shops and factories often utilized the State's many rivers and streams to power their machinery.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{milestone in}} the establishment of Black Country industry came when John Wilkinson set up an iron works at Bradley near Bilston. In 1757 he started making iron there by coke-smelting rather than using charcoal. His example was followed by others and <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> spread rapidly across the Black Country. Another important development of the 18th century was the construction of canals to link the Black Country mines industries {{to the rest of the}} country. Between 1768 and 1772 a canal was constructed by James Brindley starting in Birmingham through the heart of the Black Country and eventually leading to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal.|$|E
25|$|The Thomas Iron Company {{was a major}} {{iron-making}} firm in the Lehigh Valley {{from its}} organization in 1854 until its decline and eventual dismantling in the early 20th century. The firm was {{named in honor of}} its founder, David Thomas, who had emigrated to the United States in 1839 to introduce hot blast <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> in the Lehigh Valley, and now embarked on an independent ironmaking venture. The company's main and original plant was in Hokendauqua, Pennsylvania, which grew up around it; it also came to own blast furnaces and railroads elsewhere in the Lehigh Valley and mines in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Changes in the iron industry in the early Twentieth Century left Thomas Iron struggling to compete, and after a failed attempt at modernization and revival from 1913 to 1916, the company's assets were sold and largely dismantled during the 1920s.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{efficiency}} of blast furnaces is constantly evolving, the chemical process inside the blast furnace remains the same. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute: [...] "Blast furnaces will survive into the next millennium because the larger, efficient furnaces can produce hot metal at costs competitive with other <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> technologies." [...] One of the biggest drawbacks of the blast furnaces is the inevitable carbon dioxide production as iron is reduced from iron oxides by carbon and as of 2016, there is no economical substitute – steelmaking {{is one of the}} largest industrial contributors of the CO2 emissions in the world (see greenhouse gases).|$|E

500|$|The <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> {{blast furnace}} itself is {{built in the}} form of a tall structure, lined with {{refractory}} brick, and profiled to allow for expansion of the charged materials as they heat during their descent, and subsequent reduction in size as melting starts to occur. Coke, limestone flux, and iron ore (iron oxide) are charged into the top of the furnace in a precise filling order which helps control gas flow and the chemical reactions inside the furnace. Four [...] "uptakes" [...] allow the hot, dirty gas high in carbon monoxide content to exit the furnace throat, while [...] "bleeder valves" [...] protect the top of the furnace from sudden gas pressure surges. The coarse particles in the exhaust gas settle in the [...] "dust catcher" [...] and are dumped into a railroad car or truck for disposal, while the gas itself flows through a venturi scrubber and/or electrostatic precipitators and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the cleaned gas.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>making</b> – the {{substitution}} of coke for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost for pig iron and wrought iron production. [...] Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces, resulting in economies of scale. [...] The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760. [...] It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher blast furnace temperatures. [...] The puddling process produced a structural grade iron {{at a lower cost}} than the finery forge. [...] The rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. Hot blast (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.|$|E
2500|$|Because iron from plant {{sources is}} less easily absorbed than the heme-bound iron of animal sources, vegetarians and vegans {{should have a}} {{somewhat}} higher total daily iron intake than those who eat meat, fish or poultry. Legumes and dark-green leafy vegetables like broccoli, kale and oriental greens are especially good sources of iron for vegetarians and vegans. However, spinach and Swiss chard contain oxalates which bind <b>iron,</b> <b>making</b> it almost entirely unavailable for absorption. Iron from non-heme sources is more readily absorbed if consumed with foods that contain either heme-bound iron or vitamin C. This {{is due to a}} hypothesised [...] "meat factor" [...] which enhances iron absorption.|$|E

Usually, wine was made from grapes for everyday use, as well as for rituals, such as sacrificial libations. Less often, wine was made from pomegranates and dates.|$|E
2500|$|While {{working at}} Lee Hall in Bellingham, Northumberland, his son Francis devised {{a means of}} making iron with mineral coal, which he {{patented}} in 1727. [...] In 1723, Thomas Baylies on behalf of Wood had agreed an iron ore mining lease in Frizington Parks, near Whitehaven. [...] in May 1728, he sought to exploit the patent for <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> processes invented by his son Francis, which He re-patented himself. [...] He financed this by contracting to supply a large quantity of iron to the United Company of Mines Royal and Mineral and Battery Works, who advanced money (or rather saleable shares) with which Wood erected works on Frizington Moor. [...] The works were 375 feet long and 36 feet wide, with 11 furnaces, three horsemill-powered forges and engines for grinding coal and iron ore.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963 Robert Forward, a {{physicist}} and aerospace engineer at Hughes Research Laboratories, published a paper showing how {{within the framework}} of general relativity [...] "anti-gravitational" [...] effects might be achieved. Since all atoms have spin, gravitational permeability may be able to differ from material to material. A strong toroidal gravitational field that acts against the force of gravity could be generated by materials that have nonlinear properties that enhance time-varying gravitational fields. Such an effect would be analogous to the nonlinear electromagnetic permeability of <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> it an effective core (i.e. the doughnut of iron) in a transformer, whose properties are dependent on magnetic permeability. In 1966 Dewitt was first to identify the significance of gravitational effects in superconductors. Dewitt demonstrated that a magnetic-type gravitational field must result in the presence of fluxoid quantization. In 1983, Dewitt's work was substantially expanded by Ross.|$|E
