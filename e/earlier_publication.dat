25|$|The Communist {{began on}} 5 August 1920, {{just four days}} after the {{completion}} of the conference (the Congress of London) which founded the CPGB. The publication continued without interruption until its 131st issue, dated 3 February 1923. The paper was in many ways a direct continuation of The Call, retaining the same look and style, the same editor, and even continuing the serialization of articles begun in the <b>earlier</b> <b>publication.</b>|$|E
25|$|Il Lavoratore (The Worker) (June 1924 – September 1931) — In 1924, the Workers Party of America's press nexus {{moved from}} New York City to Chicago. The New York Italian-language weekly L'Alba Nuova was supplanted {{by a new}} Chicago daily at this time, Il Lavoratore, edited by Antonio Presi of that <b>earlier</b> <b>publication.</b> This Chicago phase proved to be brief, however, as in 1925 Il Lavoratore was moved back to New York and made a weekly, with G. Cannata at the {{editorial}} desk. The paper strove to build a united front against the fascist Mussolini government in Italy and covered trade union activities from a radical rank-and-file perspective. The publication's claimed circulation in 1925 was 12,500.|$|E
500|$|In late 1751, {{just before}} the {{publication}} of his novel, Amelia, Fielding began plotting his next literary work. He expressed a desire to use a periodical to promote the Universal Register Office – a business which connected service providers with consumers – and his other activities and views. Alluding to the <b>earlier</b> <b>publication,</b> he gave it the title The Covent-Garden Journal, and announced in The Daily Advertiser that the first number would be issued on 23 November 1751. The release was delayed until January because of work related to the publication of Amelia.|$|E

It published studio photographs of actresses as well as aristocrats, including many in the former group who married into the nobility. The British Royal Family was a frequent subject; one of the magazine's first issues included an article and photographs about the Princess of Wales' childhood, and the publication regularly reported on the movements of Queen Victoria's family.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{different}} types of E. coli, {{some of which are}} found in humans and are harmless. [...] Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a type found to cause illness in humans, possessing gene that allows it to manufacture a substance toxic to humans. Cattle are immune to its effects but when people eat food contaminated with cattle feces, the organism can cause disease. Reports of pathogenic E. coli appear in medical literature as early as 1947. [...] Publications regarding variants of E. coli which cause disease appeared regularly in medical journals throughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, with fatalities being reported in humans and infants starting in the 1970s. Despite the earlier reports, pathogenic E. coli did not rise to public prominence until 1983, when a Center for Disease Control researcher published a paper identifying ETEC as the cause of a series of outbreaks of unexplained hemorrhagic gastrointestinal illness. [...] Despite the <b>earlier</b> <b>publication</b> of pathogenic variants of E. coli, researchers encountered significant difficulties in establishing ETEC as a pathogen.|$|E
