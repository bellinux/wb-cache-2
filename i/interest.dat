5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} <b>interest</b> is also presented. Cantillon believed that <b>interest</b> originates {{from the need}} of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, <b>interest</b> is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of <b>interest</b> varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of <b>interest</b> was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of <b>interest,</b> new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory of <b>interest</b> is therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} <b>interest</b> in recent {{developments}} in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received scant attention in the United Kingdom. This <b>interest,</b> along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who heard a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed <b>interest</b> in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an <b>interest</b> in Sorabji's music.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the <b>interest</b> is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable <b>interest.</b> It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original <b>interest,</b> but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E

5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government <b>interest.</b> In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling <b>interest.</b> Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government <b>interest.</b> Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government <b>interest.</b>|$|E

The discovery of nuclear fission in uranium-235 led to an <b>interest</b> in separating this isotope. He proposed using a Holweck pump to produce the vacuum necessary for this work, and enlisted George B. Kistiakowsky and E. Bright Wilson to help.

40|$|Conflicts of <b>interests</b> arise due to {{the fact}} that a person’s right to demand to act in his <b>interests</b> imposes a duty on another person to act in such a way. Different {{concepts}} of conflict of <b>interests</b> used in various sectors and their problems are analyzed in the article. Whereas there is no unified concept of conflict of <b>interests</b> used in practice it is unclear which types of relations are regarded as conflict of <b>interests,</b> when conflict of <b>interests</b> arises and what are the solutions to it. Due to these reasons universal concept of conflict of <b>interests</b> is constructed and elements of conflict of <b>interests</b> are analyzed in this article. The concept of conflict of <b>interests</b> is discussed in the context of agency theory in the broad sense, i. e. in the legal and economic sense. Theoretical model and types of conflicts of <b>interests</b> are particularly important while trying to solve conflicts of <b>interests.</b> There are two main categories of solutions: preventive and managing measures. Preventive measures are intended to avoid conflict of <b>interests</b> before it arises and managing measures are intended to manage already risen conflict of <b>interests</b> and to prevent negative consequences. The article concludes with the concept of conflict of <b>interests,</b> its types and solutions...|$|R

5|$|Covered <b>interest</b> rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic <b>interest</b> rate, and the foreign <b>interest</b> rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available <b>interest</b> rates.|$|E

5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered <b>interest</b> rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered <b>interest</b> rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered <b>interest</b> rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered <b>interest</b> rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real <b>interest</b> rate parity, which suggests that expected real <b>interest</b> rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E

From that dictionary, we extracted only the subjects that indicate <b>interests</b> such as Art, Camping, Cooking, Computer and Technology, Election and Politics, and Sports. The user tweets are analyzed for the words connected to the <b>interests</b> and subsequently, the highest five <b>interests</b> are determined.
