30|$|MRI arthrograms have {{a limited}} role in {{evaluating}} instability. This modality enables the surgeon to confirm capsulolabral pathology and evaluate for other soft-tissue injury, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>SLAP</b> or rotator cuff tear. Though not as accurate as CT imaging for bony defects, MRI arthrograms are still a better predictor of lesions than standard radiographs.|$|R

Aguilar came to Washington <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> hitter, but Husky coach, Heather Tarr, {{decided that she}} should swing away.

5000|$|Listed at [...] and 175 lb, Kawasaki is best {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> hitter, utilizing his exceptional bat control and speed {{to get on}} base (often bunting safely to do so). However, he is somewhat lacking in power, even for a middle infielder, having never hit more than four home runs (2004, 2005, 2007) or recorded more than 31 extra-base hits (2004, 2006) for a season.|$|R

As shown by this lightness in a heavy environment the Masters are, physically, extremely strong, able to easily lift a human male with just one of their three tentacles. Their skin is described as being damp, reptilian and leathery, thus very resilient to attack.|$|R
5000|$|In particular, the {{resolution}} was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> {{in the face}} to Quebec, where it was widely viewed as racist. (One Environment Canada meteorologist sent out a weather report for Sault Ste. Marie in which the forecast called for [...] "a chance of flurries and Nazis", leading to her suspension.) Council defended {{the resolution}}, suggesting that Quebec's language laws and its refusal to abide by the Supreme Court ruling also constituted racism.|$|R
50|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of the shoulder due to potential bicep tendonitis or a tear of the labrum otherwise known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>SLAP</b> tear. The long head of the bicep passes through the shoulder joint and attaches to the labrum. During a biceps tenodesis procedure, the surgeon cuts the attachment of the biceps tendon from the labrum and reattaches it to the humerus bone by tacks. By doing this, pressure is relieved from the labrum significantly reducing pain. This surgery is performed to alleviate bicep inflammation and can be implemented in correspondence to <b>a</b> <b>SLAP</b> lesion surgery. Recovery is approximately 4 - 8 months depending on the individual and requires physical therapy.|$|R

So, Jorge Figueroa determined in his work a new property for the female figure humanist, contributing to modern humanism new meaning in a social environment characterized by the repeated use of images.|$|R
50|$|Colloquially, {{situations}} wherein some criminals receive lighter criminal sentences or {{are held}} to a lesser standard of personal accountability is referred to <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> on the wrist. The verbified form of such unequal treatment may be termed wrist slap, and alternative forms such as wristslap and wrist-slap. As an adjective, such a justice system may be described as being two-tiered or hybrid, both usually with negative connotations. Lawyers who uphold such unfair principles within the legal system are sometimes designated with pejorative terms such as double standardist.|$|R

But then he knew quite well that Lilly had made a certain call on his, Aaron's soul: a call which he, Aaron, did not at all intend to obey. If in return the soul-caller chose to shut his street-door {{in the face of}} the world-friend--well, let it be quits. He was not sure whether he felt {{superior}} to his unworldly enemy or not.

50|$|Internal sensors allow Actroid {{models to}} react {{with a natural}} {{appearance}} by way of air actuators placed at many points of articulation in the upper body. Early models had 42 points of articulation, later models have 47. So far, movement in the lower body is limited. The operation of the robot's sensory system in tandem with its air powered movements make it quick enough to react to or fend off intrusive motions, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> or <b>a</b> poke. Artificial intelligence gives it the ability to react {{in a different way}} to more gentle kinds of touch, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pat on the arm.|$|R
50|$|An early {{retirement}} again disrupted the Mons headquarters in 2000 as General Wesley Clark was shunted aside {{in favor of}} Air Force general Joseph Ralston. Although the move was publicly characterized <b>as</b> <b>a</b> purely administrative move necessitated by Clark's approaching retirement {{and the lack of}} an open four-star slot for the highly respected Ralston reality which would have compelled him to either accept a temporary demotion to two-star rank or retire from the service, Clark's relief has been often seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> at the general {{on the part of a}} Pentagon leadership that had been very much at odds with him during the Kosovo war the previous spring.|$|R
5000|$|Waner {{broke into}} the major leagues with the Pirates in 1927 and quickly built his {{reputation}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> hitter with <b>an</b> astute sense of plate discipline. In his rookie campaign, he batted [...]355 with 223 hits while only striking out 23 times (the highest strikeout total of his career). As the leadoff hitter of the powerful Pittsburgh offense, he led the National League (NL) with 133 runs scored. The runs scored mark set an MLB rookie record. Al LÃ³pez said that infielders of the era played deep at their positions, but Waner made them play closer to compensate for his speed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> runner.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{incident}} occurred in December 4, 2004, when 31-year-old U.S. Marine Staff Sergeant Christopher Van Goethem serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Marine Security Guard at the U.S. embassy in Bucharest, Romania, while driving his Ford Expedition, lethally {{collided with a}} taxi carrying Romanian singer Teo Peter. Van Goethem departed Romania {{within a few hours}} after the accident, under the terms of his diplomatic immunity, before local investigators had the opportunity to question him and conduct tests on his blood alcohol level but many Romanians viewed his abrupt departure <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> in the face and an effort to shield the Marine from justice. The Marine was later cleared by a court martial of negligent homicide.|$|R
5000|$|... 1998 was a {{particularly}} troublesome year for Krem: first, their on-site tower on Partridge Street was vandalized and nearly torn down, then sitting Minister Hubert Elrington denied the station a license {{for a few months}} after their current one expired. KREM was seen as being too friendly with the then Opposition PUP, and Hyde son Cordel was due to run against Elrington in a City division (he would win). Plus, sponsorship for semi-pro basketball had dried up because of the UDP's anti-Krem campaign and the dominance of the Raiders (four championships and one runner-up in six years), and the UDP-orchestrated 1998 Caricom Men's Basketball Tournament, which Belize won, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> to the face of semi-pro.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (<b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> in the face for Quebecers of French ancestry and <b>as</b> <b>an</b> insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|R

5000|$|This type of gate {{has many}} {{different}} local names throughout the world, sometimes hinting at its rough-and-ready nature and cheap construction. The term [...] "Hampshire gate" [...] {{is widely used}} in Britain (both in Hampshire and elsewhere) [...] - [...] the names of other counties are occasionally substituted, or more often that of New Zealand.

In the United States it is simply called a wire gate. Though {{the origins of the}} gate are obscure, the name Taranaki Gate is believed to reflect the location of its first widespread use; it may well have been invented independently in several places.|$|R
40|$|The {{infusion}} of market and business management principles {{into the public}} sector has impeded the behaviour of public service motivated employees who are motivated by intrinsic motives. Besides, the {{infusion of}} such principles caused great threats to basic values of the civil service, like equity, fairness, justice, accountability, impartiality, public welfare and other values related to the public sector. From here, public service motivation (PSM) <b>emanates</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reaction against these principles/techniques in the civil service. Public management scholars have studied PSM from different angles and perspectives; however, no one has studied the effects of socio-cultural factors on PSM. This study will fill this gap in PSM literature by studying how socio-cultural factors impede/block {{the development of this}} construct with lessons learnt from the Lebanese civil service...|$|R

The lyrics are {{par for the}} course on this lineup of overwhelmingly melancholy compositions. Still, it's well-executed music, and it's an ideal soundtrack for life's moodier moments." [...] Jon Dolan of the magazine Entertainment Weekly found the song to be a [...] "bruising breakup lament that turns into an anthem of freedom." [...] Giving the song a negative review, Alex Nun of musicOMH wrote that [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] was [...] "a turgid attempt to recapture past glories, the heard-before riffs and shockingly average vocals act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> from the proverbial wet fish."

5000|$|Five {{years after}} The Baseball Network dissolved, NBC Sports play-by-play {{announcer}} Bob Costas {{wrote in his}} book Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball that The Baseball Network was [...] "stupid and an abomination." [...] Costas further wrote that the agreement involving the World Series being the only instance of The Baseball Network broadcasting a nationally televised game was an unprecedented surrender of prestige, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> to all serious fans. He believed that The Baseball Network fundamentally corrupted the game and acknowledged that the most impassioned fans in baseball were now prevented from watching many of the playoff games {{that they wanted to}} see, as all playoff games had been broadcast nationally for decades. Costas added that both the divisional series and the League Championship Series now merited scarcely higher priority than regional coverage provided for a Big Ten football game between Wisconsin and Michigan.|$|R

5000|$|However, in January 1955, Aladdin Records, {{which had}} Wilson on {{contract}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> solo artist, claimed {{ownership of the}} team of Gene & Eunice, and had them record another version of the song with Johnny Otiss band (billed as Johnnys Comboâperhaps <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> at Combo Records) (Aladdin 3276). [...] While the songwriting was credited to Wilson, Porter and Levy, Aladdin also claimed the publishing rights, which Porter {{had only a few}} weeks earlier sold to the E.H.

Aladdin released the re-cut version on January 17, 1955. Aladdin, a much larger independent label than Combo, ran an ad in Billboard announcing: [...] "Dont Be Fooled!

40|$|Reluctance {{to change}} therapy has {{clinical}} and economic implications. Therapists {{are expected to}} deliver treatment in a oneto- one setting ending up with patient improvement. Such an achievement is difficult to overview. There is great uncertainty as to what works in psychotherapies despite research efforts. Prolonged treatment duration with little positive effect {{may be caused by}} factors inherent in therapist and patient and the external environment. Two cases are discussed illustrating the need for better surveillance of what happens in the therapy room. Responsibility for the progress in therapy rests on the shoulders of the therapist. When therapy becomes detrimental to patient and therapist, {{we do not have a}} comprehensive system to interfere or help. Delayed recovery <b>emanates</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> increase in costs to society and the family. This is the case when return to work after treatment is partly or completely retarded...|$|R

While Kelly was no doubt enraged by this he was probably more embarrassed then anything else, the other Baltimore bosses saw this as weakness believing Kelly had no real control over his candidate as he had often claimed. So in a last-minute decision on election day [...] "Boss" [...] Kelly, switched his support from his former friend Harry Nice to Albert Ritchie and swung just enough votes Ritchie's way {{to give him the}} narrowest margin of victory in Maryland history. Out of nearly 225,000 votes, Ritchie won with a mere 165 votes to spare, defeating Republican challenger Harry W. Nice 112,240 to 112,075.

50|$|In 1885, President Grover Cleveland {{appointed}} Durham First Comptroller of the Treasury of the United States; {{he served}} from March 20, 1885 until {{the office was}} discontinued on April 22, 1889. During his tenure, he sparked a minor controversy between himself and Governor J. Proctor Knott when, in a private letter to a friend, he suggested that Kentucky needed a financier in the governor's office. The letter {{went on to say}} that, while Durham had no plans to actively seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1887, he would consider running if the nomination were offered him, provided that President Cleveland approved of his resignation to seek the office. The courier who delivered the letter also shared it with a newspaper editor who subsequently published it. Governor Knott took the letter <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> at his financial acumen. A noted satirist from his time in Congress, Knott responded with a biting letter in the local newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|Augustine, however, {{does not}} {{understand}} how to turn such a weapon against her husband. She hangs the portrait in her bedroom and dresses herself exactly as she appears in it, believing that ThÃ©odore will see her once again as the young woman {{he fell in love}} with at the sign of the Cat and Racket. But when the artist sees the portrait hanging in her bedroom and asks how it came to be there, she foolishly reveals that it was returned to her by the Duchesse de Carigliano. [...] "You demanded it from her?" [...] he asks. [...] "I did not know that she had it", replies Augustine. ThÃ©odore realizes that his wife is incapable of seeing the painting as he sees it - a consummate work of art. Instead of falling in love with its subject, he regards its return <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> in the face from his mistress. His vanity wounded, he throws a fit and destroys the portrait, vowing vengeance upon the duchess.|$|R
