[...] He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like." [...] "I just want to be known as a clown", he said, [...] "because to me that's the height of my profession. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> can do everything—sing, dance and above all, make people laugh." [...] His purpose in life, he believed, was to make people laugh.|$|E

[...] "You know, what does it mean? <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be.

5000|$|Abiad has {{commented on}} the {{challenge}} Muslims face at integrating and finding acceptance in Australia, stating that areas like Adelaide are quite different to Sydney. [...] "The first Australian mosque was built in Adelaide and I think there's a level of acceptance and tolerance in the community." [...] "In Sydney are specific areas like Bankstown and Lakemba. This {{is a problem for}} me. You need to integrate and be involved in your community. Integration doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> assimilate. <b>It</b> doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> forget your identity. <b>It</b> doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> forget your culture. <b>It</b> just <b>means</b> <b>you</b> are able to communicate your culture with people and put that in the melting pot." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{a review}} for The New York Times, art critic Holland Cotter wrote, [...] "The {{extremely}} complex narrative, with uplift and tragedy seemingly {{on a fixed}} collision course, spreads over five floors of galleries", and that it [...] "holds some {{of the oldest and}} most disturbing material." [...] Cotter added that [...] "It's great that the museum mixes everything together: <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> can't just select a comfortable version of history." [...] He concluded, [...] " [...] hope, actually — that the museum will never be finished, or consider itself so; that its take on African-American history, which is American history, stays fluid, critical and richly confused: real, in other words." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some BBC staff {{felt that}} too much blame had been placed on their {{organisation}} {{in the wake of}} the David Kelly affair in the Hutton Report, and that the government was interfering in the BBC. Tim Gospill, spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said [...] "Being independent doesn't just mean not having the government telling you what to do. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> can criticise the government as well. I'm not at all sure the government understands that." [...] Groups of staff staged walk outs from Broadcasting House and other BBC offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and Londonderry, in protest at Dyke's resignation. In addition, on 31 January 2004, BBC staff paid for a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph to express their [...] "dismay" [...] over Dyke's departure. The fundraisers hoped to raise £10,000, a lot less than the market rate for a full page advert in a broadsheet newspaper. Reportedly they raised less than this amount, but were offered a deal by the Telegraph's advertising department which allowed the advert to be printed. It was signed by around 4,000 BBC employees; 10,000 (around a third of total BBC staff at the time) submitted their names for publication, but there was not sufficient space to include them all.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E
2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{sat down}} to the little hired cottage piano that {{occupied}} {{the corner of the}} neat small room, and began to run his deft fingers lightly over the keys. It was the Butterfly fantasia. The father sat back in his red easy-chair, listening with all his ears, first critically, then admiringly, at last enthusiastically. As Arthur's closing notes died away softly towards the end, the old shoemaker's delight could be restrained no longer. 'Artie,' he cried, gloating over it, 'that's music! That's real music! You're quite right, my boy; that's far and away the best thing you've ever written. It's exquisite--so light, so airy, so unearthlike. But, Artie, there's more than that in it. There's soul in it; and I know what <b>it</b> <b>means.</b> <b>You</b> don't deceive your poor old Progenitor in a matter of musical inspiration, I can tell you.

And the thing it says to me as plain as language is just this--you're in love! You're in love, Artie, and there's no good denying it.
