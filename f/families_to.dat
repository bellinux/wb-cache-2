5|$|After renovations were {{finished}} in 2005, {{the number of}} two- and three-bedroom units was increased dramatically, due to {{the combination of the}} building's original studio apartments. The larger layouts attracted more <b>families</b> <b>to</b> the cooperative community. In recent years the lobby has been restored, hallways remodeled, and amenities increased, including larger storage areas, a bike room, and an improved laundry facility. The building is now said to be luxurious as measured both by residents' quality of living and by the purchase prices they pay.|$|E
5|$|Although cottage industries, both in boyar and peasant households, {{were still}} {{the main source}} of clothing, food and construction, {{specialized}} production, such as weaving and pottery, started to develop {{by the middle of the}} 15thcentury. The first oil wells went into production in 1440, but their oil was also only for household use. In Moldavia, Gypsy slaves were first mentioned in 1428 when Alexander I awarded 31 Gypsy <b>families</b> <b>to</b> the Bistriţa Monastery. In time Gypsies became specialized in several crafts: for example, throughout the Middle Ages the working of iron was an occupation reserved almost exclusively for them.|$|E

Some plastic chairs, pails and mini-tubs kindly donated by visitors are stored at {{the perimeter of the}} compound, which has a makeshift shed in one corner. A caretaker, paid by Mindef, takes care of the place to ensure its overall cleanliness, but there is no toilet on location.

40|$|This study {{examined}} gender differences among profiles based on life role importance on work-family conflict. The {{sample consisted of}} 404 Indonesia working couples with children. We found four profiles based on their work and family role importance that is a Family, Work, Dual and a Low profile. More men than women belonged to the Work profile and Low profile; {{more women than men}} belonged <b>to</b> the <b>Family</b> profile. There was no difference between men and women in Dual profile. There were differences among the four profiles on Work <b>to</b> <b>Family</b> and <b>Family</b> <b>to</b> Work conflicts.

Men in the Low profile group experienced the most Work <b>to</b> <b>Family</b> and <b>Family</b> <b>to</b> Work conflicts. There were no differences in Work <b>to</b> <b>Family</b> conflict among women in the four profile groups. Women in the Dual profile experienced the least <b>Family</b> <b>to</b> Work conflicts. Women in the Low profile experienced the most <b>Family</b> <b>to</b> Work conflicts. Limitations and future research are discussed in the light of these findings...|$|R

5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and <b>families</b> <b>to</b> live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), {{emperors}} chose their consorts {{primarily from}} one of the eight Banner families, administrative divisions that divide all native Manchu <b>families.</b> <b>To</b> maintain the ethnic purity of the ruling dynasty, after the Kangxi Period (1662–1722), emperors and princes were forbidden to marry non-Manchu wives. Imperial daughters however were not covered by this ban, and as with their preceding dynasties, were often married to Mongol princes to gain political or military support, especially {{in the early years of}} the Qing dynasty; three of the nine daughters of Emperor Nurhaci and twelve of Emperor Hongtaiji's daughters were married to Mongol Princes.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms {{were built}} in Valletta {{to serve as the}} war {{headquarters}} for the defence of Malta.

Many of the shelters still exist, and a few are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Following birth it was common, {{particularly}} among richer <b>families,</b> <b>to</b> employ a wet-nurse {{to care for}} the child, sometimes living in with the family. Few sources give an insight into the experiences of young children in this period. Some parents played with their children and parents demonstrated grief at their loss. The primary responsibility for bringing up young children fell on the mother. For older children, the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, {{but it is not clear}} how widely these practices were adopted.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Klaus dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles, potentially {{as high as}} 15inches (380mm); the hurricane affected many areas struck by Hurricane Hugo in the previous year. On Barbados, flooding from the rainfall blocked a few roads and forced a few <b>families</b> <b>to</b> move to safer areas; lightning from {{the outskirts of the}} storm left a portion of the island without power. High winds and rainfall affected the island of Saint Lucia, which destroyed about 15% of the nation's banana crop for the year; damage totaled about $1million (1990USD).|$|E
