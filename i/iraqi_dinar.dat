50|$|Because of the {{economic}} potential of Iraq, a niche market for <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Dinar</b> currency has emerged. Speculators are making investments in the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Dinar</b> in hopes of receiving a return once Iraq stabilizes as a country. Jim Cramer's October 20, 2009 endorsement of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Dinar</b> on CNBC has further piqued interest in the investment.|$|E

50|$|When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinar</b> {{replaced}} the Kuwaiti dinar as the currency and {{large quantities of}} banknotes were stolen by the invading forces. After liberation, the Kuwaiti dinar was restored as the country's currency and a new banknote series was introduced, allowing the previous notes, including those stolen, to be demonetized.|$|E
50|$|In Iraq, the Emgrand EC7 {{alongside}} the bigger Emgrand EC8 is assembled {{by the local}} company owned by the government, called SCAI. It comes in full specification with the 1.8 liter engine and CVT automatic transmission, and with white, black, red or orange colors.

[...] According to Al Arabiya News, the theatre has 1000 seats and cost 10,000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Dinars</b> to attend.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{possible}} explanation is that the printing plates for the currency came from Switzerland, although the notes were actually printed in the United Kingdom. After the war, subject to economic sanctions authorised by United Nations resolutions, continued importing of the [...] "Swiss" [...] notes was prohibited, and the Central Bank of Iraq began domestic printing of a new <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Between 1987 and 1995 the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Dinar</b> {{went from}} an {{official}} value of 0.306 Dinars/USD (or $3.26 USD per dinar, though {{the black market}} rate {{is thought to have}} been substantially lower) to 3000 Dinars/USD due to government printing of 10s of trillions of dinars starting with a base of only 10s of billions. That equates to approximately 315% inflation per year averaged over that eight-year period.|$|E
5000|$|After World War I, Iraq's {{monetary}} system was {{administered by the}} British Mandate of Mesopotamia until 1931, when the Iraq Currency Board was established in London to issue the new <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinar</b> and maintain its reserves.

50|$|Years of {{constant}} war and rebuilding resulted in {{large amounts of}} government spending, with international sanctions creating shortages and limits on borrowing. Between 1987 and 1995 the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Dinar</b> went from an official value of 0.306 Dinars/USD (or $3.26 USD per dinar; the black market rate {{is thought to have}} been substantially fewer dinars per dollar) to 3000 Dinars/USD due to government loss of their Swiss printing press and the printing of inferior quality notes. This equates to approximately 315% inflation per year averaged over that eight-year period.|$|E
50|$|By noon, Qasim {{had arrived}} in Baghdad with his forces and set up {{headquarters}} in the Ministry of Defence building. The conspirator's attention now shifted towards locating al-Said, lest he escape and undermine the coup's early success. A reward of 10,000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinar</b> was offered for his capture, and a large-scale search began. On 15 July he was spotted in a street in the al-Battawin quarter of Baghdad attempting to escape disguised in a woman's abaya. Al-Said and his accomplice were both shot, and his body {{was buried in the}} cemetery at Bab al-Mu'azzam later that evening.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{a highly}} {{uncertain}} domestic and external environment, Al-Shabibi {{has held the}} Iraqi currency, the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Dinar</b> firm at about US$1 = IQD 1'190 (US$1 equaled IQD 2'214 in December 2002), reduced inflation to single digits (from 64% in 2006 to 5.2% in September 2012), quadrupled the bank's gold reserves to 32 tonnes, and remained a strong advocate of central bank independence. The implementation of these policies combined with the rise in oil revenues have helped to increase foreign exchange reserves to nearly US$67 billion (as of September 2012) up from US$2.7 billion in December 2002 supporting further Iraq's Macroeconomic stability.|$|E
5000|$|Paul Bremer legalized {{political}} parties and NGOs, and the specific rules regulating {{political parties}} were enacted by the 2004 Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq.

[...] Most of the detainees were from Mosul and they were arrested on charges of collaborating with the security forces. ISIL had demanded ransoms from the families of the detainees, ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinars.</b> It was also reported that ISIL's military Wali of Tigris, Abu Shuaib, was killed in an airstrike by the coalition along with many other leaders of the group.|$|R
50|$|By June 6, 2012, about 70,000 {{members of}} the group had been {{integrated}} into the Iraqi Security Forces or given civilian jobs, with 30,000 continuing to maintain checkpoints and being paid a salary by the government of around $300 per month. On January 29, 2013, Iraqi Shia-appointed officials said they would raise the salaries of Awakening Council fighters, the latest bid to appease Sunni anti-government rallies that erupted in December, 2012. Some 41,000 Awakening Council fighters are to receive 500,000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinars</b> ($415) a month, up from 300,000 dinars ($250).|$|R
5000|$|On 18 September, the Iraqi Human Rights {{ministry}} {{stated that}} as of 17 September, the total of missing soldiers and cadets was 1095, denying the most popular figure of 1700 soldiers having been killed. The ministry added [...] "The ministry relied in its statistics on spreading forms on {{the families of the}} missing people in Baghdad and the other Provinces within its quest to document the crimes and violations that the terrorist group of the Islamic State is committing towards our people." [...] The Iraqi government ordered to pay 10,000,000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinar</b> (equivalent to US$8,600) {{to the families of the}} missing cadets.|$|E
50|$|Since {{taking over}} as central bank governor, Al-Shabibi {{introduced}} the bank's employees to modern finance and payment systems. He made the bank switch from typewriters and calculators to computers, introduced it to financial instruments like currency auctions, and replaced Iraq's pre-2003 banknotes with the New <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Dinar</b> between October 2003 and January 2004. He also involved directly the Central Bank of Iraq in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank co-operation programs, {{in addition to}} the Paris Club negotiations where 19 rich creditor nations agreed in 2004 to write off 80 percent of pre-2003 debt to help Iraq recover from the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Debt forgiveness talks with non-Paris Club nations are still under way.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{sanctions}} were imposed, the Iraqi government developed {{a system of}} free food rations consisting of 1000 calories per person/day or 40% of the daily requirements, on which an estimated 60% of the population relied for {{a vital part of}} their sustenance. With the introduction of the Oil-for-Food Programme in 1997, this situation gradually improved. In May 2000 a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) survey noted that almost half the children under 5 years suffered from diarrhoea, {{in a country where the}} population is marked by its youth, with 45% being under 14 years of age in 2000. Power shortages, lack of spare parts and insufficient technical know-how lead to the breakdown of many modern facilities. The per capita income in Iraq dropped from $3510 in 1989 to $450 in 1996, heavily influenced by the rapid devaluation of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dar al-Hikma (دار الحكمة, 'House of Wisdom') was an {{underground}} publishing house, {{set up by}} the Iraqi Communist Party in September 1945. It published literature on politics, science, economy and culture. It issues Arabic translations on Friedrich Engels' Origin of the Family, Maxim Gorky's Mother and texts of Stalin on dialectics and historical materialism. The main source for the literature published was English-language books brought from the Soviet Union. Party members working with bookstores in Baghdad and Amarah enabled the sales of the books. Dar al-Hikma was financed by contributions from party members, the party managed to gather 6,000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinars</b> for the purpose. Dar al-Hikma had a short life-span.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, Shawqi {{traveled}} to England {{to take part}} in a training course along with Adil Basher. He spent a month in England where he got to know Irish coach William Cook, formerly a professional with Everton and Celtic who joined the Iraq delegation on their return to Baghdad to manage the Iraq army team. Cook spent six months training the Iraq army team at the Sarsink Camp on a wage of only a few <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinars,</b> where they played a number of friendly games, with Shawqi playing a few matches for Iraq in the outside right position, as well as working as one of Cook’s coaching assistants.|$|R
25|$|During his {{period as}} Minister of Finance, Sassoon founded all the {{financial}} and budgeting structures and laws for the Kingdom and looked whole-heartedly after {{the interests of the}} monarchy and the proper fulfilment of its laws. Rather famously, one of his most financially prolific deeds for the State was during negotiations with the British Petroleum Company in 1925. Through a pure stroke of genius and foresight, Sir Sassoon demanded that Iraq’s oil revenue be remunerated in gold rather than sterling; at the time, this request seemed bizarre since sterling was backed by the gold standard. Nevertheless, his demand was reluctantly accepted. Later this concession benefited Iraq’s treasury during World War II, when the gold standard was abandoned and sterling plummeted. He thus secured countless additional millions of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinars</b> for the State. This is something that the Iraqi nation remembers with appreciation and admiration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{primitive}} {{printing techniques}} {{resulted in a}} limitless variety in coloration and detail, one layer of the printing would be too faint while another would be too dark. Counterfeit banknotes often appeared to be of better quality than real notes. Some notes were very poorly cut, and some notes even lacked serial numbers. Despite the collapse {{in the value of}} the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinar,</b> the highest denomination printed until 2002 was 250 dinars. In 2002, the Central Bank of Iraq issued a 10,000-dinars banknote to be used for [...] "larger, and inter-bank transactions". This note was rarely accepted in practice due to fears of looting and counterfeiting. This forced people to carry around stacks of 250-dinars notes for everyday use. The other, smaller bills were so worthless that they largely fell into disuse. This situation meant that Iraq, for the most part, had only one denomination of banknote in wide circulation.|$|E
5000|$|The Ba'ath Party was {{supported}} financially by the RCC, the highest {{executive and legislative}} body of government. Members were required to pays fees commensurate with their ranks. For instance, a supporting member would pay 25 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinar</b> for membership, while a branch member would pay 3,000 Iraqi dinars. Fees were important in the party's balance sheet. The central party leadership often emphasised the importance of members' financial abilities. The leadership encouraged members to contribute more to party finances. According to Jawad Hashim, a former Minister of Planning and the RCC Economic Advisor, Saddam gave the Ba'ath Party the five percent of Iraqi oil revenues, which were previously owned by the Gulbenkin Foundation. Saddam's reasoning was that, if a counter-coup took place and the Ba'ath Party was forced from power, as had {{been the case in}} November 1963, the party needed financial security so that it could reclaim power. By Hasim's estimates, the Ba'ath Party had accumulated [...] in external revenues by 1989.|$|E

50|$|From May 2003 to June 28, 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was the {{governing}} body of Iraq. In July 2003, the CPA started {{to replace the}} old <b>Iraqi</b> <b>dinars</b> with portrait of Saddam Hussein with a new currency. On August 27, 2003, Custer Battles, LLC., signed a Dinar Exchange Contract with the CPA to construct and operate three money exchange facilities, in Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra. It was a Cost-Plus contract with reimbursement for actual expenses, plus 25% for overhead and profit. During signing, the $3-million advance paid with a U.S. Treasury check was handed over; a total of approximately $15 million was paid by the CPA to Custer Battles. At {{the end of the}} contract time, a document came into possession of the CPA which demonstrated that Custer Battles, LLC., inflated the invoices, for example, it charged $400,000 for electric generators for Baghdad facility while they were acquired for $74,000.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>Iraqi</b> Swiss <b>dinar</b> {{ceased to}} be legal tender in Iraq, it still {{circulated}} in the northern Kurdish regions, and despite lacking government backing, it had a stable market value {{for more than a}} decade. This example is often cited to demonstrate that the value of a currency is not derived purely from its legal status (but this currency would not be legal tender).|$|R
40|$|Sera from 432 small {{ruminants}} (335 sheep and 97 goats) from 72 farms in Duhok Province, northern Iraq, were collected to investigate risk {{factors associated with}} brucellosis seropositivity. Serum samples were tested using the Rose Bengal test (RBT) and an {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (iELISA). Using parallel interpretation, RBT and iELISA results showed that 31. 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 26. 1, 36. 3) of sheep and 34. 0 % (95 % CI: 24. 7, 44. 3) of goats had antibodies against Brucella in the study area. A random-effects multivariable logistic regression model indicated that a higher chance of being seropositive (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 7; 95 % 1. 4; 2. 2) was associated with an increase in the age of animals. The odds of Brucella seropositivity in flocks where sheep and goats grazed together was 2. 0 times higher (95 % CI: 1. 08; 3. 9) compared to flocks where sheep and goats grazed separately. The odds of Brucella seropositivity in {{small ruminants}} was 2. 2 higher (95 % CI: 1. 2; 4. 3) for animals originating from farms with a history of goat abortion in the preceding 12 months. In contrast, for every 1000 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Dinars</b> (~ 0. 85 US Dollar) spent by the farmers on control of Brucella in their flocks, the odds of Brucella seropositivity decreased significantly (OR = 0. 9, p-value = 0. 021). The final model also indicated significant differences in Brucella seropositivity between the different districts of Duhok Province. This study provides a contribution to the epidemiology of brucellosis in small ruminants in northern Iraq...|$|R
