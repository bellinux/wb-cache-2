I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> {{long enough to see}} the flag fall over." [...] Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least [...] from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.|$|E
500|$|At the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, LaBeouf {{told the}} Los Angeles Times he had [...] "dropped {{the ball on}} the legacy that people loved and cherished" [...] and felt that [...] "the movie could have been updated ... we just misinterpreted {{what we were trying to}} satiate." [...] In 2011, in {{response}} to LaBeouf's comments, Harrison Ford said: [...] "I think I told [...] he was a fucking idiot ... As an actor, I think it's my obligation to support the film without making a complete ass of myself. Shia is ambitious, attentive and talented — and he's learning how to deal with a situation which is very unique and difficult." [...] LaBeouf later regretted his comments and their effect on his relationship with Spielberg: [...] "He told me there's a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there's a time to sell cars. It brought me freedom, but it also killed my spirits because this was a dude <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to like a sensei." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} season's use of 1940s terminology, Fazekas stated that terms like [...] "broad" [...] and [...] "dame" [...] were preferably avoided, while {{research}} {{was done to}} ensure terms {{that were used in}} the series were actually in use during that time, with Fazekas giving the example, [...] "you know what didn't exist in 1946? Smart ass. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> the etymology on that, didn't exist in 1946. Turns out it was a term that came around in the 60s. But for instance, I wrote a line that said, [...] "Oh I think someone's yanking your chain." [...] And I had to look it up, did that exist in 1946? And actually it did; it's a mining term that exists from a long time ago. That's our research that we do." [...] Research was also done on radio shows of the time to ensure realism when creating the fictional Captain America Adventure Program, with details discovered and replicated on the series including the use of lobsters and ham to create sound effects for the radio show. The Griffith Hotel, the all-women boarding house where Carter lives, is based on the real-life Barbizon Hotel for Women. Butters felt that while working in the time period, it became an issue to not sound [...] "too period". Additionally, it was difficult to write British people from the time in order to avoid stereotypes such as the [...] "typical British butler". However, D'Arcy, who is British, felt the writing staff wrote the British characters better than anyone else he had worked with, despite there not being any British writers on the staff.|$|E
500|$|During 2007 spring practice, Scott {{was third}} on the depth chart, but {{suffered}} a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's just {{a different type of}} animal." [...] Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, [...] "I think I've got to try to get him involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that can make some plays for us." [...] The following week, unranked Maryland upset 10th-ranked Rutgers, and Scott made his first career appearance as a tailback. He had three carries for 29yards. After sitting out the Georgia Tech game because of an ankle injury, he returned four kicks for 68yards against Virginia, three for 56yards against Clemson, and two for 40yards against North Carolina. Against eighth-ranked Boston College, Scott caught a short screen pass from quarterback Chris Turner and ran 57yards for a touchdown. It was his first career reception and first career touchdown. It was one of just two offensive plays for Scott in that game, and incidentally, he was not intended to be in it. Friedgen said:"When he was in the game, I didn't even know he was in the game. I called a screen pass. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> and it was Da'Rel in there. I figured we were just giving Lance a rest, but I asked [...] Zacharias about it Sunday and he started laughing. I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all the things people said you have to do in this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By the time we got to the last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was so sick of the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked like a bunch of Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than thirty}} years after The Naked Civil Servant, Hurt reprised the role of Quentin Crisp in the 2009 film An Englishman in New York. This {{television}} film depicts Crisp's later years in New York. He returned to Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, playing the on-screen Big Brother for the Paper Zoo Theatre Company's stage adaptation of the novel in June 2009. The theatre production premiered at the National Media Museum, in Bradford and toured during 2010. Hurt said, [...] "I think Paper Zoo {{thought it would be}} quite ironic to have the person who played Winston having risen in the party.

2500|$|... "At 6:30 {{we arrived}} {{close to the}} beach.

They were having trouble getting the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and said, {{we are not going}} out that door; everybody over the side."

2500|$|Wild {{was looking}} forward to a fast ride on his first country train journey in many years. In the early days of his youth, in the 1930s, {{railways}} were always pushing to achieve an average speed of 60 miles per hour (97km/h). He had grown up [...] "when speed was regarded as the essential thing on the railway". But disappointment in his trip came when he realised that despite the train's much-publicised but very brief dash at 160 km/h, the journey, over all, had the leisurely features of a branch-line train. ... In the end, the journey took 4 hours and 37 minutes – 20 minutes longer than scheduled, at an average speed of 70.6 kilometres per hour. [...] I was absolutely appalled by the whole thing. After I flew home that night, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> an old reference book. [...] I learned that if the train had completed the run in an even four hours – a schedule that was soon to be introduced – it would have travelled at the same average speed of 81.6 km/h as the London to Bristol Express in 1851.|$|E
2500|$|The Joe A. Guerra Laredo Public Library {{was first}} housed {{on the second}} floor of the City Hall, now known as the Market Hall, in 1916. In 1974, the Laredo Public Library moved to the {{historic}} Bruni Plaza in downtown Laredo. In 1993, the citizens of Laredo approved the construction of a new main library at McPherson and Calton roads, which opened on February 1, 1998. On July 22, 2016, the structure was named in honor of Joe A. Guerra, a former member of the Laredo City Council known for his support for the library and a personal passion for reading. Council member Roque Vela, who first proposed that the structure be named for Guerra, described the former councilman, who died in 2010, as [...] "someone <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to for his unwavering commitment to public service. I am especially proud to know that the library and reading were passions of Mr. Guerra."
