5|$|In 2016, Sandoll Communications, Inc. built a Hangul {{version of}} Renault's Renault Life <b>font</b> <b>family</b> for the company. It {{consists}} of three fonts in three weights (light, regular, bold) and one width in Roman only. The font was designed by Park Ju-seong and Wi Ye-jin, {{under the direction of}} Lee Do-kyung.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} Roman type by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The <b>font</b> <b>family</b> contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, a contrast to the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the <b>font</b> <b>family</b> was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as ligatures, small caps and italic swash capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing.|$|E

25|$|Times Europa was {{designed}} by Walter Tracy in 1972 for The Times, as a sturdier alternative to the Times <b>font</b> <b>family,</b> designed for the demands of faster printing presses and cheaper paper. The typeface features more open counter spaces.|$|E
25|$|As {{the range}} of {{typeface}} designs increased and requirements of publishers broadened over the centuries, fonts of specific weight (blackness or lightness) and stylistic variants (most commonly regular or roman as distinct to italic, as well as condensed) have led to font families, collections of closely related typeface designs that can include hundreds of styles. A <b>font</b> <b>family</b> is typically a group of related fonts which vary only in weight, orientation, width, etc., but not design. For example, Times is a <b>font</b> <b>family,</b> whereas Times Roman, Times Italic and Times Bold are individual fonts making up the Times family. Font families typically include several fonts, though some, such as Helvetica, may consist of dozens of fonts.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Apple {{gradually}} {{started using}} {{a variant of}} the Adobe Myriad <b>font</b> <b>family</b> in its marketing and packaging. As new revisions of its products were released, the text changed from the serif Apple Garamond to the sans-serif Myriad Apple. The family's bolds were used for headlines, and other weights accordingly.|$|E

25|$|In July 2016, Samsung {{unveiled}} its SamsungOne font, a typeface that {{hopes to}} give a consistent and universal visual identity to {{the wide range of}} Samsung products. SamsungOne was designed to be used across Samsung's diverse device portfolio, with a focus on legibility for everything from smaller devices like smartphones to larger connected TVs or refrigerators, as well as Samsung marketing and advertisements. The <b>font</b> <b>family</b> supports 400 different languages through over 25,000 characters.|$|E
25|$|The Myriad <b>font</b> <b>family</b> was {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach and Carol Twombly for Adobe. Adobe's most recent version of Myriad is Myriad Pro, which has some additional enhancements and character set extensions, but is not significantly changed in design. Myriad Apple, a modification produced by Galápagos Design Group, incorporates minor spacing and weight differences from the standard varieties, and includes Apple-specific characters, such as the company logo. In 2006, Myriad Apple was superseded by Myriad Set, which contains extra ligatures and other minor changes.|$|E
25|$|Peter the Great, Czar of Russia, {{mandated}} {{the use of}} westernized letter {{forms in}} the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of serifs, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are {{much the same as}} modern Latin fonts of the same <b>font</b> <b>family.</b> The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.|$|E

500|$|The HTC One shipped with Android 4.1.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] and version 5.0 of HTC’s {{proprietary}} Sense software suite. In {{comparison to}} previous {{versions of the}} software, Sense 5 uses a flat, minimalist visual style with refreshed icons and the condensed variant of the Roboto <b>font</b> <b>family.</b> Instead of a traditional home screen display with apps and widgets, Sense 5 defaults to a screen known as BlinkFeed, a news aggregator which displays a scrolling grid of news headlines from selected sources (as syndicated by Mobiles Republic) and social network content {{in a similar fashion}} to Flipboard and Windows Phone’s live tiles. New content is synchronized every two hours when connected to a mobile network, but more frequently while on Wi-Fi. Directly above the BlinkFeed display is a clock which displays the user’s local time and weather forecast; the signature flip clock widget seen on previous HTC devices was replaced by a simpler digital clock for Sense 5. Hundreds of different clock designs by HTC’s designers, narrowed down to 25, were considered before the final design was chosen. As with previous versions of Sense, users can still add or remove pages on the home screen for housing app shortcuts and widgets; one such page is provided by default, and which page to display by default can be set by the user. However, BlinkFeed will always occupy the leftmost page of the home screen. The application drawer uses a 3x4 grid to display application shortcuts by default, but can still be changed back to the denser 4x5 grid used by past versions. Apps can also be sorted into folders within the drawer; a number of preset folders are provided, such as [...] "Google", [...] "Media", [...] "Productivity", [...] "Tools", and pre-loaded apps provided by the user’s wireless carrier, where applicable.|$|E

2500|$|In typography, a {{typeface}} (also {{known as}} <b>font</b> <b>family)</b> {{is a set}} of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features. Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts). For example, [...] "ITC Garamond Bold Condensed Italic" [...] means the bold, condensed-width, italic version of ITC Garamond. It is a different font from [...] "ITC Garamond Condensed Italic" [...] and [...] "ITC Garamond Bold Condensed," [...] but all are fonts within the same typeface, [...] "ITC Garamond." [...] ITC Garamond is a different typeface from [...] "Adobe Garamond" [...] or [...] "Monotype Garamond." [...] (These are all alternative updates or digitisations of the typeface Garamond, originally created in the 16th century.) ...|$|E

The ticker now alternates between general headlines and financial news from CNNMoney, and the secondary logo box was replaced with a smaller box below the CNN bug, which displays either the title, hashtag, or Twitter handle for the show being aired or its anchor. In April 2016, CNN began to introduce a new corporate typeface, known as [...] "CNN Sans", across all of its platforms.

40|$|The {{widely used}} New Font Selection System (NFSS) has its pros and cons. To have uniform {{platform}} for large font set management and selection for both plain and LATEX users, and {{to extend the}} possibilities of the NFSS, an OlÏsÂak's Font System (OFS) has been designed and implemented. The user interface of this macro {{is the same for}} plain and LATEX, with two independent implementations. First implementation is based on plain. tex macros only; the second one for LATEX users is implemented as an additional layer over NFSS macros, and is slightly less elaborate (support for math <b>font</b> <b>families</b> is missing). The main features of the system: • The OFS de®nes declarative language to de®ne the mapping from the original full names of fonts to the tfm names (in plain) or to NFSS short names of the <b>font</b> <b>families</b> (in LATEX). The user do not need to remember the short names of tfm ®les and/or the short names of NFSS <b>font</b> <b>families.</b> This allows for user-de®ned logical font markup...|$|R
