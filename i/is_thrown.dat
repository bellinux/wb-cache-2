50|$|The chakram's combat {{application}} is largely dependent on its size.

In single combat, the chakram could <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> underarm like a modern Aerobie.

A stack of chakram could <b>be</b> quickly <b>thrown</b> one at a time like shuriken. On elephant or horseback, chakram could <b>be</b> more easily <b>thrown</b> than spears or arrows.
