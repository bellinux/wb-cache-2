5|$|After {{training}} at NWA UK <b>Hammerlock,</b> Devitt debuted {{for them in}} 2000 {{at the age of}} 18, soon winning the NWA British Commonwealth Heavyweight Championship. After graduating, his wrestling career started quickly, and he began touring Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In mid-2002, Devitt, along with Paul Tracey, opened NWA Ireland, his own wrestling promotion based in Ireland. The promotion soon became the sister group of NWA UK <b>Hammerlock</b> as both promoted under the NWA banner. As part of NWA Ireland, Devitt trained future WWE competitor Becky Lynch.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} match on the {{pay-per-view}} {{portion of the}} show, Daniel Bryan faced Triple H; the winner would be inserted in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship main event later that night. Triple H was announced and accompanied by Stephanie McMahon. Bryan kicked away Triple H's handshake and started the match strongly, including performing a tornado DDT off the apron. Triple H gained the advantage by driving Bryan's injured arm into the announce table and continually attacking the arm including a <b>hammerlock</b> belly-to-back suplex on the apron. Bryan refused to submit to Triple H's submission holds of the crossface chickenwing and a regular crossface, instead reversing to his signature Yes! Lock, but Triple H reached the ropes to break the hold. Triple H countered Bryan's signature running knee with a spinebuster and his signature Pedigree maneuver, but Bryan kicked out at two. After another series of counters, Bryan hit his running knee for the three count and the win. After the match, McMahon slapped Bryan, distracting him long enough for Triple H to attack him from behind. Triple H placed Bryan's injured arm against the ring post and hit it with a steel folding chair. Bryan had to be attended to by medical staff while Triple H and McMahon celebrated on the stage.|$|E

25|$|After {{enjoying the}} World Wrestling Federation {{at a young}} age, {{particularly}} Ultimate Warrior, Black became reinterested in the late '90s {{by the age of}} 18. After achieving a 2:1 in Journalism and Contemporary History, Black began attending independent shows in Barking town hall, East London and after being inspired by wrestlers such as Robbie Brookside and James Mason, Black turned her own hand at wrestling through the NWA UK <b>Hammerlock</b> school in Kent, where she would wrestle her first matches, mainly battle royals.|$|E

25|$|Southern Senators {{continued}} to hold a <b>hammerlock</b> on Congress. Because of the Southern Democrats' disfranchisement of African Americans in Southern states {{at the start of}} the 20th century, Southern whites for decades had nearly double the representation in Congress beyond their own population. Southern states had Congressional representation based on total population, but essentially only whites could vote and only their issues were supported. Due to seniority achieved through one-party Democratic rule in their region, Southern Democrats controlled many important committees in both houses. Southern Democrats consistently opposed any legislation related to putting lynching under Federal oversight. As a result, Southern white Democrats were a formidable power in Congress until the 1960s.|$|E

5000|$|The New York Timess review concluded, [...] "the films highlight, one superbly {{conceived}} and well-performed {{scene with the}} father and girl at loggerheads over the boy. As we contend, the author does know better. He has perceptively <b>hammerlocked</b> youth and age, and until the half-way mark, the above-mentioned encounter, the quandary is genuinely intriguing. But M. Cocteaus triumphant rattling of the Oedipus legend tilts the apple cart, {{and some of his}} own dialogue provides the best summary. [...] "What a nightmare!" [...] moans Miss Spencer at one point. Mr. Warrender: [...] "Youre telling me" [...] and more recently, TV Guide wrote, [...] "the film is too talky and constricted by stage motifs. Enoch and Albiin, the mistress, do have a nice chemistry, though." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep was {{met with}} {{considerable}} praise and acclaim from multiple gaming websites and journalists such as IGN.com's Vince Ingenito, who gave the expansion a 9.2 out of 10, praising its use of the fantasy elements in its narrative, humorous references to the source material, and sheer amount of content, but stated {{that there was not}} a good variety of loot to be had from fighting the endgame bosses. [...] Despite this minor issue with the pack, IGN.com scored it much higher than the previous entry, Sir <b>Hammerlock's</b> Big Game Hunt. Despite the acclaim surrounding the pack, there have been mixed reviews as well, such as the review written by Christian Donlan for Eurogamer.net, giving the expansion a 7 out of 10, one point lower than their review of Sir <b>Hammerlock's</b> Big Game Hunt, stating that [...] "Without spoiling anything: does it work? Not entirely. But it is, unsurprisingly, just the kind of trick one of those special long-running TV shows might try to pull now and then - a bit of heavy-handed schmaltz to break up the glib anarchy, a lunge at tonal variation to bring depth to some increasingly harshly delineated cast members." [...] Despite the mixed feelings towards the narrative and themes of the pack, Donlan's review also praised the humor and entertainment value of the pack, stating that [...] "New U stations now babble about necromancy, loot chests can hide mimics and often come with many-sided dice stuck on top, there's a really great joke about punching stuff, and you're carried through it all by that endless ebb and flow between shooting things and picking over their corpses. Is Dragon's Keep fun but lacking surprises?".|$|R
25|$|The {{main event}} was between Lex Luger and Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Luger gained the early advantage, and {{targeted}} {{the left arm}} of Flair. Luger applied the <b>hammerlock,</b> and used the guard rail and ringpost. Flair fought back after he avoided an elbow drop, and sent Luger's head into the guard rail. Luger applied the sleeper hold, but Flair fought out with a belly to back suplex. Luger fought back with a superplex, and applied the figure four leglock. Luger continued to have the advantage until Flair pulled Luger down, and hit his left knee with a steel chair. Flair then targeted Luger's left leg, and applied the figure four leglock. Luger fought back with a gorilla press slam. After performing mounted punches and a scoop powerslam, Luger applied the Torture Rack. However, his knees buckled, and Flair fell on top of him. Flair then pinned Luger with {{his feet on the}} rope to win the match, and retain the title.|$|E
