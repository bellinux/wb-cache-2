500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they will attack us this night. I {{do not wish to}} conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{official}} state NAACP's website, an 82 point 'Crimes and Torts committed by Duke Lacrosse Team Players' memo was listed {{long after the}} charges were dropped and the players were declared innocent. [...] Included in the memorandum was {{an assessment of the}} defendants' strategy to have the charges dropped: [...] "The three defendants they have two mountains to climb. First, they must deflect public attention from their boorish, racist, and illegal behavior by mounting outlandish attacks on the survivor and the D.A. Second, they must deal with a mountain of physical evidence, that is corroborated by, we <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> accounts of some of the men who were at the party who have cooperated with the police and the D.A. from early on." [...] North Carolina Attorney General Roy A. Cooper refuted these facts in the summary of findings report.

No other witness confirmed her stories ... The accusing witness’s accounts of the story changed significantly." ...|$|E

[...] John Battle MP addressed the House of Commons on 8 July 1992 regarding the difficulties faced in mounting a legal case against T [...] "Basically, it is an attempt legally to prove negligence {{in the face of}} foreseeable likelihood that harm would occur as a result of causing or permitting asbestos dust to permeate the atmosphere in or around the factory premises in Canal Road, Armley, between 1925 and 1958... The legal test is whether the company knew that the dust could cause serious or possibly fatal injury to those living in the 840 houses nearby who work in the local workplaces or who attend the Armley Clock school... I <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the company and other sources, medical and environmental, did have that sort of data, and still do. The difficulty lies in seeking it out - discovering it - and, especially, forcing the company to disclose all that it knew and knows." ...|$|E

[...] After six weeks of review the USIA Appeals board overturned Mora's judgement which was based on an investigation that included improper interrogations and improper use of expunged material. The individual was offered his job back at USIA after Mora was overturned for a staff investigation fraught with errors and injuring an individual due to his sexuality.|$|E
