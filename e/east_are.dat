5|$|Western Australia {{banned the}} import of common {{starlings}} in 1895. New flocks arriving from the <b>east</b> <b>are</b> routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. New methods are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where {{other members of the}} flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used. By 2009, only 300 common starlings were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue the eradication programme.|$|E
5|$|At Steeles Avenue, {{the freeway}} enters the Regional Municipality of York. To the <b>east</b> <b>are</b> {{industrial}} units, {{while on the}} west are residential suburbs. This land-use persists north to the Highway407 ETR interchange, a multi-level stack interchange with two flyovers. North of Highway407, the freeway crosses Highway7, where the HOV lanes transition to standard through lanes. The freeway passes west of Buttonville Municipal Airport and then interchanges with 16thAvenue. It narrows and the central barrier ends; a grass median taking its place between the opposing lanes. The land-use density continues to drop, {{with the appearance of}} some open spaces and farms interspersed with industrial and commercial buildings. By 19thAvenue, just north of the Honda Canada headquarters in Markham, the land-use is agricultural on both sides of Highway404. Highway 404 continues north, forming the eastern boundary of the municipalities of Richmond Hill, Aurora and Newmarket and the western boundary of Whitchurch-Stouffville. North of Wellington Street, the highway reduces in width to four lanes, which is its configuration north through East Gwillimbury. The route continues, passing east of the community of Sharon, eventually curving northeast and terminating at an at-grade intersection with Woodbine Avenue immediately south of Ravenshoe Road (York Regional Road32).|$|E

5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway or York Regional Road48, also {{referred}} to historically as the Markham Bypass or Markham Bypass Extension, is a regionally maintained arterial bypass of Markham in the Canadian province of Ontario. Named for former Markham mayor Don Cousens in April 2007, the route initially travelled northward from Copper Creek Drive in Box Grove, south of Highway407, to Major Mackenzie Drive (York Regional Road25). A southern extension to Steeles Avenue was later completed and the name Donald Cousens Parkway applied along the extension to Ninth Line. In addition to its role of funneling through-traffic around downtown Markham, the route serves as a boundary to residential development as land {{to the north and}} <b>east</b> <b>are</b> part of the protected Rouge Park and southwest limits of the planned Pickering Airport.|$|E
5|$|Just before Godnow Swing Bridge, the {{northern}} soak drain {{crosses to the}} north side of the railway. As the canal approaches Ealand there are some large lakes to the north, which are now used for sailing. Crowle Bridge carries the A161 road over the railway and the canal, and Crowle railway station is sandwiched between the canal and the North Soak Drain. A little further <b>east</b> <b>are</b> the remains of Crowle railway bridge. It carried the Axholme Joint Railway over the canal, and consisted of four arches built from bricks, with a central swinging section, to allow keels to sail along the canal. The bridge was retained after the railway was closed in 1966, because stators from Keadby Power Station were too heavy to be transported over the A161 road bridge. The stators were carried by road to Ealand, loaded onto the railway, and crossed the bridge to Belton, where they were transferred back to a road vehicle. The process became unnecessary when Lindsey County Council rebuilt the A161 bridge in 1970, and the railway bridge was demolished in 1972.|$|E
