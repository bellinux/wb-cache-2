60|$|Your Committee then {{proceeded}} to consider the causes of this duration, with regard to time {{as measured by the}} calendar, and also as measured by the number of days occupied in actual sitting. They find, on examining the duration of the trial with reference to the number of years which it has lasted, that it has been owing to several prorogations and to one dissolution of Parliament; to discussions which are supposed to have arisen in the House of Peers on the legality of the continuance of impeachments from Parliament to Parliament; that it has been owing to the number and length of the adjournments of the Court, particularly the adjournments on account of the Circuit, which adjournments were interposed {{in the middle of the}} session, and the most proper time for business; that it has been owing to one adjournment made in consequence of a complaint of the prisoner against one of your Managers, which took up a space of ten days; that two days' adjournments were made on account of the illness of certain of the Managers; and, as far as your Committee can judge, two sitting days were prevented by the sudden and unexpected dereliction of the defence of the prisoner at the close of the last session, your Managers not having been then ready to produce their <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>reply,</b> nor to make their observations on the evidence produced by the prisoner's counsel, as they expected the whole to have been gone through before they were called on for their reply. In this session your Committee computes that the trial was delayed about a week or ten days. The Lords waited for the recovery of the Marquis Cornwallis, the prisoner wishing to avail himself of the testimony of that noble person.|$|E

Following closely behind levels in Western countries, the number of drug-facilitated sexual assaults (DFSAs), involving the illicit use of medicine, has been recently increasing in Japan. Tirazolam is the most frequently used date-rape drug in DFSAs occurring in Japan. In this study, the effect of triazolam on behavior in response to fear and anxiety was evaluated using an elevated plus-maze test in mice. Triazolam-treated animals (0. 01 mg/kg) showed no significant difference in total locomotor activity compared with vehicle-treated mice (controls). On the contrary, activity levels on the open arms of the apparatus (time spent, mean value of movement), where mice would normally feel anxiety or fear, were significantly increased in triazolam-treated mice compared with controls. However, total locomotor activities on the plus-maze were not different between two groups, indicating that sedation was not induced by tirazolam under these conditions. These results suggest that triazolam treatment led the mice to become insensitive to fear and anxiety; their defence reactions were impaired. We conclude that this finding provides scientific <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>reply</b> to defence arguments presented in court trials that there is little or no evidence of the victim attempting to escape from a sexual assault. Additionally, the finding is as true of other benzodiazepine receptor agonists as of triazolam...|$|E
40|$|In their comment White and Besner (2016) {{argue against}} our {{conclusion}} that stress assignment may affect polysyllable pseudoword reading and conclude that, currently, {{we do not}} know whether the effect of stress position is solid and reliable. White and Besner state that because the experiments reported in Sulpizio, Spinelli and Burani (2015) have methodological problems, our conclusion is grounded on weak <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>reply</b> we present further analyses of our data that overcome the methodological weakness highlighted by White and Besner. The results of these new analyses consistently mirror those reported by Sulpizio and colleagues (2015) and speak in favor of the view that, in reading Italian pseudowords aloud, stress assignment affects articulatory planning of the stimulus...|$|R

40|$|Our {{paper on}} the isotope effect in {{high-temperature}} superconductors with cation substitutions presents a comprehensive analysis rooted completely <b>in</b> the experimental <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>Reply</b> we show that pair-breaking disorder, isotope effects, doping-induced variations in Tc and in the magnetic penetration depth, Coulomb's law, and Anderson's theorem are treated with correct physical and mathematical fundamentals. In contrast, the theory fostered in the Comment by Alexandrov and Zhao contradicts several specific experimental facts, eight of which are briefly discussed. Their Comment also uncritically repeats a previously discredited assertion of an isotope effect in the superconducting carrier mass, incorrectly assumes that cation doping continuously varies intrinsic superconducting parameters, unjustifiably assigns importance to data from samples with serious quality problems, and renders a false estimate of the pair-breaking strength.

50|$|The {{defendant}} then {{introduced the}} two resolutions of November 5, 1869, above set forth, and also gave {{evidence for the}} purpose of showing that previous notice of the holding of the election was published in a newspaper at Garnett only twenty-four days before the day of the election, and not thirty days. There was also <b>evidence</b> given <b>in</b> <b>reply</b> by the plaintiff to show that the county paid the interest on the bonds every year, down to that which fell due January 1, 1881; that in March 1872, when the bonds were registered {{in the office of the}} auditor of the state, they belonged to the company, and that it afterwards sold them for full value to various parties. At the close of the evidence, the court instructed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant excepted to such instruction.|$|R
40|$|The Basra Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus griseldis) {{is one of}} the {{flagship}} bird species of Mesopotamia. Before Al-Sheikhly, Nader, and Barbanera (2013), very little was known on the breeding ecology of this species in the southern marshes of Iraq. Al-Sheikhly and co-workers carried out an intensive field research in 2006 – 2007 and 2011 – 2012, and produced data on the biology of the Basra Reed Warbler, this representing the first contribution to the conservation of the species in Iraq. In their Comment, Porter et al. (2014) question part of the findings provided by Al-Sheikhly et al. (2013). Nevertheless, Porter et al. do not provide any opposing experimental <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>reply,</b> we disclose <b>in</b> more detail information so as to confirm the reliability of our research.
