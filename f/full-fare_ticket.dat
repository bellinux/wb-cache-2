50|$|Unlike rail {{passes in}} some other {{countries}} (e.g. InterRail Pass, Japan Rail Pass or Korea Rail Pass), or even THSR Pass in same country Taiwan, TR Pass is available also to local people. Both General Pass and Student Pass are offered; while the General Pass is valid for all classes of trains (excluding some trains specially designated by TRA), the Student Pass is only valid for Chu-Kuang Train (莒光號) or slower trains. Passengers using the Student Pass cannot ride on Tze-Chiang Train (自強號), the fastest and most frequent trains operated by TRA, and other trains at the same level, even by paying the price difference between the pass and a single-trip ticket; a <b>full-fare</b> separate <b>ticket</b> would be needed instead. Taiwan High Speed Rail and those privately run rail lines, e.g. the Alishan Forest Railway, {{are not covered by}} both versions of the pass, as they are not operated by TRA.|$|R
5000|$|Most exit row seats {{provide a}} few more inches of seat pitch {{compared}} to non-exit row seats so that passengers have more space to access the exit. Seats {{in front of an}} exit row {{may not be able to}} recline, which can limit their comfort on longer flights. Nonetheless, airlines have taken advantage of this extra space by reserving exit row seats for frequent fliers or charging fees for booking them. A few airlines have gone to branding exit row seats as a premium economy product - on Virgin America's A320, the exit rows (as well as bulkhead seats) are considered [...] "Main Cabin Select" [...] where meals, alcohol, pay-per-view movies and a higher baggage allowance are all included. Main Cabin Select is sold as a separate class of service between coach and first class, and a restrictive MCS fare tends to be equivalent to a <b>full-fare</b> economy <b>ticket.</b> Similarly, JetBlue uses the exit rows as part of their [...] "Even More Space" [...] section.|$|R
