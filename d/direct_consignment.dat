In this report we examine the Tanegashima Agriculture Public Corporation in Kagoshima Prefecture. First, we look at how this corporation {{plays an important role}} as an agricultural trust organization providing management support to large-scale farming households as well as to part-time enterprises operated by senior citizens. Secondly, we point out that a reasonable farming consignment system and a co-operation system between consigners and consignees has been established that can be certified by three aspects: the establishment of mechanized systems of farming over all regions; the core household 2 ̆ 7 s growth upon the adjustment between the <b>direct</b> <b>consignment</b> and re-consignment; management improvement with the introduction of new crops. Finally, this paper summarizes the elements of stable management provided by a public corporation that ensures the benefits of the farming consignment. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of <b>direct</b> <b>consignment</b> compared with saleyard marketing on beef quality and palatability. A total of 258 cattle (mean carcass weight 227 ± 19 kg) from nine vendor properties in Victoria, Australia were used. From each vendor group (about 30 cattle/vendor), half were either: (1) processed through a saleyard and then sent to the abattoir or (2) directly consigned to the abattoir. All cattle were slaughtered at the same abattoir and the lairage and postslaughter management of the cattle and their carcasses was standardised. The cattle that had been directly consigned were slaughtered the day after dispatch from the property, whereas saleyard cattle were slaughtered 2 days after dispatch. Striploin (longissimus lumborum) samples were evaluated 1 day postslaughter and after 14 days aging. Overall, marketing method had only a small impact on the various meat quality measures and palatability. A significant vendor×marketing method interaction was found for most traits including muscle glycogen (semimembranosus and semitendinosus), pH (1, 3 and 24 h postslaughter), L*, a * and b * colour values and consumer panel scores [tenderness, flavour and combined score (MQ 4) ]. Juiciness scores were unaffected by marketing method but were significantly influenced by vendor group (P< 0. 001). For MQ 4 score, there was a general trend showing that steaks from cattle that had been marketed through the saleyard had marginally lower MQ 4 scores than those that had been directly consigned in five of the eight groups. However, this trend was only significant for two of the five groups. A significant three-way interaction between vendor group×marketing method × aging duration was found for shear force (P< 0. 001...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{primarily}} concerned with differences in returns per pound of wool accruing to Montana wool growers by the alternative methods of sale to various types of buyers. The results presented in the table's indicate that no appreciable difference {{can be attributed to}} selling wool either on a graded or ungraded basis. They do indicate an advantage for the farm flock grower, who produced less than 3, 000 pounds, to sell his wool by consignment to local wool pools. The results also imply an advantage for the farm flock grower producing from 3, 000 to 5, 000 pounds and above, to sell their wool directly to buyers. The results of this study also indicate that net returns are largest on both <b>direct</b> and <b>consignment</b> sales to manufacturers, implying that returns are highest " to growers when handler's margins are not a cost to manufacturers. This indication must-be qualified, however, because of the limited number of manufacturers who bought wool in the state in 1956. In certain instances it may be less costly for the manufacturer to buy in volume from handlers in the central markets. The price paid for wool is affected by the competitive structure of the market and by supply and demand conditions within the market. This study points out that the wool grower can sell all of his wool at the market price, but can sell non...|$|R
40|$|Minerals {{that are}} sold to {{collectors}} are often produced by artisanal and small scale miners {{in many developing}} countries. The market for collector minerals is not well understood by most government agencies or NGOs but has a large impact on the artisanal and small miners that {{have the opportunity to}} produce these minerals because of the high prices that can be realized. This paper describes the collector mineral market that is held annually in Tucson, Arizona, that analyzes the competitive forces that affect the profitability of the mineral dealers at the show and describes potential methods for artisanal and small scale miners to participate successfully in the show. Most collector minerals produced by artisanal and small-scale miners are valued for their aesthetic qualities instead of mineral content. The 43 shows that operate during the first two weeks in February make up the largest gem and mineral show in the world, the Tucson Show. The Tucson Mineral Show is a subgroup of six shows that specialize primarily in collector minerals. There are several competitive forces at the Tucson Mineral Show that can affect the profit potential of dealers that participate in the show. These forces include potential entrants, suppliers, buyers, substitutes, and rivalry among existing competitors. New entrants face several barriers to entering the market place including the supply side economies of scale, demand side benefits of scale, and capital requirements. Because of these barriers, {{the cost of doing business}} and the way that promoters organize and manage the shows, it is difficult for artisanal and small scale miners to enter the show and compete with established dealers. However, with support from entities such as local governments, non-profit organizations, and international organizations the artisanal and small scale miners have the potential to have their minerals sold at the Tucson Shows for prices that would be greater than what can be achieved in the local market. Methods to help the artisanal and small scale miners compete include <b>direct</b> sales or <b>consignments</b> to retail dealers, tailgating, development of sales co-operatives, and the creation of an artisanal/small scale mineral show.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to understand textile retailers 2 ̆ 7 interactions with artisans in the procurement, development, and production of textile products; describe how they conceptualize tradition; expand scholarly models of tradition; and contribute to a model of the craft production and marketing system;Fieldwork was conducted in Antigua, Guatemala for nearly four months. Data collection methods included participant observation, ecological traverse, interviews, and observations. Short interviews (N = 29) and observations (N = 38) were conducted with informants identified in the ecological traverse. Informants for the long interviews (N = 14) and observations (N = 20) were purposefully drawn from the informants from the large sample. Data were analyzed using open and theoretical coding and constant comparison. Three overarching themes of products, relationships, and tradition, and a grounded theory of tradition emerged;Retailers acquired their textile products using in-house product development, <b>direct</b> purchasing, and <b>consignment.</b> Communication evolved through verbal, visual, and written techniques. They employed production steps of material sourcing, sample making, and testing. Internal and external forces affected change in textile products. Both product exclusivity and quality were concerns for retailers. Textile retailers maintained strong linkages with key individuals. They established a variety of composite relationships on which their businesses were founded;For textile retailers, tradition was composed of characteristics based upon function and meaning, tools and equipment, production techniques, fibers, color, and decorative elements. Retailers conceptualized textile traditions in terms of degree of traditionality that have been visually presented on a series of nine concrete and abstract continua. Concrete continua were guided retailers 2 ̆ 7 daily activities and decision making, while abstract continua influenced retailers 2 ̆ 7 shop foci, missions, and marketing strategies. Concrete and abstract continua were interdependent as retailers negotiated between the continua, their own beliefs about tradition, and the goals of their businesses. Retailers 2 ̆ 7 relationships served to foster their beliefs about tradition;The decomposition of tradition into its constituent characteristics and retailers 2 ̆ 7 conceptualization and negotiation of tradition in their textile products are important contributions toward understanding the complex phenomenon of tradition.

40|$|African and Caribbean {{countries}} {{pioneered the}} export of fresh tropical fruits and out-of-season vegetables to Europe 30 years' ego but they have since lost a substantial {{share of the market}} to new exporters from Latin America and Asia. Many ACP countries have the climate, soils, water resources and the skills to produce quality products: a determined effort is needed to win back a larger share of what is now an expanding market. Fruit and vegetable production has a multiple role in ACP countries: as a source of food for local markets and for export; as a provider of employment and as a source of foreign exchange. A majority of countries would benefit from increasing their production of horticultural crops. This would raise national nutritional levels and provide a larger production base from which the best quality produce could be selected for export. Several African and Caribbean countries are already engaged in exporting what at first appear to be large quantities of fruit and vegetables: Cote d'Ivoire produces 20, 000 tonnes of mangoes, 200, 000 tonnes of pineapples and 1. 5 million tonnes of bananas each year, mostly for export; the Caribbean is also a major exporter of bananas, Kenya has developed exports of pineapples and French beans, Zambia exports mangetout peas, Burkina Faso exports mangoes and Madagascar exports litchis. However, in world trade terms ACP exports to the EC are both relatively small and heavily reliant on fruit, particularly bananas. Of the nine million tonnes of fresh fruit and vegetables imported into the EC in 1990, 96 % was fruit ando nly 10 % (920, 000 tonnes) was from ACP States. Of this, 46 % came from the Caribbean, 39 % from West and Central Africa and 15 % from East Africa and the Indian Ocean and Pacific States. If bananas, on which the Caribbean countries are highly dependent, are excluded, the total tonnage exported by ACP States was 300, 000 tonnes (3. 3 % of total EC imports), of which only 40, 000 tonnes (0. 45 %) were vegetables. How competitors succeed ACP countries obviously face keen competition, in particular from Central, South American and Asian countries but also from the Mediterranean region. Under the Lome Convention ACP agricultural and horticultural exports have enjoyed an advantage, entering the EC without the tariffs levied on many products from non-ACP producers. But with the eventual prospect of a single market within the EC and the removal of tariffs, ACP exporters must be prepared to produce fruit and vegetables of the highest quality at a competitive price and to supply a consistent volume. Mediterranean and Near-East countries have lower transport costs, being closer to Europe, but Asian and Latin American exporters are more distant than those in Africa. The success of Asian and Latin American exporters has been based on thorough market research to identify consumer preferences, funding of research to develop new, high yielding, flavoursome and visually attractive varieties, and disciplined production and investment in cold storage, transport and marketing promotion. The mango is a fruit which has enormous potential in the European market yet the ACP share of EC imports has dropped from 40 % in 1981 to 18 % in 1990. Meanwhile Central and South American countries, notably Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela have increased their market share in the same period from 36 % to 61 %. These countries are able to supply the European market for six months of the year, long enough to build up a good business relationship with European importers, whereas the ACP season is much shorter. Major exporters are also constantly monitoring the market and are prepared to abandon varieties or product lines if they recognise that consumer demand is changing or if a competitor develops an unassailable advantage. They are also flexible enough to develop new products rapidly. Meeting the challenge At present 70 % of ACP fruit supply to the EC consists of bananas: pineapple, citrus and coconut make up a further 27 %. All other fruit, i. e. 25, 000 tonnes, comprises only 3 % of the total. Research into the opportunities for extending this 'basket of fruit' needs to be undertaken. COLEACP, the marketing organization responsibile for trade links between ACP countries and the EC is able to assist with advice and market information. The Deputy Director, Mme C. Guichard, believes that challenges can be met and cites several successful examples, particularly {{the export of}} avocado and kiwifruit. Several African and Caribbean countries have risen to the challenges posed by aggressive competitors. Kenya has developed horticultural exports, including French beans, strawberries, avocado, pineapple and carnations, which are now worth US$ 16 million/year. With the decline in coffee prices these products have become an increasingly important source of foreign exchange. Zimbabwe has developed profitable export of mangoes, strawberries, bananas, grapes, citrus and kiwifruit. Cote d'Ivoire has long been a major exporter of pineapples and Ghana is trying now to emulate its neighbour. Burkina Faso exports French beans and mango. Madagascar exports 4200 tonnes of litchis per year 1000 tonnes by air and 3200 tonnes by sea; with an annual production of 35 - 40, 000 tonnes, there is ample scope for increasing the proportion exported. The Agricultural Diversification Coordinating Unit of the Eastern Caribbean States, based in Dominica, is actively pursuing a diversification programme to reduce dependence on bananas, coconut and limes and the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) is undertaking research to broaden the base of varieties of passion fruit and citrus grown in member countries, and to develop pro auction of new product lines including carambola, soursop and sapodilla. Unfortunately fruit and vegetable research has not been given a high priority in ACP countries over the last 30 years and also there has been a lack of training in horticulture. Dr Linda Wickham, Assistant Dean of Research at the University of the West Indies, Trinidad, believes that research, particularly in the field of post-harvest technology, is essential. She also recognizes the need to educate producers in the Caribbean to recognize that their own criteria for selection of produce - knowledge of keeping and cooking quality and taste rather than appearance - are not those of consumers in Europe, whose priorities are attractive visual appearance, consistent size and absence of blemishes. However, researching new varieties is only a beginning. The European consumer not only has considerable buying power but is also becoming increasingly selective. It is therefore essential that any country wishing to enter that market must ensure that there is a regular supply of consistently high quality produce in pre-determined quantities and at an agreed price. Planning for expansion While there is an urgent need to find new varieties, and even new crops, it is essential that due care is taken not to introduce diseases or pests during transfer of seed or vegetative planting materials. Quarantine regulations must be applied and both exporting and importing countries, as well as farmers, must take responsibility for ensuring exchange of clean planting materials. Pineapple nematodes were accidentally introduced into Ghana when growers embarked on an accelerated programme of planting improved varieties developed elsewhere in the region. Tissue culture, or aerial root propagating material, would have avoided this problem but there are no facilities for tissue culture in Ghana as yet. Sites for new plantations must be chosen with care. Mango plantations, for example, should not be established in humid zones where disease will always remain a problem. And for export crops, the distance between farm and port of exit should not be more than 100 km in order to avoid long haulage and the inevitable bruising that results. Increasingly, crops will have to be grown with very strict control over pesticide usage, especially just before or after harvest. With consumer pressure to reduce pesticide residues in food commodities and the tightening of EC laws concerning residues, alternatives to existing spraying regimes and post-harvest treatments must be developed: for example integrated pest management systems incorporating cultural and biological control measures. In the whole chain of production from grower to consumer {{one of the most critical}} links to protect quality is post-harvest storage. For tropical and sub-tropical produce the use of chilling facilities to remove field-heat and to maintain low temperatures during storage and transport is essential. However, the temperatures involved are critical and without reliable equipment and power supplies and well trained staff, all the investment in production may be lost between field or orchard and the supermarket shelf. Nearly every exporter in Zimbabwe has on-farm coldstore facilities to remove field-heat by pre-cooling and storing at the optimum temperature to prevent physiological deterioration. And there has been heavy investment in insulated trucks and cold stores at the airport for holding produce in transit. Multiple retailers (supermarkets) are expanding their share of the retail market throughout the EC and in the UK they now represent 50 % of retail distribution. The demands set by the multiples on their suppliers are high, not only in terms of quality of the product, but also on reliability of supply, volume and delivery schedule. They also expect standards of hygiene adopted by food processing industries and, where fruit or vegetables are being pre-packed, it is essential that the packhouse environment, workers' clothing and hands and any water used for washing all meet the highest standards of public health. Wherever air cargo capacity is available and prices are competitive, airfreight will be preferred for exporting perishable produce. However exporters should target only those countries served by <b>direct</b> flights; when <b>consignments</b> are trans-shipped onto a second flight they are inevitably subjected to a 3 - 5 hour period on the tarmac awaiting loading. In addition, the 'last-on' port of any cargo is vulnerable to last-minute offloads and trans-shipped consignments are the least likely to be put into coldstore facilities at an intermediate airport. Seafreight is a lower cost alternative for less perishable products but again temperature, and even the gases in the atmosphere, have to be controlled. Packaging must also be stronger in order to survive longer journey times, dockside trans-shipments and road or rail distribution on arrival in Europe. Finally, exporters should be aware of changes in packaging regulations in EC member countries. For instance, suppliers to Germany must use only standard pallets and these must be recyclable wherever possible. Where non-returnable pallets are used, they may be made only of untreated wood. Packaging must not include a mix of paper and plastic nor should toxic inks be used. Similar regulations are likely to be implemented throughout the EC. Worth the trouble? Competition is fierce and the standards demanded are high. It will not be easy for ACP countries to maintain, let alone increase, their share of fruit and vegetable exports to Europe. It may also appear easier for large-scale producers to manage production, storage, transport and marketing rather than farmers on smaller acreages. However, the rewards for successful exporters will be a share of a still-expanding market and foreign exchange to make up for reduced income from more traditional exported commodities, many of which are now in over-supply. Countries such as Kenya, Mauritius (see box) and Zimbabwe have also proved that a wide range of horticultural products can be grown to a high standard by small-scale growers: over 80 % of Kenyan producers are small-scale farmers who, with effective technical services provided by government and the private sector, are prepared to accept the challenge of producing for export. Government intervention and investment does not have to be on a large scale but it must be targeted to critical areas. It can be most effective where it plays a regulatory role and facilitates growth through horticultural research, infrastructural development, incentives and support services. In addition, the EC Commission encourages joint research projects and fosters links between ACP States and between ACP States and other countries. In the past new export crops such as fruit and vegetables have often been considered by policy makers to be less important than food crops and traditional export commodities. Now it seems that the rewards for successful trading in fresh produce may be more attractive. But exporting is a team effort and government policy-makers, research scientists, commercial exporters and farmers must be prepared to work together. If serious attention can be given to market research, varietal development, coldstorage facilities, transport, flexibility and marketing promotion, ACP countries have much to gain. African and Caribbean countries pioneered the export of fresh tropical fruits and out-of-season vegetables to Europe 30 years' ego but they have since lost a substantial share of the market to new exporters from Latin America and Asia.
