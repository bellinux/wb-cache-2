40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{evidence}} from 2 previous meta-analyses that interventions to promote poison prevention behaviours {{are effective in}} increasing a range of poison prevention practices in households with children. The published meta-analyses compared any intervention against a "usual care or no intervention" which potentially limits {{the usefulness of the}} analysis to decision makers. We aim to use network meta-analysis to simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions to increase prevalence of safe storage of i) Medicines only, ii) Other household products only, iii) Poisons (both medicines and non-medicines), iv) Poisonous plants; and v) Possession of poison control centre (PCC) telephone number in households with children. METHODS: Data on the effectiveness of poison prevention interventions was extracted from primary studies identified in 2 newly-undertaken systematic reviews. Effect estimates were pooled across studies using a random effects network meta-analysis model. RESULTS: 28 of the 47 primary studies identified were included in the analysis. Compared to usual care intervention, the intervention with education and low cost/free equipment elements was most effective in promoting safe storage of medicines (odds ratio 2. 51, 95 % credible interval 1. 01 to 6. 00) while interventions with education, low cost/free equipment, home safety <b>inspection</b> and <b>fitting</b> components were most effective in promoting safe storage of other household products (2. 52, 1. 12 to 7. 13), safe storage of poisons (11. 10, 1. 60 to 141. 50) and possession of PCC number (38. 82, 2. 19 to 687. 10). No one intervention package was more effective than the others in promoting safe storage of poisonous plants. CONCLUSION: The most effective interventions varied by poison prevention practice, but education alone was not the most effective intervention for any poison prevention practice. Commissioners and providers of poison prevention interventions should tailor the interventions they commission or provide to the poison prevention practices they wish to promote. HIGHLIGHTS: Network meta-analysis is useful for comparing multiple injury-prevention interventions. More intensive poison prevention interventions were more effective than education alone. Education and low cost/free equipment was most effective in promoting safe storage of medicines.

40|$|The Power-Normal {{distribution}} (PN) originates {{from the}} inverse Box-Cox transformation {{and is used}} in this study to fit the frequency distributions of tree diameter and height. PN is flexible in describing different shapes of observed distributions as indicated by the certain areas in the skewness x kurtosis shape plane. The estimation of the parameters using maximum likelihood is straightforward and the resulting numerical properties are desirable. The shapes achieved by PN are very diverse, even though only three parameters are used. In forestry, Johnson’s System Bounded distribution (SB) has been widely used to fit tree diameter distributions, but it is often susceptible to numerical problems when fitted by maximum likelihood estimation.

40|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}} (DVT) {{is a serious}} postoperative complication and nurses should therefore observe symptoms in an early stage and implement preventive provisions, for example use of graduated compression stockings (GCS). The nurse is also responsible for making sure that ordinate GCS tried and used correctly by the patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the latest research regarding the efficacy of GCS in prevention of postoperative DVT and if there are any incorrectness in usage. And assess guidelines and recommendations for the usage of GCS. Method: Literature review. Search was done in database PubMed and Cinahl. Seven scientific articles were analyzed and national guidelines were summarized. The result indicates that GCS has small effect in preventing DVT in postoperative patients, according to some studies. The national guidelines and recommendation comprehends risk assessment of DVT, and daily observation/control of the legs (skin <b>inspection,</b> the correct <b>fitting,</b> well –informed patient and documentation). Conclusion: The result of this review isn´t concurrent but majority of studies shows minor effect in preventing DVT.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new point cloud registration strategy for 3 D surface inspection, named object-oriented method. Traditionally, the registration methods use a fitting based algorithm, which is a recursive process and too time consuming to do quality <b>inspection.</b> Moreover, the <b>fitting</b> based algorithms require that the measured data and the CAD model have same shapes. Photogrammetry and ICP-based fitting algorithms are commonly used in this area. However, both of them cannot be applied directly to online point cloud registration for quality inspection. Since it requires: 1. no markers on the object surface. 2. a very limited inspection period of time for each part on an assembly line. 3. the measured work piece can not be assumed as same as the CAD model. The online registration is currently demanded by 3 D surface inspection in automotive glasses manufacturing industry. The object-oriented registration method is developed based on matching the invariant geometric features between two data sets instead of the artificial markers and the recursive fitting algorithms. Therefore the registration speed is much higher. A datum filter is developed to extract the invariant features from the measured point cloud, {{based on the information}} that the CAD model carries. The curvature information and moment values are used as characteristic features to design the filter. The registration matrix is calculated by the invariance parts in both data sets. The new online registration method has been applied to the quality inspection in the windshield manufacturing industry. Experimental results are presented in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed strategy. © 2008 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{sensitivity and}} specificity of proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy of the prostate with external surface coil elements at 3 T for differentiation of cancer from healthy tissue within an acceptable measurement time, by using histopathologic findings as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study {{was approved by the}} institutional review board; informed consent was obtained. Forty-five men (age range, 51 - 70 years) underwent 3 -T MR imaging with external radiofrequency surface coils for signal reception. MR spectroscopy was performed with acquisition-weighted three-dimensional water- and lipid-suppressed point-resolved spectroscopy pulse sequence. Voxels were classified into healthy peripheral zone, central gland, and periurethral zone and cancer tissue. Cancer voxels were classified according to cancer size and certainty in matching histopathologic findings with MR images. After visual <b>inspection</b> of automated <b>fitting</b> of classified voxels, the choline plus creatine-to-citrate (Cho + Cr/Cit) ratio was calculated for all tissues. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (A(z)) values were used to assess accuracy of discrimination of cancer from healthy tissues. P <. 05 indicated a significant difference. RESULTS: After exclusion of four patients with no voxels that passed visual inspection of the automated fit, a median of 82 % of the classified voxels per patient was used in the analysis. Mean Cho + Cr/Cit ratios for healthy tissues were 0. 22 +/- 0. 12 (standard deviation) for peripheral zone, 0. 34 +/- 0. 14 for central gland, and 0. 36 +/- 0. 20 for periurethral area; all were significantly different from that of cancer (P <. 001). A(z) for discrimination of probable and definite cancer tissue from healthy tissue for the peripheral zone (0. 84) was significantly higher than that for the central gland (0. 69) (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional proton MR spectroscopy of the prostate, with a combination of only external radiofrequency surface coils at 3 T, can be used to discriminate cancer from healthy tissue...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to characterize child passenger safety resources in Michigan and to analyze the impact of Michigan’s child passenger safety technicians (CPSTs), who are certified to instruct caregivers on how to correctly use child restraints. The objective was to provide OHSP with the information to guide equitable distribution of child passenger safety resources throughout Michigan. Analyses used existing data from the 2010 U. S. Census, the American Community Survey 2009 - 2013, Michigan State Police crash reports from 2010 through 2014, Michigan Office of Highway Safety Planning (OHSP) lists of certified CPSTs and their locations from 2012 to 2015, OHSP records of child restraint system distribution, and child passenger safety checklist form data from Safe Kids Michigan. Counties were considered areas at risk (with greatest need for child passenger safety resources) based on a composite risk score that included population characteristics including minority race, Hispanic/non-English speaking, poverty, and low educational attainment and crash-related injuries or suboptimal child passenger restraint behaviors associated with a crash adjusted for the child population ≤ 9 years. Needs and resources were assessed for the 83 counties and 15 OHSP Traffic Safety Regions in Michigan. A survey of CPSTs in Michigan was conducted to gather data on the workforce characteristics. Results show that counties with the highest risk scores are concentrated in the southern Lower Peninsula of Michigan and the counties with {{the largest number of}} CPSTs are in the Lower Peninsula. The total number of CPSTs in Michigan has been stable around 950, with 140 to 260 new CPSTs in a given year. Only Keweenaw, Alcona, and Montmorency counties had no CPSTs who reported living or working there. The majority of CPSTs self-identified as white race. Spanish was the most common non-English language spoken by CPSTs. The largest proportions of CPSTs worked in law enforcement, social work/health education, and healthcare. Of the CPSTs considered “high-activity”, most were both paid and volunteered for seat checks and many reported an affiliation with a Safe Kids Coalition. Car seat <b>inspection</b> (or <b>fitting)</b> stations and events were offered primarily in counties throughout the southern Lower Peninsula, with the largest number in metro Detroit and Kent counties. The number of children ≤ 9 years per CPST per county was lowest in Gogebic (166) and highest in Jackson (4618). Forty counties had 1, 000 or more children per CPST and were distributed throughout the state. Data from 32, 411 Safe Kids Michigan seat checks revealed that nearly half resulted in a change in restraint type, installation method, or location in the vehicle. Half of seat checks included the distribution of a child restraint system. The most services per child ≤ 9 years were provided in the following OHSP regions: Thumb Area, West Michigan, South Central, Traverse Bay Area, Huron Valley, and Upper Peninsula Regions. The fewest services per child ≤ 9 years were provided in the Northern Lower, Southwest, Oakland, and Macomb/St. Clair Regions. In conclusion, the child passenger safety needs are not evenly distributed throughout the state. There is wide variation in the current distribution of child passenger safety resources. Many counties with the most resources have a greater unmet need than lower-resourced counties due to the large total number of children and children considered at risk living within them...|$|R
