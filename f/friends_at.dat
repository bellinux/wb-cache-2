5|$|Akhmatova {{wrote that}} by 1935 {{every time she}} went to see someone off {{at the train station}} as they went into exile, she'd find herself {{greeting}} <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> every step as so many of St Petersburg's intellectual and cultural figures would be leaving on the same train. In her poetry circles Mayakovsky and Esenin committed suicide and Marina Tsvetaeva would follow them in 1941, after returning from exile.|$|E
5|$|Balzac wrote Louis Lambert {{during the}} summer of 1832 while he was staying with <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> the Château de Saché, and {{published}} three editions with three different titles. The novel contains a minimal plot, focusing mostly on the metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius protagonist and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is not a significant example of the realist style for which Balzac became famous, the novel provides insight into the author's own childhood. Specific details and events from the author's life – including punishment from teachers and social ostracism – suggest a fictionalized autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Betances' {{role in the}} Cánovas {{assassination}} {{is described}} by Puerto Rican (born in France) author Luis Bonafoux in his biography about Betances (written in 1901), and partially corroborated by later historians.

Tosti and his friends would hold regular social events, during one of which Angiolillo was introduced to Betances.|$|E

5|$|Potter had {{maintained}} {{contact with her}} last governess Annie Carter Moore and had grown fond of her children. Through the 1890s, she sent illustrated story letters to the children. Mrs. Moore recognised the literary and artistic value of the letters and urged her former charge to publish. Potter liked the suggestion, and, in 1900, revised a tale she had written for five-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, and fashioned a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for the tale, she published it for family and <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> her own expense in December 1901.|$|E

5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
