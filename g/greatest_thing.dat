500|$|In {{the first}} season finale, the creators ensured that Stark spoke of Steve Rogers as [...] "the <b>greatest</b> <b>thing</b> [...] ever did". This was done {{to set up the}} former's {{obsession}} with super soldier serums and identify [...] "something/someone he’s prouder of than his own son", which pays off in Captain America: Civil War: in the film, Stark is shown still attempting to recreate his super soldier serum in the 1990s; also, his love for Rogers adds to the antagonistic relationship between the latter and Tony.|$|E

500|$|According to Joe Romersa, an engineer/drummer in Los Angeles, whom ahbez bequeathed {{with master}} tapes, photos, and final works, ahbez wanted a {{correction}} {{made to the}} lyrics saying [...] "To be loved in return, is {{too much of a}} deal, and there's no deal in love.", and that instead it should read [...] "The <b>greatest</b> <b>thing</b> you'll ever learn is to love and be loved, just to love, and be loved."

Aristotle wrote in the Poetics that [...] "the <b>greatest</b> <b>thing</b> by far {{is to be a}} master of metaphor." [...] Since the rise of Modernism, some poets have opted for a poetic diction that de-emphasizes rhetorical devices, {{attempting}} instead the direct presentation of things and experiences and the exploration of tone. On the other hand, Surrealists have pushed rhetorical devices to their limits, making frequent use of catachresis.|$|E

Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, his doctors diagnosed him with diabetes, a disease that also afflicted his brothers. Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state of medicine at the time could not prevent the continued deterioration of Robinson's physical condition from the disease.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song relate to a 1940s Los Angeles-based group called [...] "Nature Boys", a {{subculture}} of proto-hippies of which ahbez was a member. Instrumentalist Chris Tyle noted that the lyrics are a musical self-portrait of ahbez, with the lines like [...] "There was a boy, A very strange, enchanted boy, They say he wandered very far, Very far, over land and sea". But he {{believed that it was}} the song's last line that made it the most poignant: [...] "The <b>greatest</b> <b>thing</b> you'll ever learn, Is just to love and be loved in return". Various interpretations of the line are given by academics, with the eponymous nature boy being a child, advising on love and relationship, or an adult hippie talking about his journey and inner-love. According to author Jeffrey P. Dennis, the song presented a homo-romantic theme, with the eponymous nature boy visiting Cole on a [...] "magic day" [...] and explaining that [...] "the <b>greatest</b> <b>thing</b> you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return". Author Raymond Knapp described the track as a [...] "mystically charged vagabond song" [...] whose lyrics evoked an intense sense of loss and haplessness, with the final line delivering a universal truth, described by Knapp as [...] "indestructible" [...] and [...] "salvaged somehow from the perilous journey of life".|$|E
