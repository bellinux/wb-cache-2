The film, only ten days after its debut, influenced the Central Board of Secondary Education to provide extra time to special children—including the visually impaired, physically challenged and dyslexic—during exams. In 2008, Mumbai's civic body also opened 12classrooms for autistic students.

Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers {{about what to do}} if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E

A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave the instructions on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the jewels.

5|$|King {{shows how}} enslaved {{children}} were educated for survival and resistance. This education was usually informal and parental and taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> slaveowners and their abuse. King also named literacy and religion's {{role in their}} education. Kids were taught mutual cooperation as a virtue between slaves. Few slaves had formal education {{and those who did}} were artisans. Those educated or given religious training were only by the fortune of their owner's interests. King's stories tell of children in domestic, farm, and industrial work, who spent their free time in celebrations, dances, games, folk rituals, and hunting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Microencapsulated Phase change {{material}} can absorb and release {{large amounts of}} latent heat over a defined temperature range as its physical state changes. The microencapsulated PCM has high energy density and isothermal behavior during charging and discharging and can avoid the contradiction of the energy supply and demand unbalance in time and space.

5|$|The first Home Army {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with the Soviet threat had been NIE, formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 NIE ("NO") was disbanded and transformed into an Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.|$|E

5|$|The {{views of}} the Croatian {{leadership}} on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the JNA's role in the Croatian Serb revolt gradually evolved between January and September 1991. Croatian President Franjo Tuđman's initial plan was to win European Community (EC) and United States support, so he dismissed Špegelj's advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in Croatia in late 1990. During the Ten-Day War in June and July 1991, Špegelj once again urged Tuđman to act while the JNA fought Slovenia's TO. Špegelj's calls were echoed by Šime Đodan, who succeeded him as Defence Minister in July. Špegelj remained {{in command of the}} ZNG.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with was <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive {{that it would}} be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low {{regard for the}} simple life they led and also for their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as saying {{in the last quarter of}} the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army.

Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.|$|E

5|$|Montcalm and Vaudreuil, {{who did not}} {{get along}} with each other, {{differed}} on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the British threat.

Vaudreuil, who had limited combat experience, wanted to divide the French forces, with about 5,000 each at Carillon and Louisbourg, and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the British in the Mohawk River on the northwestern frontiers of the Province of New York. Montcalm believed this to be folly, as the plan would enable the British to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the French attack. Vaudreuil prevailed, and in June 1758 Montcalm left Quebec for Carillon.|$|E
