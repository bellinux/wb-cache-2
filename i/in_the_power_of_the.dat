5|$|The New Thought movement, {{which emerged}} in the 1880s, was {{responsible}} for popularizing belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind to achieve prosperity. While initially focused on achieving mental and physical health, New Thought teachers such as Charles Fillmore made material success a major emphasis of the movement. By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being common features of both self-help literature and popular psychology.|$|E
5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious {{than those of the}} incumbent. Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. Bush {{in the aftermath of the}} 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E
5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which {{laid the groundwork for}} the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} political development and feudalisation of Bulgaria in the 13th century {{resulted in a}} rising number of serfs, {{as well as an}} increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landed nobility. This, in turn, led to aspirations for more self-rule among the most influential nobles. Many of them established semi-independent fiefdoms that nominally recognized the emperor in Tarnovo and greatly reduced the capacity of the central authorities to deal with external threats. In {{the second half of the}} 13th century, the peasantry was losing personal privileges to the benefit of the secular and religious feudal lords, which in turn reduced the peasants' income and opportunities, worsening their lives. In parallel, the inability of Constantine Tikh to terminate the constant Mongol incursions in the north-east of the country shattered the pillars of the state institutions in Dobrudzha and contributed to the outbreak of the uprising and its swift success. The Mongol raids were carried out by the semi-independent chief Nogai Khan, who was more powerful than the legitimate ruler of the Golden Horde, Mengu-Timur (r. 1266–1280), and ruled over the steppes of modern Moldova and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The tranomasina were {{destroyed}} in March 1897 by French authorities who removed {{the bodies of}} the sovereigns interred here and relocated them to the royal tombs at the Rova of Antananarivo. The rich collection of funerary objects enclosed within the tombs was also removed for display in the Manjakamiadana palace on the Antananarivo rova grounds, which the Colonial Authority transformed into an ethnological museum. This was done in an effort to desanctify the city of Ambohimanga and break the spirit of the Menalamba resistance fighters who had been rebelling against French colonization for the past year, break popular belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal ancestors, and relegate Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. A French garrison was housed within the royal city and military buildings were erected on top of the stone tomb foundations. A kitchen and military canteen were built on top of the tombs of Andrianampoinimerina and Andriamasinavalona. By 1904, the military buildings were likewise demolished, leaving the stone tomb foundations intact.|$|E

25|$|Some sources {{suggest that}} Alan de Rupe (rather than Saint Dominic) {{was the major}} {{influence}} on the rosary in the 15th century, while other sources seek a middle ground to these two views.

25|$|The Franco-Prussian War (War of 1870) was the {{culmination}} of years of tension between the two nations, which finally came to a head on 19 July 1870, when Emperor Napoleon III of the second Empire declared war against Prussia.

25|$|With the spectre {{of foreign}} {{influence}} over the strike thus removed, negotiations began, and the strike ended in early July. Labor leaders who {{had been accused of}} having ties with Guatemala were jailed, and the final settlement, which met few of the original demands, was signed with elements more acceptable to the government and the fruit companies than to the workers. Despite the limited gains, however, the strike did mark a major step toward greater influence for organized labor in Honduras and a decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruit companies.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{essentially}} consensus among historians and academics that the New Deal brought about a large increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal government, {{there has been some}} scholarly debate concerning the results of this federal expansion. Historians like Arthur M. Schlesinger and James T. Patterson have argued that the augmentation of the federal government exacerbated tensions between the federal and state governments. However, contemporaries such as Ira Katznelson have suggested that, due to certain conditions on the allocation of federal funds, namely that the individual states get to control them, the federal government managed to avoid any tension with states over their rights.|$|E

25|$|After the French Revolution of 1789, Catherine {{rejected}} many {{principles of}} the Enlightenment she had once viewed favourably.

She provided support to a Polish antireform group known as the Targowica Confederation. After defeating Polish loyalist forces in the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and in the Kościuszko Uprising (1794), Russia completed the partitioning of Poland, dividing all of the remaining Commonwealth territory with Prussia and Austria (1795).|$|E
25|$|Benevento was {{certainly}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romans in 274 BC, when Pyrrhus {{was defeated in}} a great battle, fought in its immediate neighborhood, by the consul Curius Dentatus. Six years later (268 BC) they further sought to secure its possession by establishing there a Roman colony with Latin rights. It was {{at this time that}} it first assumed the name of Beneventum, having previously been called Maleventum, a name which the Romans regarded as of evil augury, and changed into one of a more fortunate signification. It is probable that the Oscan or Samnite name was Maloeis, or Malieis (Μαλιείς in Ancient Greek), whence the form Maleventum would derive, like Agrigentum from Acragas (modern Agrigento), Selinuntium from Selinus (the ruins of which are at modern Selinunte), etc.|$|E
25|$|After {{securing}} the king in his throne, the Portuguese got permission {{to build a}} fort –- Fort Kochi (Fort Emmanuel) (after the reigning king of Portugal) -- surrounding the Portuguese factory, {{in order to protect}} it from any further attacks.

Meanwhile, the Portuguese secretly tried to enter into an alliance with the Zamorins. Later attempts by the Zamorin at conquering the Kochi port was thwarted by the Cochin Raja with the help of the Portuguese. Slowly, the Portuguese armory at Kochi was increased, with the presumed notion of helping the raja protect Kochi. However, the measure led to decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cochin Raja, and an increase in the Portuguese influence.|$|E
