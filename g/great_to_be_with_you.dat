I'm a senior researcher at CERT working on operational resilience and software assurance. Today three of my colleagues and I will be discussing CERT's new Master of Software Assurance curriculum the need we hope that it satisfies, its content, and how academic institutions can take advantage of it. So let me introduce you to my three colleagues. First up joining me today is Nancy Mead who’s our fearless leader on the curriculum development team. Welcome back, Nancy. Glad to have you with us.

As you’ve just heard, I’m {{president}} of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, one of 12 regional Banks in the Federal Reserve System. The district covered by our Bank is geographically the largest and the most populous in the Fed. And, of course, Los Angeles is the biggest city in the district, and an economic powerhouse and cultural trendsetter for people around the world. This {{is the second time}} I’ve spoken at a Town Hall Los Angeles event. In fact, two years ago, I gave my first speech as San Francisco Fed president before this group. The economic landscape has changed significantly since then. But some things remain the same. Most notably, despite substantial improvement in the economy, unemployment is still far too high. Things still have a way to go before we can say we’ve fully recovered from the worst financial crisis and recession since the 1930 s. Today, I’ll talk about how I see the economy now and where I think it’s headed. I’ll offer my forecast {{for the next few years}} and discuss what the Federal Reserve is doing to boost the recovery. Of course, Fed speeches are not like Hollywood movies. That’s because I’ll tell you how it ends right here at the beginning...|$|E

The expansion of computer applications into non-male dominated areas, such as inter-personal communication, is cited as a major explanation for these observations. The findings imply that some reduction of sex asymmetries in computing course enrolments should be expected, although it is speculated that this might only be marginal.

The panels have been remarkably rich and informative. That they should occur here in Massachusetts, where probation in particular originated in 1841, makes the proceedings today especially fitting. Probation and parole, of course, are the epitome of state-indeed, community-based criminal justice. As recognized since the founding era, and repeatedly acknowledged by the U. S. Supreme Court, criminal justice in our federal union is mainly an undertaking {{of state and local}} governments, which process the lion’s share of criminal offenders and ultimately must accommodate such individuals upon their reentry into society. This predominance by the states is surely no less evident with respect to persons convicted of sex offenses. However, with sex offenders, there is a wrinkle: registration and community notification laws require the continued monitoring of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} ex-offenders no longer subject to probation and parole. In New York State, for instance, of the 24, 300 persons in the state registry, almost 19, 000 fall into this category. There’s also a unique federalism twist-in contrast to the broader population of ex-offenders reentering society from state and local penal facilities, as to whom the states and local governments unquestionably call the shots-registrants are also very much the concern of the federal government.
