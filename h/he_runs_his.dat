25|$|Oscar Soteno is Tiburcio’s nephew, {{the son of}} Alfonso Soteno. Like the {{generation}} before him, he learned to work clay as a child, specializing in Trees of Life as an adult in 1988. Today <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> own shop with his wife Maria and three other family members. Most of the works from this shop measure one meter high by 85cm wide although much larger and smaller ones are also produced. Oscar Soteno Elías family workshop is just outside Metepec on the highway that leads to Ixtapan de la Sal. The workshop is dominated by a large courtyard which is in turn dominated by two large brick and adobe kilns where the pieces are fired. Just off the courtyard is the small gallery where pieces are exhibited and sold. Oscar Soteno has also been experimenting with selling his pieces online, especially Day of the Dead themed work for Halloween in the United States, with sales rising.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{subsequent}} wrongful death of Braillard v. Maricopa County, the plaintiff's attorney cited numerous reports commissioned {{and paid for}} by Maricopa County, dating {{back as far as}} 1996, detailing a [...] "culture of cruelty" [...] where inmates were routinely denied humane healthcare at Maricopa County jails run by Arpaio. Testifying in this case, Arpaio stated he could not deny making the statement that even if he had a billion dollars he wouldn’t change the way <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> jails. Arpaio said his jails were meant as places for punishment, and that the inhabitants were all criminals, although in fact most inmates had not been convicted of a crime and were awaiting trial.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his next}} start on April 16, Holy Bull was the odds on {{favorite}} in the Blue Grass Stakes. He went to the early lead and set a moderate pace, then responded to a brief challenge by pulling away under a hand ride. The win earned Holy Bull a Beyer of 113. After the race, Smith was confident in the colt's ability to go an extra furlong in the upcoming Kentucky Derby. [...] "He would have gone around again today," [...] he said. [...] "I think he'll {{go as far as}} you want him. I'm not going to say no one can ever beat him, but when <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> race, they've got to have their running shoes on. Every time I get on his back, I realize he's incredible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emerson {{had given}} no public {{indication}} that {{he was thinking of}} leaving the Liberal Party during the election campaign, Wong's remarks notwithstanding. As a Cabinet minister he had been featured prominently in Liberal TV ads in British Columbia promoting that party as the best choice for voters. He launched several blistering attacks against Harper and the Conservatives during the campaign, including one assertion that under a Harper government, [...] "the strong [...] survive and the weak die". On election night, he told supporters {{that he wanted to be}} [...] "Stephen Harper's worst nightmare." [...] In an interview with CTV after being sworn in, he clarified to reporters about the heated partisan rhetoric used during the campaign. [...] Emerson told CTV that <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> riding office on a nonpartisan basis, and that his first priority was the interests of the people of Vancouver Kingsway.|$|E

60|$|This {{taking the}} hair off people's heads, or scalping, {{as it is}} called, is a common {{practice}} among the North American Indians. When a savage kills his enemy <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> scalping knife round the dead man's head, seizes the hair {{with his left hand}} and tears the scalp off. Indeed this dreadful cruelty is sometimes practised before death has occurred. The scalp with its lock of hair is taken home by the victor, and hung up in his tent as a trophy of war. The man who can show the greatest number of scalps is considered the greatest warrior. The dresses of Indian warriors are usually fringed with human scalp-locks.|$|E

They say he's in the {{smuggling}} business with Black Jack, and that he disposes of the silks and wines that are brought over in the Lucy, and that Jack trades over in France with his friends. The lieutenant at the coast-guard station has his eye upon him, and I believe that some day they will catch Black Jack as <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> cargo; but he's a slippery customer. It would be a good day for Hayling if they could do so, for he and his crew do a lot of harm to the place. They look more like men who have belonged to the Seamew I was talking to you about than honest English fishermen." ...|$|E
60|$|Inky {{blackness}} drifted up in wisps, {{in smoke}} before his eyes; he was powerless to move, to cry out. There {{was no room}} to turn; no air to breathe. And yet there was a low, continuous, never-varying stir as of an enormous wheel whirling in the gloom. Countless infinitesimal faces arched like glimmering pebbles the huge dim-coloured vault above his head. He heard a voice above the monstrous rustling of the wheel, clamouring, calling him back. He was hastening headlong, muttering to himself his own flat meaningless name, like a child repeating as <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> errand. And then {{as if in a}} charmed cold pool he awoke and opened his eyes again on the gathering darkness of the great bedroom, and heard a quick, importunate, long-continued knocking on the door below, as of some one who had already knocked in vain.|$|E

"Admitting that, {{by keeping}} mid-channel, she goes clear of White Stone and Frogs," [...] he said, giving to Throgmorton's its vulgar name, [...] "he {{must be a}} wizard, {{to know that the}} Stepping-Stones lie {{directly}} across his course, and that a vessel must steer away northerly, or bring up on rocks that will as surely hold {{him as if he were}} built there. Then <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> chance for the Executioners, which are as prettily placed as needs be, to make our trade flourish, besides the Middle Ground further east, though I count but little on that, having often tried to find it myself, without success. Courage, noble captain! if the fellow be the man you say, we shall get a nearer look at him before the sun sets; for certainly he who has run the Gate without a pilot in safety, has had as much good luck as can fall to his share in one day." ...|$|E

Why, look here;" [...] he nudged the mill-owner secretly, and, as the minister's back was {{momentarily}} turned, pulled out the letter he had avoided reading to Mrs. Martin, and pointed to a paragraph. [...] "I'll be d----d," [...] said the writer, [...] "but I'll have peace and quietness at Pine Clearing, if I have to wipe out or make over the whole Pike County gang. Draw on me for a piano if you think Mrs. Martin can work it. But don't say anything to Peaseley first, or he'll want it changed for a harmonium, and that lets us in for psalm-singing till you can't rest. Mind! I don't object to Church influence--it's a good hold!--but you must run IT with other things equal, and not let it run YOU. I've got the schoolhouse insured for thirty thousand dollars--special rates too." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{primitive}} {{children of}} the forest live in tents of deerskin or bark; and sometimes, where skins are scarce, of branches of trees. They are conically shaped, and are constructed thus:--The Indian with his family (probably two wives and three or four children) arrives in his bark canoe at a pretty level spot, sheltered from the north wind, and conveniently situated {{on the banks of}} a small stream, where the fish are plentiful, and pine branches (or brush), for the floor of the tent, abundant. Here <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> canoe ashore, and carries his goods and chattels up the bank. His first business is to cut a number of long poles, and tie three of them at the top, spreading them out {{in the form of a}} tripod. He then piles all the other poles round these, at half a foot distance from each other, and thus encloses a circle of between fifteen and twenty feet in diameter. Over the poles (if he is a good hunter, and has plenty of deer-skins) he spreads the skin tent, leaving an opening at the top for the egress of the smoke. If the tent be a birch-bark one, he has it in separate rolls, which are spread over the poles till the whole is covered. A small opening is left facing the river or lake, which serves for a doorway; and this is covered with an old blanket, a piece of deer-skin, or, in some instances, by bison-skin or buffalo robe. The floor is covered with a layer of small pine branches, which serve for carpet and mattress; and in the centre is placed the wood fire, which, when blazing brightly, gives a warmth and comfort to the slight habitation that could scarcely be believed. Here the Indian spends a few days or weeks, according to the amount of game in the vicinity, and then removes to some other place, carrying with him the covering of the tent, but leaving the poles standing, as they would be cumbrous to carry in his small canoe, and thousands may be had at every place where he may wish to land.|$|E
