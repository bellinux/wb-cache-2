Main objective is to describe mechanical options as replacements for the <b>climbing</b> <b>knots</b> as <b>rope</b> clamps and descenders. Research also contains comparisons of <b>rope</b> clamps and <b>climbing</b> <b>knots</b> [...] their advantages and disadvantages. Main part describes measurement of the strength three different types of <b>climbing</b> <b>knots,</b> measured on two types of ropes before start of the sliding movement. Results of the measurements are output tables which contain recommendation for the practical usage...|$|R

40|$|<b>Climbing</b> <b>rope</b> is {{certainly}} {{one of the most important}} pieces of climbing equipment. On market there are many manufacturers of dynamic <b>climbing</b> <b>ropes</b> and even more of their products. All the ropes meet the requirements of the standards, which ensure that the ropes are safe enough for use in climbing. However the requirements are set only under certain conditions. In reality <b>climbing</b> <b>ropes</b> are exposed to various conditions that are many times different to those set by the standards. Consequently there are many different falls, which lead to very different loads of impact. By using appropriate method of testing rope samples made by three different manufacturers we discovered that there are differences between all three manufacturers. This leads us to a suggestion that standards should be improved...|$|R

50|$|Nylon ropes {{that were}} used in yachts for hauling were tested and found useful in {{climbing}} and caving and are now the modern standard. The German company Edelrid introduced the first kernmantel rope in 1953, which revolutionized fall prevention. Hemp <b>climbing</b> <b>rope</b> became {{a thing of the past}} and rope breakage was greatly reduced. In 1964, Edelrid developed a dynamic rope capable of withstanding multiple falls. It became the forerunner of the modern dynamic <b>climbing</b> <b>rope.</b> Although there were occasional innovations, the rope used today is similar in construction, strength, and durability across manufacturers. There are several major manufacturers, including Pigeon Mountain Industries (PMI), which is popular with cavers, Mammut, Sterling, Beal, Edelweiss, Blue Water, Roca, Tendon and Maxim. Overall there is a huge variety of <b>climbing</b> <b>ropes</b> available for different purposes; for instance, there are well over one hundred different dynamic single ropes (the most popular <b>rope</b> system in <b>climbing).</b> Kernmantle <b>ropes</b> are still used in sailing and other sports, but the technical requirements are usually not as rigorous for such purposes as for climbing, since those applications are not as critical to safety. Small kernmantle ropes are commonly called accessory cords; they are often used to make prusik knots and loops or to attach accessories such as chalk bags.|$|R

5000|$|The term rope team (Seilschaft), roped team or roped party, {{originally}} {{came from}} mountain sports, especially climbing, where it describes {{a group of}} people joined by a mountain or <b>climbing</b> <b>rope</b> and thus secured against falling.|$|R

25|$|Ropes: Climbers often simply {{use their}} <b>climbing</b> <b>ropes</b> for abseiling. For many other applications, low-stretch rope (typically ~2% stretch when under the load {{of a typical}} bodyweight) called static rope is used to reduce {{bouncing}} and to allow easier ascending of the rope.|$|R

50|$|The {{butterfly}} coil (also {{known as}} a backpacker's coil) is a method used by climbers for storing and transporting a <b>climbing</b> <b>rope.</b> Slinging the coiled rope over the shoulders and tying it in place for carrying earns the technique its alternative name.|$|R

50|$|Rope drag on {{a dynamic}} <b>climbing</b> <b>rope</b> also {{effectively}} reduces {{the length of}} rope available for absorbing fall energy (or, in other words, effectively increases the rope's modulus of elasticity), resulting in higher fall impacts than would be expected using a simple fall factor calculation.|$|R

50|$|Instructor or Assistant Instructor Commando (O/HuO Cdo):This is an 8-week {{training}} program {{given at the}} Commando training centre (CE Cdo). It consists of a 4-week course and a 4-week {{training program}} where candidates learn to make installations with ropes and cables to cross vertical, horizontal, and wet obstacles. Candidates are also taught how to quickly and safely install many types of installations such as, <b>climbing</b> <b>ropes,</b> rope ladders, ferries, and death rides. They are also instructed in the evacuation of injured individuals in rocky and difficult terrain.|$|R
50|$|When {{selecting}} a rope for heavy top roping use, a large diameter (>= 10mm) static rope (or low-stretch rope) {{is recommended for}} the anchors to prevent rope wear and reduce rock erosion and to ensure maximum safety {{in the event of}} a fall. A dynamic rope should be used for the climbers. It is important to arrange the anchor system such that the <b>climbing</b> <b>rope</b> touches the rock as little as possible; damage to or destruction of the rope can result if a rope is loaded or dragged across sharp rocks enough times or with enough force. For anchors which are set back from the cliff edge, extending the anchor using multiple slings, a long adjustable-length sling, or a length of static line is common. Most practitioners run the <b>climbing</b> <b>rope</b> through two screwgate carabiners attached to the anchor, to provide backup in case one becomes undone. In the interests of safety at least two separate and redundant anchor points should be used, with forces distributed as evenly between them as possible. In the photo above, it can be seen that only the two locking carabiners protrude over the cliff edge, allowing the <b>climbing</b> <b>rope</b> a relatively free run from belayer to climber.|$|R
50|$|The figure-eight loop is used like an {{overhand}} loop knot.

50|$|Standard backpacking gear is {{required}} for a crossing, but also gear that accounts for alpine campsites exposed to high winds and severe weather elements.
