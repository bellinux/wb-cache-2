500|$|Central to a noble {{affinity}} was the lord's indentured retainers, {{and beyond}} {{them was a}} more amorphous group of general supporters and contacts. The difference, K. B. McFarlane wrote, was that the former did the lord [...] "exclusive service" [...] but the latter received his good lordship [...] "in ways both more and less permanent" [...] than the retainers. Christine Carpenter has described {{the structure of the}} earl of Warwick's affinity as [...] "a series of concentric circles" [...] with him at the centre. It has been noted that a lord only had to gather {{a relatively small number of}} people around in areas where he was strong, as members of his affinity supported not only him but also each other; thus, the number of men who could come to his aid was often far greater than the number of men he actually <b>knew.</b> <b>These</b> were men the lord trusted: for example, in 1459, on the verge of the Wars of the Roses, the earl of Salisbury gathered the closest members of his affinity to him in Middleham Castle and took their advice before publicly coming out in support of the rebellious duke of York.|$|E
500|$|In a 1980 interview, Gordimer {{stated that}} she {{was fascinated by the}} role of [...] "white hard-core Leftists" [...] in South Africa, and that she had long envisaged the idea for Burger's Daughter. Inspired by the work of Bram Fischer, she {{published}} an essay about him in 1961 entitled [...] "Why Did Bram Fischer Choose to Go to Jail?" [...] Fischer was the Afrikaner advocate and Communist who was Nelson Mandela's defence lawyer during his 1956 Treason Trial and his 1965 Rivonia Trial. As a friend of many of the activist families, including Fischer's, Gordimer <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> families' children were [...] "politically groomed" [...] for the struggle, and were taught that [...] "the struggle came first" [...] and they came second. She modelled the Burger family in the novel loosely on Fischer's family, and Lionel Burger on Fischer himself. While Gordimer never said the book was about Fischer, she did describe it as [...] "a coded homage" [...] to him. Before submitting the manuscript to her publisher, Gordimer gave it to Fischer's daughter, Ilse Wilson (née Fischer) to read, saying that, because of connections people might make to her family, she wanted her to see it first. When Wilson returned the manuscript to Gordimer, she told the writer, [...] "You have captured the life that was ours." [...] After Gordimer's death in July 2014, Wilson wrote that Gordimer [...] "had the extraordinary ability to describe a situation and capture the lives of people she was not necessarily a part of." ...|$|E

500|$|While in prison, Cox mailed several {{letters to}} the St. Petersburg Times in 2008 in which he accused {{politician}} Kevin White of taking bribes from him during Cox's criminal career. He claims he made payoffs to White, an ultimately successful candidate for the Tampa City Council, in 2002 and 2003. Cox said White {{told him he could}} not receive the money directly, and suggested that Cox have friends donate $500 each, and then reimburse them. Records and statements from those who donated show that Cox did in fact make numerous contributions to White's campaign, and reimbursed others who did so as well. White, he claims, agreed to vote to rezone vacant properties in Tampa and Ybor City. When Cox was first arrested, the FBI talked to him about White, whom they were also investigating, and he told them the same information. He claimed to have paid him $7,000 in cash in addition to the recorded contributions he arranged. When White and a fellow City Council member were told Cox's contributions might have been illegal in 2004, his colleague told the police, while White kept silent. White has denied that he <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> contributions were reimbursed, and called Cox's accusations [...] "the jailhouse ramblings of a reputed con man." [...] White said he befriended Cox when he came to believe the con man was interested in revitalizing Tampa Heights. Cox had fled the Tampa area before White cast any rezoning votes, so there is no voting record which could help confirm the validity of his accusations. In 2012, White, who had gone on to serve as Hillsborough County Commissioner, was convicted of unrelated federal bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to three years in federal prison.|$|E

From these three data, 1) the Tacoraei are neighbours of the Besadae/Sosaeadae; 2) the Asini are the neighbours of the Sosaeadae [...] 3) The Asiani [...] are kings of the Thocari, [...] it follows that the Asini of Pliny's text are identical with the Asiani, who are the kings of the Tocharians. This implies that—at least in the time of Pliny—the Kushāṇas were kings of the region between Jhelam and Indus and that Bucephala was one of their cities.

For instance, Isaiah, describing the condition to which Babylon was to be reduced after her ruin, says that she shall become the abode of satyrs, lamiæ, and strigæ (in Hebrew, lilith). This last term, according to the Hebrews, signifies the same thing, as the Greeks express by strix and lamiæ, which are sorceresses or magicians, who seek to put to death new-born children. Whence it comes that the Jews are accustomed to write in the four corners of the chamber of a woman just delivered, [...] "Adam, Eve, be gone from hence lilith."...The ancient Greeks <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> dangerous sorceresses by the name of lamiæ, and they believed that they devoured children, or sucked away all their blood till they died.|$|E

Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse.

2500|$|Anything {{after that}} was mere hearsay. The Laramie Sentinel {{announced}} in 1889 that Bogan {{had been killed}} during a shootout in Mexico. In 1907 it was announced by yet another newspaper that he'd been killed when his horse bucked him, again in Mexico, suffering a broken neck. It was rumoured Bogan was killed while riding with bandits in Argentina, and also that he'd built a ranch there and prospered. In his book [...] "A Lonestar Cowboy", published in 1919, Charlie Siringo revealed that he believed Bogan was still living, {{and that he had}} reason to believe Bogan had returned to the United States under yet another assumed name, married, settled in southwestern New Mexico, and raised a family on a small ranch. However, he never revealed the identity of who he believed Bogan to be, but suffice to say Siringo felt all but certain he <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> facts. In some support of Siringo's allegations, former Bogan friend A. C.

2500|$|The {{reason for}} the fourteen-year delay in Seder ‘Olam 11 is that Rabbi Yose (primary author of the Seder ‘Olam) had the idée fixe that the total time that Israel spent in its land must come out to an exact number of Jubilee cycles. If {{that had been the}} case, then we should have {{expected}} that 587 BC, when the exile began, would have been {{at the end of a}} Jubilee period. However, Rabbi Yose cited Ezek 40:1 as designating the time of the seventeenth Jubilee, and since he knew this was fourteen years after the city fell, he presumed that counting had been delayed for fourteen years so that he could account for the fourteen years between the fall of the city and the observance of the seventeenth Jubilee. He also mentioned the previous Jubilee, in the time of Josiah. As much as he would have liked to put these last two Jubilees fourteen years earlier in order to be consistent with his idée fixe, Rabbi Yose could not do it because he <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> were historical dates, not dates that came from his own calculation.|$|E
