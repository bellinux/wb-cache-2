40|$|The fusicoccin-binding protein was solubilised from {{purified}} oat root plasma membranes. The solubilised protein retained {{full binding}} activity, provided that protease inhibitors were included. Sodium fluoride reduced the high-affinity [H- 3]fusicoccin binding to almost zero in a concentration-dependent way, with an optimum at approximately 20 mM sodium <b>fluoride.</b> The presence <b>of</b> magnesium (> 100 mu M) {{was required for}} the inhibitory action <b>of</b> <b>fluoride,</b> whereas addition <b>of</b> low amounts <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> (25 mu M) Shifted the fluoride optimum to lower concentrations. Fluoride changes the biochemical properties of the binding protein in a reversible manner, because the inhibition was both prevented and reversed by 1 M ammonium sulphate. The combined effects <b>of</b> <b>aluminium,</b> <b>fluoride</b> and magnesium are reminiscent of the action of activated GTP-binding proteins. Since no functional assay for GTP-binding-protein activity in plants is available yet, GTP-binding-protein activation by fluoride and magnesium was deduced from competition with binding of [gamma-S- 35]GTP[S] to purified plasma membranes. Indeed, fluoride (20 mM) completely blocked the specific binding of [gamma-S- 35]GTP[S]. It is concluded that the inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>fluoride</b> upon the binding of fusicoccin is indirect and mediated through activated GTP-binding proteins. A hypothesis on the mechanism of fusicoccin action is presented wherein the fusicoccin-binding protein is one component of a signal-transduction chain, two or more steps downstream of a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this {{doctoral}} thesis, a new analytical HPLC-MS/MS method for monitoring of concentration changes of 17 β-estradiol (βE 2) during in vitro mouse sperm capacitation was developed. Capacitation was performed for three initial concentrations of βE 2 (200, 20 and 2 μg/L). For all the concentrations a similar trend for the total unbound βE 2 was observed. In general, the βE 2 concentration decreased to reach its minimum and then increased again. The position of the minimum differed for the individual tested βE 2 concentrations. Experimentally obtained results were subjected to the kinetic analysis. The curves fitted through the experimentally determined points displayed an autocatalytic character. For the agreement between the curves obtained by fitting through the experimental points and the theoretical calculated curves, it is necessary to assume that the first step is adsorption of βE 2 onto the surface of the sperm controlled by Langmuir isotherm. The kinetic study was also used to study the effects <b>of</b> <b>fluorides</b> and <b>aluminium</b> fluoride complexes on the capacitation of mouse sperm.

40|$|A {{suite of}} {{amorphous}} silica-aluminas (ASAs) was prepared by homogeneous deposition–precipitation (HDP) <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> on a silica surface followed by calcination. The HDP process {{was investigated in}} detail by 27 Al NMR spectroscopy of solid and liquid aliquots of the synthesis mixture. Deposition occurs predominantly via a hydrolytic adsorption <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> onto the hydroxyl groups of the silica surface. Precipitation becomes more significant at higher aluminium concentration. Depending on the aluminium loading, the surface contains four- and six-coordinated aluminium as well as patches <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> hydroxides. Calcination results in two competing process, that is the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into the silica network and sintering <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into separate patches of a phase which mainly consists of octahedral Al. These ASAs exhibit Brønsted acidity similar to industrial amorphous silica-aluminas prepared by the grafting <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> on very reactive silica gels. Their acidity does not vary systematically with the aluminium concentration, except below 5 wt% Al 2 O 3. The acidity increases with the calcination temperature. The active sites form due to the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> into the silica network at high temperatures, leading to Al substitutions of Si atoms. This is expected as the acidity does not correlate with anything else, viz., the amount <b>of</b> four-coordinated <b>aluminium</b> nor the presence of segregated Al or five-coordinated aluminium at the interface of these domains and the mixed silica-alumina phase. The surface of an amorphous silica-alumina consists <b>of</b> isolated <b>aluminium</b> grafted onto the silica surface (pure silica-alumina phase) with a very small amount <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> in the silica network, which brings about the Brønsted acidity, and small patches <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> oxides.
