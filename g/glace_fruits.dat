50|$|Candied fruit, {{also known}} as {{crystallized}} <b>fruit</b> or <b>glacé</b> <b>fruit,</b> has existed since the 14th century.

Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months. This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.|$|R
