5|$|The typical hunting {{strategy}} of the diamond stingray is to cruise just above the sea floor, landing atop any prey encountered. It then quickly levers its body up-and-down with its disc, producing negative pressure to extract the prey from its burrow. This ray has also been known to excavate large pits by undulating its disc and spitting jets of water, so as to uncover buried prey. Diamond stingrays are frequently trailed by smaller fishes, including Mexican <b>hogfish</b> (Bodianus diplotaenia), Galapagos porgies (Calamus taurinus), greybar grunts (Haemulon sexfasciatum), spinster wrasses (Halichoeres nichols), and long-spine porcupinefish (Diodon holocanthus), which {{take advantage of the}} invertebrates stirred up by the ray's activities. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium bullardi, A. dasi, A. rajivi, and A. soberoni, Anthocephalum currani, Parachristianella tiygonis, and Pseudochristianello elegantissima, the flukes Anaporrhutum euzeti and Probolitrema mexicana, and the monogenean Listrocephalos kearni.|$|E
25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred <b>hogfish.</b> Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|E
25|$|Sleep in fish is not {{extensively}} studied. Typically fish exhibit {{periods of}} inactivity but show no significant reactions to deprivation of this condition. Some species that always live in shoals or that swim continuously (because {{of a need}} for ram ventilation of the gills, for example) are suspected never to sleep. There is also doubt about certain blind species that live in caves. Other fish seem to sleep, however. For example, zebrafish, tilapia, tench, brown bullhead, and swell shark become motionless and unresponsive at night (or by day, {{in the case of}} the swell shark); Spanish <b>hogfish</b> and blue-headed wrasse can even be lifted by hand all the way to the surface without evoking a response. A 1961 observational study of approximately 200 species in European public aquaria reported many cases of apparent sleep. On the other hand, sleep patterns are easily disrupted and may even disappear during periods of migration, spawning, and parental care.|$|E

40|$|The {{islands of}} Madeira and Selvagens {{are less than}} 300 km apart but offer a clear {{contrast}} between a densely populated and highly developed island (Madeira), and a largely uninhabited and remote archipelago (Selvagens) within Macaronesia in the eastern Atlantic. The Madeira Archipelago has ~ 260, 000 inhabitants and receives over six million visitor days annually. The Selvagens Islands Reserve {{is one of the}} oldest nature reserves in Portugal and comprises two islands and several islets, including the surrounding shelf to a depth of 200 m. Only reserve rangers and a small unit of the maritime police inhabit these islands. The benthic community around Selvagens was dominated by erect and turf algae, while the community at Madeira was comprised of crustose coralline and turf algae, sessile invertebrates, and sea urchin barrens. The sea urchin Diadema africanum was 65 % more abundant at Madeira than at Selvagens. Total fish biomass was 3. 2 times larger at Selvagens than at Madeira, and biomass of top predators was more than 10 times larger at Selvagens. Several commercially important species (e. g., groupers, jacks), which have been overfished throughout the region, were more common and of larger size at Selvagens than at Madeira. Important sea urchin predators (e. g., <b>hogfishes,</b> triggerfishes) were also in higher abundance at Selvagens compared to Madeira. The effects of fishing and other anthropogenic influences are evident around Madeira. This is in stark contrast to Selvagens, which harbors healthy benthic communities with diverse algal assemblages and high fish biomass, including an abundance of large commercially important species. The clear differences between these two island groups highlights the importance of expanding and strengthening the protection around Selvagens, which harbors one of the last intact marine ecosystems in the North Atlantic, and the need to increase management and protection around Madeira.

2500|$|Jacques-Yves Cousteau {{once found}} what he {{believed}} was [...] "the cleanest waters in the world" [...] around this minor archipelago; there is an abundance of marine activity, many endemic to the environment, including the barred <b>hogfish,</b> puffer fish (Tetraodontidae), sea spider and many species of sea urchin. At depth of about [...] the waters around the islands/islets are teeming with algae and many species of migratory species of common fish, from the islands of Cape Verde, Madeira and the Canaries routinely.|$|E
5000|$|The Tarry <b>hogfish,</b> Bodianus bilunulatus, is {{a species}} of wrasse native to the Indian Ocean from the African coast to the western Pacific Ocean to Japan, New Caledonia, and the Philippines. This species occurs on reef slopes at depths of from 3 to 160 m with the adults being found in deeper waters than the juveniles. This species can reach 55 cm in total length with a maximum {{recorded}} weight of 1.8 kg. It is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries and is also popular as a game fish. It {{can also be found}} in the aquarium trade.

50|$|The Coral <b>Hogfish</b> {{undergoes}} {{a major change}} from juvenile to adult coloration, typical of many <b>hogfish</b> species. The juvenile is jet-black, with bright yellow around its eyes and on the body. The adult <b>hogfish</b> has a pink head, and then a vertical black stripe separating the pink head {{from the rest of}} the body, which is bright yellow. The change of coloration occurs quickly, at around 2 inches.|$|E
5000|$|Like many wrasses, the <b>hogfish</b> is a {{sequential}} hermaphrodite, {{which means}} it changes sex during different life stages. The <b>hogfish</b> is a protogynous, [...] "first female" [...] hermaphrodite: juvenile <b>hogfish</b> start out as female and then mature to become male. The change usually occurs around three {{years of age and}} about 14 inches in length. Females and juveniles will usually start out as pale gray, brown, or reddish brown in color, with a paler underside and no distinct patterns. Males are distinguished by a deep, dark band spanning from the snout to the first dorsal spine, as well as by a lateral black spot behind the pectoral fins. <b>Hogfish</b> reach a maximum of 91 cm in total length and about 11 kg and have been recorded to live up to 11 years. Spawning in South Florida occurs from November through June. <b>Hogfish</b> social groups are organized into harems where one male will mate and protect a group of females in his territory.|$|E

50|$|The Mexican <b>hogfish,</b> Bodianus diplotaenia, is {{a species}} of wrasse native to the eastern Pacific Ocean.Adults inhabit rocky or coral areas at depths of 5-75 m. Sometimes, they are also found on sandy bottoms and where marine plants abound. They are solitary or form aggregations {{of only a few}} individuals. Mexican <b>hogfish</b> feed on crabs, brittle stars, mollusks, and sea urchins. At night, they gather in cracks and crevices of rocks and caves to sleep. The Mexican <b>hogfish</b> starts life as a female, and later becomes a {{functional}} male. Males defend temporary reproductive territories called leks. The sex change may be due to local social conditions, but it may also have a genetic component, since the reversal occurs over a limited size range. They are oviparous, with distinct pairing during breeding.|$|E
