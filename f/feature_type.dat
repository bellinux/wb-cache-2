50|$|The {{definition}} of features that share membership {{of a common}} theme is a <b>feature</b> <b>type,</b> though {{there are a number}} of terms for this characteristic, including category, feature class, group, layer, level, object, and theme.|$|E
30|$|Most {{existing}} {{feature selection}} methods focus on predictability (e.g., prediction accuracy) without considering {{the correlation between}} different <b>feature</b> <b>types,</b> weakening the interpretability of selected results. However, different <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> exhibit various information, including statistical characteristics and domain-specific meanings. Given a set of distinct <b>feature</b> <b>types,</b> it remains unclear what <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> contribute to a specific class.|$|R
30|$|Given {{a certain}} class, the {{prediction}} accuracy varies with <b>feature</b> <b>types.</b> How to select <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> and measure their effectiveness {{for a specific}} class are essential for interpretability analysis. In particular, one-versus-all strategy are combined with SIP-FS to select <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> (each contains {{a certain number of}} features) for a specific class. The effectiveness of these <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> for each class are measured by the relative contribution ratio, which are normalized by the respective maximum contribution [14].|$|R
40|$|Images contain step edges, line {{features}} and many <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> that are {{somewhere between the}} two. Traditional gradient based edge operators are tuned to detect step edges, and hence are unable to properly detect and localize other <b>feature</b> <b>types.</b> The Phase Congruency detector {{is used as a}} tool to identify the different <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> found in images. It is shown that there is a continuum of <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> between step edges and lines, and that most images have a broad distribution of all these <b>feature</b> <b>types.</b> It is concluded that in typical images gradient based operators detect and localize {{only a small fraction of}} features correctly. 1...|$|R

30|$|Thus, feature {{selection}} {{is becoming increasingly}} applied to obtain compact data representation. For example, Wang et al. [22] and Somol et al. [23] proposed to select the most discriminative <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> based on the relationships between different <b>feature</b> <b>types,</b> both methods are sparse {{feature selection}}s rather than filter methods.|$|R
30|$|Next, {{we studied}} the {{sensitivity}} and specificity (see Sect.  2.7) of our classifier model; Fig.  5 c shows the findings for four <b>feature</b> <b>types.</b> We found that the sensitivity (accurately classifying face trials) and specificity (accurately classifying no-face trials) were comparable to the overall accuracy for these four <b>feature</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R
30|$|Haur et al. {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of feature selection methods on functional interpretability of the signatures [20]. Li et al. utilize association rule mining algorithms to improve the interpretability of the selected result without degrading prediction accuracy [21]. However, these feature selections are with less consideration of the correlation between two <b>feature</b> <b>types.</b> For different <b>feature</b> <b>types,</b> learning a shared subspace for all classes is a popular strategy to reduce the dimensionality. Although subspace-based methods are suitable for high-dimensional data, it learns a linear or non-linear embedding transformation rather than selects relevant and significant features from original <b>feature</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the {{understanding}} of sensory processing in animals served as inspiration for the SIFT descriptor (Lowe, 1999), which is a local feature used in computer vision for tasks such as object recognition and wide-baseline matching, etc. The SIFT descriptor {{is arguably the most}} widely used <b>feature</b> <b>type</b> for these tasks.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the WFS specification, {{proposed}} by the the OpenGIS Consortium (OGC), is to describe the manipulation operations over geospatial data using GML. Web servers providing WFS service are called WFS Servers. WFS servers publish GML views of geographic features stored in data sources such that the user can query and update data sources through a user defined <b>feature</b> <b>type</b> schema. In this work, we study the problem of answering WFS queries through a <b>feature</b> <b>type</b> schema, when the data is stored in a relational database. A <b>feature</b> <b>type</b> is specified by the <b>feature</b> <b>type</b> schema {{and a set of}} correspondence assertions. The feature type's correspondence assertions formally specify relationships between the <b>feature</b> <b>type</b> schema and the relational database schema. We define the semantic for WFS query answering and present an algorithm that translate a WFS query defined over a <b>feature</b> <b>type</b> schema into a SQL/XML query defined over the relational database schema. 1...|$|E

Several <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> can then be selected and used to determine what types contribute to a specific class by quantitative evaluation.

The experiments on three datasets, MIML, NUS-WIDE-LITE, and USGS 21, demonstrate that the performances of stability and interpretability are significantly improved without sacrificing predictability, compared with other filter and their respective ensemble-based methods. In future work, we intend to further investigate the selection of multi-modal information using SIP-FS.|$|R
