2500|$|When <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> {{music that}} would match the epic story and visuals of the drama, Misia's {{overwhelmingly}} powerful and bittersweet voice {{was all that}} came to mind. I {{wanted it to be}} touching and nostalgic and for it to bring to life the earnestness of the people from the Edo period and the feeling of a love that transcends time, so I asked Misia to write an epic ballad like only she can. Once I heard the song, I became even more confident in the drama and am certain it will liven up the production [...] I want the viewers to focus on the lyrics, as they may be hinting at the climax of the drama.|$|E
2500|$|The Provost and Dean of Dickinson College, Neil Weissman, [...] {{responded to}} Robert Samuelson's rebuttal, in the 30 June 2007 Letter to the Editor, for the Washington Post, College Rankings Are Lame Science, {{in which he}} states, [...] "when Dickinson College chose not to {{participate}} in the U.S. News and World Report rankings of colleges, <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> decision would evoke some criticism, but never the charge Robert J. Samuelson made of 'anti-intellectualism' [...] 'Intellectual' to me means thoughtful. The problem with the U.S. News rankings is that they are not 'intellectual.' They are, as some higher education experts label them, lame science. Mr. Samuelson also missed the point in suggesting nonparticipating colleges are trying to censor U.S. News. The magazine is of course free to continue its rankings, as are others. We are simply saying that we will not participate in an exercise that, in our view, misleads prospective students more than it helps and drives up college costs by encouraging spending in pursuit of rankings on a fictional prestige ladder invented by U.S. News." ...|$|E
60|$|When that {{length of}} time had elapsed, however, and he yet {{remained}} absent, fear crept over me, and <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> worst.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know much}} about Voodoo and can't state if it's magic or tricks. However, <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> Bat did use it against people who disputed his rule." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no train until to-morrow and <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> fellow wouldn't be {{satisfied}} with canned meat, {{so long as he}} could get something better when the cars stopped." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{feeling of}} {{compassion}} for my creaking boots surged up in me, so well could <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> sorrowful long curiosity of regard {{which he would}} bend on them.|$|R
6000|$|... "We landed no goods; <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> sheep {{would be}} paid for afterwards. Looks as if Wolf had an {{agreement}} with somebody in the interior." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For one thing, I'd {{put on a}} cloth jacket--the evenings {{are pretty}} cold--and dark serge doesn't melt into a {{background}} of stones and sand. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> tribe knew me." ...|$|E
60|$|The packet {{was not a}} thick one. In fact, it was so thin {{that for}} an instant <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> {{envelope}} was empty. But a hasty examination proved my fears groundless.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw you in {{the last}} number," [...] said Cayenne. [...] "From the {{quotations}} from your own works, <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> review of your own book was by yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{man he had}} met first said it was his name, and Foster resumed: [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> {{fellow with}} the gun means to declare that you struck him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that!" [...] said Festing awkwardly. [...] "I did it when I {{fell over}} a stove at the settlement. The pipe {{came down and}} <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> edge struck me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I find {{it harder}} to sell my farm than <b>I</b> <b>imagined.</b> <b>The</b> {{settlement}} covenant's the trouble, and I don't feel inclined to give the land away. I want a talk with you. Will you come to my hotel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Colonist {{printed a}} short paragraph; <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> police edited the story. Old man Salter knows his job, {{although}} the shooting {{was on the}} Royal North-West's ground. Anyhow, the tale left you to guess. But were you in it?" ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>imagined,</b> <b>the</b> ship {{proves to}} be in a current; if that {{appellation}} can properly be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{not believe}} it!" [...] exclaimed Major Doyle. [...] "This hotel isn't {{what you might}} call first-class, and can't rank with <b>the</b> Waldorf-Astoria; but <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> beds will be very comfortable." ...|$|R
60|$|January 17.--Another proper day of mist, sleet, and rain, {{through which}} I navigated homeward. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> {{distance}} to be {{a mile and}} a half. It is a good thing to secure as much exercise.|$|R
6000|$|... "François' {{accounts}} are checked and I'm {{surprised to find}} them right, but <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> other calculations will not be finished. Anyhow, it won't make much difference whether they are or not. I guess you know that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'd {{never have}} known you," [...] he said, {{surveying}} her {{from head to}} foot. [...] "It's funny. I had the clearest picture of you in mind. But you're {{not at all like}} <b>I</b> <b>imagined.</b> <b>The</b> Columbine I remember was thin, white-faced, and all eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|As I walked {{among these}} solitary cells, {{and looked at}} the faces of the men within them, I tried to picture to myself the {{thoughts}} and feelings natural to their condition. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> hood just taken off, and the scene of their captivity disclosed to them in all its dismal monotony.|$|E
60|$|It {{is plain}} now that I did her an injustice, {{for there was}} about her words none of the inconsequence <b>I</b> <b>imagined.</b> <b>The</b> fault was in myself and in the {{profound}} ignorance of the ways {{of men and women}} which went hand in hand with my deep but ineffectual learning in the ways of saints.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stannard might hit a line a {{few yards}} below <b>the</b> top, but <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> clouds will soon roll up. Give me the glasses. I want to locate a gully that goes for some {{distance}} up the ridge." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> {{him at his}} luncheon, a meal {{he usually}} treats with a {{becoming}} gravity. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> waiter marking the kindly self-indulgence of his clean-shaven face, and advancing with that air of intimate participation the good waiter shows to such as he esteems. I figure the respectful pause, the respectful enquiry.|$|R
6000|$|Your {{description}} of the porter and the carpet-bags prepares me for a first-rate facetious novel, brimful of the richest humour, on which I have no doubt you are engaged. What is it called? Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> title-page thus: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This, Sir, {{is a most}} exact {{detail of}} the {{conversation}} (as far as related to that affair) {{on the part of}} Mirza Shaffee Khân. On my part I could only say, that <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> affair was misrepresented, and that I should write as he requested. Let me therefore request that you will enable me to answer in a more effectual manner any further questions on this subject.|$|E
6000|$|The above {{was written}} many years ago. I still think the remark plausible, though I should not now express myself so positively. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> Jews to mean: [...] "he has evidently used the words [Greek: ho patáer mou]--not {{in the sense}} in which all good men may use them, but--in a literal sense, because by the words that followed, [Greek: ergázetai, kagô ergázomai], he makes himself equal to God." [...] To justify these words {{seemed to me to be}} the purport of Christ's reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "In a sense, it was so. In fact, I {{think the}} man who sold you {{expected}} me to seize her," [...] Revillon agreed with some dryness. [...] "Well, I followed you and steered a course that would pin you against the shoals. I had studied the chart and pilot book, and nothing indicated that a vessel could get across." [...] He paused and shrugged. [...] "Well, what would you have? <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> guns were overboard and you had run aground. My duty was not to wreck my ship. I hauled off the coast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not {{surprised}} you don't like him," [...] Harold {{replied with a}} laugh, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> dislike is mutual. When two gentlemen are paying attentions to one young lady they seldom appreciate each other's merits very cordially." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are a {{delightful}} family." [...] The sub-editor {{does not say}} so, but <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> two sisters are likewise typical young Englishwomen. They ride and shoot and cook and make their own dresses, have common sense and love a joke.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, I don't know what I did expect to find. We're ostensibly practising scouting, but there's {{a batch of}} Dumfries cyclists {{scouring}} the Galloway roads, and <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> authorities have some reason for sending us out." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{was riding}} Dora's pony from Rydal to Cambridge, I got off, as I {{occasionally}} did, to walk. I fell {{in with a}} sweet-looking peasant girl of nine or ten years old. She had been to carry her father's dinner, who {{was working in the}} fields, and she was wheeling a little wheelbarrow, in which she collected manure from the roads for her garden at home. After some talk I gave her a penny, for which she thanked me in the sweetest way imaginable. I wish I had asked her whether she could read, and whether she went to school. But I could not help being struck with the happy arrangement which Nature has made for the education of the heart, an arrangement which it seems the object of the present age to counteract instead of to cherish and confirm. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> happy delight of the father in seeing his child at a distance, and watching her as she approached to perform her errand of love. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> joy of the mother in seeing her return. I am strongly of opinion (an opinion you, perhaps, have seen expressed by me in a letter to Mr. Rose[263]) that this is the discipline which is more calculated by a thousand degrees to make a virtuous and happy nation than the all-engrossing, estranging, eleemosynary institutions for education, which perhaps communicate more knowledge. In these institutions what the pupils gain in knowledge they often lose in wisdom. This is a distinction which must never be lost sight of.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{were the}} lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had {{pronounced}} the words [...] "I SHALL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT," [...] I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as <b>I</b> <b>imagined,</b> <b>the</b> seal to my fate.|$|E
6000|$|The day was misting and dark, but so vast was my {{relief that}} <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>the</b> sun was out as I rattled toward Arlington Street. If only Dolly were not ill {{again from the}} shock, I should be happy indeed. She must have heard, ere then, that I was not killed; and I had still better news to tell her than that of Lord Comyn's condition. Mr. Fox, who got every rumour that ran, had shouted after me that the duke and Lewis were set out for France. How he knew I had not waited to inquire. But the report tallied with my own surmise, for they had used the word [...] "Dover" [...] when they left us for dead in the Wilderness.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will cost}} very little. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> haulage of the gravel and the slabs {{for the wall}} will cost nothing," [...] Osborn replied. [...] "Bell has promised to bring me all the stuff we'll need with his new trailer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{find the}} Lake of the Skeezers," [...] replied Ozma. [...] "From what that dreadful Su-dic said <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> Skeezers {{are good people}} and worthy of our friendship, and {{if we go to}} them we may help them to defeat the Flatheads." ...|$|R
6000|$|Don Arturo looked thoughtful. [...] "West Africa's my field, and I don't {{know the}} North, but now France has {{got all the}} hinterland, I {{sometimes}} think the dispute about the Atlantic coast may be reopened. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Government is not a friend of Islam." ...|$|R
