5|$|Like its predecessor, the 747X {{family was}} unable to garner enough {{interest}} to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the Sonic Cruiser concept. Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747-500X and -600X, it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747-400ER.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Otto of Freising and {{the remnant}} of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April, and Conrad soon after. Fulk, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, {{was sent to}} invite Louis to join them. The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time, {{as well as the}} Provençals who had left Europe under the command of Alfonso Jordan, Count of Toulouse. Alfonso himself <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to Jerusalem as he died at Caesarea. He was {{supposedly}} poisoned by Raymond II of Tripoli, the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alfonso caused much of the Provençal force to turn back and go home. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa, but the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Much of the 1964 {{session was}} devoted to a bill to desegregate public {{accommodations}} in Kentucky. A rally {{in favor of the}} bill was held in March and was attended by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Reverend Ralph Abernathy, and baseball player Jackie Robinson. Despite this, the bill <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out of legislative committee. As a member of the Southern Governors Conference in October 1964, Breathitt was one of three governors to oppose George Wallace's proposed constitutional amendment to give states and state courts sole jurisdiction over their public schools, preventing a federal law to integrate them. Breathitt's opposition helped prevent the Conference's endorsement of the amendment, since endorsement required a unanimous vote.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. The first part of qualifying (Q1) was disrupted towards the end, when Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso came to a halt at the hairpin, preventing a number of drivers from improving on their lap times. Marcus Ericsson, whose first timed lap had been hampered by a spin, was one of the affected drivers and was eliminated in 17th place. Jenson Button also <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into Q2. While his second run was also affected by Verstappen, he lost time in his first due to a failure of communication concerning his engine mode. Also eliminated were the second Sauber of Felipe Nasr and both Manor Marussia cars.|$|E

The final scene switches to a World War II German field-hospital. A doctor summons some SS officers to examine the unfamiliar uniform of a burns patient who was recently brought in. The patient is revealed as Archer. One of the SS personnel steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to be a gray-skinned alien.|$|E

5|$|The ancestral {{origins of}} the Maine Coon are unknown — there are only {{speculation}} and folk tales. One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France {{with the help of}} Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.|$|E
5|$|Welensky {{considered}} a federal unilateral {{declaration of independence}} when the new Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament. Determined at one point to prevent changes, Welensky was convinced that if he refused, the British would use military force to remove his government. Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya, he discussed the federation's ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion. In the end, {{the idea of a}} British invasion was one of many options considered, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> past cabinet discussion.|$|E

Team mate Jenson Button was more successful, missing out on Q3 when his second fast lap was interrupted by Nico Rosberg going off at Sainte Dévote. The second Williams of Felipe Massa completed a problematic Saturday for the team, claiming only 14th on the grid, while Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean also <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into Q3.|$|E

5|$|General Carleton {{arrived in}} Trois-Rivières {{late in the}} action. A {{detachment}} of British forces led by Major Grant had taken control of a bridge over the Rivière-du-Loup, a critical crossing for the Americans retreating along {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence. Carleton ordered Grant to withdraw, allowing most of the Americans to escape, either because {{he did not want to}} deal with large numbers of prisoners or because he wanted to demoralize the Americans further. A significant number of Americans <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> that far, and were captured. These included General Thompson and seventeen of his officers. It was not until June 13 that the British finished rounding up the stragglers. In all, 236 captives were taken. Brendan Morrissey says that about 30 Americans were killed in the battle, while Howard Peckham gives a figure of 50 Americans killed.|$|E
5|$|Lacking {{military}} discipline, in what likely {{seemed to}} the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact {{they were still in}} Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of Bohemians and Saxons <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> past Hungary before splitting up.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), only the Ferrari were confident enough to run only on the slower, harder tyres, {{while the rest of the}} field needed to equip the super-soft compound. Daniil Kvyat topped the session with a time of 1:45.340 on the supersoft tyre. Pastor Maldonado was eliminated, as were the two Manor Marussia drivers, who were even further off the pace than usual. Both of the team's drivers received a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change. Both Sauber drivers also <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into Q2, when Jenson Button was the last to set a fast lap, edging out Felipe Nasr by less than a tenth of a second.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Amberg on 24 August and the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September, Charles {{defeated}} Jourdan's northern {{army and}} compelled the French army to retreat, eventually {{to the west}} bank of the Rhine. With Jourdan neutralized and retreating into France, Charles left Franz von Werneck to watch the Army of Sambre and Meuse, making sure it did not try to recover a foothold on the east bank of the Rhine. He then turned on Moreau, who belatedly began to withdraw from southern Germany. Although Moreau briskly repulsed Latour at the Battle of Biberach, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> through the Black Forest before Charles was able to cut French access to the Bruchsal and Kehl crossings. At the battle of Battle of Emmendingen and the Battle of Schliengen in October, Charles forced Moreau to retreat south. During the winter the Austrians reduced the French bridgeheads in the Siege of Kehl and the Siege of Hüningen, and forced Moreau's army back to France. Despite Charles' success in Germany, Austria lost the war in Italy to a new French army commander, Napoleon Bonaparte, which resulted in the Peace of Campo Formio.|$|E
5|$|For {{his next}} serial, Hergé planned to put {{together}} a story that caricatured the actions of Nazi Germany, developing the plot for King Ottokar's Sceptre. However, he temporarily set aside that project when he began to experience dreams of white and a car stuck in the snow, having ideas of sending Tintin to the north, considering Greenland or the Klondike as potential locations. The result was The Black Island, although Hergé only sent Tintin as far north as Scotland, and he instead used the idea of the car stuck in a snowdrift on a greetings card that he designed. He also had an idea of Tintin combating a group of anarchists bent on destroying Europe's iconic buildings, but again this idea <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into the eventual story. Having decided to set most of his story in Britain, Hergé briefly visited London and the southern English coast {{to learn more about the}} country. There, he purchased a stainless steel Gillotts Inqueduct G-2 pen, a type that he would continue to use throughout his life. His positive depiction of Britain was in part due to an Anglophilia that he had received from his childhood, with the British government having been a longstanding ally of Belgium, supporting its 1831 creation and liberating it from German occupation during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In 1737, Murray {{acted as}} Counsel for the City of Edinburgh in the {{aftermath}} of the death of Captain John Porteous. In Edinburgh, it was traditional for criminals sentenced to death to be allowed to visit a church near the city jail the Sunday before the execution. Two criminals named Wilson and Robertson took this as an opportunity to escape, and although Wilson <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out of the church, Robertson escaped completely. Wilson had been a smuggler who supplied his fellow citizens with goods, and because of this and the unpopularity of the city guard, public opinion was firmly on his side. Porteous was the captain of the Edinburgh city guard, and angry with Wilson's attempt to escape and aware of the possibility of an attempt to free him. Porteous ordered a guard of 80 men to be placed around the gallows for Wilson's execution. When a man attempted to cut Wilson's body down after the execution, Porteous ordered his troops to fire on the crowd, and seven people were killed. Porteous was initially sentenced to death for murder, and when the execution was delayed, a mob of citizens rushed the city jail and lynched him.|$|E

5|$|In Adventure, the player's goal is {{to recover}} the Enchanted Chalice that an evil magician has stolen and hidden in the kingdom {{and return it to}} the Golden Castle. The kingdom {{includes}} two other castles (White and Black) and various obstacles and mazes within them. Further, the kingdom is guarded by three dragons: Yorgle (yellow dragon), Grundle (green dragon), and Rhindle (red dragon who moves much faster than the other two), that protect various items in the game and will try to chase and eat the player's avatar. There is also a bat that can roam across the kingdom freely, carrying a single item (which can include the player's avatar or a dragon) around; the bat was to be named Knubberrub but the name <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into the manual. The bat has two states, agitated and non-agitated; when in the agitated state, the bat will either pick up or swap what it currently carries with an object in the present room, eventually returning to the non-agitated state where it will not pick up an object. The bat continues to fly around even if not present on the player's current screen and may continue moving or swapping around objects.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E
