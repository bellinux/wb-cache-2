5000|$|The screw {{was one of}} {{the last}} of the simple {{machines}} to be invented. [...] The screw appeared in ancient Greece and Egypt, and by the first century BC was used in the form of the screw press and the Archimedes' screw, but when it was invented is unknown. Greek philosopher Archytas of Tarrentum (428 - 347 BC) was said by the Greeks to have invented the screw. Although the Greek philosopher Archimedes is credited by the Greeks with inventing the Archimedes screw water pump around 234 BC. records indicate it was first used in ancient Egypt. [...] Archimedes was first to study the screw as a machine, so he is sometimes considered the inventor of the screw. Greek philosophers defined the screw as one of the simple machines and could calculate its (ideal) mechanical advantage. For example, Heron of Alexandria (52 AD) listed the screw as one of the five mechanisms that could [...] "set a load in motion", defined it as an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, and described its fabrication and uses,including describing a tap for cutting <b>female</b> <b>screw</b> threads.|$|E

40|$|Since {{a number}} of decades there are many {{problems}} {{in the northern part}} of Germany with high sulphate resistant cement in historical gypsum masonry. Instead of protecting the ancient mansory these injections led to a continuing deterioration of the masonry structure. Own experiments with mortar bars (4 x 4 x 16) consisting of high sulphate resistant cements and gypsum mortar have been exposed to different humidities. Another mean parameter was the sulfate concentration. The changes of length and weight were measured. Chemical and mineralogical analysis give information about the existance of etringite and thaumasite. The second part of the analysis dealt with anchorages of steel bars in masonry. To prevent sulphate reactions in gypsum mortar only the special TUBAG-injection mortar and chrom-nickel-steel bars have been used. Pull-out tests with concrete- and threaded steel bars embelled in concrete have been performed. The threaded steel bars were anchored at their ends with <b>female</b> <b>screws.</b> Some proposals for dimensioning were given. (orig.)

50|$|A {{leadscrew}} (or lead screw), {{also known}} as a power screw or translation screw, is a screw used as a linkage in a machine, to translate turning motion into linear motion. Because of the large area of sliding contact between their male and <b>female</b> members, <b>screw</b> threads have larger frictional energy losses compared to other linkages. They are not typically used to carry high power, but more for intermittent use in low power actuator and positioner mechanisms. Common applications are linear actuators, machine slides (such as in machine tools), vises, presses, and jacks.|$|R
40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, thread rollers and <b>female</b> <b>screw</b> which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and <b>female</b> <b>screw</b> the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers â€“ with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and <b>female</b> <b>screw</b> thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces male thread pitch diameter control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male screw and roller pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces male thread control. In the long term while reexamination of the All-Union state standard 2475 - 88 it is required to enlarge the range of smooth wires with new ones intended for RS advanced concepts pieces male thread pitch diameter control...|$|E

The main results are as follows: (1) Failure loads of M 4 type of screw samples are quite scattered, no matter how many circles of threads were involved. (2) Repeatable failure loads were detected for samples with M 5 to M 10 type of screws. (3) A linear increment of connection-strength with increasing thread circles was detected for a given type of screw samples, and the bigger the thread size, the greater the increasing rate. (4) Higher strength was detected for samples cut along longitudinal direction of the forging than for samples along its radial direction.

40|$|This study aims at {{analyzing}} the phenomena which characterize threaded connections. This type of joint {{has been known}} for thousands years (one of the first applications is attributable to Archimedes) allows transforming a torque into an axial force, typically used to lock two or more components thanks to the friction forces that arise between the connected bodies. One of the main strengths of this type of coupling is the possibility to assemble and disassemble the assembled parts; in addition, it can be applicable to almost any type of material. However, the joint system is characterized by a low efficiency: only a modest amount of the tightening torque is actually converted into axial force. In addition, the obtained axial force is typically affected by a large scatter. This behavior is due to the combined effect of two different friction effects that arise between the under-head of the screw (or nut) and the surface of the elements to be locked in the first case, and between the screw threads and <b>female</b> <b>screw</b> in the second one. The relationship between tightening torque and preload axial force is very sensitive to the effect of the various friction coefficients that rule the tribological behavior of the joint:, these coefficients have a significant variability due to the processes used to manufacture the components, and to the different tightening parameters, such as the presence of lubrication or the tightening speed. Threaded connections do have a wide array of applications, both in the field of civil engineering and in mechanics. For instance, in the automotive compartment, due to a steadily growing strive towards weight reduction and increased automation of assembly procedures, an accurate knowledge of the performance of threaded connections has recently become critical in order to achieve the safety of the junction at an adequate production cost. In order to control a threaded connection, it is necessary to focus on the three main factors that characterize its behavior: the coefficients of friction at tightening, the self-relaxation phenomenon (decrease of axial preload in the first few seconds after tightening, due to sinking of the load bearing area in the clamped parts), self-loosening (loss of axial preload, typically due to the action of external shearing forces). In the following, literature review will be presented first, then it will be shown an experimental investigation on the effect of solid lubrication on the friction coefficients, carried out for repeated tightenings and different surface treatments. Moreover, the effect of the number of engaged threads on the performance of an anaerobic threadlocking adhesive will be examined. The need for these analyses arose from the study of an in-field failure occurred in a pinion shaft of a transmission for earth moving machines, which, as it will be shown in the following, probably failed due to a combination of the aforementioned typical issues of threaded components. The research has the aim of increasing the knowledge about the effect of lubrication on the different phenomena that contribute to determining the performance of a bolted connection...|$|E

50|$|Threaded {{plug valves}} are used {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a threaded plug valve involves a plug with a threaded cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of <b>female</b> glass. <b>Screwing</b> the plug in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. Screwing the plug valve all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|R
40|$|Studies of sacral pedicle anatomy {{have been}} {{reported}} in the European population. However, the feasibility for the use of S 1, S 2 and S 2 -ilium screws has not been fully investigated in the Asian population. To assess feasibility, morphometric parameters and safety of S 1, S 2 and S 2 -ilium screw insertion in the Asian population. 180 three dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans of pelvis (90 males and 90 females) with contrast were analysed using Mimics(A (R)) version 13. 1 (Materialise, Belgium) software. All parameters were measured using this programme. The safety medial trajectory of S 1 pedicle screw was 11. 8 +/- A 3. 9 to 37. 1 +/- A 4. 5 A degrees in males and 11. 7 +/- A 3. 1 to 35. 9 +/- A 4. 4 A degrees in <b>females.</b> The <b>screw</b> length was from 35. 0 +/- A 3. 0 to 58. 3 +/- A 3. 1 mm in males and from 31. 9 +/- A 2. 6 to 53. 1 +/- A 3. 5 mm in females. Right S 1 pedicle screws were safe as long as the anterior cortical penetration of quadrant 2, 3 and 4 were avoided. On the left, it was safe for the screws to exit at quadrant 1, 2 and 3. The lateral trajectory of S 2 sacral alar screw was from 0 to 32. 6 +/- A 3. 3 A degrees in males and from 0 to 33. 6 +/- A 3. 5 A degrees in <b>females.</b> The <b>screw</b> length was from 23. 9 +/- A 3. 2 to 53. 1 +/- A 4. 1 mm in males and from 23. 0 +/- A 2. 5 to 53. 2 +/- A 4. 5 mm in females. For S 2 screws, on the right side, the frequency of the internal iliac artery location was 7. 2, 38. 3, 47. 2 and 1. 7 for quadrants 1, 2, 3 and 4, whereas on the left side, the frequency was 7. 8, 50. 6, 33. 9 and 2. 2 for quadrants 1, 2, 3 and 4. For S 2 -ilium screws, the lateral trajectory was from 39. 3 +/- A 3. 1 to 50. 4 +/- A 6. 1 A degrees in males and from 39. 5 +/- A 3. 1 to 50. 2 +/- A 5. 9 A degrees in <b>females.</b> The <b>screw</b> lengths were from 85. 3 +/- A 22. 2 to 122. 6 +/- A 11. 4 mm and from 86. 4 +/- A 22. 7 to 122. 2 +/- A 11. 9 mm in males and females, respectively. The application of S 1, S 2 and S 2 -ilium screws are feasible. The amount of medial angulation and the ideal screw length in the Asian population must be borne in mind during insertion. Right S 1 screws carry higher risk of injury to the internal iliac artery when the anterior cortical penetration occurs due to the course of the iliac vessels...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Pedicle screw {{fixation}} {{is the standard}} technique for the stabilization of the spine, a clinically relevant complication of which is screw loosening. This retrospective study investigates whether preoperative CT scanning can offer a predictor of screw loosening. METHODS CT-scan attenuation in 365 patients was evaluated to determine the mean bone density of each vertebral body. Screw loosening or dislocation was determined in CT scans postoperatively using the standard radiological criteria. RESULTS Forty-five of 365 patients (12. 3 %; 24 male, 21 <b>female)</b> suffered postoperative <b>screw</b> loosening (62 of 2038 screws) over a mean follow-up time of 50. 8 months. Revision surgeries were necessary in 23 patients (6. 3 %). The correlation between decreasing mean CT attenuation in Hounsfield Units (HU) and increasing patient age was significant (p < 0. 001). Mean bone density was 116. 3 (SD 53. 5) HU in cases with screw loosening and 132. 7 (SD 41. 3) HU in cases in which screws remained fixed. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0. 003). CONCLUSION The determination of bone density with preoperative CT scanning can predict the risk of screw loosening and inform {{the decision to use}} cement augmentation to reduce the incidence of screw loosening...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{develop a}} {{reference}} for the distal screw length in volar locking plate fixation for distal radial fractures in an East Asian population. Methods. 12 pairs of forearm specimens from 11 male and one female East Asian cadavers were scanned using computed tomography. On sagittal {{images of the}} distal radius, the mean cortex-to-cortex distance of 8 quadrants was measured as a reference for the distal screw length. In addition, intra-operative 3 -dimensional fluoroscopy of 10 male and 10 female patients who underwent volar locking plate fixation for distal radial fractures was used to validate the distal screw length in the cadaveric reference. 76 distal locking screws were applied in the 8 quadrants; their cortex-to-cortex distances were measured. Results. The mean cortex-to-cortex distances at quadrants A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H were 15. 4 mm, 19. 6 mm, 20. 8 mm, 20. 0 mm, 13. 3 mm, 18. 0 mm, 18. 8 mm, and 17. 4 mm, respectively. In 45 % of the specimens, the 2 screws inserted at quadrants C and D were longest. Distal screws (quadrants A to D) were significantly longer than proximal screws (quadrants E to H) [p= 0. 02]. In intra-operative 3 -dimensional fluoroscopic images, 2 of the 76 distal locking screws penetrated the dorsal cortex (one in quadrant A and one in quadrant F). The mean screw length was 88. 0 % of the cortex-to-cortex distance. When referenced to the cadaveric data, 88. 2 % of the screws could be safely inserted without penetrating the dorsal cortex, and the remaining 11. 8 % of screws (5 at quadrant D, one at quadrant B, and 3 at quadrant C; all in female patients) could potentially cause dorsal cortex penetration of 2 to 4 mm. In male patients, the mean screw length was 76. 1 % of the cortex-to-cortex distance based on the cadaveric reference. In female patients, when the screw length was 4 mm less than the cadaveric reference, the mean screw length would be 72. 0 % of the referenced cortex-to-cortex distance, with no dorsal cortex penetration. Conclusion. In <b>female</b> patients, the <b>screw</b> length should be 4 mm less than the cadaveric reference to avoid dorsal cortex penetration. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
