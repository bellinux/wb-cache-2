40|$|The {{perception}} of a regular beat is fundamental to music processing. Here we examine whether the detection of a regular beat is pre-attentive for metrically simple, acoustically varying stimuli using the mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP response elicited by violations of acoustic regularity irrespective of whether subjects are attending to the stimuli. Both musicians and non-musicians were presented with a varying rhythm with a clear accent structure in which occasionally a sound was omitted. We compared the MMN response to the omission of identical sounds in different metrical positions. Most importantly, we found that omissions in strong metrical positions, on the beat, <b>elicited</b> <b>higher</b> <b>amplitude</b> MMN responses than omissions in weak metrical positions, not on the beat. This suggests that the detection of a beat is pre-attentive when highly beat inducing stimuli are used. No effects of musical expertise were found. Our results suggest that for metrically simple rhythms with clear accents beat processing does not require attention or musical expertise. In addition, we discuss how the use of acoustically varying stimuli may influence ERP results when studying beat processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{components}} of the rat and human auditory event-related potential (ERP) as generated in active oddball and passive single tasks. The rats were trained to discriminate between target and standard stimuli in an oddball task, whereas the human subjects received instructions. Task effects on various ERP components were found in both species. Interestingly, effects on the P 3 component were simular in the species with regard to amplitude: Target stimuli <b>elicited</b> a <b>higher</b> <b>amplitude</b> in the oddbal task than did standard stimuli. This might indicate that the P 3 shares the same characteristics between species. However, the first four components occured 1. 82 times earlier in rats than in humans, expecting a P 3 of about 200 ms in rats. The P 3 in rats appeared at 380 ms. We conclude that either the relation between human and rat peak latencies is not linear, or the P 3 in rats is not the equivalent of the human P 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{anomalous}} innervation of the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) muscle by {{the accessory}} deep peroneal nerve is pre-sented below. This 23 -year-old male {{was referred to}} the clini-cal neurophysiology laboratory for evaluation of possible lum-bar radiculopathy. The nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography revealed abnormalities consistent with an S 1 radiculopathy on the right. Incidentally, the routine pero-neal nerve conduction study on the left revealed a larger com-pound muscle action potential (CMAP) on proximal stimula-tion below and above the fibular head, {{when compared to the}} distal stimulation (Figure 1, trace A 2, A 3 and A 1 respectively). The stimulation behind the lateral malleolus showed a CMAP with amplitude of 1. 6 mV (Figure 1, trace A 4), thus confirm-ing the presence of the accessory deep peroneal nerve. The NCS of the right peroneal nerve did not reveal any anomaly. Comments Anatomic variations in the innervation of muscles should be kept in mind during the electrophysiological assessment of neuropathies. Lack of awareness of these anomalies may re-sult in the wrong interpretation of nerve conduction results. The deep peroneal nerve, a major branch of the common peroneal nerve, usually innervates the EDB. In 21 - 28 % of subjects, this muscle also receives innervation from the acces-sory deep peroneal nerve, an anomalous branch of the super-ficial peroneal nerve. 1 This anomaly should be suspected when proximal stimulation of the common peroneal nerve at the knee <b>elicits</b> <b>higher</b> <b>amplitude</b> CMAP, than stimulation of the deep peroneal nerve at the ankle. Stimulation of the accessory deep peroneal nerve behind the lateral malleolus activates the anomalously innervated lateral portion of the EDB. Rarely, this anomalous branch may exclusively supply the EDB. In the presence of this anomaly, the lesions of the deep peroneal nerve spare the lateral portion or the whole of the EDB, thus leading to the possibility of an incorrect conclusion. 2 The in-heritance pattern of the accessory deep peroneal nerve shows an autosomal dominant trait. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{growing number}} of studies suggest that early visual {{processing}} is not only affected by low-level perceptual attributes but also by higher order cognitive factors such as attention or emotion. Using high-density electroencephalography, we recently demonstrated that attentional load of a task at fixation reduces the response of primary visual cortex to irrelevant peripheral stimuli, as indexed by the C 1 component. In the latter study, peripheral stimuli were always presented during intervals without task-relevant stimuli. Here, we use a similar paradigm but present central task stimuli and irrelevant peripheral stimuli simultaneously while keeping all other stimulus characteristics constant.

40|$|Frequency tagging is an EEG method {{based on}} the {{quantification}} of the steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) elicited from stimuli which flicker with a distinctive frequency. Because the amplitude of the SSVEP is modulated by attention such that attended stimuli <b>elicit</b> <b>higher</b> SSVEP <b>amplitudes</b> than do ignored stimuli, the method {{has been used to}} investigate the neural mechanisms of spatial attention. However, up to now it has not been shown whether the amplitude of the SSVEP is sensitive to gradations of attention and there has been debate about whether attention effects on the SSVEP are dependent on the tagging frequency used. We thus compared attention effects on SSVEP across three attention conditions-focused, divided, and ignored-with six different tagging frequencies. Participants performed a visual detection task (respond to the digit 5 embedded in a stream of characters). Two stimulus streams, one to the left and one to the right of fixation, were displayed simultaneously, each with a background grey square whose hue was sine-modulated with one of the six tagging frequencies. At the beginning of each trial a cue indicated whether targets on the left, right, or both sides should be responded to. Accuracy was higher in the focused- than in the divided-attention condition. SSVEP amplitudes were greatest in the focused-attention condition, intermediate in the divided-attention condition, and smallest in the ignored-attention condition. The effect of attention on SSVEP amplitude did not depend on the tagging frequency used. Frequency tagging appears to be a flexible technique for studying attention. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

Skin emanations from 27 human individuals, collected on glass marbles, were tested against ammonia in a dual-choice olfactometer to establish their degrees of attractiveness to anthropophilic Anopheles gambiae s. s.

40|$|A neural {{correlate}} for phrase boundary perception in language {{has recently been}} identified as a reliable and replicable brain effect. It is called the closure positive shift (CPS) and has an equivalent in the perception of music (music CPS). Nevertheless, either in language or in music, this component is elicited by phrase boundary embedded in sentence or melody. Poetry, as the interlude of language and music, is a special kind of discourse and promising material to explore prosodic boundary processing beyond sentence level. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the cognitive processing of hierarchical prosodic boundaries in Chinese Tang poem using rhythm matching task. There are generally four hierarchical levels in each poem, including foot boundary, phonological phrase boundary, intonational phrase boundary, and couplet boundary. The electrophysiological results indicated that all the prosodic boundaries of different levels in poems could give rise to the CPS reflecting prosodic phrasing. Furthermore, as the prosodic hierarchical level became higher, the onset latency of the CPS got longer, suggesting the influence of retrospective processing of former information. With regard to the amplitude, we analyzed the CPS amplitude in every 100 ms time window. It was showed that phonological phrase boundary <b>elicited</b> <b>higher</b> CPS <b>amplitude</b> as compared to that evoked by couplet boundary in an earlier time window, whereas in a later time window both of them were lower than the CPS correlated to intonational phrase boundary. The present results further shape our understanding of the CPS component and its relation to the processes involved in prosodic phrasing. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In the {{literature}} on implicit learning, controversy exists regarding whether the knowledge obtained from implicit sequence learning consists of context-bound superficial features or context-free structural rules. To explore the nature of implicit knowledge, event related potentials (ERP) recordings of participants’ performances in a non-local dependent transfer task under two response-stimulus-interval (RSI) conditions (250 and 750 ms) were obtained. In the behavioral data, a transfer effect {{was found in the}} 750 ms RSI condition but not in the 250 ms RSI condition, suggesting that a long RSI is the basis for the occurrence of non-local dependent transfer, as which might have provided enough reaction time for participants to process and capture the implicit rule. Moreover, P 300 amplitude was found {{to be sensitive to the}} impact of RSI on the training process (i. e., the longer RSI <b>elicited</b> <b>higher</b> P 300 <b>amplitudes),</b> while variations in both N 200 (i. e., a significant increase) and P 300 amplitudes (i. e., a significant decrease) were found to be related to the presence of a transfer effect. Our results supported the claim that implicit learning can involve abstract rule knowledge acquisition under an appropriate RSI condition, and that amplitude variation in early ERP components (i. e., N 200 and P 300) can be useful indexes of non-local dependent learning and transfer effects...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} in-vivo changes to ocular morphology during ocular accommodation, with particular attention to ciliary muscle changes, using pharmacological agents and physiological stimuli. To determine the optimum target for accommodation studies, accommodative responses to different stimuli were investigated. Insignificant differences in accommodative responses to a letter target and Maltese cross were found. Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) and semi-automated software were used for in-vivo investigation of ciliary muscle morphology. As expected, anti-muscarinic agents reduced the accommodative amplitude, the greatest effect evident with cyclopentolate hydrochloride 1 %, which was, in turn, associated with a reduced forward movement of the ciliary muscle, possibly due to the restricted movement of radial and longitudinal fibres. Pilocarpine nitrate 2 % induced a contractile shortening and anterior thickening of the ciliary muscle in both pre-presbyopic and presbyopic eyes. However, pilocarpine {{does not seem to}} be a super-stimulus for accommodation. Comparison between cyclopentolate and pilocarpine ciliary muscle morphology further supported the concept that anterior movement of ciliary muscle mass is essential to <b>elicit</b> <b>higher</b> accommodative <b>amplitudes.</b> Ciliary muscle asymmetry was identified between horizontal and vertical meridians. The findings confirmed a longer ciliary muscle in axial elongated eyes, however, only within the temporal, nasal, and superior muscle quadrants. Nevertheless, during accommodation, anterior thickening and contractile shortening of the muscle was evident for all four quadrants. The effect of accommodation on posterior eye conformation revealed a homogenous elongation of the posterior pole, with the greatest expansion occurring along the inferior-nasal quadrant, rather than the visual axis. The possibility of a vitreous role in accommodation is discussed. The studies presented herein suggest a forward movement of ciliary muscle mass is necessary for accommodation. Further research is required to establish whether a mechanical restriction occurs to the muscle with increasing age, resulting in presbyopia. Moreover, investigations are required to explore the variation in ciliary muscle morphology in eyes with ametropia, as well as the likely role of the vitreous in accommodation...|$|R

The peak of the melatonin rhythm was entrained by the cryophase temperature of the thermocycle in DD and LL, irrespective of the time at which the cryophase temperature was applied. Comparable thermocycles of 6 h at 15 °C imposed on a 12 L: 12 D photocycle, however, affected the amplitude and phase of the melatonin rhythm, depending on the phase relationship between light and temperature. Cold pulses in the early light period and at midday resulted, respectively, either in low amplitude or nonexistent melatonin rhythms, whereas those centered in or around the dark phase <b>elicited</b> rhythms of <b>high</b> <b>amplitude.</b> Supplementary experiments in 12 L: 12 D using two intermittent 6 -h 15 °C cryophases, one delivered in the midscotophase and another in the midphotophase, elicited melatonin rhythms comparable to those in lizards subjected to constant 33 °C and 12 L: 12 D.

30|$|The {{root-mean-square}} amplitude attributes (Fig.  13) were {{extracted from}} the seismic sections @ 20 – 40  ms windows covering the mapped horizons. This was done to analyze the amplitude changes and relate them possibly to changing reservoir properties away from well control. The results reveal two main characteristic patterns of <b>high</b> and low <b>amplitude</b> areas. There is an intermediate zone between the low and <b>high</b> <b>amplitudes</b> that may be regarded as transition zone, the low amplitude is considered as the background <b>amplitude,</b> while the <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> is the anomalous <b>amplitude.</b> The <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> is {{as a result of}} matrix fluid contact on the surface which makes it act as a reflection surface. It measures seismic reflectivity; therefore, the brighter the bright spot, the better the prospect. The NW–SE elongated <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> anomaly depicts a sand channel with very good lateral continuity of about 80 % of the entire horizon. The <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> zone falls within the top of the structure in the tested fault block, where the occurrence of hydrocarbon has been confirmed. Consequently, the attribute map helped in locating existing hydrocarbon zones and their lateral extent. It also extends to the roll-over structure in the upthrow side of fault F 3. Hence, regions of <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> constitute proven hydrocarbon areas and regions of prospect. This suggests that there is a relationship in the reservoir characteristics of the two structures and the root-mean-square amplitude attribute. Moreover, From the basic seismic theory of trace formation, reflection coefficient is convolved with extracted wavelet to form a trace. Reflection coefficient is related to acoustic impedance contrast which occurs at the boundary of two lithologies or fluids. The product of velocity and density yields the acoustic impedance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the <b>high</b> and low <b>amplitude</b> region may indicate impedance contrast between two different lithologies or fluids. The <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> zone is suspected to indicate the presence of hydrocarbon, since hydrocarbon has been confirmed in one of the regions.|$|R

However, the main issue preventing widespread use of these techniques is that they require <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> waves to induce the nonlinear response. To achieve such <b>high</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> transducers currently need to be bonded to the test material, reducing the range of applications.
