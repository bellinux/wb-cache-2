5|$|In the 19th century, recessions {{frequently}} {{coincided with}} financial crises. Determining {{the occurrence of}} pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of economic statistics, so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the <b>economic</b> <b>system</b> such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.|$|E

5|$|Kosygin {{would prove}} to be a very {{competent}} administrator, with the Soviet standard of living rising considerably due to his moderately reformist policy. Kosygin's moderate 1965 reform, as with Nikita Khrushchev's thaw, radicalised the Soviet reform movement. While Leonid Brezhnev was content to maintain the centralised structure of the Soviet planned economy, Kosygin attempted to revitalise the ailing <b>economic</b> <b>system</b> by decentralising management. Following Brezhnev's death in 1982, the reform movement was split between Yuri Andropov's path of discipline and control and Gorbachev's liberalisation of all aspects of public life.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund II's childlessness added {{urgency to}} the idea of turning the {{personal}} union between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into a more permanent and tighter relationship; it was also a priority for the execution movement. Lithuania's laws were codified and reforms enacted in 1529, 1557, 1565–1566 and 1588, gradually making its social, legal and <b>economic</b> <b>system</b> similar to that of Poland, with the expanding role of the middle and lower nobility.

5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} depends on means of production. Literally, those things, like land, {{natural resources and}} technology, necessary {{for the production of}} material goods and the relations of production. In other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, with the base (or substructure) referring to the <b>economic</b> <b>system</b> and superstructure, to the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.|$|E
5|$|While {{disagreeing with}} Nehru about socialist {{economic}} model, Gandhi also critiqued capitalism that {{was driven by}} endless wants and a materialistic view of man. This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism {{at the cost of}} other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships. To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital. A better <b>economic</b> <b>system</b> is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.|$|E
5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial <b>economic</b> <b>system,</b> involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1957 Mao {{suggested}} a nationwide programme of mass collectivization, in which China's farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao's theories on mass collectivization became {{the basis of the}} Great Leap Forward, a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, {{tens of millions of people}} had starved to death. From October–December 1958, the <b>economic</b> <b>system</b> in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to work in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet <b>economic</b> <b>system,</b> the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E
5|$|Weber's essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is {{his most}} famous work. It is argued that this work should {{not be viewed as}} a {{detailed}} study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the <b>economic</b> <b>system.</b> In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber put forward the thesis that Calvinist ethic and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy. Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant. Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world.|$|E
