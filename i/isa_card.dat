50|$|For security, WaveLAN used a 16-bit NWID (NetWork ID) field, which yielded 65,536 {{potential}} combinations; {{the radio}} {{portion of the}} device could receive radio traffic tagged with another NWID, but the controller would discard the traffic. DES encryption (56-bit) was an option {{in some of the}} <b>ISA</b> and MCA <b>cards</b> and all of the WavePoint access points. The full-length <b>ISA</b> and MCA <b>cards</b> had a socket for an encryption chip, the half-length 915 MHz <b>ISA</b> <b>cards</b> had solder pads for a socket which was never added, and the 2.4 GHz half-length <b>ISA</b> <b>cards</b> had the chip soldered directly to the board.|$|R

50|$|There {{still is}} an {{existing}} user base with old computers, so some <b>ISA</b> <b>cards</b> are still manufactured, e.g. with USB ports or complete single board computers based on modern processors, USB 3.0, and SATA.|$|R
5000|$|All recent Linux {{distributions}} support Sound Blaster Cards via kernel drivers. In case of non-Plug-and-Play <b>ISA</b> <b>cards,</b> a {{configuration file}} in [...] "/etc/modules" [...] must be reconfigured, writing for example with Sound Blaster 16 Card installed: [...] "snd-sb16 isapnp=0".|$|R
5000|$|Originally, the bus {{clock was}} {{synchronous}} with the CPU clock, resulting in varying bus clock frequencies {{among the many}} different IBM [...] "clones" [...] on the market (sometimes as high as 16 or 20 MHz), leading to software or electrical timing problems for certain <b>ISA</b> <b>cards</b> at bus speeds they were not designed for. Later motherboards or integrated chipsets used a separate clock generator, or a clock divider which either fixed the ISA bus frequency at 4, 6, or 8 MHz or allowed the user to adjust the frequency via the BIOS setup. When used at a higher bus frequency, some <b>ISA</b> <b>cards</b> (certain Hercules-compatible video cards, for instance), could show significant performance improvements.|$|R

5000|$|The EISA bus slot is a {{two-level}} staggered pin system, {{with the}} upper part of the slot corresponding to the standard ISA bus pin layout. The additional features of the EISA bus are implemented on the lower part of the slot connector, using thin traces inserted into the insulating gap of the upper / <b>ISA</b> <b>card</b> card edge connector. Additionally the lower part of the bus has five keying notches, so an <b>ISA</b> <b>card</b> with unusually long traces cannot accidentally extend down into the lower part of the slot.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The Octek Jaguar V {{motherboard}} from 1993.

Note the large AT keyboard connector at the back right is its only peripheral interface.|$|R
50|$|EISA {{replaced}} the tedious jumper configuration common with <b>ISA</b> <b>cards</b> with software-based configuration. Every EISA system shipped with an EISA configuration utility; this was usually a slightly customized {{version of the}} standard utilities written by the EISA chipset makers. The user would boot into this utility, either from floppy disk or on a dedicated hard drive partition. The utility software would detect all EISA cards in the system, and could configure any hardware resources (interrupts, memory ports, etc.) on any EISA card (each EISA card would include a disk with information that described the available options on the card), or on the EISA system motherboard. The user could also enter information about <b>ISA</b> <b>cards</b> in the system, allowing the utility to automatically reconfigure EISA cards to avoid resource conflicts.|$|R

50|$|The three ISA slots can be {{activated}} {{by use of}} a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board IBM-PC-compatible hardware, including Intel 80286, 80386, or 80486 microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. Compatible <b>ISA</b> <b>cards</b> may then be installed into the two remaining ISA slots.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{connected}} to an <b>ISA</b> <b>card</b> fitted into a PC expansion slot, {{each of which}} could host 2 x R.Ed units. Multiple host cards could be used. A PCI version of the Host card was available in 2001.|$|E
50|$|In general, the Mega PC {{was seen}} as a better-built device than Sega's TeraDrive, as the unit was more robust and had more {{efficient}} air circulation. The Mega PC was IBM-compatible and had a Mega Drive <b>ISA</b> <b>card,</b> a Mega Drive Controller, Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor, Joystick and Internal Speakers.|$|E

50|$|In {{applications}} where {{vertical clearance}} is {{at a premium}} (such as <b>ISA</b> <b>cards</b> in computers), it is often feasible to bend the leads at a right angle and mount the component flat to the printed wiring board using a screw and nut. This often provides enough surface area to heatsink the component when power dissipation is moderately high.|$|R
