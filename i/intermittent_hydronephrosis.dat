40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{ureteral}} polyp causing <b>intermittent</b> <b>hydronephrosis</b> in a 12 -year-old boy. He was often hospitalized with episodes of right flank pain and gross hematuria. An excretory urogram (IVP) revealed mild hydronephrosis, but it showed a markedly dilated right renal pelvis during the attack. An Anderson-Hynes type pyeloplasty was done. At operation we found four ureteral polyps, and performed partial ureterectomy including polyps. Pathological examination showed fibrous ureteral polyps. He has reported no symptoms for 3 months after the operation...|$|E
30|$|We {{present a}} case of a 31  year old G 0 with left sided pelvic pain and {{intermittent}} left sided hydronephrosis. On examination her pelvis is essentially frozen, with very limited mobility. This case was extensively discussed on the AAGL ListServ site and various treatment options were recommended, including Lupron, in vitro fertilization and surgery. We opted to proceed with surgery first given the significant amount of induration on examination and the history of <b>intermittent</b> <b>hydronephrosis.</b> The video demonstrates our routine for performing these challenging cases.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: There are {{no current}} {{guidelines}} for diagnosing and managing mild prenatal hydronephrosis. Variations in physician approach {{make it difficult}} to analyze outcomes and establish optimal management. We determined the variability of diagnostic approach and management regarding prenatal hydronephrosis among maternal-fetal medicine obstetricians, pediatric urologists and pediatric radiologists. Materials and Methods: Online surveys were sent to mailing lists for national societies for each specialty. Participants were surveyed regarding criteria for diagnosing mild prenatal hydronephrosis and recommendations for postnatal management, including use of antibiotic prophylaxis, followup scheduling and type of followup imaging. Results: A total of 308 maternal-fetal medicine obstetricians, 126 pediatric urologists and 112 pediatric radiologists responded. Pediatric urologists and radiologists were divided between Society for Fetal Urology criteria and use of anteroposterior pelvic diameter for diagnosis, while maternal-fetal medicine obstetricians preferred using the latter. For postnatal evaluation radiologists preferred using personal criteria, while urologists preferred using anteroposterior pelvic diameter or Society for Fetal Urology grading system. There was wide variation in the use of antibiotic prophylaxis among pediatric urologists. Regarding the use of voiding cystourethrography/radionuclide cystography in patients with prenatal hydronephrosis, neither urologists nor radiologists were consistent in their recommendations. Finally, there was no agreement on length of followup for mild prenatal hydronephrosis. Conclusions: We observed a lack of uniformity regarding grading criteria in diagnosing hydronephrosis prenatally and postnatally among maternal-fetal medicine obstetricians, pediatric urologists and pediatric radiologists. There was also a lack of agreement on the management of mild <b>intermittent</b> prenatal <b>hydronephrosis,</b> resulting in these cases being managed inconsistently. A unified set of guidelines for diagnosis, evaluation and management of mild <b>intermittent</b> prenatal <b>hydronephrosis</b> would allow more effective evaluation of outcomes...|$|R
40|$|A 14 -year-old boy {{presented}} with asymptomatic right hydronephrosis detected on routine yearly ultrasound examination. Previously, {{he had at}} least two normal renal ultrasonograms, 4 years after remission of acute myeloblastic leukemia, treated by AML-BFM- 93 protocol. A function of the right kidney and no damage on the left was confirmed by a DMSA scan. Right retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy revealed 3 renal arteries with the lower pole artery lying on the pelviureteric junction. Histologically chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis was detected.

40|$|Case 1 : An 8 -year-old boy {{consulted}} our clinic {{complaining of}} left flank colicky pain. He had a past {{history of the}} same episode. Ultrasonographic study was promptly performed. Left hydronephrosis was detected. At operation, left aberrant renal vessel was resected, {{and he has been}} free of pain. Case 2 : A 65 -year-old woman consulted our clinic because of abdominal pain and fever, who occasionally had the same episode. The existence and disappearance of the right hydronephrosis could be observed by emergency ultrasonography and following ultrasonic study, and the stenosis of the right lower ureter caused of cystitis cystica and glandularis was pointed out by retrograde ureterography. Diuresis ultrasonography by furosemide was performed to evaluate urinary tract stricture. In case 1, an incomplete obstruction pattern was obtained after operation, and in case 2, a complete obstruction pattern was shown. The emergency ultrasonography and diuresis ultrasonography were useful for the diagnosis and observation of <b>intermittent</b> <b>hydronephrosis...</b>|$|E
