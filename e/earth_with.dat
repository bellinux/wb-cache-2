Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive object that is pulling the Local Group, the Virgo Supercluster, and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.|$|E
5|$|As the Decepticons {{retreated from}} <b>Earth,</b> <b>with</b> a {{critically}} injured Megatron, {{it created a}} void among the Decepticon ranks.

A new team of Wreckers is sent by Prowl to retake the prison. They manage, however, at a heavy price with most members dead or critically wounded.|$|E
5|$|Careful {{measurement}} of {{the positions of the}} planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics.

5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the <b>earth</b> <b>with</b> outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth. It has an {{apparent}} magnitude (V) of 8.22, making the star too dim {{to see from}} <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> the naked eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with the naked eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest. The star's actual brightness is measured with an absolute magnitude of 4.12, {{similar to that of}} the Sun.|$|E
5|$|HD 20003 {{is a star}} of {{magnitude}} 8.37. It is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V a little cooler and smaller than our Sun around 143 light-years away.

5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion through space, but rather {{to the expansion of}} space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be moving away from the <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) convinces the Xindi-Aquatics to aid him in {{his fight}} against the Xindi-Reptilians and Insectoids {{alliance}} to prevent Earth's destruction by their superweapon. In {{the midst of a}} battle between the two Xindi factions, an away team is sent to rescue Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), previously captured by the Reptilians. However, the superweapon departs for <b>Earth,</b> <b>with</b> Archer in pursuit on board a Xindi vessel.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} <b>Earth</b> <b>with</b> a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
