5|$|Four middle-aged <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{known each}} other since sixth form, Baxter (John Simm), Quinn (Philip Glenister), Rick (Marc Warren) and Woody (Max Beesley), get {{together}} for a holiday in Majorca at the villa of Alvo (Ben Chaplin), a mutual friend who became wealthy in the property business. Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by {{a man in a}} Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove evidence of their presence, when they are mistaken for drug dealers and paid three million euros. Afterwards, the four learn from María (María Botto), a local detective, that they are caught up in a Serbian mafia drug smuggling operation. Using video camera footage of their holiday, Baxter learns the real perpetrators are corrupt police officers, including María and her superior Dominic (Tim Woodward). Alvo is revealed {{to be a part of}} the operation, and was murdered when he no longer wanted to take part in it. María later attempts to kill the four when employing scare tactics to make them part with the cash fails to work, but is shot to death by Quinn. The other three run over Dominic to save Quinn. They leave with the money and accidentally board a ferry to Ibiza (their intention is to go to Barcelona).|$|E

25|$|Liberal Quakerism {{generally}} {{refers to}} <b>Friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken ideas from liberal Christianity, often sharing a similar mix of ideas, such as more critical Biblical hermeneutics, {{often with a}} focus on the social gospel.

25|$|Simplicity to Friends has {{generally}} been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to {{what they need to}} live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony is not just about the nature of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many <b>Friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.|$|E

25|$|Forced to {{separate}} from the party, Noctis finally reaches the Crystal, only to be slowly pulled into it. Ardyn then appears and reveals himself to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, a former healer and king of Lucis who was chosen by the Crystal two thousand years ago. Ardyn had saved Eos by absorbing the Daemons into himself, only to be demonized by Noctis’ ancestors. Rendered immortal by the Daemons' power and denied ascension by the Astrals, Ardyn has since sought revenge on the royal bloodline and the Crystal, hastening {{the onset of the}} Starscourge while waiting for the True King to appear so he could destroy them both. Within the Crystal, Noctis encounters the Astral Bahamut; he learns that he is the True King of prophecy, who will cleanse the Starscourge and restore light to Eos. Noctis prepares himself to fulfill his destiny, knowing that it will cost him his life; upon his return to the mortal realm, he finds that ten years have passed. He reunites with his <b>friends,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been keeping the Daemons at bay since Eos’ descent into eternal darkness, before heading to the ruins of Insomnia. After the party defeats the rogue Astral Ifrit, Noctis confronts Ardyn alone and kills him in single combat. Noctis then ascends the throne, and using the power of the Lucii and the Crystal's light sacrifices his life to purge the Starscourge and the Daemons from the world. In the spirit realm, Noctis—with the aid of Lunafreya and the Lucii—destroys Ardyn's spirit.|$|E

500|$|In 1977 Le Mesurier portrayed Jacob Marley in a BBC {{television}} {{adaptation of}} A Christmas Carol, which starred Michael Hordern as Ebenezer Scrooge; Sergio Angelini, {{writing for the}} British Film Institute about Le Mesurier's portrayal, considered that [...] "although never frightening, he does exert {{a strong sense of}} melancholy, his every move and inflection seemingly tinged with regret and remorse". In 1979 he portrayed Sir Gawain in Walt Disney's Unidentified Flying Oddball, directed by Russ Mayberry, and co-starring Dennis Dugan, Jim Dale and Kenneth More. The film, an adaptation of Mark Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, was hailed by Time Out as [...] "an intelligent film with a cohesive plot and an amusing script" [...] and cited it as [...] "one of the better Disney attempts to hop on the sci-fi bandwagon". The reviewers praised the cast, particularly Kenneth More's Arthur and Le Mesurier's Gawain, which they said were [...] "rather touchingly portrayed as <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> grown old together".|$|E

500|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura, while exchanging e-mails with director Yoshinori Kitase {{during the}} period between the development of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII, suggested that the game should have a [...] "school days" [...] feel. Because Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age, the idea worked. Thus, they created the concept of military academies, called [...] "Gardens", in which students would train to become [...] "SeeD" [...] mercenaries. Nojima also planned for the two playable parties featured in the game—Squall's present day group and Laguna Loire's group of twenty years in the past—to highly contrast with one another. Laguna's group consists of characters in their late twenties and {{have a lot of}} combat experience. They are also close <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> fought together {{for a long time and}} trust one another. On the other hand, Squall's party is young and inexperienced, and Squall himself does not initially understand the value of friendship.|$|E
500|$|The rumors {{concerning}} his sexuality {{led to a}} Gawker article linking him to a New York Post Page Six blind item about a closeted gay actor, nicknamed [...] "the Gay Rapist". Despite {{the victim of the}} alleged attack denying that it was Franco, two magazines then contacted Franco's lawyer to alert them that they might run stories suggesting his involvement, but were unable to, as at least part of their stories were fabricated. However, Gawker refused to take their article down as they were simply reporting what another outlet published and instead offered him a chance to make a comment about the speculation on its website. He declined, hoping it would die down. The actor later called the episode very offensive because he has <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been raped. In July 2015, a former Gawker employee admitted on his Twitter account — in now deleted posts — that he was pressured to write a series of articles about [...] "the Gay Rapist", and lead readers into believing the man was Franco.|$|E
500|$|Katrina Kaif {{was born}} in Hong Kong with her mother's surname Turquotte (also spelt Turcotte), on 16 July 1983.

She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced {{when she was a}} child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: [...] "When I see <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for all the other things I have". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father.|$|E

500|$|In another interview, Ehrich {{expressed}} more of {{his opinions}} on the storyline, stating: [...] "It’s so relevant now and it’s such an epidemic. Just {{for it to be}} out there to show that it happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I’ve personally experience bullying and I know many <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>have.</b> Whether people’s reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids." [...] Of the character's [...] "dark side", Ehrich stated: [...] "I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." [...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve gotten to be out of control, and it’s a really nice feeling. It’s exhilarating." [...] He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey—a long, long journey to find some peace." ...|$|E
