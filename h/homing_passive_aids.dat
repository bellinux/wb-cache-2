40|$|Active force {{feedback}} in robots {{has been developed}} in the 1970 s as {{an answer to the}} limitations of the passive solutions, like the RCC (Remote Center Compliance), offered as an add-on for peg-into-hole assembly operations. Generic solutions of {{force feedback}} and impedance control have been developed in laboratory environments, but their industrial use has been very limited ever since. This situation has recently changed and it becomes feasible now to provide off-the-shelf industrial robots with real-time force feedback capabilities. In the paper, two convincing case-studies of tasks with force control will be presented. One is the synchronisation of a brake press with a plate-handling robot for sheet metal bending applications. Synchronisation is assured in two ways: (i) through a geometric bending model, and (ii) through active force feedback. The second case study deals with forcecontrolled assembly of rotary compressors. Here <b>passive</b> RCC-like <b>aids</b> are compared with force-feedback solutions. In some critical cases, active force feedback is the only solution, while in other cases <b>passive</b> <b>aids</b> suffice. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{telemetry}} {{acquisition system}} was a <b>passive</b> acquisition <b>aid</b> operated on the interfereometer principle which gives angular {{position of the}} target relative to the ship.

An overview of systems for needle placement was assembled, including those found in scientific publications and patents, as well as those that are commercially available. The systems are categorized by function and tabulated. Over 40 systems were identified, ranging from simple <b>passive</b> <b>aids</b> to fully actuated robots. The overview shows a wide variety of developed systems with growing complexity.

40|$|Work Centered Support System design {{represents}} {{an approach to}} the development of user interface application as an integrated, multi-faceted active and <b>passive</b> <b>aiding</b> system. Several successful instances of WCSSs have been developed using largely labor-intensive hand analysis and software coding methods.

These aiding tools for interface system development is expected to improve WCSS design, shorten develop time, and improve sustainability of released interface products.

40|$|Traditional {{guidance}} laws with range-to-go {{information or}} time-to-go estimation {{may not be}} implemented in <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> missiles since <b>passive</b> seekers cannot measure relative range directly. A time-varying biased proportional guidance law, which only uses line-of-sight (LOS) rate and look angle information, is proposed to satisfy both impact angle constraint and seeker’s field-of-view (FOV) limit. In the proposed guidance law, two time-varying bias terms are applied to divide the trajectory into initial phase and terminal phase. The initial bias is designed {{as a function of}} LOS rate and look angle to maintain the seeker’s lock-on while the final bias eliminates the deviation between the integral value of angle control bias and the expected bias amount. A switching logic is adopted to change the biases continuously so that there is no abrupt acceleration change during the engagement. Extensive simulations considering both kinematic and realistic missile models are performed to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was {{to analyze}} an {{influence}} of most important humanitarian actors and evaluate their cooperation and efficiency. The task of this thesis was too to show that humanitarian and development aid doesn't have to bring expectable results every time. Low effectiveness of humanitarian activities isn't only the consequence of an insufficient coordination of humanitarian organizations, but it particularly caused by features of a given country, its institutions, its rules and non-existing democracy. On {{the basis of this}} knowledge, the analysis of humanitarian aid in Haiti was conducted in this work, which became known to the public all over the world due to a devastating earthquake in January 2010, {{in spite of the fact}} that its economic situation has been for very poor for a long time before. The thesis also points on some mistakes of humanitarian organizations in the most important sectors and suggests its solution.

5000|$|The G7es (TXI) [...] "Zaunkönig II" [...] was a torpedo {{developed}} for German U-boats during World War II. The torpedo was electric {{and had an}} effective range of 5,700 m at a speed of 24 kn. This torpedo employed acoustic, <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> to find its target after a straight run of 400 m.

A design for a British Mk 31 torpedo which would have used active echo-location sonar failed to receive Government approval for production.
