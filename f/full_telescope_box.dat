40|$|We present {{analysis}} and numerical simulations {{of a new}} method to sense atmospheric wavefront distortion in real time with Rayleigh beacons. Multiple range-gated images of a single pulse from the laser are used to determine each phase map, providing an advantage over other methods in that photon noise is substantially reduced for a given brightness of the beacon. A laser at about 350 nm projects collimated pulses of light adjacent to the telescope. Rayleigh-scattered light from each pulse is recorded through the <b>full</b> <b>telescope</b> aperture in a sequence of video frames, each a few s long. Images are captured as the pulse approaches and passes through the height at which the camera is focused. Phase diversity is thus naturally introduced between the frames. An iterative algorithm is used to extract the pupil-plane phases from the recorded intensity distributions. We anticipate that such beacons {{are likely to be}} valuable in future advanced systems for adaptive optics on very large telescopes [...] ...|$|R

This software was originally intended for application to the James Webb Space Telescope, but is also applicable to other segmented-mirror telescopes. The software is capable of determining optical-wavefront information using, as input, a variable number of irradiance measurements collected in defocus planes about the best focal position.

This led us to investigate the new coronagraphic approach based {{on the use of}} a four-quadrant phase mask (FQPM). Combined with high-level wavefront correction on an unobscured off-axis section of a large telescope, this method allows high-contrast imaging very close to stars.

In June 2005, we deployed our instrument to the Palomar 200 -inch telescope, using existing facilities as much as possible for rapid implementation.

40|$|Space {{observations}} of fainter and more distant astronomical objects constantly require telescope primary mirrors {{with a larger}} size. The diameter of monolithic primary mirrors is limited to 10 m because of manufacturing and logistics limitations. For space telescopes, monolithic primary mirrors are limited to less than 5 m due to fairing capacity. Segmented primary mirrors thus constitute an alternative solution {{to deal with the}} steadily increase of the primary mirror size. The optical path difference between the individual segments must be close to zero (few nm) in order to be diffraction limited over the <b>full</b> <b>telescope</b> aperture.

The maps are sampled to the <b>full</b> <b>telescope</b> spatial resolution and reveal unprecedented detail on ~ 150 pc size scales. We detect [C II] emission over the whole mapped area, [O III] being the most luminous FIR line. The ratio of [O III]/[C II] peaks at about 2 toward the sites of massive star formation, higher than ratios seen in dusty starburst galaxies. The [C II]/CO ratios are 20 000 to 70 000 toward the 2 massive clusters, which are at least {{an order of magnitude}} larger than spiral or dusty starbursts, and cannot be reconciled with single-slab PDR models. Toward the 2 massive star-forming regions, we find that L[CII] is 0. 5 to 0. 8 % of the LTIR. All of the lines together contribute up to 2 % of LTIR. These extreme findings are a consequence of the lower metallicity and young, massive-star formation commonly found in dwarf galaxies. These conditions promote large-scale photodissociation into the molecular reservoir, which is evident in the FIR line ratios. This illustrates the necessity to move to multiphase models applicable to star-forming clusters or galaxies as a whole. Comment: Accepted for publication in the A&A Herschel Special Issu...|$|R
40|$|Telescoping Half Slotted Containers (HSC) and Diagonal Corner Bliss style {{containers}} {{are popular}} choices for packaging agricultural {{products such as}} apples, pears, citrus, potatoes, garlic and most vegetables. This study evaluated two unique corrugated container designs, Kisch Full Circle Tray (FCT) and Single V Kisch Bliss, which are both viable designs available to replace the presently used styles of boxes for produce distribution. This paper presents the compression strength results of Telescoping HSC containers as compared to two possible replacements and the Diagonal Corner Bliss designs when stored under standard, refrigerated and tropical conditions. It also compares the material savings and the life-cycle environmental impacts for the three designs against the Telescoping HSC design. Comparing the average overall peak forces, across all three environmental conditions of the <b>Telescoping</b> HSC <b>boxes</b> {{to that of the}} three designs, it was concluded that the Kisch FCT boxes were approximately 17 % weaker, while providing material savings of over 14 %; the Diagonal Corner Bliss boxes were approximately 9 % weaker, while providing material savings of almost 22 % and the Single V Kisch Bliss boxes were approximately 14 % stronger, while providing material savings of over 19 %.

40|$|The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) {{primary mirror}} (PM) is 6. 6 m in {{diameter}} and consists of 18 hexagonal segments, each 1. 5 m point-to-point. Each segment has a six degree-of-freedom hexapod actuation system and a radius-of-curvature (RoC) actuation system. The <b>full</b> <b>telescope</b> will be tested at its cryogenic operating temperature at Johnson Space Center. This testing will include center-of-curvature measurements of the PM, using the Center-of-Curvature Optical Assembly (COCOA) and the Absolute Distance Meter Assembly (ADMA). The COCOA includes an interferometer, a reflective null, an interferometer-null calibration system, coarse & fine alignment systems, and two displacement measuring interferometer systems. A multiple-wavelength interferometer (MWIF) is used for alignment & phasing of the PM segments. The ADMA is used to measure, and set, the spacing between the PM and {{the focus of the}} COCOA null (i. e. the PM center-of-curvature) for determination of the ROC.

40|$|We {{report on}} high-accuracy {{high-resolution}} (< 20 mas) stellar observations obtained with the Palomar Fiber Nuller (PFN), a near-infrared (2. 2 μm) interferometric coronagraph {{installed at the}} Palomar Hale telescope. The PFN uses destructive interference between two elliptical (3 m × 1. 5 m) sub-apertures of the primary to reach high dynamic range inside the diffraction limit of the <b>full</b> <b>telescope.</b> In order to validate the PFN's instrumental approach and its data reduction strategy, based on the newly developed "Null Self-Calibration" (NSC) method, we observed a sample of eight well-characterized bright giants and supergiants. The quantity measured is the source astrophysical null depth, or equivalently the object's visibility at the PFN 3. 2 m interferometric baseline. For the bare stars α Boo, α Her, β And, and α Aur, PFN measurements are in excellent agreement with previous stellar photosphere measurements from long baseline interferometry. For the mass-losing stars β Peg, α Ori, ρ Per, and χ Cyg, circumstellar emission and/or asymmetries are detected. Overall, these early observations demonstrate the PFN's ability to measure astrophysical null depths below 10 ^(– 2) (limited by stellar diameters), with 1 σ uncertainties as low as a few 10 ^(– 4). Such visibility accuracy is unmatched at this spatial resolution in the near-infrared and translates into a contrast better than 10 ^(– 3) within the diffraction limit. With further improvements anticipated in 2011 / 2012, a state-of-the-art infrared science camera and a new extreme adaptive optics system, the PFN should provide a unique tool {{for the detection of}} hot debris disks and young self-luminous sub-stellar companions in the immediate vicinity of nearby stars...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary mirror}} control system (M 1 CS) keeps the 492 {{segments}} of the Thirty Meter Telescope primary mirror aligned {{in the presence of}} disturbances. A global position control loop uses feedback from inter-segment edge sensors to three actuators behind each segment that control segment piston, tip and tilt. If soft force actuators are used (e. g. voice-coil), then in addition to the global position loop there will be a local servo loop to provide stiffness. While the M 1 control system at Keck compensates only for slow disturbances such as gravity and thermal variations, the M 1 CS for TMT will need to provide some compensation for higher frequency wind disturbances in order to meet stringent error budget targets. An analysis of expected high-wavenumber wind forces on M 1 suggests that a 1 Hz control bandwidth is required for the global feedback of segment edge-sensor-based position information in order to minimize high spatial frequency segment response for both seeing-limited and adaptive optics performance. A much higher bandwidth is required from the local servo loop to provide adequate stiffness to wind or acoustic disturbances. A related paper presents the control designs for the local actuator servo loops. The disturbance rejection requirements would not be difficult to achieve for a single segment, but the structural coupling between segments mounted on a flexible mirror cell results in control-structure interaction (CSI) that limits the achievable bandwidth. Using a combination of simplified modeling to build intuition and the <b>full</b> <b>telescope</b> finite element model for verification, we present designs and analysis for both the local servo loop and global loop demonstrating sufficient bandwidth and resulting wind-disturbance rejection despite the presence of CSI...|$|R
