Low-ability workers have higher turnover rates, they are more often employed in low-wage firms and face an earnings distribution with a higher frictional component.

25|$|In the United States, an {{exception}} is the merchant <b>firm</b> <b>offer</b> rule set out in Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205, which states that an offer is firm and irrevocable if it is an offer {{to buy or sell}} goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the offeror. Such an offer is irrevocable {{even in the absence of}} consideration. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.|$|E
25|$|After the {{depositions}} {{had been}} taken and briefs filed, the defendants moved for summary judgement. Judge Michael M. Mihm granted it on all but the First Amendment claim. Much of his opinion, handed down in early 1990, consisted of a lengthy explication of Illinois case law on contract formation as it applied to language in the hospital's employee handbook. He held {{that it did not}} constitute a <b>firm</b> <b>offer</b> of continued employment and thus could not be considered a contract Churchill had become party to by continuing to work once aware of its terms. Since there was no contract to breach, there could be no denial of due process rights. He could not grant summary judgement on the First Amendment claim since there was a factual dispute in that area, and ordered a status conference to be held the next month with a magistrate.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} firms' {{incentive}} to offer customized products {{in addition to}} their standard products in a competitive environment. We offer several key insights. First, we delineate market conditions in which firms will (will not) offer customized products {{in addition to their}} standard products. Surprisingly, we find that when <b>firms</b> <b>offer</b> customized products they are able to not only expand demand, but can also the prices of their standard products relative to when they do not. Second, we find that when a <b>firm</b> <b>offers</b> customized products it is a dominant strategy for it to also offer its standard product. This result highlights the role of standard products and the importance of retaining them when <b>firms</b> <b>offer</b> customized products. Third, we identify market conditions under which ex ante symmetric firms will adopt symmetric or asymmetric customization strategies. Fourth, we highlight how the degree of customization offered in equilibrium is affected by market parameters. We find that the degree of customization is lower when both <b>firms</b> <b>offer</b> customized products relative to the case when only one <b>firm</b> <b>offers</b> customized products. Finally, we show that customizing products under competition does not lead to a prisoner's dilemma. degree of product customization, mass customization, standard products, competition, game theory...|$|R

2500|$|The city's {{management}} agreement {{came to an}} end in 2003. [...] City managers {{argued that}} they should be allowed to renew the contract. The city proposed using its own funds to renovate the arena, and {{to begin the process of}} planning for a new, greatly expanded multi-purpose convention center and sports arena. As a gesture of good faith, Great Falls city commissioners said they had spent $6,000 to study the ice rink covering issue and $2,000 on a handicapped-accessibility study, and had agreed to spend $200,000 to purchase the ice rink covering. The purchased was designed to meet the needs of local youth hockey organizations, which in 2002 were the arena's largest tenant (paying $65,000 in fees in 2002 and an anticipated $85,000 in fees in 2003). But it was also designed to expand the facility's use, and reduce the city's subsidy to the fairgrounds. [...] Four Seasons managers noted that the arena had to turn away bands, comedians, and other entertainers because the venue could not be turned around fast enough. Cascade County managers, however, argued that although the county did not have the credit rating or tax revenues of the city, they could obtain grants to make the improvements the city was to pay for. They also said that their lack of management expertise did not matter, as they were considering contracting with SMG World, an arena management firm, to run Four Seasons. In October 2002, SMG said it needed more time to assess the fairgrounds in order to make a <b>firm</b> <b>offer.</b> With Cascade County apparently committed to taking over the fairgrounds and Four Seasons Arena again, the city of Great Falls demanded that the county to pay $1 million to reimburse the city for improvements made there (a figure which included $142,250 renovating the heating, air conditioning, and carpeting at the arena). The county refused, and offered to pay less than 20% of that figure. After extensive negotiations, Cascade County agreed to pay $384,370 over 10 years at 4% interest (a total which included all of the improvements to the arena). On November 12, 2002, Cascade County signed a formal agreement to allow SMG World to take over management of the fairgrounds and arena.|$|E

Our theory predicts that low-quality <b>firms</b> <b>offer</b> inefficiently strict terms for refunds, while high-quality <b>firms</b> <b>offer</b> inefficiently generous terms. This may help to explain the observed variety in contractual terms. As in our model strict cancellation terms and low refunds are used to price discriminate, rather than to trap consumers into purchasing inferior products, {{the imposition of a}} statutory minimum refund policy would not, in general, improve consumer surplus or welfare. ...|$|R
