40|$|The {{problem of}} {{deriving}} a probabilistic mathematical model of an industrial production line is {{addressed in this}} paper. In particular, the analysis of a Tetra Pak liquid foodstuff packaging line has been developed as application of the modeling theory. Tetra Pak's package forming machine works {{on the basis of}} a continuous process which cannot be interrupted without production wasting. Production buffer are used to decouple package forming machine with following (downstream) machines (e. g. straw applicator, <b>film</b> <b>wrapper,</b> etc.) to avoid forming machine forced stoppage because downstream machine stoppage. The paper presents a new analytical approach for the packaging forming machine restart control policy based on buffer level...|$|E
50|$|Tetra Pak is a {{multinational}} food packaging and processing sub-company of Tetra Laval, with head offices in Lund, Sweden, and Lausanne, Switzerland. The company offers packaging, filling machines and processing for dairy, beverages, cheese, ice-cream and prepared food, including distribution tools like accumulators, cap applicators, conveyors, crate packers, <b>film</b> <b>wrappers,</b> line controllers and straw applicators.|$|R
50|$|While the {{original}} idea was to provide hygienic pre-packaging for liquid food stuffs, Tetra Pak is now providing a range of different packaging and processing products and services due to its acquisition of Alfa Laval in 1991, consequently supplying complete systems of processing, packaging and distribution within fields as various as ice cream, cheese, fruit and vegetables and pet food.In addition to its various packaging products, Tetra Pak thus provides integrated processing and distribution lines for different kinds of food manufacturing, including packaging machines and carton paper, equally providing distribution equipment like conveyors, tray packers, <b>film</b> <b>wrappers,</b> crates, straws and roll containers. The company additionally offers automated production equipment and technical service.|$|R

50|$|The {{third and}} final {{installment}} is The World's End, a 2013 science fiction apocalyptic comedy. The film follows a group of friends, led by Pegg, reattempting an epic pub crawl during an alien occupation of their home town. In the final scene of the <b>film,</b> a Cornetto <b>wrapper</b> blows past in a breeze, briefly catching on a wire fence.|$|R
40|$|Plastics are manmade long chain {{polymeric}} molecules {{which are}} resistant against microbial attack and {{become part of}} parcel of today life. It {{turns out to be}} imperative component in agriculture as different plastics are used for various purposes namely plasticulture, polyhouses, mulches, packaging container, shrink <b>film</b> <b>wrappers,</b> etc. Plastics have replaced paper and cellulose-based products for packaging because of their strength, lightness, resistance to water and most water borne microorganism. Nowadays a wide variety of synthetic polymers are produced worldwide to the extent of ~ 140 million tonnes every year. Remarkable of these polymers are introduced in the ecosystem as industrial waste products every year. The dramatic increase in production and lack of biodegradability of commercial polymers, particularly commodity plastics used in packaging, industry and agriculture, focused public attention on a potentially huge environmental accumulation and pollution problem that could persist for centuries. Because of their persistence in our environment, several communities are now more sensitive to the impact of discarded plastic on the environment, including deleterious effects on wildlife and on the aesthetic qualities of cities and forests. In addition, the burning of polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastics produces persistent organic pollutants (POPs) known as furans and dioxins. In order to find alternatives, a new material has been developed known as bioplastic. Bioplastics are long chain of monomers joined with each other by ester bonds. These plastics are thus considered as polyesters. Bioplastics are classified into variou...|$|R
30|$|To 25  ml {{sample in}} a 50 -ml Erlenmeyer flask, 1  ml phenol {{solution}}, 1  ml sodium nitroprusside solution and 2.5  ml oxidizing solution were added with thorough mixing. Samples {{were covered with}} plastic wrap or paraffin <b>wrapper</b> <b>film.</b> Colour development was allowed at room temperature (22 °C to 27 °C) in subdued light for at least 1  h. Absorbance was measured at 640  nm on a spectrophotometer. A blank {{and at least two}} other standards by diluting stock ammonium solution were prepared into the sample concentration range. Standards were treated the same as samples and compared with the standard curve to get the exact value.|$|R
40|$|Starch based films, {{reinforced}} by {{two types of}} polysaccharide-based crystals, were prepared and compared. The films were transparent and their surface was smooth in appearance. Addition of crystals increased the Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus and tensile strength of starch-based materials and decreased elongation at break. Scanning electron microscopic observation indicated good compatibility between starch matrix and the reinforcing fillers due to same chemical unit (glucose). Cellulose crystals have higher thermal stability than that of starch crystals; this provides better processibility and superior mechanical properties to starch films filled with cellulose crystals. On the other hand, starch films filled with starch crystals demonstrated higher protection againstUV radiation. Since all the components used in this work belong to food sources, the prepared films are biodegradable, safe for food packaging and {{can also be used}} to developed ible <b>films</b> (such as <b>wrappers</b> for candies) and medicinal capsules (both soft and hard capsules) ...|$|R
