50|$|The MK28C is {{a variant}} of the MK28. The MK28C (C - chassis) {{replaced}} Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) types, these based on a mix of tactical and commercial truck chassis and including: water distributor, 2,000 US gallon; fuel, 1,500 US gallon; field service; asphalt distributor; <b>earth</b> <b>auger.</b> Interchangeable commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) - or modified COTS - bodies are fitted to MK28C chassis as field circumstances dictate.|$|E

30|$|The {{experimental}} {{area for the}} study was established in April 2010 on post-agricultural land covering 5.91  ha. Poplar saplings were planted in holes, created by an <b>earth</b> <b>auger</b> powered by a tractor, with spacing of 2.5 [*]×[*] 3  m (1333  plants ha− 1). The {{experimental area}} was fenced to prevent browsing by wild animals.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect and reliability of soil sample volume on nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) and soil-water content in the soil. Four soil sampling devices (a 20. 3 -cm power <b>earth</b> <b>auger,</b> a 5. 1 -cm hand <b>earth</b> <b>auger,</b> a 3. 2 -cm soil probe and a 1. 9 -cm soil probe) were used to collect soil samples from 35 conventionally tilled and 35 no-till locations. Soil samples were taken at 30 -cm intervals {{to a depth of}} 150 cm with each of the four sampling devices and were analyzed for NO 3 -N and moisture contents. Results {{of this study indicate that}} sample volume has no significant effect on determining soil-moisture content. Sample volume also had no effect on NO 3 -N concentration in the soil water under no-till conditions but had a definite impact on the NO 3 -N levels in the conventionally tilled soils. Results further indicate that a 5. 1 -cm diameter sample may best predict the quantity of residual soil NO 3 -N...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{annoyance}} {{caused by}} single and combined construction machinery noise is evaluated through the auditory experiments of two groups those are residents and construction engineers. Six construction machinery noises those are pile driver, <b>earth</b> <b>auger,</b> pay loader, breaker, bulldozer and excavator {{were recorded in}} several construction sites in Korea, by using the binaural ear microphone. LAeq was varied from 40 to 90 dBA with an interva l of 5 dBA for auditory experiment of single construction machinery noise. The annoyance for each construction machineries were increased according to increase noise level. Annoyance for four combined construction noises was evaluated by auditory experiment. LAeq was varied from 40 to 75 dBA with an interval of 5 dBA. The variations in annoyance scores were not sensitive when background noise levels increased. Based on the results, it can be suggested that the reasonable SNR were ranged from 0 to 10 dBA...|$|E
