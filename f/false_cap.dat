5000|$|In 1964 Cardinal Cushing {{authorized}} {{the restoration of}} the church, including the lowering of the building upon its original foundation and the reconstruction of the Bulfinch cupola. Chester F. Wright was architect for the rebuilding and the work was done by Isaac Blair & Co., the same firm that had raised and moved the church almost a century earlier. During the restoration a careful search was made for evidence of the original work, and in the process the old copper-covered dome was found beneath the <b>false</b> <b>cap</b> and the side entrance doors, complete with hardware, were discovered bricked up in the porch. George E. Ryan wrote of the restoration work: ...|$|E
50|$|Amanita manginiana, {{also known}} as Mangin's <b>false</b> death <b>cap,</b> is a species of the genus Amanita.|$|R
50|$|The <b>false</b> death <b>cap</b> {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodlands in Autumn in Europe. It {{is also found in}} North American oak and pine forests.|$|R
50|$|Edible {{species of}} Amanita include Amanita fulva (grisette), Amanita vaginata, Amanita calyptrata (coccoli), Amanita crocea, Amanita rubescens (blusher), Amanita caesarea (Caesar's mushroom), Amanita jacksonii (American Caesar's mushroom), and Amanita citrina (<b>false</b> death <b>cap).</b>|$|R
5000|$|True morels are {{distinguished}} from false morels (Gyromitra spp. and Verpa spp.). <b>False</b> morels have <b>caps</b> attached {{at the top}} of the stalk, while true morels have a honeycombed cap and a single, continuous hollow chamber within.|$|R
50|$|Known as the <b>false</b> death <b>cap,</b> or Citron Amanita, Amanita citrina (previously {{also known}} as Amanita mappa), is a basidiomycotic mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It grows in {{silicate}} soil {{in the summer and}} autumn months. It bears a pale yellow or sometimes white cap, with white stem, ring and volva. Though it is not poisonous, its similarity to the lethal death cap (Amanita phalloides) precludes its use in cooking.|$|R
50|$|Amanita pseudoporphyria, {{also known}} as Hongo's <b>false</b> death <b>cap,</b> is a species of agaric fungus from the genus Amanita that grows solitarily or gregarious in {{coniferous}} forests. Originally described from Japan, it is now also known in Northern India, Thailand, and Nepal. It is quite a common species in southern China and is sold in free markets, along with the similar mushroom, Amanita manginiana. It differs only slightly by having more abundant inflated cells of its volva, and its ellipsoid to broad ellipsoid spores.|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{widespread in the}} Americas and Europe. It can grow either singly, scattered, or in groups. It prefers habitats like coniferous and mixed forests and alongside paths, where it fruits in summer and fall. It is a toxic mushroom that has muscarine, the same toxin as Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina {{as well as many}} species in the Clitocybe and Inocybe genera. It is often confused with various other European species. A.gemmata resembles the <b>false</b> death <b>cap,</b> tawny grisette and panther cap mushrooms. Its cap is brighter in color than the former, and more yellow than the latter two.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hymenoptera stings can induce {{specific}} IgE (sIgE) to carbohydrate determinants (CD) on venom glycoproteins that cross-react with CD in pollen. sIgE to such cross-reacting CD (CCD) {{are believed}} to have little or no biological activity and thus may cause misdiagnosis of pollen sensitization after a sting. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of multiple <b>false</b> positive <b>CAP</b> results to pollen because of sting induced anti-CCD sIgE in Hymenoptera venom (HV) allergic patients and to investigate the association of such anti-CCD sIgE with features of 'atopy'. METHODS: Skin prick tests (SPT) and CAP tests with grass, tree and weed pollen and with house dust mite (HDM) were carried out prospectively in 259 HV allergic patients and CAP tests with honeybee (HBV) and yellow jacket (YJV) venom were performed. Patients with negative pollen SPT associated with positive CAP tests to all three pollen groups were operationally defined as 'CCD positive'. We investigated in selected 'CCD positive' patients the presence of anti-CCD sIgE by CAP tests with bromelain and studied the identity of CD in HVs and pollen by mutual sIgE inhibition tests with CD from proteinase treated HBV (HBV-CD) and Lolium perenne (Lol-CD) extracts. RESULTS: sIgE to all three pollen groups without positive SPT or history was found in 16 % of 259 patients. The presence of anti-CCD sIgE was substantiated by positive CAP tests with bromelain in 14 / 14 and by inhibition of all pollen CAP tests with HBV-CD in 8 / 9 and with Lol-CD in 2 / 2 patients. Double venom (DV) positive CAP tests were present in 93 % of 'CCD positive' patients and were in some associated with DV skin test positivity and allergy. The prevalence of 'CCD positivity' was significantly higher among HBV (23 %) than among YJV (11 %) allergic patients, but was also unexpectedly high among those with DV allergy (47 %). 'CCD positive' patients were younger, had a higher total IgE and more sIgE to HDM than 'CCD negative' patients. CONCLUSION: We have shown that the risk in HV allergic patients for misdiagnosis of multivalent pollen sensitization is 16 %, and we have confirmed that sting induced anti-pollen sIgE are directed to similar CD in venoms and pollen. We found evidence that the recognition of CCD might be related to the 'atopic' trait. Importantly, a positive bromelain CAP test does not exclude clinical reactivity to both venoms in 'CCD positive' HV allergic patients. status: publishe...|$|R
500|$|Marvel Comics' {{incorporation}} of LGBT themes has been unfavorably {{compared with that}} of DC; its use of gay characters has been described as [...] "less prolific but more deliberate". Marvel reportedly had a [...] "No Gays in the Marvel Universe" [...] policy during Jim Shooter's 1980s tenure, and Marvel's policy from the 1990s had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an [...] "Adults Only" [...] label, in response to conservative protests. However, these policies did not stop creators from slipping in gay characters and themes; J.M. DeMatteis introduced Arnie Roth, a childhood friend of Steve Rogers, who comes to Cap seeking help in rescuing his [...] "roommate" [...] Michael. Later, Arnie himself is captured by Baron Zemo and forced to dress in flamboyant clothes and stage make-up and give a speech about how his love for Michael is <b>false</b> and unnatural. <b>Cap</b> rescues Arnie and reassures him that his love for Michael is as genuine as Cap's own love for his girlfriend, Sharon. The story appears to have gone under the radar purely because DeMatteis did not use the word [...] "gay". Subsequent official character biographies have confirmed Arnie Roth as gay. As of 2006, these policies are no longer enforced and LGBT characters appear regularly in Marvel comics. Although same-sex couples are depicted occasionally kissing, intimate or sexual scenes have not been shown, even in Marvel's [...] "Adult only" [...] imprint. The use of mutants and the discrimination they face in the X-Men comics has been seen {{as a metaphor for the}} real-world discrimination directed at minority groups including LGBT people.|$|R
