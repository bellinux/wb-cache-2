25|$|One of {{the most}} common causes of falsely high <b>breath</b> <b>analyzer</b> {{readings}} is the existence of mouth alcohol.

However, alcohol may have come from the mouth, throat or stomach for a number of reasons. To help guard against mouth-alcohol contamination, certified breath-test operators are trained to observe a test subject carefully for at least 15–20 minutes before administering the test.|$|R

40|$|A novel breath-alcohol {{analyzer}} {{based on}} the standardization of the breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) to the alveolar-air water vapour concentration has been developed and evaluated. The present study compares results with this particular <b>breath</b> <b>analyzer</b> with arterial blood alcohol concentrations (ABAC), the most relevant quantitative measure of brain alcohol exposure. The precision of analysis of alcohol in arterial blood and breath were determined {{as well as the}} agreement between ABAC and BrAC over time post-dosing. Twelve healthy volunteers were administered 0. 6 galcohol/kg bodyweight via an orogastric tube. Duplicate breath and arterial blood samples were obtained simultaneously during the absorption, distribution and elimination phases of the alcohol metabolism with particular emphasis on the absorption phase. The precision of the <b>breath</b> <b>analyzer</b> was similar to the determination of blood alcohol concentration by headspace gas chromatography (CV 2. 40 vs. 2. 38 %, p= 0. 43). The ABAC/BrAC ratio stabilized 30 min post-dosing (2089 ± 99; mean±SD). Before this the BrAC tended to underestimate the coexisting ABAC. In conclusion, breath alcohol analysis utilizing standardization of alcohol to water vapour was as precise as blood alcohol analysis, the present "gold standard" method.

25|$|The oldest <b>breath</b> <b>analyzer</b> models pass <b>breath</b> {{through a}} {{solution}} of potassium dichromate, which oxidizes ethanol into acetic acid, changing color in the process. A monochromatic light beam is passed through this sample, and a detector records the change in intensity and, hence, the change in color, {{which is used to}} calculate the percent alcohol in the breath. However, since potassium dichromate is a strong oxidizer, numerous alcohol groups can be oxidized by it, producing false positives.

The characteristic bond of alcohols in infrared is the O-H bond, which gives a strong absorbance at a short wavelength.

The suspect will also be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (sometimes referred to as driving or operating while intoxicated). While BrAC tests are not necessary to prove a defendant was under the influence, laws in most states require the jury to presume that he was under the influence if his BrAC is found and believed to be over 0.08 (grams of alcohol/210 liters breath) when driving.
