The binary separation of dextran T 6 and fructose with linear isotherm is modeled with Aspen Chromatography simulator in a four zone SMB with one column per zone for both normal-feed and Partial Feed. Increase in number of <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> and feed time in the cycle plays a very important role in the separation performance with Partial Feed. In addition, the effect of mode of operation (early or late introduction of increase in number of <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> in the cycle) on product purity and recovery is also investigated. Furthermore, the binary separation system is designed with the safety margin method and the optimum operating parameters for simulation are calculated with triangle theory. Finally, a new strategy with Partial Feed is developed, showing improved separation performance relative to the basic four-zone SMB with regard to extract stream purity and recovery. The results of the proposed study can served as a useful summary of Partial Feed operation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main results obtained during {{several years of}} studies with periodically fed biological reactors (sequencing batch reactors, SBRs) {{from the perspective of}} wastewater treatment. Substrate (acetate) removal mechanisms under transient conditions were studied both in the SBR and in batch tests, as were their dependence on the applied operating conditions in the SBR (organic load rate and/or sludge age, <b>feed</b> <b>length,</b> aerobic or anoxic conditions). The most general evidence was the relevant role of storage (usually representing about 70 % of the overall observed yield) and the negligible role of growth (usually less than 10 %) during acetate removal for all tested conditions. However, when acetate was present for a long enough time, physiological adaptation could occur, and the growth contribution could become more important. The applied operating conditions affected the biomass behavior. In particular, with an increase in the applied organic load rate, the observed yield in the SBR and the acetate removal rate in the batch tests decreased, whereas with an increase in the <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> (other conditions being the same), the relevance of the storage response decreased. The role of dynamic conditions in selecting a floc-forming or filamentous biomass was also investigated. Even though a floc-forming biomass usually developed, filament growth was also sometimes observed. Thus, the usual assumption that filaments are less able than floc-formers to store the substrate should not be considered as an absolute rule. Finally, an empirical kinetic model, including growth and storage both in parallel and in sequence, was defined and applied to describe and interpret the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{sharpness}} angle on tool wear {{and the effect}} of tool wear on machined surface roughness were investigated in wood flour/polyethylene composite (WFPEC) peripheral up-milling using cemented tungsten carbide (TC) tools. It was shown that nose width and edge recession increased with increasing <b>feeding</b> <b>length.</b> During the milling process, the wear of the nose width was smallest for the tool with a sharpness angle of 45 °, followed by tools with sharpness angles of 55 ° and 65 °. The wear of edge recession was highest for the tool with a sharpness angle of 45 °, followed by tools with sharpness angles of 55 ° and 65 °. The nose width increased with increasing sharpness angle, the edge recession decreased with increasing sharpness angle, and the machined surface roughness increased with increasing sharpness angle after a <b>feeding</b> <b>length</b> of 40 m. The nose width had a positive effect on the machined surface roughness, and the machined surface roughness increased with increasing nose width. The edge recession had little effect on the machined surface roughness. The clearance face roughness of the worn tool increased with increasing sharpness angle. The analysis of the SEM micrographs and EDS of the clearance face of the worn tool showed that the wear mechanisms of the cemented tungsten carbide tool were oxidation and abrasion in the range tested during cutting. Thus, a slight wear of the edge recession is gained in exchange for a lower machined surface roughness by decreasing the sharpness angle. Validerad; 2014; 20140507 (matse...|$|R

40|$|Many {{bird species}} need to {{accumulate}} fat deposits prior to long distance migration. The surplus energy {{required to achieve}} this {{can be obtained by}} increasing food intake. There are two main ways of attaining an increased food intake; by increasing <b>feeding</b> day <b>length</b> or by an increase in the rate of feeding. The foraging and roosting behaviour of Turnstones, Arenaria interpres, and Purple Sandpipers, Calidris maritima, was studied in the spring pre-migratory period at Hartlepool, N. E. England. Adult Turnstone increase both their <b>feeding</b> day <b>length</b> and <b>feeding</b> rate. First year Turnstones show no lengthening of their feeding day and only a small increase in feeding rate, they do not undergo long distance migration so do not need to deposit fat. Purple Sandpipers do not exhibit an increase in their <b>feeding</b> day <b>length,</b> due to the availability of their feeding areas being strictly tidally controlled, and rely on an increased feeding rate alone to achieve fat deposition. Associated with the increased feeding rates is a reduction in time spent vigilant, suggesting a trade off occurs as increased time spent foraging becomes more beneficial.

In this paper, an analysis of broadband L-probe fed variations of microstrip antenna like, circular microstrip antenna, annular ring microstrip antenna, rectangular microstrip antenna, E-shaped microstrip antenna and half E-shaped microstrip antenna, is presented. It was observed that, total L-probe <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> nearly equals quarter wavelength at the resonance frequency of equivalent patch. Further using this quarter wavelength approximation, L-probe fed rectangular and circular microstrip antennas were re-designed at different frequencies which results into the broadband response with formation of loop inside the VSWR = 2 circle.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new ultra {{wideband}} {{circular antenna}} array (UCAA) combining genetic algorithm (GA) {{to minimize the}} bit error rate (BER) is proposed. The ultra wideband (UWB) impulse responses of the indoor channel for any transmitter-receiver location are computed by SBR/Image techniques, inverse fast Fourier transform and Hermitian processing. By using the impulse response of multipath channel, the BER performance of the binary pulse amplitude modulation (B-PAM) impulse radio (IR) UWB system with circular antenna array can be calculated. Based on the topography of the antenna and the BER formula, the array pattern synthesis problem can be reformulated into an optimization problem and solved by the genetic algorithm. The novelties of our approach is not only choosing BER as the object function instead of sidelobe level of the antenna pattern, but also considering the antenna <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> effect of each array element. The strong point of the genetic algorithm is that, it can find out the solution even if the performance index cannot be formulated by simple equations.

In particular it receives much interests in complex shape tubular components forming {{such as in the}} automotive industry. The process consists of a tube placed in a die and filled with a pressurized media which expands the tube till it reaches the desired geometry. The material formability is influenced by the high friction acting between the pressurized tube and the die which does not allow enough material flowing during the process. In the present work, a Y-joint hydroforming FEM model was developed on the base of previously conducted experiments to study the effects of asymmetric friction conditions in the tube feeding zones.

Erythromycin is a prokinetic agent used to treat feeding intolerance, but its efficacy remains inconclusive. Objective To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} oral erythromycin to enhance feeding tolerance in preterm infants. Methods This prospective, randomized controlled trial in preterm infants was conducted at Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar, Bali, from June 2015 to January 2016. Eligible infants were randomized to receive either 12. 5 mg/kg/dose oral erythromycin or a placebo, every 8 hours. The primary outcome was the time to establish full enteral feeding. The secondary outcomes were body weight at full enteral <b>feeding</b> and <b>length</b> of hospital stay. Results Of 62 initial subjects, 3 infants dropped out of the study. Thirty infants were given erythromycin and 29 infants were given placebo. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar, with mean of gestational ages of 31. 4 (SD 1. 7) weeks in the erythromycin group and 32. 4 (SD 2. 2) weeks in the placebo group. The median times to reach full enteral feeding did not significantly differ between the two groups, with 10 (SD 5. 3) days in the erythromycin group vs. 8 (SD 6. 5) days in the placebo group (P= 0. 345). Also, median body weights at full enteral <b>feeding</b> and <b>lengths</b> of hospital stay were not significantly different between the two groups.

Upon completion of data acquisition, the table feed and gantry rotation time were analyzed and used to calculate the actual table feed speed (mm/s). Under the low table feed speed setting, the table feed speed was found to be 26. 67 mm/s. Similarly, under the intermediate and high table feed speed settings, the table feed speed was found to be 48. 10 and 64. 07 mm/s, respectively.

Today such cable winding is performed manually, which is very repetitive, time-consuming and therefore also expensive. This paper presents the design, function and control system of a developed cable feeder tool for robotized stator cable winding. The presented tool was able to catch a cable inside a cable guiding system and to grab the cable between two wheels. One of these wheels was used to feed cable through the feeder. A control system was integrated in the tool to detect feeding slippage and to supervise the feeding force on the cable. Functions to calculate the cable <b>feed</b> <b>length,</b> to release the cable from the tool and for positional calibration of the stator to be wound were also integrated in the tool.

An IVP with a threshold of 20 cm H 2 O was used to indicate primary or staged closure, and the outcomes between the two methods were compared. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Newborns in whom primary closure was feasible were born at a lower gestational age. There {{was no significant difference in}} the frequency of complications, time to begin oral <b>feeding,</b> <b>length</b> of parenteral nutrition or length of hospital stay. Compared with previous reports, our data showed higher rates of prenatal diagnosis and cesarean delivery, a lower average birth weight, a higher rate of small gestational age babies and a more frequent association with intestinal atresia. Conversely, our data showed a lower rate of postoperative necrotizing enterocolitis and a lower average length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: No significant difference was observed in the outcome of newborns who underwent primary closure or staged closure of gastroschisis when using an IVP below 20 cm H 2 O as the criterion for primary closure...|$|R
50|$|They {{are found}} on the bottoms of oceans around the world, with some species, such as the Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus, being found down to 2000 m. The smaller species eat sea-floor {{invertebrates}} such as polychaetes and crustaceans, but the larger righteye flounders, such as H. hippoglossus, which grows up to 4.7 m in <b>length,</b> <b>feed</b> on other fishes and cephalopods, as well.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} estimated breastfeeding on infant outcomes in comparison to test weighing and to describe staff members’ experiences of estimated breastfeeding as a method for supporting the transition from tube feeding to breastfeeding. Design: A mixed method evaluation. Setting: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in Sweden. Participants: The study included 365 preterm (25 th– 36 th gestational weeks) infants and 45 nurses or nurse assistants. Methods: A retrospective comparative medical record study {{was used to assess}} infant outcomes during a period of test weighing (196 infants) and again after the implementation of estimated breastfeeding (169 infants). A qualitative survey was conducted to explore the staff experiences of estimated breastfeeding. Results: No differences were found between groups regarding duration of tube <b>feeding,</b> <b>length</b> of hospital stay, gestational age, weight at discharge, and rate of any breastfeeding. Infants in the estimated breastfeeding group had a higher risk of not being exclusively breast milk fed than infants in the test-weighing group (OR = 2. 76, CI [1. 5, 5. 1]). Staff perceived estimated breastfeeding as a more facilitative and less stressful method for mothers than test weighing. Some staff had difficulty following guidelines while simultaneously providing person-centered care. Conclusions: Estimated breastfeeding is a nonintrusive and feasible method for assessing and supporting the transition from tube feeding to breastfeeding among preterminfants in a NICU. However, the increased risk for not being exclusively breastfed is of concern. Additional research is needed to assess whether this method is appropriate and feasible in varying contexts and cultures...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Laparoscopic Heller­Dor operation, a {{standard}} method {{in the treatment}} of achalasia, has been performed at the Center for Esophageal Surgery of the First Surgical Clinic since April 2006. Objective. The aim {{of this study was to}} present this surgical procedure and initial experiences after 36 consecutive laparoscopic Heller­Dor operations. Methods. This partly retrospective, partly prospective study presented our results after laparoscopic Heller­Dor operation (presentation of the treatment method). We performed {{a standard}} anterior esophagocardioymiotomy, without releasing the posterior aspect of the cardia, and anterior partial fundoplication. The type and severity of symptoms and their duration were evaluated based on questionnaires fulfilled by patients. The diagnosis was made based on radiological, endoscopic and manometric findings. Laparoscopic surgery as the method of treatment was evaluated based on the duration of surgery, intra­ and postoperative complications, time interval until the initiation of oral <b>feeding,</b> <b>length</b> of hospital stay, need for additional therapeutic measures after the operation and effect of surgery on the severity of symptoms. Results. Preopereratively, dysphagia was the predominant symptom in all patients, while regurgitation was much lower (44 %). The average duration of operation was 127 minutes. Postoperative hospitalization lasted on the average 5. 7 days. From 36 treated patients, 34 (94. 4 %) considered that the effect of treatment was good or excellent. Postoperative dysphagia was present in two patients (5. 6 %) and was successfully solved by balloon dilatation. Conclusion. Laparoscopic Heller­Dor operation is an effective and safe surgical procedure in resolving symptoms of achalasia and today presents the method of the first choice {{in the treatment of}} this disease...|$|R
