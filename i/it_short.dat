MacNeill was briefly persuaded to go along with some sort of action when Mac Diarmada revealed to him that a German arms shipment was about to land in County Kerry. MacNeill believed that when the British learned of the shipment they would immediately suppress the Volunteers, thus the Volunteers would be justified in taking defensive action, including the planned manoeuvres.|$|E
25|$|Conduit operation, {{in which}} trams took {{electricity}} from a conduit below {{and between the}} tracks, though very successful in locations such as town or city centres, proved to be very problematic on a line {{so close to the}} coast. During bad weather, sea water washed over the track and into the conduit where <b>it</b> <b>short</b> circuited the traction supply and operated the circuit breakers in the power station. Sand from the beaches was blown across the tracks and filled up the conduits. It was constantly necessary to remove this sand, as the addition of sea water would leave the conduits filled with wet sand which short circuited the supply. Another problem was that electrical resistance was greater than anticipated and the voltage in portions of the conduit was far less than that generated at Blundell Street – 230V dropped to 210V at the junction with the main line on the Promenade, 185V at Cocker Street and 168V at South Pier (then Victoria Pier).|$|E
25|$|Smallholders {{used the}} dense network of ADMARC markets to obtain {{fertilizer}} or seed and {{to buy or}} sell crops at standard prices. Partial privatisation inspired by the World Bank in 1987 left <b>it</b> <b>short</b> of funds to provide services. Despite liberalisation, few private traders emerged, and maize markets were disrupted. Malawi was increasingly dependent on imported maize in deficit years, but limited state funding forced ADMARC to use commercial loans to import 312,000 tonnes of maize a year in the 1990s. It also had to create, with inadequate funds, an 180,000 tonne Strategic Grain Reserve from the cheaper of domestic or imported maize to stabilise prices for farmers and consumers. The World Bank criticised losses on imported maize as an untargeted subsidy: in 1996, it required the creation of a National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA) independent of government influence to control grain imports. NFRA was not responsible for price stability, and was poorly funded. ADMARC kept control over domestic grain and remained under political control. It also started selling the domestic reserves after the NFRA was formed.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the main}} SG-1 {{characters}} are US airmen and wear authentic United States Air Force uniforms. During missions, {{the members of the}} SG-1 team normally wear olive green Battle Dress Uniforms. Richard Dean Anderson and Don S. Davis received a regular military-style haircut on set. Amanda Tapping had her hair comparably short until the filming of the direct-to-DVD films. Playing a civilian, Michael Shanks adopted James Spader's hairstyle from the feature film but cut <b>it</b> <b>short</b> for the Season 2 finale and subsequent seasons. The Jaffa alien Teal'c (Christopher Judge) was the only main character whose look required more than basic make-up. His Egyptian look was reflective of the Goa'uld Ra from the feature film and was complemented with a forehead symbol and a gold skin tone, although his make-up process was simplified over the years. Judge shaved his head at home each day until the producers allowed him to let his hair grow in Season 8. As a trained nurse, key make-up artist Jan Newman could make burns, cuts, bruises and the SG-1 team's other wounds look authentic.|$|E
25|$|However, India quickly {{showed their}} intent. As Andre Adams pitched <b>it</b> <b>short</b> outside the off stump, Virender Sehwag feasted, smashing sixteen off one over, and taking only 34 balls for his 45 before {{dragging}} a ball from Oram {{into his own}} stumps. With the other opener, Sourav Ganguly, having made 19, India had made a solid start, with 75 runs coming off 50 deliveries. Rahul Dravid and Mohammad Kaif came to the crease, and the pair slowed down the run rate somewhat, but still hit plenty of boundaries when opportunities arose, keeping the required rate around 5. New Zealand's bowlers tried to apply pressure, but only Scott Styris managed to do so with any consistency, bowling nine overs in a spell before his last over yielded 10 runs – which prompted Fleming to bring on spinner Jeetan Patel. Dhoni came on a few overs earlier as Yuvraj was out for 22, and the big-hitting wicket-keeper punished Patel with two straight sixes to bring the equation from 19 off 22 to 7 off 20. Dhoni then ended the match with six runs off the balls from Andre Adams, who conceded 67 runs in total, to see India into the final and make the last match with Zimbabwe academic.|$|E

[...] Smith does not cite Hopkins as a serious contender for LeHand's affections.|$|E

500|$|A common {{complaint}} for {{the game}} reviewers was the repetitive nature of the game, as no new gameplay mechanics are introduced after the player learns to roll and jump, and that the levels are [...] "far from challenging". However, these reviewers also commented that the monotonous gameplay is not as significant an issue with a gaming system like the PSP that encourages shorter play sessions. Reviewers also commented {{on the length of}} the game, considering <b>it</b> <b>short</b> with only a few extras that would add some additional enjoyment after completing the main game.|$|E
500|$|Men either went naked or wore cloths {{covering}} their lower regions; women wore fine skirts woven from cotton, and some used a fine white cloth {{to cover their}} head and chest. The Manche Ch'ol, based on their distinctive attire, in particular their turban-style headdresses, were probably descended from the Classic period inhabitants of the region; similar headdresses were illustrated in Classic Maya art from Nim Li Punit and such headdresses were restricted to the southeastern Maya lowlands and were used at cities such as Copán, Quiriguá, and their satellites. Manche Ch'ol men grew their hair long; {{they were forced to}} cut <b>it</b> <b>short</b> upon their evangelisation and this caused much ill-feeling.|$|E

Wichita Recordings did not comment, but {{the band members}} were quoted as being worried about {{a reduction in the}} potential impact of the album's content and sales. Bloc Party started a promotional tour of North America the same month with Panic! at the Disco, but cut <b>it</b> <b>short</b> after three concerts when Tong suffered a collapsed lung. The focus was changed to interviews throughout the world to explain the album's stylised lyrics and composition in the run-up to its release.|$|E

500|$|Performance {{time of the}} Magnificat lies {{typically}} between 25 and 30 minutes, with {{an additional}} five minutes for the Christmas interpolations. The duration of the version without Christmas hymns is comparable with that of an average Bach cantata. However, there are many differences: the Magnificat contains about twice as many movements as an average cantata, keeping <b>it</b> <b>short</b> by avoiding da capos in the arias, and altogether no recitatives. Also the text is in Latin (not the usual language for a Bach cantata), {{the architecture of the}} movements is fairly complex, as opposed to the fairly simple structure of an average cantata, and the choral writing is in five parts, [...] "outside the normal routine of Bach's sacred vocal works".|$|E
500|$|A {{psychedelic}} rock version by the Misunderstood {{was recorded}} in 1966 and released as the B-side to the [...] "I Can Take You to the Sun" [...] single on Fontana Records. [...] Author Dave Thompson writes, [...] "The Misunderstood pumped it up but kept <b>it</b> <b>short,</b> psychedelic sound effects, heart attack drums, [...] eerie harmonics". [...] Misunderstood guitarist Glenn Ross Campbell reworked [...] "Who Do You Love" [...] with his later band, Juicy Lucy, which reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart in 1970. [...] The song features Campbell's psychedlic steel guitar lines, which Thompson describes [...] "as fast and mean and dirty as any record could have been, a breakneck tour through the bayou swamps and dirt-track roads of the American South, powered by a guitar to make your fingers bleed".|$|E
500|$|Walker {{found the}} court {{sections}} [...] "maddening" [...] due {{to how the}} game sometimes requires very specific evidence to be presented, with evidence that he found reasonable being rejected, forcing him to resort to guessing; he wished that the health meter would have been replenished through correct answers, or {{that it had been}} removed from the game entirely. Bryan Vore at Game Informer found the investigation sections tedious at times, but found them to be helped by how the psyche-locks add [...] "courtroom drama" [...] to the investigations. Juba thought that the game's reliance on text made the investigations move slowly, but that the game becomes an [...] "irresistible adventure" [...] when the text is mixed with gameplay in the trials. Thomas found the psyche-locks interesting, but underwhelming as the only new feature. East said that the psyche-locks were what made the investigations fun. Reparaz liked how the psyche-lock mechanic adds [...] "a new dimension of weirdness" [...] to the game. Both Harris and Thomas wished that the game had been less linear, with more possible wrong paths to take or more endings. Thomas, Reparaz and East wished that the Nintendo DS-exclusive gameplay features introduced in the first game's final episode had been used in Justice for All, with Reparaz calling it disappointing but [...] "not a huge deal". Villoria and East said that the game does not last very long; Walker did not consider <b>it</b> <b>short,</b> but found it to not last as long as the first game.|$|E

500|$|Darryl {{thinks his}} {{popularity}} {{with the staff}} will make him a shoo-in, so he thinks {{he does not have}} to do an interview like everyone else. He is caught off-guard when he actually must do an interview and they ask for his resume. Darryl writes up an overly extensive four-page resume, which Jo quickly derides, though Jim encourages Darryl by saying that the interview and resume are mere formalities for him. When Andy interviews for the manager position, Gabe hijacks the meeting in an attempt to sabotage him by asking random trivia questions, which Andy successfully parries, but Gabe ends up screaming at him and acting like a lunatic. Gabe is also dismissive of Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) during her interview, saying she is not a [...] "real candidate". Kelly exacts revenge by telling Jo about Gabe's relationship with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and his harassing behavior after their breakup. In response, Jo sends Gabe back to Sabre's Florida headquarters, and installs Kelly in Gabe's position on the search committee. Kelly then says she has accepted Dwight's bribery and looks forward to the benefits of his return to the manager's chair, as Toby haltingly says they could give Dwight another trial run and Jim looks on in horror. After Phyllis tells Jim that Kelly and Dwight have pre-fired her, Jim tells Dwight he is not and will not be the manager, and the office begins arguing about who will be selected. When the discussion gets out of control, with Ryan (B. J. Novak) preferring a homeless man, Andy declaring he wants the job, and Darryl's daughter Jada asking out loud if Jim is the guy making him manager, Jim cuts <b>it</b> <b>short</b> and brings the committee back to the conference room to make up their minds.|$|E
500|$|In Takumi's {{initial draft}} of the story, the second episode, [...] "Turnabout Sisters", was the first episode of the game. The {{development}} team decided {{that it did not}} work well as something that would ease players into the game, because of its length among other factors. Because of this, Takumi wrote a shorter episode, [...] "The First Turnabout", which was used as the game's first episode. Takumi wanted players to focus on the thrill of [...] "nailing the culprit", especially for the first episode; because of this, the culprit of the first episode is shown in that episode's opening, as this was the most direct way Takumi could think of doing it. According to Takumi, it was a challenge to write the episode, as, in addition to keeping <b>it</b> <b>short,</b> he had to set up the world of Ace Attorney and the types of characters that players would meet. The third episode was written {{for the sake of the}} character Miles Edgeworth, and the theme of the fourth episode was [...] "rekindling the relationship". In it, Takumi tried to portray an intensively strong friendship between Phoenix and Edgeworth; he did wonder if that was what people got from it, saying that some people interpreted the bond between Phoenix and Edgeworth as [...] an [...] "intensively passionate bond". Because of these two episodes, Takumi considered Edgeworth to in a way be the game's protagonist. The classroom trial in the game's fourth episode was based on real events: when Takumi was in second grade, he had found a 5 yen coin and put it in his pocket; his teacher accused him of stealing it from another student, and made him apologize to her.|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, [...] "It is {{flawlessly}} crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well." [...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received [...] "two thumbs up" [...] and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as [...] "a glorious Hollywood epic" [...] and [...] "well worth the wait," [...] and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio [...] "captivating". James Berardinelli stated, [...] "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic {{is the kind of}} epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it." [...] It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that [...] "the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy" [...] and that [...] "when you consider that [...] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, [...] "To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell <b>it</b> <b>short.</b> James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner {{is one of the most}} magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood." ...|$|E
