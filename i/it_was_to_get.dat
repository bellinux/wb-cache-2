5|$|Eventually, an {{accounting}} teacher arrives, believing demonstrations {{are being held}} to determine which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron. He gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at how easy <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, {{would be good for the}} country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

25|$|However, being a governess {{was one of}} the few {{legitimate}} ways {{by which}} an unmarried middle class woman could support herself in Victorian society. Not surprisingly, her position was often depicted as one to be pitied, and the only way out of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married. Unfortunately, it was difficult for a governess to find a suitable husband because most of the eligible men she encountered were her social superiors, who preferred a bride from within their own social class, particularly since such women generally had better financial resources.|$|E
25|$|Canterbury were {{confident}} {{heading into the}} 1995 season with a new home at Parramatta Stadium but the uproar of the Super League War caused Jim Dymock, Dean Pay, Jason Smith, and Jarrod McCracken to announce mid-season they were to leave the club. Their form before Super League was patchy and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> worse with demoralising losses against Manly 26-0, 19th place Parramatta, Newcastle 42-0 and Auckland 29-8 putting the season in doubt. Two major turning points was the switch of the final round match against North Queensland Cowboys to Belmore Sports Ground and Chris Anderson dropping Kiwi International Jarrod McCracken to reserve grade. Anderson would later omit McCracken from the overall squad. The Bulldogs walloped the Cowboys in a club record 66-4 victory and laid the platform for the Finals ahead.|$|E
500|$|The first {{mention of}} a bishop in Finland is from a papal letter in 1209. It was sent to Archbishop Anders of Lund by Pope Innocent III as a reply to the Archbishop's earlier letter which has not survived. According to the Archbishop, the Bishop of the newly {{established}} church in Finland was dead, apparently from natural causes since his passing away is mentioned to have been [...] "lawful", and the see had been vacant for some time. The Archbishop had complained to the Pope how difficult <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> anyone to be a bishop in Finland and planned to appoint someone without formal adequacy, who was already working in Finland. The Pope approved of Archbishop's suggestion without questioning his opinions. It is noteworthy that the Archbishop of Uppsala, Valerius (1207–1219/1224), was also in Denmark at the time, temporarily exiled from Sweden after having allied with the deposed King Sverker, yet another exile in Denmark.|$|E

500|$|One {{complaint}} {{many customers}} have with Schwa {{is that it}} is exceedingly difficult to get a reservation. GQ magazine describes a typical customer as having spent weeks trying to get past the always full answering machine that serves as Schwa's primary reservation system. [...] The restaurant attracts an estimated 60 requests for its 26 seats each day, and is notoriously slow at returning phone calls. One couple got so frustrated with the system that they drove down to the restaurant to make a reservation in person. Upon arrival, they were told they had to call it in. Despite their frustration, the couple kept trying and when they finally got in they remarked, [...] "You know what? It was worth it." [...] According to Carlson, most customers' first comment when they arrive at Schwa is either to complain about how difficult <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a reservation or to ask for another one. Schwa will not seat customers without a reservation, even if the restaurant is empty.|$|E
500|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the management team, the Monks conducted extensive rehearsals with a focus on gritty, rhythmically oriented music. The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a Maestro fuzz box (and eventually a wah-wah pedal) for Burger, a floor tom for Johnston, and a six-string banjo for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section. Shaw explained that the group's motivation was to possess [...] "high rhythm and high energy". He elaborated further, saying [...] "The idea of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> as much 'beat' out of it as we could. As much 'bam-bam-bam-bam' on the beat or whatever. The only time cymbals would be used would be for accent. If anyone wasn't contributing towards rhythm, then it wasn't part of the Monks sound". However, the band's transformation into the Monks was painstakingly slow, taking the group nearly a year of trial-and-error before they were confident enough to return to the studio.|$|E
500|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline, Shannon {{does not go}} back with Boone. In [...] "LA X", Boone goes back alone on Flight 815 and sits beside Locke, where he finds out about Locke supposedly going on a Walkabout in Australia. In a parallel with the island timeline, Boone tells Locke if they crashed, he would follow him. Once the plane lands, Boone shakes Locke's hand and exits the plane. Boone reappears in the final episode of Lost. In [...] "The End", we see Hurley and Sayid talking in a car on a dark street, and they witness a thug beating up a guy (Boone) outside of a bar. Shannon shouts [...] "Leave my brother alone," [...] and Sayid {{gets out of the}} car to intervene. His and Shannon's memories are restored the moment they touch. Boone, having conspired with Hurley to bring Shannon and Sayid together, wanders over to the car. He jokes with Hurley about how he had to take a beating and [...] "thanks for taking your time." [...] He also comments how difficult <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Shannon to return from Australia with him, but he and Hurley agree the effort was worth it for this moment to have her and Sayid's memories restored. Boone is one of the first people Jack greets in the church where everyone reunites to move on to the afterlife together.|$|E

2500|$|If {{information}} about Folquinus still being in office in 1198 is correct, his identification with Fulco would require {{him to have}} worked in missionary assignments for more than 30 years, in any case reaching a rather high age {{for a man of}} his times. In a letter by Pope Innocent III to Anders Sunesen, the Archbishop of Lund, in 1209, an unnamed Bishop of Finland is mentioned to have died [...] "lawfully" [...] (i.e., a natural death) sometime earlier. By repeating Archbishop's own words, the letter makes it clear that the dead bishop had been appointed by the Lund archbishopric or at least with its approval, and that the [...] "recent" [...] establishment of the church in Finland was work of the Danes or their close allies, [...] "caretaking of a few noble men". The Archbishop had also complained to the Pope how difficult <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> anyone to be a bishop in Finland and planned to appoint someone without formal adequacy, which the Pope approved of without questioning Archbishop's opinions.|$|E
2500|$|The April 17, 2008, {{edition of}} The Economist noted Bowdoin {{in an article}} on {{university}} admissions: [...] "So-called 'almost-Ivies' such as Bowdoin and Middlebury also saw record low admission rates this year (18% each). It is now as hard to get into Bowdoin, says the college's admissions director, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into Princeton in the 1970s." [...] However, applicant levels have been declining since 2013. Many students apply for financial aid, and around 85% of those who apply receive aid. Bowdoin is a need-blind and a no-loans institution. While {{a significant portion of}} the student body hails from New England — including nearly 25% from Massachusetts and 10% from Maine — recent classes have drawn from an increasingly national and international pool. Although Bowdoin once had a reputation for homogeneity (both ethnically and socioeconomically), a diversity campaign has increased the percentage of students of color in recent classes to more than 31%. In fact, admission of minorities goes back at least as far as John Brown Russwurm 1826, Bowdoin's first African-American college graduate, and the third African-American graduate of any American college.|$|E
