40|$|Intensive {{appeal for}} energy saving has driven the {{production}} industry towards more environmentally benign manufacturing. Diverse process settings in manufacturing {{can result in}} a high variance of energy consumption. Regarding process chains, the allocation of machining stock to each process is very crucial in terms of energy use. Optimization of material <b>stock</b> <b>allowance</b> and process parameters can effectively reduce the production energy. In this study, two cylindrical machining processes – turning and grinding are compared at machine level with respect to energy intensity and surface roughness. A systematic energy-efficient approach, based on minimizing the production energy while complying with the required surface roughness, has been developed and validated to optimize the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> for the turning-grinding process sequence.

30|$|Interestingly, if Φ MB {{was changed}} from 0.21 to 0.3, a huge {{difference}} in the measured heating curve was observed. As the amount of <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> was kept constant at Φ GS =  0.15, we calculated Φ GS, rel (Eq.  3) defined as the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> filling degree with regard to the void volume in the milling ball packing. The complete void volume is filled with the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> if Φ GS, rel =  1. Results show that the change in the heat up curve occurs if Φ GS, rel is approximately at this value. The milling beakers warm up significantly slower for Φ GS, rel > 1 (see Online resource 1). The <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> overfills the void volume, the velocity of the milling balls is reduced and thus less heat is generated.|$|R
30|$|The {{influence}} of the operating frequency, the milling ball and <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> filling degree, the material of the milling balls and beakers, the milling ball diameter {{and the size of}} the milling beakers on the temperature increase inside the milling beakers in a mixer ball mill was investigated. These parameters influence the temperature progression and the equilibrium temperature of the system. The <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> filling degree with regard to the void volume in the milling ball package showed huge influence on the heating rate and the equilibrium temperature. In this context, the behavior of the temperature progression changes if the complete void volume is filled with the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{temperature}} {{that was}} measured after 90  min milling strongly {{depends on the}} loaded material. The highest temperature was measured without any <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> (compare section <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> filling degree, Fig.  3). The addition of powder led to lower temperatures in every case. The temperature ranges between 40 and 63  °C for quartz sand and vanillin, respectively (Online resource 1). The material influence on the temperature {{seems to be a}} complicated interaction of material properties like Young´s modulus and hardness [13]. The kind of material influences the elasticity of the collision and the motion of the balls, as shown for planetary ball mills [32]. Thus, it acts on the temperature progression and on the heat transfer from the balls to the wall of the beaker [13]. Young´s modulus for example is insufficient to describe the increase of temperature. For example, with MgF 2 and CaF 2 as <b>grinding</b> <b>stocks,</b> final temperatures of 51  °C were measured, although Young’s modulus is considerably different with 139 and 76  GPa, respectively [33]. In addition to the material properties of the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock,</b> physical phenomena like the compaction of the material on the milling wall influence T milling bed. If the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> material adheres to the wall, less material is trapped when the balls collide. Furthermore, the compact layers reduce the free space for acceleration of the balls.|$|R

30|$|Ball milling {{procedures}} are {{often referred to}} as “milling at room temperature” [9, 10]. This term should be used carefully, as even within short milling times a temperature increase can be observed, if there are no precautions for temperature control. For example, it was shown that milling in a mixer ball mill (MBM) for 10  min with two milling balls in a 10  ml beaker raised the temperature from 25 to 30  °C, and Colacino and co-workers measured a temperature increase of approximately 14  K after 30  min milling in an MM 200 mixer mill [6, 11]. McKissic et al. observed a temperature of 50  °C after 1  h milling in a Spex mixer mill and Takacs and McHenry reported milling ball temperatures of 66  °C [12, 13]. Comparably higher temperatures can be reached in planetary ball mills (PBMs), where temperatures from 60 to 600  °C can be measured, {{depending on the type of}} PBM, the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock,</b> the <b>grinding</b> material and the filling degree [5, 13, 14].|$|R

50|$|The {{product to}} be {{processed}} is fed to the mill centrally via an inlet box {{at the top and}} is pre-crushed by primary beater tools when reaching the top of the rotor. The beaters also accelerate the product, moving it into the milling zone proper, {{at the side of the}} rotor. There the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> fluidised in the air flow is comminuted by the grinding tools (rotor, stator). The stator is formed by a cover enclosing the rotor. The inside of this cover is provided with toothed grooves running vertical, i.e. crosswise to the sense of rotation of the rotor. The outside of the rotor is covered by numerous U-shaped sections which form a deep cassette-type structure. This geometry creates extreme air whirls in the rotor's grinding zone which induce intense secondary comminution processes due to the particles crashing into each other and due to friction and shearing forces. The final particle size can be adjusted over a wide range by changing the grinding rotor clearance, air flow and rotor speed.|$|R
40|$|Part with {{sculptured}} surfaces {{is obtained}} in three stages: roughing, semi-finishing and finishing. The roughing operation consists in using flat end tools or fillet end tools on sequential horizontal cutting planes {{to remove the}} most material from the raw part {{as rapidly as possible}} using “Parallel Planes” or “Offset Contours ” machining strategy. When roughing deep parts, radial cutting forces, vibrations and tool bending are important. To avoid these disadvantages, the “Plunge Milling ” strategy is developed.

This paper studies the implications of demand surges, lead-time variations and resources breakdown on the ability of a manufacturing system to achieve its delivery target. Simulation modelling was used to represent a stochastic manufacturing system, which is disturbed by these uncertainties. Manufacturing systems each with and without intelligent feedback were modelled. An intelligent feedback is represented via a set of algorithm, which reanalyse and self-organise the new status of the order {{in the presence of the}} uncertainties and update the relevant attributes before the order is released. Four types of intelligence were examined: (1) lead-time allowance, (2) capacity <b>allowance,</b> (3) safety <b>stock</b> <b>allowance</b> and (4) batching flexibility. Experiments results from each system were compared. It was found that the manufacturing system with intelligent feedback has a higher ability to achieve its delivery target by proactively tackling the variations caused by uncertainties. This study also found that the reliability of a work order in the presence of uncertainty could be improved by using an appropriate type of intelligence. which is dependent upon how and when the order was released. It was concluded from this research that intelligent feedback could help manufacturing enterprises proactively readjust the release of work orders that will be affected by uncertainties in order to improve the reliability and delivery of work orders.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a one-dimensional cutting stock procedure which will minimize material wastage when {{a batch of}} small pieces are cut from several long pieces. The problem differs from the classical one-dimensional cutting stock problem in that {{the dimensions of the}} material to be cut are random variables due to fringe defects caused by the production process. Examples of such processes include the production of flat glass, laminated board, corrugated board, adhesive tape, carpeting, and insulating tape. The cutting procedure inevitably generates some material wastage and process delays caused by the need to set cutting knives in required positions. The approach followed in this paper is to minimize material wastage when cutting a batch of identical rolls of insulating tape from several long rolls with stationary cutting knives. An exact solution is presented for the case in which the variability of defects at both ends is independently distributed and the two distributions differ by a location parameter only. An approximate solution is also presented when the two end defect distributions differ by both scale and location parameters. The wastage resulting from the use of these procedures is then compared with the wastage generated when the positioning of the knives is altered every time an original piece is cut. This comparison enables management to decide when the positioning of the cutting knives should be fixed. production/scheduling: cutting <b>stock,</b> inventory/production: reject <b>allowances,</b> probability: stochastic model applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} space {{provided}} to animals governs important elements of their behaviour and, hence, is critical for their health and welfare. We review the use of allometric principles and equations to estimate the static space requirements of animals when standing and lying, and the space required for animals to feed, drink, stand-up and lie-down. We use the research literature relating to transportation and intensive housing of sheep and cattle to assess the validity of allometric equations for estimating space allowances. We investigated these areas because transportation and intensive housing provide points along a continuum {{in terms of the}} duration of confinement, (from hours to months) and spatial requirements are likely to increase with increasing duration of confinement, as animals will need to perform a greater behavioural repertoire for long-term survival, health and welfare. We find that, although there are theoretical reasons why allometric relationships to space allowances may vary slightly for different classes of <b>stock,</b> space <b>allowances</b> that have been demonstrated to have adverse effects on animal welfare during transportation correlated well with an inability to accommodate standing animals, as estimated from allometry. For intensive housing, we were able to detect a space allowance below which there were adverse effects on welfare. For short duration transportation during which animals remain standing, a space allowance per animal described by the allometric equation: area (m) = 0. 020 W, where W = liveweight (kg), would appear to be appropriate. Where it is desirable for all animals to lie simultaneously, then a minimum space allowance per animal described by the allometric equation: area (m) = 0. 027 W appears to permit this, given that animals in a group time-share space. However, there are insufficient data to determine whether this allowance onboard a vehicle/vessel would enable animals to move and access food and water with ease. In intensive housing systems, a minimum space allowance per animal described by the allometric equation: area (m) = 0. 033 W appears to be the threshold below which there are adverse effects on welfare. These suggested space allowances require verification with a range of species under different thermal conditions and, for transportation, under different conditions of vehicular/vessel stability. The minimum length of trough per animal (L in m) required for feeding and drinking can be determined from L = 0. 064 W, with the number of animals required to feed/drink simultaneously taken into account, together with any requirement to minimise competition. This also requires verification with a range of species. We conclude that allometric relationships are an appropriate basis for the formulation of space allowances for livestock.

40|$|Confronted with {{substantial}} environmental burden induced by ever-rising consumption {{of energy and}} resources, the manufacturing sector has been urged to shift its production towards a more environmentally conscious paradigm. Hence, sustainable manufacturing has drawn significant attention in recent years. To accomplish this aim, reducing production energy has been acknowledged {{as one of the}} essential tasks. As the key element in manufacturing, machine tools dominate the energy consumption during production. Accordingly, reducing the energy consumption of machine tools can effectively mitigate the adverse environmental impact of manufacturing. This research aims to develop energy-efficient approaches to diminish the energy footprint of machining processes (e. g. turning, milling, and grinding) at machine tool level. Several research subjects have been investigated to address this issue, which mainly involve energy modelling of machine tools, optimization approaches for energy-efficient machining strategies, simulation of energy consumption in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems, and enhancement of the energy conservation of process planning. Firstly, the energy characteristics of machine tools are investigated. The results indicate that the machine energy is significantly influenced by the process parameters. Based on the analysis, the energy model of the machine tool is then developed as a function of process parameters. Two modelling methods, the black-box approach (BBA) and the bottom-up approach (BUA), are developed to establish the energy model of machine tools. The black-box approach considers the machine tool as an opaque object, and the energy characteristic is established empirically by correlating the input machining parameters and their corresponding output energy. In the bottom-up approach, the energy consumption of a machine tool is decomposed into different elements based on either machine state (e. g. startup, standby, cutting) or machine component (e. g. spindle, axis drives). By accumulating the energy of all elements, the total machine energy can be obtained. A modelling accuracy of 95 % can be realized by applying the developed energy models. To develop energy-efficient machining strategies, a surface roughness based approach is proposed to optimize the parameter of the finishing turning process. In this approach, process parameters which can satisfy the surface roughness requirement are firstly selected based on the surface roughness model; then the machining parameters that would lead to minimum energy consumption are determined by applying the established energy model. In addition, the machine energy can also be dramatically affected by different toolpath strategies and non-cutting movement. For selection of toolpath patterns, the investigation for the milling process shows that process time plays a critical role in the energy consumption. A longer toolpath prolongs the machining time and thus requires more energy. The mass of the activated axis also influences the energy, showing that heavier moving axes will result in more energy consumption. For settings in the non-cutting movement, a higher feed rate will increase the energy consumption of axis drives and decrease the energy of auxiliary parts; thus it demonstrates that machine energy presents a U-shape over feed rate, and an optimum feed rate can be selected for non-cutting movement. Moreover, the investigated machining case shows that an overall 50. 6 % of the total machine energy can be reduced through changing process settings (parameters, toolpath pattern, and non-cutting movement). At process chain level, in order to quantitatively allocate the machining stock, a systematic energy-efficient approach, which is based on minimizing the production energy while complying with the required surface roughness, is developed to optimize the <b>grinding</b> <b>stock</b> for the turning-grinding process sequence. The validation results present that, compared to the conventional method (Halevi method), the developed approach reduces 16. 6 % of energy consumption for the turning-grinding process sequence. Furthermore, using the developed energy models, an operation-mode based simulation approach, which incorporates material removal simulation to precisely track the energy of removing material, is developed and validated to predict the energy consumption of machining processes. It is shown from the validation result that by applying the developed approach, the energy consumption of machining one product with a sequence of operations can be simulated accurately within a deviation of 10 %. By merging the developed approach into current CAM systems, energy-efficient computer-aided manufacturing can be achieved, and the process settings can be optimized before the workpiece is loaded onto the machine for execution. The investigated case shows that an overall energy-saving potential of 80 % can be identified by adjusting process settings. Therefore, applying the developed simulation approach will help to facilitate process planning, enhance the energy conservation of machine tools as well as cut down the production cost. Finally, to foster the energy conservation of process planning, a comparative analysis is carried out to investigate how the manufacturing energy footprint is affected by the decision-making at each stage of process planning (selection of blank shape and selection of process settings). Process chains, consisting of primary shaping and machining processes for manufacturing conventional shape and near-net-shape products, are analyzed. At the stage of blank shape selection, the process chain for near-net-shape consumes much less energy in contrast with the process chain of conventional shape, showing that for the studied cases more than 50 % of energy can be mitigated for the whole manufacturing chain. As for the selection of process settings, energy saving of up to 20 % can be realized. It shows that using process chain of near-net-shape saves more energy than modifying process settings. In addition to saving energy consumption, manufacturing of near-net-shape products can also reduce the material usage. About 60 % less material is utilized by manufacturing of near-net-shape products. Therefore, applying near-net-shape is able to achieve both energy- and resource- efficient manufacturing. Besides, it also implies that early decision-makings in process planning would help to save more energy consumption in manufacturing. status: publishe...|$|R

How could we supervise and modify them and take the example from Sweden to improve the welfare of farm animals in Taiwan still needs more investigation and improvement. 動物福祉在歐盟已經是一個非常重要的議題並且比其他國家獲得更多的政府的關注。在台灣，一般人對動物福祉的概念通常是來自於動物疫病或食品問題的負面新聞，並非作為一個需要迫切解決的問題。台灣因為空間有限，密集式飼養 一直被視為最有效率的方式。農委會（COA）已經開始進行了一連串農場動物福祉的研究，並鼓勵學生從事這方面的研究。 在瑞典的民眾一般認為動物福祉在他們國家有著很好的政府規劃。在歐盟國中廣泛認為瑞典的動物福祉是領先其他盟國的。因此，由於瑞典是在農場動物福利領域最先進的國家，本研究的目的是藉由瑞典來改善動物福利和解決在台灣的主要福利問題，並介紹和討論這兩個國家兩種主要農場動物-豬和雞的飼養狀況與福祉問題。 在台灣有許多嚴重的農場動物的福利問題，如在歐盟被禁止的雞隻的修喙與巴達利蛋雞籠的使用；懷孕母豬夾欄、母豬分娩欄、剪齒、環境溫度、剪尾、飼養密度、飼養空間、熱緊迫、和豬的去勢。此外，在台灣土雞存在著許多獨有的福祉問題如：接觸性皮膚炎、低存活率、光照時間、飼養記錄不完整、同類相殘、病弱雞的處理等，都是我們必須想辦法解決的問題。該如何以瑞典經驗為範例來監督與修正以提高台灣農場動物的福利，仍需要更多的調查和改進。Contents Chapter 1 Introduction [...] 1 1. 1 Concept of animal welfare [...] . 1 1. 2 Farm Animal Welfare in Europe [...] 1 1. 3 Farm animal welfare in Taiwan [...] . 1 Chapter 2 The farm animal welfare in Sweden [...] 3 2. 1 Status [...] [...] 3 2. 1. 1 History of farm animal welfare in Sweden [...] 3 2. 1. 2 The Swedish approach [...] . 4 2. 1. 3 Consumers’ attitude to animal welfare in Europe and Sweden [...] . 9 2. 2 Production systems in Europe and Sweden [...] 10 2. 2. 1 Chickens in Sweden [...] 10 2. 2. 2 Pigs in Sweden [...] . 1 5 2. 3 Legislation in the EU and Sweden [...] . 17 2. 3. 1 Chickens in the EU and Sweden [...] 17 2. 3. 2 Pigs in the EU and Sweden [...] 20 2. 3. 3 European Legislation [...] . 22 2. 3. 4 National Animal Welfare Legislation [...] 22 2. 3. 5 Legislation in Sweden [...] . 22 Chapter 3 The farm animal welfare in Taiwan [...] . 24 3. 1 Chicken [...] .
