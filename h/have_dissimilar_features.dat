40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the use of rights issues of convertible debt in the Australian market. The Australian market is of interest as it <b>has</b> <b>dissimilar</b> <b>features</b> to the US market but similar features to many European markets. That is, the primary mode of issuing securities is through rights issues rather than public issues, a listed debt market does not exist for Australian firms and many stocks are severely thinly traded. The effect of the use of rights to raise capital in the form of convertible debt has not been examined in any market. This paper has two aims, to examine {{the impact of the}} announcement of convertible debt on stock prices and to consolidate and test the numerous theories of price reaction that have been established in the literature. The results find that the announcement of convertible debt tends to be preceded by positive abnormal stock price performance, and followed by a negative drift in stock prices, similar to US markets.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{advocate}} asymmetric function placement {{as one of}} {{guiding principles}} to architect sensor network systems. We demonstrate its generic applicability and effectiveness by applying this principle to three typical sensor network technologies, namely, localization (Spotlight), sensing (uSense) and communication (mNets). These technologies <b>have</b> very <b>dissimilar</b> <b>features,</b> representing {{a wide spectrum of}} system design requirements. We have invested significant effort to design, implement and evaluate our techniques on TinyOS/Mote testbeds. The results from several running systems indicate that asymmetric function placement is a powerful guiding principle to achieve efficiency and high-performance simultaneously in wireless sensor networks. At the end, we exam the system features that discourage the use of asymmetric function placement and approaches to address them. I...|$|R

40|$|The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2015. Previous work on visual search has {{suggested}} that only a single attentional template can be prioritized at any given point in time. Grouping features into objects and objects into categories can facilitate search performance by maximizing {{the amount of information}} carried by an attentional template. From infancy to adulthood, earlier studies on perceptual similarity have shown that consistent features increase the likelihood of grouping features into objects (e. g., Quinn & Bhatt, Psychological Science. 20 : 933 - 938, 2009) and objects into categories (e. g., shape bias; Landau, Smith, & Jones, Cognitive Development. 3 : 299 - 321, 1988). Here we asked whether lower-level, intra-item similarity facilitates higher-level categorization, despite inter-item dissimilarity. Adults participated in four visual search tasks in which targets were defined as either one item (a specific alien) or a category (any alien) with either similar features (e. g., circle belly shape and circle back spikes) or <b>dissimilar</b> <b>features</b> (e. g., circle belly shape and triangle back spikes). Using behavioral and neural measures (i. e., the N 2 pc event-related potential component, which typically emerges 200 ms poststimulus), we found that intra-item feature similarity facilitated categorization, despite <b>dissimilar</b> <b>features</b> across the category items. Our results demonstrate that feature similarity builds novel categories and activates a task-appropriate abstract categorical search template. In other words, grouping at the lower, item level facilitates grouping at the higher, category level, which allows us to overcome efficiency limitations in visual search...|$|R

Here, we examined whether priming of abstract letter representations occurs in an orthographic system, Arabic, in which the letters show an intricate number of contextual forms. Arabic {{does not have a}} lowercase/uppercase distinction, but the letters exhibit different forms that depend on their position (initial, medial, final, or isolated) and their connectivity. Importantly, some letters look quite different across positions (e. g., and, which correspond to the letter ‘ayn), whereas others look very similar (e. g., and, which correspond to the letter fā’). We employed a masked priming same–different task, in which native speakers of Arabic decided whether a target letter was the same as or different from a reference letter presented in a different position (middle vs. isolated). The results showed masked repetition priming effects of the same magnitude for letter pairs with similar and with <b>dissimilar</b> visual <b>features</b> across letter positions. These data support the view that priming of abstract letter representations is a universal phenomenon...|$|R
