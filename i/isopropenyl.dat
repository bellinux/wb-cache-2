50|$|The full {{biosynthesis}} of α-santonin has {{not been}} elucidated but α-santonin bears much similarity to parthenolide. The proposed biosynthesis begins with the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to (+)-germacrene A by a sesquiterpene synthase. (+)-germacrene A hydroxylase then hydroxylates the <b>isopropenyl</b> side chain. The oxidation of germacratrien-12-ol to germacratrien-12-oic acid via the intermediate germacratrien-12-al is done by NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase(s). Germacratrien-12-oic acid is then hydroxylated at C6 subsequently followed by lactonization forming (+)-costunolide.|$|E

In 2004, Ohwada and coworkers resolved the Meldrum acid anomaly by performing several calculations. [...] Ohwada noticed that the energy-minimizing conformation structure of the compound places the alpha proton's σCH orbital in the proper geometry to align with the π*CO, so that the ground state poses unusually strong destabilization of the C-H bond.|$|E

The use of <b>isopropenyl</b> acetate as the acylating agent results in acetone as the byproduct, which is effectively removed from the reaction using molecular sieves.|$|E
5000|$|Cannabidiol-dimethylheptyl (also {{known as}} CBD-DMH or DMH-CBD) is a {{synthetic}} homologue of cannabidiol where the pentyl chain {{has been replaced}} by a dimethylheptyl chain. Several isomers of this compound are known. The most commonly used isomer in research is (−)-CBD-DMH, which has the same stereochemistry as natural cannabidiol, and a 1,1-dimethylheptyl side chain. This compound is not psychoactive and acts primarily as an anandamide reuptake inhibitor, but is more potent than cannabidiol as an anticonvulsant and has around the same potency as an antiinflammatory. Unexpectedly the [...] "unnatural" [...] enantiomer (+)-CBD-DMH, which has reversed stereochemistry from cannabidiol, was found to be a directly acting cannabinoid receptor agonist with a Ki of 17.4nM at CB1 and 211nM at CB2, and produces typical cannabinoid effects in animal studies.Another closely analogous compound has also been described, with the double bond in the cyclohexene ring shifted to between the 1,6-positions rather than the 2,3-positions (i.e. analogous to synthetic THC analogues such as parahexyl), the <b>isopropenyl</b> group saturated to isopropyl, and a 1,2-dimethylheptyl side chain. It is synthesized by Birch reduction from the 1,2-dimethylheptyl analogue of cannabidiol. This compound also produces potent cannabinoid-like effects in animals, but has three chiral centers and is composed of a mixture of eight stereoisomers, which have not been studied individually, so it is not known which enantiomers are active.|$|E

40|$|The {{polymerization}} of methyl <b>isopropenyl</b> ketone {{initiated by}} nbutyllithium and triethylaluminium in hydrocarbon solvent has been studied. The nbutyllithium initiated polymerization {{gives rise to}} a large quantity of oligomer and some high molecular weight material, which is a normal vinyl polymer containing some intramolecular cyclized units. The process of cyclization gives rise to water in the reaction mixture, which slows down the polymerization and limits the molecular weight of the high polymer. The triethylaluminium initiated polymerization also {{gives rise to a}} mixture of oligomer and normal vinyl polymer, but with this initiator the polymer is not cyclized, and the degree of polymerization is much greater than in the nbutyllithium system. In order to obtain useful kinetic data for the triethylaluminium initiated polymerization of methyl <b>isopropenyl</b> ketone, it has been shown necessary to pre-mix equimolar quantities of the triethylaluminium and monomer under carefully controlled conditions to produce the initiator species, followed by the subsequent addition of the further monomer, after the pre-mixing period.

30|$|For the valencenoid derivatives, {{in terms}} of their {{repellant}} activity against termites (C. formosanus), a reduction of the 1, 10 -double bond (1, 10 -dihydronootkatone and tetrahydronootkatone) produced compounds that were more repellent than nootkatone [21]. The <b>isopropenyl</b> group probably did not participate in the binding as evidenced by the absence of {{a significant difference in the}} repellent activities of nootkatone, isonootkatone and 11, 12 -dihydronootkatone [21].

30|$|In conclusion, the {{bioactivity}} of p-menthane monoterpenoids {{was dependent}} upon the presence and the position of certain functional groups {{and the degree of}} saturation fraction in the side chain functional group. A phenolic hydroxyl group was effective for termite mortality, whereas the presence of a carbonyl group provided a strong inhibitory effect on seed germination, and promoted termiticidal activity. In particular, this position was relevant for estimating the performance of p-menthane alcohols because the alcoholic hydroxyl group in the ring had been shown to have an inhibitory effect on seed germination and termite mortality. Although an isopropyl group in the ring also provided an inhibitory effect and termiticidal activity, the presence of an <b>isopropenyl</b> group in the ring showed a particularly marked inhibitory effect. Therefore, the selective bioactivity corresponded to the difference in isopropyl and <b>isopropenyl</b> groups.|$|E
