40|$|International audience—Modern FPGAs provide great {{computational}} {{power and}} flexibility {{but there is}} still room for improving their performances. For example multiuser approaches are particularly underdeveloped as they require specific mechanisms still to be automated. Sharing an FPGA resource between applications or users requires a context switch ability. The latter enables pausing and resuming applications at system demand. This paper presents a method that automatically selects a good execution point, called hardware checkpoint, to perform a context switch on an FPGA. The method relies on a static analysis of the finite state machine of a circuit to select the checkpoint states. The obtained selection ensures that the context switch mechanism respects a given latency and tries to minimize the mechanism costs. The method takes advantage of its integration in an open-source HLS tool and preliminary results highlight its efficiency. Index Terms—FPGA, HLS, <b>CAD,</b> <b>hardware</b> context switc...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Current {{computer-aided}} detection (CAD) {{systems for}} pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) scans {{have a good}} performance for relatively small nodules, but often fail to detect the much rarer larger nodules, which {{are more likely to}} be cancerous. We present a novel CAD system specifically designed to detect solid nodules larger than 10 mm. Methods: The proposed detection pipeline is initiated by a three-dimensional lung segmentation algorithm optimized to include large nodules attached to the pleural wall via morphological processing. An additional preprocessing is used to mask out structures outside the pleural space to ensure that pleural and parenchymal nodules have a similar appearance. Next, nodule candidates are obtained via a multistage process of thresholding and morphological operations, to detect both larger and smaller candidates. After segmenting each candidate, a set of 24 features based on intensity, shape, blobness, and spatial context are computed. A radial basis support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to classify nodule candidates, and performance was evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation on the full publicly available lung image database consortium database. Results: The proposed CAD system reaches a sensitivity of 98. 3 % (234 / 238) and 94. 1 % (224 / 238) large nodules at an average of 4. 0 and 1. 0 false positives/scan, respectively. Conclusions: The authors conclude that the proposed <b>dedicated</b> <b>CAD</b> system for large pulmonary nodules can identify the vast majority of highly suspicious lesions in thoracic CT scans with a small number of false positives...|$|R

This Semantic Web based standard enables storing distributed parametric geometry {{and is a}} further development of the standard CMO developed in several other EU projects. An important practical issue within Proficient is to generate the content and knowledge according to this new standard. For clear reasons –in order to ensure the open and unlimited application of the end-users- no new CAD package will be developed {{as part of the}} project supporting this new standard. The result is that mainly existing CAD software will have to be used to create content. As a result a conversion from CAD to CMO with Extensions needs to be created. Within the Building & Construction industry all major CAD packages support IFC export. IFC is an open standard with the goal to store the building data for all disciplines in the process, however with only very limited parametric representation power and missing coherent and holistic data. This means that the required parametric knowledge needs to be added afterwards in a dedicated application. An alternative solution is to create a dedicated exporter for CMO within a certain CAD package. Given a powerful enough API and strong enough parametric capabilities this enables modelling the parametric knowledge directly in the CAD package in order to encourage the end users to operate the new system on a well-known software platform.

40|$|The {{investigation}} was undertaken firstly to identify, classify and assess requirements and methods for in-service {{training in the}} use of computer-aided design (CAD) systems in UK building surveying practice. The second purpose was to develop, test and assess alternative instructional methods for practitioners to acquire and develop capabilities for appropriate use of CAD. Requirements, opportunities and constraints were informed through discussion with practitioners, suppliers of CAD systems or associated services, and a postal survey of 50 UK building surveying practices. Collated information was considered within Romiszowski's (1984) framework for problem solving in the organisation. Conventional methods for CAD training in the UK construction industry, and relevant instructional theory, were investigated in a literature search. Alternative instructional models and methods were identified and developed through an action research methodology based upon Cohen and Manion (1989). Proposals were assessed conceptually using the first three of Popper's (1959) four tests for theories. Prototyping core components, substantially by computer-based methods, and classroom experiments with students of building surveying, or clients of the Leicester CAD Centre, both at De Montfort University, were used in place of Popper's fourth test. The research findings contribute detailed analysis of requirements, provision and constraints to a sparse knowledge base for use of CAD in building surveying. They also provide a critical review of conventional methods for developing users of the technology in this domain. Three core principles are proposed to guide the policies and actions of building surveying practices in relation to CAD, emphasising integration of staff development within an overall CAD strategy. An alternative instructional model, synthesised from results across the research programme, is recommended for developing relevant practical capabilities with CAD. Corresponding specifications are made for a hybrid of manual, interpersonal and computer-based methods for its implementation. The model is set in the context of wider considerations for effective use of CAD technology, and is independent of particular software systems, types of workplace and trainee. Theoretically the model is capable of rapidly enabling staff in any practice to apply relevant <b>CAD</b> <b>hardware</b> and software effectively to authentic tasks, and subsequently contribute to developing application methods in the workplace. In conjunction with recommended operational principles the alternative instructional model improves significantly upon conventional methods identified for in-service training in CAD by provision for strategic integration, system independence, and responsiveness to local requirements. The investigation concluded by identifying four foci for further research and development to overcome constraints on implementing the model by the methods prototyped. A fifth focus recommends investigation of an optimal model and methods to develop capabilities of staff in building surveying practices for appraising, implementing, managing and developing the use of CAD systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{reconfigurable}} computing {{community has}} yet to be successful in allowing programmers to access FPGAs through traditional software development flows. Existing barriers that prevent programmers from using FPGAs include: 1) knowledge of hardware programming models, 2) the need to work within the vendor specific <b>CAD</b> tools and <b>hardware</b> synthesis. This thesis presents a series of published papers that explore different aspects of a new approach being developed to remove the barriers and enable programmers to compile accelerators on next generation reconfigurable manycore architectures. The approach is entitled Just In Time Assembly (JITA) of hardware accelerators. The approach has been defined to allow hardware accelerators to be built and run through software compilation and run time interpretation outside of CAD tools and without requiring each new accelerator to be synthesized. The approach advocates the use of libraries of pre-synthesized components that can be referenced through symbolic links in a similar fashion to dynamically linked software libraries. Synthesis still must occur but is moved out of the application programmers software flow and into the initial coding process that occurs when programming patterns that define a Domain Specific Language (DSL) are first coded. Programmers see no difference between creating software or hardware functionality when using the DSL. A new run time interpreter is introduced to assemble the individual pre-synthesized hardware accelerators that comprise the accelerator functionality within a configurable tile array of partially reconfigurable slots at run time. Quantitative results are presented that compares utilization, performance, and productivity of the approach to what would be achieved by full custom accelerators created through traditional <b>CAD</b> flows using <b>hardware</b> programming models and passing through synthesis...|$|R

It concerns both the operations on the object property values and the interactive manipulation of their structure. They involve concepts of the object models as well as the application semantics. They rely therefore on concepts used for representing the design objects and on semantic notions related to expert knowledge in the application domain. Among these are the notions of consistency and of completeness of the objects. These two complementary aspects are detailed and their relationships described. The emphasis is on the heuristic rules that provide a unified knowledgebased approach for their management independent of the particular application being considered.
