5|$|Because of {{his fear}} of demagoguery and belief {{the people of the}} United States could be easily misled, Gerry also {{advocated}} <b>indirect</b> elections. Although he was unsuccessful in obtaining them for the lower house of Congress, Gerry did obtain such <b>indirect</b> elections for the U.S. Senate, whose members were to be elected by the state legislatures. Gerry also advanced numerous proposals for <b>indirect</b> elections of the President of the United States, most of them involving limiting the right to vote to the state governors and electors.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Texas, Hurricane Claudette caused little damage {{due to its}} low intensity. In total, damage {{estimates}} rose to $180million (2003 USD, $198million 2006USD), and {{the storm}} caused one direct and two <b>indirect</b> deaths. One of the <b>indirect</b> deaths occurred from a man {{having a heart attack}} while surfing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{table of}} the storms in 1990 and the {{affected}} regions, if any. Deaths in parentheses are additional and <b>indirect</b> (an example of an <b>indirect</b> death would be a traffic accident), but are still storm-related. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{table of}} the storms in 1997 and their landfall(s), if any. Deaths in {{parentheses}} are additional and <b>indirect</b> (an example of an <b>indirect</b> death would be a traffic accident), but are still storm-related. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low, but do not include impacts in the Western Pacific basin.|$|E
5|$|Various immunoassays for T. cruzi are {{available}} {{and can be used}} to distinguish among strains (zymodemes of T.cruzi with divergent pathogenicities). These tests include: detecting complement fixation, <b>indirect</b> hemagglutination, <b>indirect</b> fluorescence assays, radioimmunoassays, and ELISA. Alternatively, diagnosis and strain identification can be made using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).|$|E
5|$|Allen caused {{just over}} $1 billion (1980 USD) in damages and {{killed at least}} 269 people {{throughout}} its course (including <b>indirect</b> deaths).|$|E
5|$|As a small storm, Hurricane Danny only {{caused a}} damage toll of $ (1997 USD, $  USD). A total of 4 direct and 5 <b>indirect</b> deaths {{resulted}} {{from the effects of}} Danny.|$|E
5|$|August 14, 1974 - Tropical Storm Alma makes {{landfall}} on northeastern Venezuela {{and later}} dissipates over the mountainous country. Intense rain bands cause a passenger plane to crash on Isla Margarita, resulting in 47 <b>indirect</b> deaths. Damage is unknown.|$|E
5|$|August 17, 1986– Hurricane Charley makes {{landfall}} {{along the}} state and causes one <b>indirect</b> death; damage is minor and is mostly from tidal flooding and downed trees.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{accompanied}} {{the couple in}} Prévost's return to his country, and would be under their <b>indirect</b> tutelage while boarding at the school. He showed interest in natural and exact sciences early on, and also became a good fencer.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Gulf Coast of the United States, Ethel dropped {{rainfall}} in {{the states}} of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, causing little if any damage. Throughout its path, Ethel caused $1.5million (1960USD) in damage and one <b>indirect</b> fatality.|$|E
5|$|Crash Team Racing {{was praised}} by critics for its {{gameplay}} and graphics, though the audio {{was met with}} mixed opinions. An <b>indirect</b> sequel, Crash Nitro Kart, was released in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and N-Gage.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{fame and}} {{popularity}} {{led to his}} name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an <b>indirect</b> relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.|$|E
5|$|David {{produced}} widespread damage {{across the}} United States amounting to $320 million ($900 million in 2005 USD). Prior to the hurricane's arrival, 400,000 evacuated from coastal areas. In total, David directly killed {{five in the}} United States, and was responsible for ten <b>indirect</b> deaths.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– glans, hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive <b>indirect</b> physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), <b>indirect</b> clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E
5|$|However, this is {{management}} {{at the end of}} a long series of <b>indirect</b> causal factors that are initiated by human consumption, so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Irene passed {{near the}} northwestern Bahamas, causing {{moderate}} flooding and spawning a few tornadoes. One tornado caused damage in Marsh Harbour and killed one on Abaco island. Four <b>indirect</b> deaths occurred when a truck drove off a wet pier during a downpour.|$|E
5|$|In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro {{proposed}} that epidemic diseases {{were caused by}} transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or <b>indirect</b> contact, or even without contact over long distances.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a 777-style interior, {{known as}} the Boeing Signature Interior, debuted on the 767-400ER. Subsequently adopted for all new-build 767s, the Signature Interior {{features}} even larger overhead bins, <b>indirect</b> lighting, and sculpted, curved panels. The 767-400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777. Older 767s can be retrofitted with the Signature Interior. Some operators have adopted a simpler modification {{known as the}} Enhanced Interior, featuring curved ceiling panels and <b>indirect</b> lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture, as well as aftermarket modifications such as the NuLook 767 package by Heath Tecna.|$|E
5|$|In all, Tropical Storm Odette caused 8 {{deaths and}} 14 injuries, mostly due to flash {{flooding}} and mudslides. In addition, two <b>indirect</b> deaths {{are associated with}} the storm due to heart attacks. Neighboring Haiti experienced little from the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the acute}} phase {{physical}} therapists {{focus on the}} patient’s respiratory status, prevention of <b>indirect</b> complications (such as pressure ulcers), maintaining range of motion, and keeping available musculature active.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>indirect</b> or French process, {{metallic}} zinc {{is melted}} in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the {{oxygen in the}} air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This <b>indirect</b> method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indirect</b> {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles {{have been observed}} in laboratories. Many particle physics candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.|$|E
5|$|July 29, 1960– Tropical Storm Brenda hits near Yankeetown, {{producing}} locally {{heavy rainfall}} which reaches over 13inches (330mm) near Tampa. The rainfall causes flooding {{and a few}} <b>indirect</b> traffic deaths, and damage in the state totals $5million (1960USD, $36million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|June 13, 2001– The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Allison enter {{the state as}} a subtropical depression and drop over 10inches (250mm) of rainfall in the northeastern portion of the state; the rainfall results in nine <b>indirect</b> deaths due to traffic accidents on slick roads.|$|E
5|$|June 14, 2006– The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Alberto cross the state, producing heavy rainfall peaking at 7.16inches (182mm) in Raleigh; the rain causes one <b>indirect</b> death when a boy runs into a flooded drainage system and drowns.|$|E
5|$|Major {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Port Arthur and Beaumont. Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes in Louisiana were also devastated with the towns of Cameron and Holly Beach completely wiped out. Offshore oil platforms throughout Rita's path also suffered significant damage, though the refineries of Houston, originally thought to be at risk, escaped {{the brunt of the}} storm. Seven people are confirmed dead from Rita's direct effects, and total damage from the storm is estimated at $10billion, almost entirely in Texas and Louisiana. 55-112 <b>indirect</b> deaths have also been reported, most resulting from incidents during the evacuation of Houston when the storm was predicted to strike the city. Many of the <b>indirect</b> deaths were caused by a single bus fire in the mass exodus.|$|E
5|$|October 13, 1990– The extratropical {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Marco bring additional heavy rainfall to the state, causing two direct deaths and two <b>indirect</b> traffic deaths.|$|E
5|$|October 18, 1999– Hurricane Irene {{parallels}} the state's coastline just offshore, dropping further heavy rainfall to coastal regions. Some additional flooding is reported, and one <b>indirect</b> death occurs {{due to a}} traffic accident.|$|E
5|$|October 3, 2000– The {{precursor}} disturbance to Tropical Storm Leslie produces 10—20inches (255–510mm) {{of rainfall}} across southeastern Florida, flooding about 93,000houses. The flooding causes $950million in damage (2000USD, $1.4billion 2017USD), {{along with three}} <b>indirect</b> deaths.|$|E
5|$|Ohio's medical {{colleges are}} {{sixth in the}} nation in terms of {{economic}} impact, resulting in 425,000 direct or <b>indirect</b> positions and $37.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|One {{death in}} Jamaica, four deaths in Cuba, and ten {{deaths in the}} United States were {{directly}} attributed to Charley. Numerous injuries were reported, as well as 25 <b>indirect</b> deaths in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Only three {{fatalities}} were reported, one direct {{death in}} Florida from high surf, one <b>indirect</b> {{death in a}} traffic accident in North Carolina and a second <b>indirect</b> death due to a fall in Nova Scotia. Damage is estimated at around $70million, mostly in North Carolina {{but also in the}} Bahamas and Nova Scotia and on the Florida coast. While the storm was initially estimated to have caused as much as $1billion in damages, that number was determined to be a significant overestimate.|$|E
5|$|Other {{authors have}} {{also argued that}} <b>indirect</b> land use changes produce other {{significant}} social and environmental impacts, affecting biodiversity, water quality, food prices and supply, land tenure, worker migration, and community and cultural stability.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Hurricane Mitch {{caused an}} {{estimated}} $3.8billion in damage, of which $2.005billion was from direct damages {{and the remainder}} from <b>indirect</b> costs. The overall impact represented about 70% of Honduras's annual gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E
