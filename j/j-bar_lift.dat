25|$|There are {{no major}} ski resorts on North Mountain. Much {{of the land}} on the {{mountain}} {{is part of the}} Pennsylvania State Game Lands, particularly State Game Lands Number 13. However, between 1964 and 1984, a ski slope did exist on North Mountain near Sonestown. The slope featured a <b>J-bar</b> <b>lift.</b> A Poma lift was also brought to the slope, but never installed. There were plans at one point to extend the ski slope to a height 1400 vertical feet, but these plans ran afoul of local zoning laws. As of 2008, the slope was well-maintained.|$|E
50|$|Gore Mountain has 107 {{trails and}} 15 lifts (nine chairlifts, one gondola lift, one <b>J-bar</b> <b>lift,</b> one Poma lift, and one magic carpet), and one snow train.

The {{elevation}} of its summit is 5,895 feet (1,797 m) above sea level, with a vertical drop of 475 feet (145 m) on its treeless north-facing slopes of Art Richards Mountain. A Poma lift was installed in 1998; it replaced a <b>J-bar</b> <b>lift</b> that had served since 1964. The primary lift before the J-bar was a rope tow.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mountain}} range is also {{famous for its}} skiing facilities located around Bánkút. There {{are a number of}} maintained ski slopes equipped with several <b>J-bar</b> <b>lifts.</b> The long traditions of skiing - on the racing and recreational levels - in Bükk are fostered by local enthusiasts constituting the [...] "Bánkút Ski Club" [...] also in charge of operating and developing one of the largest alpine ski centres in Hungary (http://www.bankut.hu).|$|R
5000|$|A {{group led}} by Tom Corcoran opened Waterville Valley [...] in 1966 with four new Stadeli double {{chairlifts}} and a <b>J-Bar</b> surface <b>lift.</b> Of the original chairlifts, the High Country and Lower Meadows still remain.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Lower Mountain" [...] {{consists}} of mostly Beginner terrain and is accessed by a high-speed detachable quad chairlift. There {{is also a}} [...] "Bunny Slope" [...] accessed by a <b>J-bar</b> surface <b>lift.</b> A beginner carpet lift was installed in 2010 to make the learning progression easier for first time skiers. There {{are a couple of}} terrain parks and a beginner glade (Enchanted Forest) here as well. This section of the mountain also has lift served mountain biking during non-snow months. The main Sherburne Base Lodge services this section of the resort. This lodge contains the rental shop, restaurant/bar, retail shop, and cafeteria.|$|R
50|$|A T-bar or <b>J-bar</b> <b>lift</b> is {{employed}} for low-capacity slopes in large resorts and small local areas. It {{consists of an}} aerial cable loop running over a series of wheels, powered by an engine at one end. Hanging from the rope {{are a series of}} vertical recoiling cables, each attached to a T- or J-shaped bar measuring about a meter in both dimensions. The horizontal bar is placed behind the skier's buttocks or between the snowboarder's legs, and pushes the passengers uphill while they slide across the ground.|$|E

50|$|The resort {{was opened}} on December 21, 1963 as Treasure Mountain by United Park City Mines. This company {{was the last}} {{surviving}} mining corporation in Park City, and the resort was opened with funds from a federal government program meant to revive the economically depressed town. When it originally opened, it boasted the longest gondola in the United States, {{as well as a}} double chairlift, a <b>J-bar</b> <b>lift,</b> base and summit lodges, and a nine-hole golf course. The gondola was a four-passenger Polig-Heckel-Bleichert (PHB, a German aerial ropeway company). Its sister lift was built at Sugarloaf/USA in Carrabassett Valley, Maine, after top members of Sugarloaf's management visited Park City's lift.|$|E
50|$|The {{town has}} several rivers, streams and brooks running through it, {{including}} the Ten Mile River and the Seven Mile River. There are several ponds and lakes, including Greenwood Lake (site {{of a fish}} hatchery) and Falls Pond, among others. The town's largest park, World War I Memorial Park, {{is located in the}} northern part of town and contains the highest point in Bristol County - Sunrise Hill (Watery Hill) at 390 feet above sea level. World War I Memorial Park features a petting zoo, Petti Field for soccer and lacrosse and a ski/sledding hill with <b>J-bar</b> ski <b>lift</b> which is currently inoperable. There is also the North Attleborough Arboretum adjacent to the park.|$|R
50|$|The Dartmouth Skiway has {{a summit}} {{elevation}} of 1943 ft and a base elevation of 975 ft, {{giving it a}} vertical drop of 968 ft. Its longest trail is 1.25 mi. There are three lifts which serve the trails at the skiway, including the Winslow Mountain Quad, the Holt's Ledge Double, and the <b>J-Bar</b> Beginner <b>Lift.</b> These lifts give the ski area an uphill capacity of 3,300 skiers per hour. Snowmaking covers about {{seventy percent of the}} area with over fifteen snowguns. There is a terrain park located on the Winslow side. The Dartmouth Skiway Ski and Snowboard School has a staff of over 35 instructors. The Dartmouth Skiway is patrolled by the Dartmouth Ski Patrol, a joint community and student first aid volunteer organization, and is home to the Dartmouth Ski Team, which hosts the alpine skiing events of the Dartmouth Winter Carnival there annually.|$|R
50|$|Park City Mountain Resort {{is located}} 34 mi east of {{downtown}} Salt Lake City, in Park City, Utah. It was opened on December 21, 1963, as Treasure Mountain by United Park City Mines, the last surviving mining company in Park City, with funds {{from a federal}} government program meant to revive the economically depressed town. When it originally opened, it boasted the longest gondola in the United States, {{as well as a}} double chairlift, a <b>J-bar</b> <b>lift,</b> base and summit lodges, and a nine-hole golf course. A special Skier's Subway was used to transport skiers nearly 2.5 mi into the mountain through the pitch-black Spiro Tunnel on a mine train, where skiers then boarded a mining elevator that lifted them 1750 ft to the surface, from there they had access to the entire mountain. Treasure Mountain's name was changed to the Park City Ski Area for its fourth season of 1966-67, and eventually it became known as the Park City Mountain Resort. The resort has grown to include eight peaks and nine bowls, with 3300 acres of skiing and 16 lifts.|$|E
