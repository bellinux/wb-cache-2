5|$|After {{the islands}} were {{transferred}} to Scotland, thousands of Scots families emigrated to Shetland in the 16th and 17th centuries but studies of the genetic makeup of the islands' population indicate that Shetlanders are just under half Scandinavian in origin. A sizeable component of Scandinavian patrilineal ancestry {{has been reported in}} Orkney (55%) and Shetland (68%). This combination is reflected in many aspects of local life. For example, almost <b>every</b> <b>place</b> name in use {{can be traced back to}} the Vikings. The Norn language was a form of Old Norse, which continued to be spoken until the 18th century when it was replaced by an insular dialect of Scots known as Shetlandic, which is in turn being replaced by Scottish English. Although Norn was spoken for hundreds of years it is now extinct and few written sources remain. Shetlandic is used both in local radio and dialect writing, and kept alive by the Shetland Folk Society.|$|E
5|$|Thus, in August 480 BC, {{when the}} Persian army was {{approaching}} Thessaly, the Allied fleet sailed to Artemisium, and the Allied army marched to Thermopylae. Themistocles himself took {{command of the}} Athenian contingent of the fleet, and went to Artemisium. When the Persian fleet finally arrived at Artemisium after a significant delay, Eurybiades, who both Herodotus and Plutarch suggest was not the most inspiring commander, wished to sail away without fighting. At this point Themistocles accepted a large bribe from the local people for the fleet to remain at Artemisium, and used some of it to bribe Eurybiades to remain, while pocketing the rest. From this point on, Themistocles {{appears to have been}} more-or-less in charge of the Allied effort at Artemisium. Over three days of battle, the Allies held their own against the much larger Persian fleet, but sustained significant losses. However, the loss of the simultaneous Battle of Thermopylae to the Persians made their continued presence at Artemisium irrelevant, and the Allies thus evacuated. According to Herodotus, Themistocles left messages at <b>every</b> <b>place</b> where the Persian fleet might stop for drinking water, asking the Ionians in the Persian fleet to defect, or at least fight badly. Even if this did not work, Themistocles apparently intended that Xerxes would at least begin to suspect the Ionians, thereby sowing dissension in the Persian ranks.|$|E

Up to the 1940s men made up {{the vast majority of}} the Costa Rican Chinese community. Males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico and they married Mexican women. One stark difference between Indian and Chinese Coolies was the treatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage. Though there were crimes against women and women being murdered, these incidents were nowhere near as frequent as with Indian Coolies. Though this was because there were so few Chinese, it became common for people to believe that Indians murder their women while Chinese women stay alive because, unlike their Indian counterparts, they are chaste.|$|E

Animated by a cheerful philosophy, and anxious to pour its sunshine into <b>every</b> <b>place</b> where there is lurking care or suffering, she selects for illustration the scenes of everyday experience, paints them with exact fidelity, and seeks to diffuse over the mind a delicious serenity, and in the heart kind feelings and sympathies, and wise ambition and steady hope. Her style is colloquial, picturesque, and marked by a facile grace which is evidently a gift of nature. Her characters are nicely drawn and delicately contrasted, her delineation of manners decidedly the best that has appeared.|$|E

25|$|Reformed theologians {{affirm that}} the Bible is true, but {{differences}} emerge among {{them over the}} meaning and extent of its truthfulness. Conservative followers of the Princeton theologians take {{the view that the}} Bible is true and inerrant, or incapable of error or falsehood, in <b>every</b> <b>place.</b> This view is very similar to that of Catholic orthodoxy as well as modern Evangelicalism. Another view, influenced by the teaching of Karl Barth and Neo-Orthodoxy, is found in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s Confession of 1967. Those who take this view believe the Bible to be the primary source of our knowledge of God, but also that some parts of the Bible may be false, not witnesses to Christ, and not normative for today's church. In this view, Christ is the revelation of God, and the scriptures witness to this revelation rather than being the revelation itself. Dawn DeVries, a professor at Union Presbyterian Seminary, has written that Barth's doctrine of Scripture is not capable of resolving conflicts in contemporary churches, and proposed that Scripture not be thought of as the Word of God at all, but only human reports of the revealed Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian {{historian}} Róbert Hermann {{writes in}} one of his studies, that during the battles around Zsigárd and Pered between 16–21 June, General Artúr Görgei committed one of his few great mistakes of his military career: the Hungarian main commander chose at 16 June not to command directly from the battlefield the actions of his new, inexperienced corps commanders, who because of this failed to coordinate their actions, and were defeated, with this letting the opportunity to win the battle to slip. Later he apologized himself writing that he wanted to put his new army corps commanders to the proof, but the importance of this battle {{for the future of the}} Hungarian revolutionary state was too high for such a risk. In the Spring campaign, when the commanders of the corps were the very talented and experienced Damjanich and Klapka, Görgei was every time nearby, but now when the new commanders were first time commanding an army corps, and when their tasks were far more difficult than in the former corps commanders had in the Spring Campaign, Görgei did not supported them. Another mistake of Görgei was the replacement of Colonel Lajos Asbóth, the most successful army corps commander of the first day of the Battle of Pered, 20 June with Colonel József Kászonyi, whose performance eased the task of the enemy forces to win the battle. But during the battle of Pered Görgei showed a great efficiency as high commander, turning several times the fate of the battle by reorganizing his retreating troops and putting them to attack again. But he could not be in <b>every</b> <b>place</b> in the same time to hold the battle together, while his chief of the general staff, Colonel József Bayer did not shown up to help him, remaining in his bureau.|$|E
