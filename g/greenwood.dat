5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{what is now}} NY210 was {{originally}} designated as part of NY55, a connector between NY17 in Goshen and the New Jersey state line south of the village of <b>Greenwood</b> Lake. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY55 was incorporated into two longer routes: NY210 from New Jersey to <b>Greenwood</b> Lake and NY17A from <b>Greenwood</b> Lake to Goshen. Initially, NY17A ended in <b>Greenwood</b> Lake while NY210 continued east to U.S. Route9W (US9W) {{on the banks of}} the Hudson River in West Haverstraw. From <b>Greenwood</b> Lake to Southfields, NY210 was routed on modern NY17A. The route continued east from there along Southfields Road to the eastern fringe of Harriman State Park, at which point it headed to West Haverstraw via Willow Grove and Letchworth Village roads, Suffern Lane, and Railroad Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Greenwood</b> Lake–Goshen {{portion of}} NY17A was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} New York State Route55 in the 1920s. South of <b>Greenwood</b> Lake, NY55 used modern NY210. NY55 was split into NY17A and NY210 {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Initially, only NY210 continued east from <b>Greenwood</b> Lake to Southfields; however, NY17A was extended to Southfields by 1933, overlapping NY210. The overlap was eliminated in 1982 when NY210 was truncated to <b>Greenwood</b> Lake.|$|E

However, concern is expressed over <b>Greenwood's</b> (1) failure to adequately reference recent debates concerning social constructionist views of emotion and (2) almost exclusive focus on emotions as representations...|$|R

5|$|Following the war, three visitations {{reformed}} the University of Oxford in the Parliamentarians' preferred style, including purging Brasenose of its remaining loyalists. Sir William Petty, {{a former}} student, {{was among those}} promoted to fellow of the college. Samuel Radcliffe, Principal, was to be replaced with Dr Daniel <b>Greenwood,</b> a long-term fellow {{of the college of}} Puritan sympathies by order of the visitors. However, the college held out repeatedly against efforts to expel or remove its fellows and principal, most through deliberate inactivity. Radcliffe was ill and continued to personally oppose handing over control of the college to <b>Greenwood,</b> particularly the college archives and treasury. The fellows, also opposing <b>Greenwood,</b> instead elected Thomas Yate to replace Radcliffe upon his death, although owing to the visitors' choice of <b>Greenwood</b> he would not take up his post fully for twelve years. Over this period, thirteen of Brasenose's sixteen remaining fellows were expelled, but the college survived.|$|E

In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY55 was incorporated into two longer routes: NY210 from New Jersey to <b>Greenwood</b> Lake and NY17A from <b>Greenwood</b> Lake to Goshen. The modern routing of NY17A between Greenfield Lake and Southfields was originally only part of NY210, which continued past NY17 and into Rockland County. NY17A was extended east to Southfields by 1933, completing the alternate loop of NY17 and creating an overlap with NY210.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route210 (NY210) is a {{state highway}} in Orange County, New York, in the United States. It runs north from the New Jersey state line—where it {{continues}} south as Passaic County Route511 (CR511)—along the west shore of <b>Greenwood</b> Lake to the eponymous village of <b>Greenwood</b> Lake, where it ends at a junction with NY17A. It was once much longer, as it originally extended east along NY17A and CR106 in Orange and Rockland counties to Stony Point when it was assigned {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The route was truncated to its current length in 1982. Prior to becoming NY210 in 1930, the road alongside <b>Greenwood</b> Lake was part of NY55, a route connecting New Jersey to Goshen, in the 1920s.|$|E
