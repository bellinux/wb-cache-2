25|$|The 1935 Constitution {{originally}} {{provided for}} a single six-year term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> without re-election. In 1940, however, the 1935 Constitution was amended and the term of the President (and Vice President) was shortened to four years but allowed one re-election. Since the amendment was done, only Presidents Manuel L. Quezon (1941) and Ferdinand E. Marcos (1969) were re-elected. Presidents Sergio Osmeña (1946), Elpidio Quirino (1953), Carlos P. Garcia (1961) and Diosdado Macapagal (1965) all failed in seeking a new term.|$|E

In November 2009, buoyed by the government's defeat of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in May 2009, incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa called an early presidential election. In the elections held in January 2010 Rajapaksa secured a second term in office, defeating common opposition candidate Sarath Fonseka. In February 2010 the Supreme Court ruled that Rajapaksa's second term would begin in November 2010, and was accordingly sworn in on 19 November 2010.|$|E
25|$|President Reagan's tenure {{marked a}} time of {{expanded}} economic prosperity for many Americans. The misery index sank to 9.72 {{from a high of}} 19.33, the greatest improvement record <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>President</b> since Harry S. Truman left office. In terms of American households, the percentage of total households making less than $10,000 a year (in real 2007 dollars) shrunk from 8.8% in 1980 to 8.3% in 1988 while the percentage of households making over $75,000 went from 20.2% to 25.7% during that period. However, the number of Americans below the poverty level did not decline at all. The number of children, ages 18 years and younger, below the poverty level increased from 11.543 million in 1980, 18.3% of children, to 12.455, 19.5%, in 1988. Also, the situation of low income groups was affected by the reduction of social spending, and inequality increased. The share of total income received by the 5% highest-income households grew from 16.5% in 1980 to 18.3% in 1988 and the share of the highest fifth of income increased from 44.1% to 46.3% in same years. In contrast, the share of total income of the lowest fifth of households fell from 4.2% in 1980 to 3.8% in 1988 and the second poorest fifth from 10.2% to 9.6%.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was buried}} in his family {{cemetery}} (which, although {{it is part of}} the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park in Stonewall, Texas, is still privately owned by the Johnson family, who have requested that the public not enter the cemetery), a few yards from the house in which he was born. Eulogies were given by former Texas governor John Connally and the Rev. Billy Graham, the minister who officiated at the burial rites. The state funeral, the last <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> until Ronald Reagan's in 2004, was part of an unexpectedly busy week in Washington, as the Military District of Washington (MDW) dealt with its second major task in less than a week, beginning with Nixon's second inauguration. The inauguration affected the state funeral in various ways, because Johnson died only two days after the inauguration. The MDW and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee canceled the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration, to allow for a full state funeral, and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral. It also meant Johnson's casket traveled the entire length of the Capitol, entering through the Senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state and exiting through the House wing steps due to inauguration construction on the East Front steps.|$|E

500|$|In Marion, Harding ran his campaign. As a newspaperman himself, he {{fell into}} easy camaraderie with the press {{covering}} him, enjoying a relationship few presidents have equaled. His [...] "Return to Normalcy" [...] theme was aided by the atmosphere that Marion provided, an orderly place that induced nostalgia in many voters. The front porch campaign allowed Harding to avoid mistakes, and as time dwindled towards the election, his strength grew. The travels of the Democratic candidates eventually caused Harding to make several short speaking tours, {{but for the most}} part, he remained in Marion. America had no need for another Wilson, Harding argued, appealing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> [...] "near the normal".|$|E
500|$|President Reagan professed that he {{was unaware}} of the plot's existence. He opened his own {{investigation}} and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat (John Tower, Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie, known as the [...] "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible. A separate report by Congress concluded that [...] "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have." [...] Reagan's popularity declined from 67% to 46% in less than a week, the greatest and quickest decline ever <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>president.</b> The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff, and eleven convictions.|$|E

He was an excellent delegator and judge of talent and character; he talked regularly with department heads and listened to their advice before making a final decision. In handling routine tasks, he was [...] "systematic, orderly, energetic, solicitous of the opinion of others ... but decisive, intent upon general goals and the consistency of particular actions with them."
