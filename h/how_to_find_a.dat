500|$|When {{mentioning}} the game's art style, most reviewers gave positive response. Denton described the style as a [...] "beautifully drawn, angular 2D world". Prell wrote that Rætikon triangle-based art style made its characters feel like papercraft {{and gave the}} game [...] "a sense of reverence and spirituality" [...] when complemented by the story, and gave comparison to Shadow of the Colossus. [...] Thew gave similar response noting that it is reminiscent of Origami. However, Thew continued to state that while the visuals were [...] "distinctive", the game's [...] "alpine" [...] area was [...] "clichéd and predictable" [...] and its [...] "good looks and smooth movement mechanics" [...] did not compensate {{for the rest of}} the game's design. He found the game [...] "shallow", uninteresting, and [...] "a disappointment ... on almost every level". Denton of Eurogamer praised the moments where he figured out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> shard or alphabet piece, but ultimately found Rætikon [...] "awkward", with [...] "substance did not live up to its style", and causing unjustified and unreasonable frustration.|$|E

She is also known for her distinct understanding of the game, which has led to her developing [...] "a great football IQ". In addition to her creativity, eye for goal, and tactical awareness, she is known for outstanding control and dribbling ability, as well as her elegance on the ball. Her technical skill and ability to read the game allow her to determine [...] "when to take a defender on one-on-one, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> teammate with a slide-rule pass, and how to exploit tight spaces to create scoring chances for herself and her cohorts". For these reasons, her playing style has drawn comparisons with compatriot and 1998 World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane.|$|E

500|$|Georgene L. Troseth and {{her colleagues}} at Vanderbilt University studied how {{toddlers}} use information gained from prerecorded video and from interactions with a person through closed-circuit video, and found that two-year-olds do not learn as much from prerecorded videos because the videos lack social cues and personal references. Two-year-olds who viewed a pretaped video with instructions about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> toy in an adjoining room by a non-interactive researcher {{did not use the}} information, even though they smiled and responded to questions. Troseth speculated that their research had implications for interactive educational shows like Blue's Clues, which although was [...] "on the right track" [...] due {{to the way in which}} the host invites interaction with the show's viewers, did not provide children with the social cues to solve real-world problems. Troseth stated that repetition, repeated exposure, and familiarity with the show's host may increase children's ability to learn facts and to use strategies they learn from Blue's Clues to solve new problems. Her research suggested that Blue's Clues engaged young children and elicited their active participation because they mimicked social interaction. A longitudinal study published in 2005 found that early exposure to Blue's Clues to children between six and thirty months of age was positively linked with vocabulary and expressive language later learned.|$|E

60|$|I had heard, long ago, {{that she}} {{believed}} that the material evidences of her dogma as to the authorship, together with the key of the new philosophy, would be found buried in Shakespeare's grave. Recently, as I understood her, this notion had been somewhat modified, and was now accurately defined and fully developed in her mind, with a result of perfect certainty. In Lord Bacon's letters, on which she laid her finger as she spoke, she had discovered the key and clew to the whole mystery. There were definite and minute instructions <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> will and other documents relating to the conclave of Elizabethan philosophers, which were concealed (when and by whom she did not inform me) in a hollow space in the under surface of Shakespeare's gravestone. Thus the terrible prohibition to remove the stone was accounted for.

All that Miss Bacon now remained in England for-- indeed, the object for which she had come hither, and which had kept her here for three years past--was to obtain possession of these material and unquestionable proofs of the authenticity of her theory.|$|E

6000|$|His face, as {{it appears}} on his coins, is of the loftiest and most Jove- like type of Greek beauty. There is a {{possibility}} about it, as about most old Greek faces, of boundless cunning; a lofty irony too, and a contemptuousness, especially about the mouth, which puts one in mind of Goethe's expression; the face, altogether, of one who knew men too well to respect them. At least, {{he was a man}} of clear enough vision. He saw what was needed in those strange times, and he went straight to the thing which he saw. It was his wisdom which perceived that the huge amorphous empire of Alexander could not be kept together, and advised its partition among the generals, taking care to obtain himself the lion's share; not in size, indeed, but in capability. He saw, too (what every man does not see), that the only way to keep what he had got was to make it better, and not worse, than he found it. His first Egyptian act was to put to death Cleomenes, Alexander's lieutenant, who had amassed vast treasures by extortion; and who was, moreover, (for Ptolemy was a prudent man) a dangerous partisan of his great enemy, Perdiccas. We do not read that he refunded the treasures: but the Egyptians surnamed him Soter, the Saviour; and on the whole he deserved the title. Instead of the wretched misrule and slavery of the conquering Persian dynasty, they had at least law and order, reviving commerce, and a system of administration, we are told (I confess to speaking here quite at second-hand), especially adapted to the peculiar caste-society, and the religious prejudices of Egypt. But Ptolemy's political genius went beyond such merely material and Warburtonian care for the conservation of body and goods of his subjects. He effected with complete success a feat which has been attempted, before and since, by very many princes and potentates, but has always, except in Ptolemy's case, proved somewhat of a failure, namely, the making a new deity. Mythology in general was in a rusty state. The old Egyptian gods had grown in his dominions very unfashionable, under the summary iconoclasm to which they had been subjected by the Monotheist Persians--the Puritans of the old world, as they have been well called. Indeed, all the dolls, and the treasure of the dolls' temples too, had been carried off by Cambyses to Babylon. And as for the Greek gods, philosophers had sublimed them away sadly during the last century: not to mention that Alexander's Macedonians, during their wanderings over the world, had probably become rather remiss in their religious exercises, and had possibly given up mentioning the Unseen world, except for those hortatory purposes for which it used to be employed by Nelson's veterans. But, as Ptolemy felt, people (women especially) must have something wherein to believe. The [...] "Religious Sentiment" [...] in man must be satisfied. But, how to do it? <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> deity who would meet the aspirations of conquerors as well as conquered--of his most irreligious Macedonians, as well as of his most religious Egyptians? It was a great problem: but Ptolemy solved it. He seems to have taken the same method which Brindley the engineer used in his perplexities, for he went to bed. And there he had a dream: How the foreign god Serapis, of Pontus (somewhere near this present hapless Sinope), appeared to him, and expressed his wish to come to Alexandria, and there try his influence on the Religious Sentiment. So Serapis was sent for, and came--at least the idol of him, and-- accommodating personage!--he actually fitted. After he had been there awhile, he was found to be quite an old acquaintance--to be, in fact, the Greek Jove, and two or three other Greek gods, and also two or three Egyptian gods beside--indeed, to be no other than the bull Apis, after his death and deification. I can tell you no more. I never could find that anything more was known. You may see him among Greek and Roman statues as a young man, with a sort of high basket-shaped Persian turban on his head. But, at least, he was found so pleasant and accommodating a conscience-keeper, that he spread, with Isis, his newly-found mother, or wife, over the whole East, and even to Rome. The Consuls there--50 years B.C.--found the pair not too respectable, and pulled down their temples. But, so popular were they, in spite of their bad fame, that seven years after, the Triumvirs had to build the temples up again elsewhere; and from that time forth, Isis and Serapis, in spite, poor things, of much persecution, were the fashionable deities of the Roman world. Surely this Ptolemy was a man of genius! ...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Distribution-free {{statistical}} procedures {{should be applied}} to the establishment of assigned values and uncertainty intervals in a control serum. The two problems, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> appropriate statistical evaluation proce-dure and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> optimized experimental design, are simultaneously dealt with here: Three distribution-free procedures are presented, each based on elimination of extreme values, and 60 designs are considered differing with respect to the number of reference laboratories, of independent series, and of single or double determinations. Using the data of the study described in part 1 of this series (Passing, H. et al. (1981) this j. 19, 1137 - 1144) we simulated these designs and the pertaining assigned values and uncertainty intervals given by each evaluation procedure. From this study one evaluation procedure is shown to be superior to others. This optimized procedure has the follow-ing characteristics: Extreme values are eliminated so that the width of the uncertainty interval is as small as possible. The median of the remaining values is the assigned value. Moreover, 6 reference laboratories are shown to be appro-priate.
