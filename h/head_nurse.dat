40|$|Introduction: The {{intensive}} care unit {{is one of the}} specialized units in hospitals where <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> are responsible for both motivating the personnel and providing high quality care. Understanding of the lived experiences of <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> could help develop new assumptions of the ICU. The present study was therefore conducted to describe the lived experiences of <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> working in ICU. Methods: In this phenomenological study, data were collected through unstructured in-depth interviews with 5 ICU <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> in Northern Iran and then analyzed using 7 steps Colaizzi’s method. Results: Despite the "distressing atmosphere of the ICU", the "difficulty of managing the ICU" and the "difficulty of communication in the ICU", which encourages the "desire to leave the unit" among ICU <b>head</b> <b>nurses,</b> the "desire to stay in the unit" is stronger and <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> are highly motivated to stay in the unit because the unit "develops a feeling of being extraordinary", "creates an interest in providing complicated care to special patients", "facilitates the spiritual bond", "develops a professional dynamism" and "creates an awareness about the nature of {{intensive care}}" among them. Conclusion: According to the result, ICU <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> are still inclined to work in the unit and achieve success in spite of the problems that persist in working in the ICU. As the individuals’ motivation can be the backbone of organizations, and given that individuals with a high enthusiasm for success are productive, hospital managers can take advantage of this strength in choosing their <b>head</b> <b>nurses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Within {{the nursing}} {{organization}} of four hospital wards, {{a new work}} design was introduced, which was primarily characterized by the delegation of responsibilities from <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> to nurses and by the participation of patients.

25|$|While Duke University’s {{reputation}} grew as {{a national}} educational institution, its attitudes towards black workers remained unchanged. The same year the Duke Employees Benevolent Society was established in 1965, Duke revealed a new $200 million plan to promote Duke’s status as a top national university. The funds were used to advance the renovation of new libraries, science research labs, and more modern facilities. Despite Duke University’s reputation as an institution for higher education and its growing expertise in preparing its students for the professional society, the working environments and attitudes towards black, blue-collar workers had not changed. Workers were not given health insurance, received little pay, had inconsistent and demanding schedules, often working ten to twelve days without a day off, and were treated unprofessionally. One nurse’s maid, Helen Johnstone, recalled being treated like a servant: “When I was a nurse’s maid, our second <b>head</b> <b>nurse,</b> Joan Ashley, she used to run me everywhere—uptown to get the immunizations and {{to put them in}} my refrigerator. She had me run to the library to return her books for her on time.” It was not unusual for black workers to be treated this way, especially as a result of unclear job descriptions that gave those with higher power control over the tasks assigned to black workers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Providing {{convenience}} and comfort for patients is a nursing duty which {{is affected by}} different stressors. Therefore, Lack {{of attention to the}} communication skills of <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> can cause increased stress in the workplace and has an adverse effect on the self-efficiency of nurses. This study aimed to determine the relationship between communication skills of <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> and self-efficacy of nurses in the educational hospitals of Sanandaj. Methods: This Analytical Cross Sectional study was conducted in 2015 on 51 <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> and 153 nurses in different wards of Sanandaj teaching hospitals (Besat, Tohid and Qods hospitals). Samples were selected through census for headnurses and random for nurses. Queendom Communication Skills Inventory and Sherer's self-efficacy questionnaire were used to collect the data. Finally, collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 by descriptive statistics and appropriate tests like independent t-test, one way ANOVA, Tukey test, and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Most <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> were women, aged 30 to 54 years. They were married and had a bachelor’s degree in nursing. Communication skills, including the ability to receive and send messages, emotional control, listening, insight into the communication process in studied <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> were higher than the average value (average value= 3) and communication skills combined with the certainty which was less than the average value. There was no significant relationship between age, sex, education level, work experience, and communication skills of <b>head</b> <b>nurses.</b> Conclusion: There was a statistically significant relationship between communication skills of <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> and self-efficacy of nurses. Therefore, the self-efficacy of nurses increased with the increasing communication skills of <b>head</b> <b>nurses</b> in the clinical activities.
