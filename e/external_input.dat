500|$|A special link {{could be}} {{included}} in the chain which incorporated an interrupter circuit. [...] The purpose of the interrupter is to rapidly connect and disconnect the circuit so that the normally steady current of the battery is turned into a rapidly varying current. [...] The usual practice in the use of medical electrical batteries was to feed the output of the interrupter to an induction coil in order to increase the voltage applied to the patient by transformer action. [...] In Pulvermacher's patent however, {{there is no mention of}} using induction coils - the Pulvermacher battery could produce large voltages merely by adding more links to the chain. [...] However, the interrupter still had an effect in that an interrupted current produces a stronger sensation of electric shock in the patient than a steady current. [...] A novel feature of Pulvermacher's interrupter was that it was operated by the action of a vibrating spring kept in motion by the movements of the patient without the need for any <b>external</b> <b>input.</b> [...] Interrupters of the time typically had to be hand-cranked by the physician, although there were already some in existence using electro-mechanical automatic interrupters. [...] Later versions of the Pulvermacher chain used clockwork driven interrupters whose rate of interruption could be adjusted so that the rate of shock to the patient could be controlled. [...] Such a clockwork interrupter is fitted to the chain shown in figure 1. [...] It is wound up by turning the handle at the left end.Pulvermacher, p.2 ...|$|E

2500|$|Inertial {{navigation}} systems used {{a cluster}} of gyroscopes and accelerometers to determine accelerations relative to inertial space. After a gyroscope is spun up in a particular orientation in inertial space, the law of conservation of angular momentum requires that it retain that orientation as long as no external forces are applied to it. [...] Three orthogonal gyroscopes establish an inertial reference frame, and the accelerators measure acceleration relative to that frame. The accelerations, along with a clock, can then be {{used to calculate the}} change in position. Thus, inertial navigation is a form of dead reckoning that requires no <b>external</b> <b>input,</b> and therefore cannot be jammed by any external or internal signal source.|$|E
2500|$|The nativist theory, {{proposed}} by Noam Chomsky, argues that {{language is a}} unique human accomplishment, and {{can be attributed to}} either [...] "millions of years of evolution" [...] or to [...] "principles of neural organization that may be even more deeply grounded in physical law". Chomsky says that all children have what is called an innate language acquisition device (LAD). Theoretically, the LAD is an area of the brain that has a set of universal syntactic rules for all languages. This device provides children with the ability to make sense of knowledge and construct novel sentences with minimal <b>external</b> <b>input</b> and little experience. Chomsky's claim is based upon the view that what children hear—their linguistic input—is insufficient to explain how they come to learn language. [...] He argues that linguistic input from the environment is limited and full of errors. Therefore, nativists assume that it is impossible for children to learn linguistic information solely from their environment. However, because children possess this LAD, they are in fact, able to learn language despite incomplete information from their environment. Their capacity to learn language is also attributed to the theory of universal grammar (UG), which posits that a certain set of structural rules are innate to humans, independent of sensory experience. This view has dominated linguistic theory for over fifty years and remains highly influential, as witnessed by the number of articles in journals and books.|$|E
