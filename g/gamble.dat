40|$|With the {{exception}} of horse racing, any form of <b>gambling</b> was criminalised in South Africa until the dawn of constitutional democracy in 1994. In the same year, the Lotteries and <b>Gambling</b> Board Act, 1993, came into force decriminalising, amongst others, casinos and <b>gambling</b> games within the Republic. This Act has since been repealed and <b>gambling</b> is governed by the National <b>Gambling</b> Act, 2004, {{as well as by}} provincial <b>gambling</b> laws. Interactive / online <b>gambling</b> is illegal pending authorisation by a national legislation. Such legislation, the National <b>Gambling</b> Amendment Act, 2008, seeking to regulate interactive <b>gambling</b> awaits proclamation of the date of its commencement by the President. The National <b>Gambling</b> Policy, 2016, dashes any hope of regulation of interactive <b>gambling,</b> however, as it seeks to embargo the introduction of (new) forms of <b>gambling,</b> including but not limited to interactive <b>gambling.</b> The scourge of problem <b>gambling</b> and the protection of traditional forms of <b>gambling,</b> that is, casinos, are the main reasons for advocating for the continued prohibition of interactive <b>gambling.</b> Problem <b>gambling</b> is not unique to interactive <b>gambling,</b> but affects all modes of <b>gambling.</b> South Africa is among countries with a high rate of problem <b>gambling.</b> It is feared that interactive <b>gambling</b> will exacerbate the scourge of problem <b>gambling</b> as gamblers with access to the internet will now have unlimited <b>gambling</b> opportunities around the clock. On the other hand, interactive <b>gambling</b> offers practical solutions to the implementation of harm minimisation strategies to deal with problem <b>gambling</b> such as limitations on <b>gambling</b> deposits, losses and time. Prohibition of interactive <b>gambling</b> is difficult to enforce and deprives the country of an opportunity to control, through licensing, this mode of <b>gambling</b> and possible benefit from taxation and licensing fees. It further exposes gamblers – who despite prohibition choose this mode of <b>gambling</b> – to unregulated and illegal <b>gambling</b> websites.

40|$|Background and aims: Online <b>gambling</b> {{participation}} is increasing rapidly, with relatively little research {{about the possible}} effects of different <b>gambling</b> activities on problem <b>gambling</b> behaviour. The aim of this exploratory {{study was to examine}} the participation in online <b>gambling</b> activities and the relationship with problem <b>gambling</b> among an international sample of online gamblers. Methods: An online <b>gambling</b> survey was posted on 32 international <b>gambling</b> websites and resulted in 1, 119 respondents over a four-month period. Results: Poker was the most popular <b>gambling</b> activity online. A number of online activities were associated with problem <b>gambling,</b> including: roulette, poker, horse race betting, sports betting, spread betting and fruit (slot) machines. Not surprisingly, those that <b>gambled</b> on these activities regularly (except poker) were more likely to be a problem gambler, however, what is interesting is that the reverse is true for poker players; those that <b>gambled</b> regularly on poker were less likely to be a problem gambler compared to the non-regular poker players. The majority of the players also <b>gambled</b> offline, but there was no relationship between problem <b>gambling</b> and whether or not a person also <b>gambled</b> offline. Discussion: Problem <b>gambling</b> is associated more with certain online <b>gambling</b> activities than others, and those <b>gambling</b> on two or more activities online were more likely to be a problem gambler. Conclusion: This paper can help explain the impact different online <b>gambling</b> activities may have on <b>gambling</b> behaviour. Consideration needs to be given to the <b>gambling</b> activity when developing and implementing treatment programmes. ...|$|R
