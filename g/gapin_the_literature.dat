40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{addresses}} a significant <b>gapin</b> <b>the</b> conceptualization fbusiness ethics within different cultural influences. Though theoretical models of business ethics have recognized th. e importance {{of culture in}} ethical deci-sion-making, few have examined how this influences ethical decision-making. Therefore, this paper develops proposi-tions concerning the influence of various cultural dimen-sions on ethical decision-making using Hofstede's typology. Over the last decade, the topic of social responsibility and ethics in business has been of significant interest to scholars. However, {{few studies have been}} cross-cultural in content, even though existing theoretical models recognize the importance of this factor (e. g., Ferrell and Gresham, 1985; Hunt and Vitell, 1986 and 1992). Barrels (1967) {{was one of the first}} to note the importance of the role of culture in ethics decision-making identifying cultural factors such as values and customs, religion, law, respect for indi-viduality, national identity and loyalty (or patri-otism), and rights of property as influencing ethics, Scot @ VitelI is Associate Professor of Marketing and holder of th...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the feasibility of}} ateledentistry model for teleconsultation and telediagnosis inResidential Aged Care Facilities. Study feasibility was definedby the ability to develop remote treatment plans. Reliability ofthe remote assessments was assessed by comparing with thoseperformed by traditional face-to-face oral examinations. Anintraoral camera was operated by trained teledentistryassistants {{with the aim of}} screening residents for oral diseasesand pathological conditions. The model was supported bytraning and an instructional kit for the introral cameraoperators. The structure, content and delivery of the program,was evaluated. Residents’ views about the structure, contentand delivery of the program were also evaluated. A total of 50 residents participated in this assessment. Results indicated thatthe proposed teledentistry approach for oral health screeningis feasible and reliable as an alternative to traditional oralhealth examination. Residents expressed high levels ofsatisfaction with the teledentistry service. This study providesan innovative solution towards closing <b>the</b> service delivery <b>gapin</b> <b>the</b> provision of sustainable oral health care services tounderserviced populations (e. g., nursing homes, rural areas) ...|$|R

40|$|This study want {{to measure}} the {{performance}} of pedestrian facilities (zebra cross), particularly the critical gapanalysis to see the level of opportunity {{to cross the street}} safely. To support the recommendations that will be setin addition to the critical gap method will be investigated also waiting time and total time to cross the street andanalysis of types of facilities based on the volume of pedestrian and vehicle volume as the raw determination ofthe crossing facility. From some discussion can be summarized that according to the study analyzes the volume of pedestrian andvehicle volumes obtained by the recommended pedestrian facilities according to standard determination of thecrossing facility is the type of pelican crossing with a separator. Based on the analysis of waiting time to crossthe street, 93 % require pedestrian waiting time, with the average waiting time to cross and the total time tocross at that location, which is 56. 61 seconds and 79. 25 seconds. The condition is very far from the pedestrianshould not waiting more than 30 seconds. Results of analysis of critical gaps, both based on the critical gap only in the morning or combined critical <b>gapin</b> <b>the</b> morning and afternoon shows very little chance of crossing the road owned by the defector, on themorning of 7 times for critical gap in only the morning and 11 times for a combination of critical gap Total 125 waders for 06. 30 until 7 : 30 pm, and 20 times based on a critical gap only in the morning a and 29 times forcritical gap combination of pedestrian total of 66 people over at 07. 30 until 08 : 30 pm.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> role of <b>literature</b> in <b>the</b> Ugandan society.

The interviews were collected {{by the author of}} this thesis in the beginning of 2015. The thesis examines the overall conditions on <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> market, <b>the</b> hierarchies and the character of <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> In addition to field theory, it uses post-colonial theory, and Ngûgî Wa Thiong'os' Decolonising the mind {{to investigate}} the languages and styles of <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b>   To investigate <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> outside of <b>the</b> educated circles and intellectual spheres, the concept of <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> as merely printed and publicated needs to be questioned, since there is also an existing body of oral <b>literature</b> in <b>the</b> country.
