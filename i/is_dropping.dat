5|$|Louis then targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is {{charmed by}} his wife, Edith. He {{substitutes}} petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's darkroom, with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is {{fit to be}} his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne is the next victim. Posing as the Anglican Bishop of Matabeleland, Louis poisons his port. From {{the window of his}} flat, Louis then uses a bow to shoot down the balloon from which the suffragette Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne <b>is</b> <b>dropping</b> leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne a jar of caviar which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, he insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision at sea.|$|E

Nanoparticles are typically smaller than 100 nanometres in diameter, yet most of the particles in food grade titanium dioxide are much larger.|$|E

Omar orchestrates an {{elaborate}} and successful hijacking of Joe's entire shipment of heroin as it enters port. As he had no wish to sell drugs on the street, he sells the heroin back to Proposition Joe. Although the heist makes Omar a lot of money, it has all of the drug kingpins ready to put a contract on his head.|$|E
25|$|Kovačić {{has been}} {{described}} as a great technician with excellent dribbling abilities. He is considered to be a versatile midfielder, having played in different midfield positions. He started off as an attacking midfielder at Dinamo Zagreb, but he transformed his game at Inter where he was deployed out wide and also as a central midfielder, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker, while being coached by Andrea Stramaccioni. One of his trademarks <b>is</b> <b>dropping</b> deep to receive the ball and then driving forward, often performing his slalom runs. Under the coach, Walter Mazzarri, he was often used in a more advanced position. Former Italy and Inter Milan manager Giovanni Trapattoni once claimed that Kovačić knows how to really reach the ball from deep and drive up the pitch like a 'raging bull'. Proven by his pass completion percentages, Kovačić is known for distributing the ball up the pitch.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{the birth}} rate {{increased}} again. Russia recorded 1,896,263 births, {{the highest number}} since 1990, and even exceeding annual births during the period 1967–1969, with a TFR of 1.691, the highest since 1991. (Source: Vital statistics table below). In fact, Russia, despite having only slightly more people than Japan, has recently had nearly twice as many births as that country. The number of births was expected to fall {{over the next few}} years as women born during the baby bust in the 1990s enter their prime childbearing years, but this didn't occur thanks to the continued growth of the TFR. The figures for 2013-2015 again showed around 1.9 million births, about the same as in 2012, but because the number of women of childbearing age <b>is</b> <b>dropping,</b> especially for those in their early 20s, the TFR actually rose to 1.777, which places Russia at first 9 or 10 countries out of 50 developed nations, and at 6th place in Europe.|$|E

Ethnically, the town is 93.7%white, with small minority groups including Chinese, and white minority groups from other countries in Europe. The 2001 census indicated that the largest non-white ethnic group were Chinese; studies conducted by the local council in 2008 indicated {{that there has been}} a growth in people arriving from Eastern Europe, particularly Poland. Unemployment in Eastbourne is below the national average, at 4.1% compared to 4.4% for England and Wales. [...] The percentage of economically active people increased between 2001 and 2011. There has also been an upward trend in the number of people with qualifications with an increase of 5.19% ...|$|E
500|$|As Betty Francis (January Jones) packs for {{a family}} ski vacation, Sally {{complains}} that she would rather spend the weekend with Don and Megan (Jessica Paré). An angry Betty calls Don to say she <b>is</b> <b>dropping</b> Sally off at his apartment. To Megan's surprise, Sally {{shows up at the}} apartment and informs her that she will be staying for the weekend. Megan later complains to Don for not telling her about Sally's visit. Don confides that he had to fire Lane for embezzlement. Lane arrives home drunk to find that Rebecca has surprised him with a new Jaguar. She tells him her reasoning — he never spends on himself. He vomits, but, the next morning, reassures Rebecca (Embeth Davidtz) that he likes the car. Lane attempts to commit suicide {{in the middle of the}} night using the new car's exhaust, but, in an ironic confirmation of Cooper's earlier retort of Jaguars that [...] "They don't start!", the car fails to start. He then walks into SCDP's empty office and types a letter at his desk.|$|E

5000|$|Players first {{drop their}} pieces onto the board. Stewart Culin, H.J.R. Murray, and R.C. Bell {{unfortunately}} did not describe in detail how they <b>are</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the board. In some other hunt games, an oxen piece would first <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> onto any vacant {{point on the}} board followed by a tiger piece onto any vacant point on the board, and players would continue in this fashion. Tiger pieces may not be moved or perform captures until all three tigers have <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the board which takes three turns. Likewise, oxen pieces may not be moved until all twelve oxen pieces have <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the board which takes twelve turns. Another method that could be employed is the one used in the Myanmar game of Tiger and Buffaloes. Four oxen pieces would <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> first, followed by a tiger piece. Then four more oxen pieces would <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> followed by another tiger piece. Then the remaining four oxen pieces would <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> followed by the last tiger piece.|$|R
