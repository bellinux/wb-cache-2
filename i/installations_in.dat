40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{the extent of the}} {{relationship}} between PC installation and revenue creation using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in different economies and by running a series of Granger causality tests. Our findings show that in developed economies the total PC installation and the PC <b>installation</b> <b>in</b> home market Granger cause GDP growth, whereas GDP growth only Granger causes the PC <b>installation</b> <b>in</b> the market for education. However, in developing economies, {{there appears to be a}} unidirectional causality in that GDP growth Granger causes total PC <b>installation,</b> PC <b>installation</b> <b>in</b> education and PC <b>installation</b> <b>in</b> business and government markets. We do not find any PC installation variables Granger causing GDP growth, including PC <b>installation</b> <b>in</b> home market. Overall, our results show that developing economies, unlike developed economies, do not gain from investing in Information Technology (IT) in the short run. economic growth; GDP growth; Granger causality; information technology; revenue creation; revenue management; gross domestic product; PC installation; personal computers; developing economies; developing countries. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{completing}} his duties in Iran, Juskalian assumed {{the role of}} chief of operations and training at the headquarters of the First Army that commanded all U.S. Army <b>installations</b> <b>in</b> New England, New York and New Jersey. His posting in New York was cut short by the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and Juskalian was sent to France to join the 1st Logistical Command. When the 1st Logistical Command was merged with the 4th Logistical Command at Verdun, Juskalian was transferred to this command, serving as the G-3 chief of plans, operations and training.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} <b>installations</b> <b>in</b> the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E

5|$|Pipe {{organs are}} {{installed}} in churches, synagogues, concert halls, schools, other public buildings and in private properties.

The beginning of the 21st century has seen a resurgence in <b>installations</b> <b>in</b> concert halls. The organ boasts a substantial repertoire, which spans over 500years.|$|E

5|$|World wind {{generation}} capacity {{more than}} quadrupled between 2000 and 2006, doubling about every three years.

5|$|After his {{tours of}} duty in New York and France, Juskalian volunteered to fight in Vietnam in late spring of 1963. He arrived in Saigon in August 1963 and took up a posting as deputy senior advisor to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam's IV Corps {{stationed}} in the Mekong Delta. After six months, Jukalian {{was assigned to the}} headquarters of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) to serve as the MACV inspector general under General William Westmoreland, the MACV commander. As part of his duties, he traveled throughout South Vietnam on inspection visits to many military <b>installations.</b> <b>In</b> the transient officers quarters at Danang, he found an ashtray from George Mardikian's Omar Khayyam restaurant in San Francisco and kept it as a souvenir {{for the rest of his}} life.

5|$|All ground {{stations}} {{are connected to}} KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and TrollSat.

Some customers have direct access to their <b>installations</b> <b>in</b> Longyearbyen without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, a wave of Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} (in the appearance of Balkenkreuz sprites on the map) will cross the English Channel and proceed to bomb various cities, air bases and radar <b>installations.</b> <b>In</b> response, RAF squadrons are automatically scrambled and will await orders to either engage invading Luftwaffe fighters or to defend key cities from bombers. When a RAF squadron has successfully engaged a Luftwaffe unit on the map, the game will shift to a first-person shooter perspective, in which the point of view is portrayed from a cockpit of either a Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, depending on the side chosen. During the dogfight sequence, the number of Luftwaffe casualties will depend on how many aircraft the player was able to shoot down.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, MIT had {{acquired}} the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer, {{the successor to}} the TX-0, which also used a vector display system. The system's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that, like with the TX-0, the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs for the computer which were not directly academically related whenever {{it was not in}} use. In 1961-62, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen created the game Spacewar! on the PDP-1, inspired by science fiction books such as the Lensman series. The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer <b>installations</b> <b>in</b> American academic institutions, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV <b>installations</b> <b>in</b> Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
