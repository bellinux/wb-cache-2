The initial catalytic activity in lean NOx reduction of Cu-ZSM- 5 catalysts was not influenced by the formation of copper <b>hydroxyacetate,</b> but for both Cu-ZSM- 5 preparations a change of the nature of copper species was evidenced after temperature programmed reaction test at spark ignition engine exhaust. Similar modifications were found for Co-ZSM- 5 samples after catalytic test at the exhaust of a methane fuelled engine.

In both the cases a mixture of hexacyanoferrate(II) and hexacyanoferrate(III) ions {{was found to be}} intercalated in the anionic clay. The mixed anion intercalated anionic clays could be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to get pure hexacyanoferrate(III) intercalated anionic clay.

In this thesis {{two different types of}} coatings for fused silica capillaries aimed to eliminate such interactions have been studied. The first is a covalent, electroosmosis-free coating with polyacrylamide (PAA) and the second involves a non-covalent coating with the quaternary ammonium compound N, N-didodecyl –N, N- dimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) with a strong anodic electroosmosis. Optimal conditions regarding efficiency and resolution were established by variations of the composition and ionic strengths of buffers at pH below the isoelectric point of the proteins. To achieve high efficiency and resolution the choice of buffer constituents was extremely important. The PAA coating was very stable at neutral and acidic conditions. Ammonium acetate (0. 12 M) and ammonium <b>hydroxyacetate</b> (0. 15 M) both at pH 4 provided the best separations with plate numbers up to 1 700 000 plate/m that is among the highest reported in the literature. Capillaries coated with DDAB were stable enough to, without recoating, permit consecutive separations of the proteins up to 9 hours (90 injections). High apparent efficiencies (over 1 million plates/m) were achieved with ammonium acetate (0. 07 M), ammonium <b>hydroxyacetate</b> (0. 08 M) and sodium phosphate (0. 1 M) at pH 4. Zone broadening was studied by determination of the variance contributions from all main parameters. Significant variances were contributions from longitudinal diffusion, capillary curvature, injection plug, detector time response and detector slit width while other variances, e. g., variances for Joule heat and vertical sedimentation were negligible. The remaining undetermined variance may have its origin in all types of relatively slow interactions including adsorption onto the capillary surfaces and protein-buffer component interactions. The results indicate that the latter is the main cause to zone broadening in protein separations...|$|E

40|$|When polyelectrolyte-neutral block {{copolymers}} {{are mixed}} in solutions to oppositely charged species (e. g. surfactant micelles, macromolecules, proteins etc), {{there is the}} formation of stable supermicellar aggregates combining both components. The resulting colloidal complexes exhibit a core-shell structure and the mechanism yielding to their formation is electrostatic self-assembly. In this contribution, {{we report on the}} structural properties of supermicellar aggregates made from yttrium-based inorganic nanoparticles (radius 2 nm) and polyelectrolyte-neutral block copolymers in aqueous solutions. The yttrium <b>hydroxyacetate</b> particles were chosen as a model system for inorganic colloids, and also for their use in industrial applications as precursors for ceramic and opto-electronic materials. The copolymers placed under scrutiny are the water soluble and asymmetric poly(sodium acrylate) poly(acrylamide) diblocks. Using static and dynamical light scattering experiments, we demonstrate the analogy between surfactant micelles and nanoparticles in the complexation phenomenon with oppositely charged polymers. We also determine the sizes and the aggregation numbers of the hybrid organic-inorganic complexes. Several additional properties are discussed, such as the remarkable stability of the hybrid aggregates and the dependence of their sizes on the mixing conditions.

30|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) with {{a direct}} wide band gap of 3.37  eV {{and a large}} {{excitation}} binding energy of 60  meV has attracted great attention in recent years, owing to its applications in photocatalysts, solar cells, and electrical and optical devices [1 – 10]. ZnO has extremely abundant nanostructures, such as nanospheres, nanorods, nanowires, and nanoflowers [11 – 16]. Various synthesis methods have been utilized to produce ZnO nanostructures [17 – 22]. Among these methods, solution-based polyol process exhibits splendid advantages in preparing inorganic compounds (metal, oxide, <b>hydroxyacetate)</b> due to the unique solvents’ characteristics, such as high boiling point (up to 250  °C) and complexing, reducing, and surfactant properties, {{in addition to their}} amphiprotic character [23 – 25]. In the past decades, ZnO nanoparticles with various sizes and morphologies derived from the polyol-mediated approach have been studied extensively. The processing parameters of polyol, reaction temperature and concentration, anion, hydrolysis or alkaline ratio, and additive have great influence on the size and morphology of ZnO particles [11 – 31]. The spherical oxide particles with the size of 20 – 500  nm are frequent morphologies when using ethylene glycol (EG) as solvent and Zn(OAc) 2 · 2 H 2 O as Zn source [23, 28, 30].

40|$|Porphyrinoids are macrocyclic molecules, {{of which}} porphyrins and phthalocyanines are {{examples}} of. Porphyrins {{share the same}} basic pyrrolic ring structure, as hemin and chlorophyll, where the four pyrroles are joined by methine bridges. They are all found in nature, whereas phthalocyanines and porphyrazines are purely synthetic compounds. The difference between porphyrazines and porphyrins is the aza-bridges that connect the pyrroles. The literature review explains the history of research of porphyrins and phthalocyanines in detail. Several synthetic methods are described for both chromophores. The high-yield condensation method for synthesizing porphyrins, developed by Lindsey et al., is reported. Lindsey method is a two step-one flask synthesis, where an aldehyde and pyrrole upon acid catalysis are tetramerizing into a porphyrinogen molecule, which is further oxidized into porphyrin. This method is suitable for mixed condensations, where the two different aldehydes A and B are first mixed in statistical proportions, e. g. 3 and 1, with pyrrole in a dry solvent, followed by the second step - oxidation of the porphyrinogen into porphyrin. For phthalocyanines the general synthetic steps are first described briefly, followed by a closer look on the synthetic steps of preparing unsymmetrical phthalocyanines, e. g. AB 3, with three different methods; statistical condensation, synthesis via subphthalocyanine and solid-phase method. The Results and Discussion part of this Thesis shows extensive experimental work for preparation of both porphyrin- and phthalocyanine chromophores with <b>hydroxyacetate</b> tethers. Porphyrin synthesis required seven intermediate steps and products. Preparing the linkers for the phthalocyanine were attempted with two different pathways; one-step and three-step method. The final products and all the intermediate products were characterized by NMR and mass spectra...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the basic factors which govern the microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) and micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) separation of Hematoporphyrin ID and its base hydrolysis product, hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD), was performed. These model compounds contain a complex mixture of porphyrin monomers, dimers and/or oligomers, and were utilized to gain insights into the MEEKC/micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) separation of samples containing highly lipophilic substances. For example, the organic modifier/cosurfactant (1 -butanol) and/or oil phase (e. g., 1 -octanol in comparison to ethyl acetate) {{were found to have}} an apparent influence on the separation selectivity of Hematoporphyrin D, the extent of which was dependent on the chemical nature of the surfactant employed (e. g., sodium dodecyl sulfate vs. sodium cholate). An interesting and important finding was that the presence of an organic modifier (methanol or acetonitrile at a concentration of 20 % or higher) in the sample matrix {{as well as in the}} run buffer was essential for the optimal MEEKC or MEKC separation of a number of porphyrin monomers (including hernatoporphyrin IX and its acetates, most likely <b>hydroxyacetate,</b> diacetate, and vinyl acetate, as well as its dehydration products, hydroxyethylvinyl-deuteroporphyrin and protoporphyrin) contained in Hernatoporphyrin D. On the other hand, the use of these optimized conditions for the MEEKC or MEKC separation of various oligomeric porphyrin species in HpD were unsatisfactory. As HpD is a well-known and effective photosensitizing agent in photodynamic therapy (a new approach for cancer treatment), the improved separation and characterization of various monomeric and oligomeric porphyrin species in HpD and its starting material, such as Hernatoporphyrin D, is a challenging and important task...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Long lived radioactive species such as 129 I‾ and 99 TcO 4 ‾ are formed as by-products of nuclear fission. These species have extremely long half-lives (1. 5 million and 211, 000 years respectively), are biologically assimilating and due to their anionic nature, can move freely within a geosphere. Historical disposal methods for active species are no longer considered acceptable {{to the general public}} and other ways in which to treat the waste are being explored. One remove and concentrate method to remove radioactive species from the biosphere is using alkaline-resistant materials which trap active species that can be encapsulated in a high pH concrete matrix. Layered hydroxides and layered double salts which consist of positively charged layers between which exchangeable anions and water molecules lie are good candidates for these materials due to the basic conditions in which they form. The synthesis, anion exchange properties and stability of copper, lanthanum, nickel and zinc hydroxysalts have been investigated. The structures consist of layers of edge-sharing metal hydroxide octahedra together with an interlayer space containing the anion and in some cases water molecules. Products were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy to confirm the identity of structure of the material formed and the anion incorporated. Only Cu 2 (OH) 3 (NO 3), Cu 2 (OH) 3 (OAc). H 2 O, Ni 2 (OH) 3 (NO 3) and Zn 5 (OH) 3 (NO 3). 2 H 2 O consistently exhibited exchange capabilities with iodide as the target anion. In terms of exchange rate and efficiency, copper <b>hydroxyacetate</b> is a more suitable precursor as equilibrium is achieved in 10 mins; whereas other LHS containing nitrate as the occupying require longer than 1 day to reach equilibrium.

Exposure to divalent anions (CO 32 -, Cr 2 O 42 -, SeO 3 -) resulted in no interaction whereas exposure to trivalent PO 43 - forms Cu 3 (PO 4) 2.

40|$|Atmospheric {{corrosion}} {{takes place}} on most metals as they interact with thesurrounding environment. A degradation of the metal is the common result,which often leads to a shortened lifespan of the material. Hence, knowledge onthe fundamental interaction between a gas containing corrosive constituentsand a metal surface, which is {{the starting point of}} atmospheric corrosion, isimportant in many contexts. As the nature of atmospheric corrosion is inherentlycomplex, it imposes demands on the analytical studies that are neededin order to understand the fundamentals on a molecular level. Consequently,in-situ vibrational techniques, providing molecular information, have beenutilized in this work to study atmospheric corrosion by targeting the initialstages of the interaction between corrosive air and a metal surface. The initialstages (from minutes until days of exposure) were studied as these havea large influence on the atmospheric corrosion for prolonged exposure times. More specifically, the interaction between humidified air to which organicacids were added, and zinc was targeted in order to address a situation inindoor atmospheric corrosion, where organic acids are of importance. Zinc isa constituent in e. g. brass, which is an alloy used in many indoor applications. A systematic investigation utilizing complementary acting vibrational techniquesthus enabled detailed information on the mechanisms of the onsetof atmospheric corrosion of zinc induced by acetic and formic acid. Corrosionproducts of both two dimensional and three dimensional character couldbe separately studied by combining VSFS (interface sensitive), IRAS (nearsurfacesensitive), and CRM (bulk sensitive). The Zn surface was found to be heterogeneous with different hydroxylgroups present on the surface. As this surface was exposed to formic or aceticacid, the OH groups on the surface were rapidly displaced in a ligand exchangewith formate or acetate. These ligands, organised in two dimensionalstructures, promoted corrosion by weakening the bonds of the Zn atoms totheir surrounding matrix. The subsequent growth of three dimensional corrosion products, Zn <b>hydroxyacetate</b> and formate, observed within short exposure times of Zn exposedto acetic and formic acid, was found to be electrochemical in nature. Cathodic areas consisting of more crystalline ZnO were observed. The potentialdifference between these more noble areas on the surface and those of lessnoble character created an electrochemical cell, initiating release of Zn ionsinto the aqueous adlayer in the anodic reactions. These Zn ions precipitatedas localised corrosion products. The cathodic areas increased the local pHon the surface, thereby promoting precipitation in their vicinity. The resultson initial stages of this type of corrosion were found to have similarities withprevious field studies of Zn exposed to real indoor environments. One way to decrease the corrosion rate of zinc is by adsorbing a corrosioninhibitor to the metal surface in order to protect it. As a model for sucha corrosion inhibitor, octadecanethiol (CH 3 (CH 2) 17 SH) was seen to provideincreased corrosion protection of both reduced and oxidised Zn substrates byforming an adsorbed surface layer with an ordered structure.
