2500|$|The DPP and the Pan-Green Coalition has {{routinely}} claimed {{there was}} a potential compromise on Taiwan's national security should there be liberal three links, suggesting the PRC could disguise troop carriers as commercial aircraft to invade Taiwan, a charge met by criticism from both the PRC and the Pan-Blue Coalition. In the wake of 13 June 2008 agreements, the DPP {{raised the issue of}} national security again, criticising its plans to open up to eight airports when China would open only five. The eight airports included Hualien and Taitung, which also operate as military airfields, thus creating a security threat. They also expressed concern over the possibility of absconding Chinese tourists. A defense ministry report on 18 May 2008 concluded that direct charter flights would be a national security threat, and the air force has reportedly expressed concern that six of the airports except the Taiwan Taoyuan and Kaohsiung airports have military installations and aircraft. The Vice Minister of National Defense Lin Chen-yi has further recommended to maintain indirect flight routes via a third party’s air space on 23 May 2008. But on 18 June 2008, the Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min declared that direct flights without the involvement of any third party air space would not pose a threat to national security, saying [...] "The final routes for direct charter <b>flights</b> <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> decided by the Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{air traffic}} {{in the next few}} years and limited capacities at airports, a main key factor of operating an airport is the aircraft traffic mix. General Aviation is a very special and individual part of the air traffic and will continue operating at many airports in the future. Therefore processes of General Aviation compared to scheduled <b>flights</b> <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> analysed and differences derived. The main goals of this paper are to examine if and how there are influences between scheduled air traffic and General Aviation and under which certain conditions General Aviation flights are sense full to consider in (pre-) tactical planning phases at airports. A survey addressing private and commercial pilots of GA is carried out to gain necessary knowledge of their procedures and to identify gaps in data transfer or communication between airport stakeholders. Further, real flight data from a typical medium sized airport are used to determine possible interactions of GA flights with commercial flights. To match these preliminary findings airports are asked exemplarily to state their experiences on this topic. First results indicate missing or only short-term generated information of General Aviation flights from the airport’s point of view compared to scheduled airline flights. An exchange of information between air traffic control, airport companies and service providers is rarely established. It seems it might be only a small segment of General Aviation flights which are affected in this kind of problems at all, and, it might be shown there are great season, week and even day dependencies existing. Nevertheless, results show in some situations it makes sense to optimize the data sharing between the above-mentioned parties to enhance the airport’s processes and allow to adapt the pilot’s arrival or departure time to low demand times in the preflight planning phase already...|$|R

40|$|MINI-IRENE is the Flight Demonstrator (FD) of IRENE, a new-concept capsule with a {{variable}} geometry, originally conceived by ASI {{to widen the}} range of available platforms to retrieve payloads and/or data from low Earth orbit. The main characteristics of IRENE is the “umbrella-like" deployable front structure that reduces the capsule ballistic coefficient, leading to acceptable heat fluxes, mechanical loads, stability and final descent velocity. The feasibility study of the IRENE deployable re-entry system {{has been carried out}} in 2011. The TPS materials, selected for the nose cone and for the flexible umbrella shield, have preliminarily been tested in the SPES hypersonic wind tunnel at the University of Naples, and in the SCIROCCO Plasma Wind Tunnel at CIRA. Such successful tests and the preliminary experimental results proved the concept feasibility and the viability of commercial materials for lowcost re-entry nacelles. After the preparation phases A and B were successfully completed, the European Space Agency funded the current phase of the program. The object is to design and built a Flight Demonstrator and a Ground Demonstrator to prove, with a suborbital flight and with a Plasma Wind Tunnel (PWT) test campaign, the functionality of the deployable heat shield. The <b>Flight</b> Demonstrator <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> included as a secondary payload in the interstage adapter of a VSB- 30 launcher from ESRANGE. It <b>shall</b> then <b>be</b> ejected during the ascent phase of the payload section, after its separation from the booster at an altitude of about 150 km, perform a 15 minutes ballistic flight, re-enter the atmosphere and hit the ground.
