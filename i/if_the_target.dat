5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of the array with the target value. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> value matches the middle element, {{its position in the}} array is returned. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> value is less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the array, respectively, eliminating the other half from consideration.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> {{value is}} greater than the {{greatest}} value in the array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar problem will occur <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> value is smaller than the least value in the array and the first index of the array is the smallest representable value of R. In particular, this means that R must not be an unsigned type if the array starts with index 0.|$|E
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> was obscured.|$|E

5|$|As the Mongols of the Ilkhanate {{continued}} {{to move towards}} the Holy Land, city after city fell to the Mongols. The typical Mongol pattern was to give a region one chance to surrender. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> acquiesced, the Mongols absorbed the populace and warriors into their own Mongol army, which they would then use to further expand the empire. If a community did not surrender, the Mongols forcefully took the settlement or settlements and slaughtered everyone they found. Faced with the option of subjugation to or combat with the nearby Mongol horde, many communities chose the former, including some Christian realms.|$|E
5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi {{does not}} respond to prey if the light is under 100lux (like a {{restaurant}} with only subdued artificial lighting), but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E

5|$|One way of {{clustering}} {{a set of}} {{data points}} in a metric space into two clusters is to choose the clusters {{in such a way}} as to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This is preferable to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the {{electrical}} safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works {{in the south and}} the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E

Moored-3 (Mao-3) is a mine with contact wires so that targets would not have to strike the mine itself for detonation, and the mine can be detonated some distance away, still causing enough damage <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is within range and comes in contact with the contact wire.

40|$|When two targets (T 1, T 2) are {{presented}} amongst a rapid stream of distractors, T 2 accuracy is impaired <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> {{are separated by}} at least one distractor (attentional blink). However, this impairment largely disappears <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> follow one another directly (lag- 1 sparing), and, in fact, as many as four or five consecutive targets may be identified quite accurately under these conditions (extended sparing). Although all current models propose a common mechanism for both lag- 1 and extended sparing, this hypothesis has yet to be tested. To this end, we examined the effect of various types of attentional switches, known to impact lag- 1 sparing, on extended sparing in order to determine whether they would have a similar effect. Results suggested substantial parallels between the two types of sparing. We discuss these results in terms of a unified account of sparing in temporal object perception...|$|R
25|$|Another cross-site {{vulnerability}} is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser {{into taking}} actions the user didn't intend at a target site (like transferring {{money at a}} bank). It works because, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> site relies only on cookies to authenticate requests, then requests initiated by code on the attacker's site will carry the same legitimate login credentials as requests initiated by the user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and {{not only in the}} cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.|$|E

A radio direction finder (DF or RDF) from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings.) To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> was moving, the detections must be close {{to one another in}} time. To plot the task force's course with certainty, at least four such detections must have been made in proper time-pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means.
