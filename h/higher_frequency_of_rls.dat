40|$|Objective: Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a chronic}} disorder {{characterized by an}} urge to move the legs. In the present study, we investigated the frequency of RLS in patients with psoriasis and tried to obtain the effects of RLS on sleep quality and psychiatric wellbeing. Methods: A total of 114 consecutive psoriasis patients (60 women and 54 men) and 67 control subjects who attended the Department of Dermatology and Venereology {{were enrolled in the}} study. A diagnosis of RLS was made according to the criteria of the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG), and severity was assessed using the IRLSSG severity scale. Sixty-seven of 114 patients answered the Turkish version of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: We found a <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>RLS</b> in psoriasis patients (11. 4...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the frequency of}} restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) in Petrópolis, Brazil, and investigate associations between the syndrome and: demographic characteristics, biochemical variables and comorbidities. METHOD: A cross-sectional study in which we interviewed 176 patients on dialytic therapy based on criteria elaborated by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group, and compared data of patients with and without RLS. RESULTS: The frequency was 14. 8 %. There {{were no significant differences}} between the two groups in demographic and biochemical variables investigated (iron, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone, hemoglobin, calcium, phosphate). We found no association between RLS and the most common comorbidities, except for chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) (OR = 3. 84, p < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: In the studied population RLS is a common disorder, and is not associated with the investigated biochemical abnormalities. A <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>RLS</b> in subjects with CGN is a finding that needs further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Background: Tuberculosis (TB) in elderly is a {{worldwide}} problem. Objective: To evaluate differences in clinical, radiological, laboratory features, adverse antituberculosis drug reactions and TB-related mortality in elderly and young pulmonary TB patients. Results: The study included {{analysis of the}} medical history, chest radiographic and laboratory findings in 124 elderly and 124 young pulmonary TB patients, with mean age of 60. 5  ±  9. 1 and 31. 6  ±  10. 8  years, respectively (p <  0. 0001), and comparable male predominance. There were <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea, anorexia, weight loss, weakness and mental changes in elderly than young (p= 0. 001, 0. 004,  <  0. 0001,  <  0. 0001, 0. 002, respectively) while there were <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> cough and sputum production, hemoptysis, and fever in young than elderly (p= 0. 008, 0. 01, 0. 04, respectively) patients. Elderly had <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> comorbidities (p <  0. 0001). Elderly had <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> atypical radiological findings for pulmonary tuberculosis and initial misdiagnosis as pneumonia and lung cancer (p <  0. 0001, 0. 001, 0. 01, respectively). Elderly had {{a higher level of}} erythrocytic sedimentation rate (p = . 01). Young had a <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> positive sputum direct smear for acid fast bacilli (p =  0. 04). Elderly had a higher role for fiberoptic bronchoscope in diagnosis of pulmonary TB (p =  0. 001). There was a delay in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in elderly (p <  0. 0001) patients. Anti-tuberculosis drug side effects and TB-related mortality were more frequent in elderly (p <  0. 0001, 0. 03, respectively) patients. Conclusion: This study showed that elderly pulmonary TB patients had <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> atypically clinical, radiological presentations, co-morbidities, anti-tuberculosis drug adverse reactions and TB related mortality...|$|R
