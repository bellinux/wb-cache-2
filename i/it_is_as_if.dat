As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

25|$|Atoms in {{the first}} excited state may also be re-ionized by the ambient CMB photons {{before they reach the}} ground state.

25|$|Statutes {{and common}} law rules that are {{declared}} unconstitutional are void ab initio (from the beginning) – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they never existed.

To overcome this problem, the Court of Appeal may apply the doctrine of prospective overruling to preserve the state of law prior to the date when the unconstitutional law is overruled.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s through the 1970s, she {{abandoned}} painting, {{and focused on}} working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean's or moon's surface, the insides of shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, {{a master of the}} pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter's an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and the choice is apparently unimportant. This is of course not the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.|$|E
25|$|However, Alexander Grosart {{denies that}} Henry Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. There are moments {{in when the}} reader can {{identify}} Vaughan's true self, rather than an imitation of Herbert. In such passages Vaughan is seen to demonstrate naturalness, immediacy and ability to relate the concrete through poetry. In some instances, Vaughan derives observations from Herbert's language that are distinctly his own. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herbert's work, yet makes it completely unique to himself. Vaughan takes another step away from Herbert in his manner of presenting his poetry. Herbert in The Temple, which is most often the source of comparison between the two writers, lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with the attitude of Vaughan, who saw the experience of reading as the best guide to his meanings and promoted no special reading method.|$|E
25|$|Leigh Fermor {{translated}} the manuscript The Cretan Runner written by George Psychoundakis, a dispatch runner on Crete during the war, and helped Psychoundakis get his work published. Fermor also wrote a novel, The Violins of Saint-Jacques, which was adapted as an opera by Malcolm Williamson. His friend Lawrence Durrell, in Bitter Lemons (1957), recounts how, during the Cypriot insurgency against continued British rule in 1955, Leigh Fermor visited Durrell's villa in Bellapais, Cyprus: After a splendid dinner {{by the fire}} he starts singing, songs of Crete, Athens, Macedonia. When I go out to refill the ouzo bottle...I find the street completely filled with people listening in utter silence and darkness. Everyone seems struck dumb. 'What is it?'

500|$|The {{majority}} of the population was Christian and was to remain so until the conquest of Saladin in 1187. The Muslim conquest apparently had little impact on social and administrative continuities for several decades. The word 'Arab' at the time referred predominantly to Bedouin nomads, though Arab settlement is attested in the Judean highlands and near Jerusalem by the 5th century, and some tribes had converted to Christianity. The local population engaged in farming, which was considered demeaning, and were called Nabaț, referring to Aramaic-speaking villagers. A ḥadīth, brought {{in the name of a}} Muslim freedman who settled in Palestine, ordered the Muslim Arabs not to settle in the villages, [...] "for he who abides in villages <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he abides in graves".|$|E
500|$|A {{focal point}} of Hazlitt's account of Troilus and Cressida is a {{comparison}} of the characterisation in this play and that in Chaucer's poem Troilus and Criseyde (one of Shakespeare's sources). Chaucer's characters are full and well developed; but Chaucer unfolded each character in itself, one at a time. Shakespeare displayed characters as they see themselves as well as how others see them, and showed the effects each has on the others. Shakespeare's characters were so distinctive that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> each were expressed by a distinct [...] "faculty" [...] of his mind; and, in effect, these faculties could be considered as showing [...] "excessive sociability", notable for [...] "how they gossiped and compared notes together." [...] Twentieth-century critic Arthur Eastman thought that, although these remarks did insufficient justice to Chaucer, they were particularly original in revealing [...] "the sophisticated genius of Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, reviewers {{have been}} put off by Agârbiceanu's plot devices and epic mannerisms, and in {{particular}} by his explanatory comments and notes, which they deem superfluous and distracting. As Lovinescu notes, Agârbiceanu and other Transylvanian realists will [...] "accumulate in details", but will remain [...] "incapable of narrating {{on more than one}} level": [...] "for all their dynamism, his sketches are not exciting in the dramatic sense." [...] The moralizing aspect of Agârbiceanu's fiction makes it hard to separate between it and his purely theological productions: as Lovinescu notes, whenever Agârbiceanu depicts village drunks, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] "for an anti-saloon exhibition." [...] Dragomirescu argues that Agârbiceanu's work amounts to a set of humanitarian [...] "directives", although, he concludes, its depiction of [...] "the bleak and mystical recess of life" [...] is a fine literary contribution, [...] "rising above" [...] his generation's. He states: [...] "Agârbiceanu is a socializing Poporanist or Sămănătorist only when he is at his weakest".|$|E

500|$|We {{as readers}} or {{audience}} appreciate the characters {{by the force}} of our imagination's seeming to participate in the scene, as if we were present during such an event in real life. Commenting on the scene in Julius Caesar where Caesar confides to Marc Antony his apprehensions about Cassius, Hazlitt writes: [...] "We know hardly any passage more expressive of the genius of Shakespeare than this. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had been actually present, had known the different characters and what they thought of one another, and had taken down what he heard and saw, their looks, words, and gestures, just as they happened." [...] In [...] "Hamlet", he observes that [...] "the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. [...] The whole play is an exact transcript of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|While Christian theologians {{held that}} the natural world {{was part of an}} unchanging {{designed}} hierarchy, some theologians speculated that the world might have developed through natural processes. Thomas Aquinas went even farther than Augustine of Hippo in arguing that scriptural texts like Genesis should not be interpreted in a literal way that conflicted with or constrained what natural philosophers learned about the workings of the natural world. He saw that the autonomy of nature was a sign of God's goodness, and detected no conflict between a divinely created universe and the idea that the universe had developed over time through natural mechanisms. However, Aquinas disputed the views of those (like the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles) who held that such natural processes showed that the universe could have developed without an underlying purpose. Aquinas rather held that: [...] "Hence, it is clear that nature is nothing but a certain kind of art, i.e., the divine art, impressed upon things, by which these things are moved to a determinate end. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the shipbuilder were able to give to timbers that by which they would move themselves to {{take the form of a}} ship." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of the book drew mixed reactions, with Toronto Star's Kim Hughs describing it as [...] "the novel's most defining feature and its most exasperating conceit". She believed that Pari {{was meant to be}} the protagonist of the story but that the shifting focus on the numerous other personalities left her [...] "barely [...] through the clutter". The Independent's Arifa Akbar stated, [...] "The changing points of view and leaps in time can confuse and confine, leaving characters clearly defined but lacking depth. Decades gallop by and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the story of these interconnected, cross -generational lives will simply go on echoing the original crime of Abdullah and Pari's separation." [...] Michiko Kakutani from The New York Times thought the novella-like storytelling was handled well and wrote, [...] "Khaled Hosseini's new novel, And the Mountains Echoed, may have the most awkward title in his body of work, but it's his most assured and emotionally gripping story yet, more fluent and ambitious than The Kite Runner (2003), more narratively complex than A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007)." [...] Kamal agreed, saying that the structure was [...] "exquisitely crafted". Scoop Empires Sherine El Banhawy added that the focus on multiple characters allowed to readers {{to gain a better understanding}} of the diversities of Afghan culture.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{national}} Muslim {{organizations and}} individual imams, such as Council on American–Islamic Relations, Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), and Islamic Circle of North America issued statements condemning {{the attack and}} offering sympathy for the victims.
