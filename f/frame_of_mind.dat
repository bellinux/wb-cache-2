5|$|Andrew Garfield as Sebastião Rodrigues (based on Giuseppe Chiara, {{who later}} in the film {{goes by the name}} Okada San'emon). In interviews, Garfield has spoken of his {{extensive}} year-long preparation for the role with James Martin, a practicing Jesuit priest working in New York. Garfield detailed that the preparation with Martin included extensive research and immersion in the Jesuit lifestyle and <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> which was felt to be essential to the accuracy of the film by the producers. Garfield, who is of slight to medium frame, reported losing 40 pounds to play the role following the rules of abstention which were outlined to him by Martin.|$|E
5|$|While {{the central}} plot is a murder mystery, the initial idea {{was of a}} writer with PTSD who cannot write and is instead {{fronting}} for his blacklisted best friend. Throughout the series, Brubaker switched between first- and third-person narration because it allowed him to tell a broader story. He was also {{trying to create a}} layered story that would reward repeated reading, so he avoided extraneous details. When writing the scripts, Brubaker listened to music from the 1940s to stay in the right <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{the issue of}} his playing future, Miller was back in a good <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> for the Fourth Test in Adelaide. In a high-scoring match, Miller took a wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. England batted first and had reached a strong position of 4/320 {{on the second day}} when Miller bowled Joe Hardstaff junior, who edged a bouncer into his stumps for 67, ending a partnership of 118 with centurion Compton; the hosts lost wickets steadily thereafter to be dismissed for 460, and Miller ended with 1/45 from 16 overs in extreme heat. After Morris and Hassett put on 179 runs for the third wicket, Miller came in at 3/207 late on the third day and reached 33 by the time stumps were drawn with Australia at 4/293, while his partner Johnson was unbeaten on 35.|$|E

5|$|Zimmer wrote {{several hours}} of music, and an {{abundance}} of different themes, before Malick started to shoot the film. The director played the music on the set, while filming, to get himself, {{and the rest of}} the crew and actors in the right <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> The official soundtrack features tracks that were not used on the film and some tracks from the film are not found on the CD. The film features several pieces of Melanesian choral music sung by the Choir of All Saints in Honiara, only one of which is featured on the soundtrack. However, another soundtrack was released containing several tracks from the Choir, which has since gone out of circulation.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E
5|$|Off the pitch, Miller privately {{decided that}} he would not honour his Rawtenstall contract. He {{secretly}} accepted an offer to relocate to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman and play cricket. Back in a good <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> for the Fourth Test in Adelaide, Miller took one wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. After England had made 460, Miller came in at 3/207, and was 23 not out by the close of the second day. He hit the first ball of the next day for six, and accumulated 67 runs in the opening 71 minutes, to reach his maiden Test century. The Englishmen utilised leg theory to prevent easy scoring, but as the tail began to be dismissed, Miller accelerated, launching drives into the crowd, despite the presence of four men on the fence. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 but the match petered out into a high-scoring draw. Before the last Test, Miller played for Victoria against England, taking 4/65.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of evaluative devices in narratives of Cantonese speaking children. The evaluative devices include: a) <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> b) negative qualifiers, c) hedges, d) character's speech, and e) causal connectors. A 24 -pictured story-book was used to elicit narrative. Four groups of Cantonese- speaking subjects were recruited: five-, seven-, nine-year-old children and University undergraduate students. A quantitative comparison revealed that (i) there is {{significant increase in the}} use <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> negative qualifiers and causal connectors across age. (ii) Pattern of evaluative devices used by five- year-old children {{is similar to that of}} the seven-year-old children. While adults and nine-year-old children form unique pattern in the use of different evaluative devices. These findings are discussed with cognitive, linguistic and pragmatic achievements. ...|$|R

25|$|However, other {{evidence}} was interpreted as suggesting that DNA was structurally uninteresting and possibly just a molecular scaffold for the apparently more interesting protein molecules.

X-ray crystallography theoretically offered the opportunity to reveal the molecular structure of large molecules like proteins and DNA, but there were serious technical problems then preventing X-ray crystallography from being applicable to such large molecules.|$|E
5000|$|Liam Hudson (1933-2005) was a British social {{psychologist}} and author.

50|$|Howard Gardner {{proposed}} in <b>Frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> (Gardner 1983/1994) that intellectual giftedness {{may be present}} in areas other than the typical intellectual realm. The concept of multiple intelligences (MI) makes the field aware of additional potential strengths and proposes a variety of curricular methods. Gardner argued that there are eight intelligences, or different areas in which people assimilate or learn about the world around them: interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, naturalistic, and spatial-visual.|$|R

I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
25|$|Feminist history {{combines}} {{the search for}} past female scholars with a modern feminist perspective on how history is affected by them. While many mistake it as women’s history, feminist history does not solely focus on the retelling of history from a woman’s perspective. Rather, it is interpreting history with a feminist <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> It is also {{not to be confused}} with the history of feminism, which recounts the history of the feminist movements. Feminist historians, instead, include “cultural and social investigations” in the job description. Feminist history came into being as women began writing accounts of their own and other women’s lives. A few of these, such as Susan B. Anthony and Audre Lorde, documented histories of their feminist movements. Afterword, a fever drove women onward to be historically minded and create women’s archives.|$|E
25|$|The {{band played}} {{sporadic}} shows {{to support the}} album, which was well-reviewed in UK, but EMI Australia did little to assist them. Without such backing, it was clear {{by the end of}} 1971 that {{they were not going to}} achieve the success they had dreamt of. Although Keays' recollections are more positive, Wheatley's own account of the album sessions is that they were an unhappy experience for him. He had a bad LSD trip the night before they went into the studio and began the recording in a negative <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> Tensions mounted steadily during the recording and Wheatley did not play on some of the tracks, with his parts covered by Ford. According to Keays, Wheatley had been working part-time at a management agency over the previous few months and had insufficient time to rehearse because of his day job.|$|E

To orientate the reader the book starts with an overview of analytical psychology and how it has been used to analyze films.

25|$|Moreton, however, is not unconcerned of the {{situation}} of the decent poor people and vagrants, so he suggests that barracks or barns should be built at convenient ends of the town, where all vagrants should be obliged to render themselves at a stated hour, where they should have clean straw allowed them, and be kept orderly and out of harm's way; they may be let loose if they have apparent means of honest livelihood, otherwise they should be sent to the workhouse of their respective parish, or to a general workhouse, of which there is great need; and of which more hereafter. This proposition can be valued as an hint of the eighteenth-century ambivalent <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> towards these individuals. On one hand restrictions and penalties were vigorously demanded by the English society. On the other hand, not only some kinds of begging activities were allowed but, common people strongly felt a social and religious obligation to give something or to answer a plea.|$|E

To his surprise, she begins {{to talk to him}} very earnestly about duels and how to load a pistol. They are interrupted by General Yepanchin who wants Myshkin to walk with him. Aglaya slips a note into Myshkin's hand as they leave. The General is greatly agitated by the effect Nastassya Filippovna's behavior is having on his family, particularly since her information about Yevgeny Pavlovich's uncle {{has turned out to be}} completely correct. When the General leaves, Myshkin reads Aglaya's note, which is an urgent request to meet her secretly the following morning. His reflections are interrupted by Keller who has come to offer to be his second at the duel that will inevitably follow from the incident that morning, but Myshkin merely laughs heartily and invites Keller to visit him to drink champagne. Keller departs and Rogozhin appears. He informs the Prince that Nastassya Filippovna wants to see him and that she has been in correspondence with Aglaya. She is convinced that the Prince is in love with Aglaya and is desperately seeking to bring them together. Myshkin is perturbed by the information, but he remains in an inexplicably happy <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> and speaks with forgiveness and brotherly affection to Rogozhin. Remembering it will be his birthday tomorrow, he persuades Rogozhin to join him for some wine.|$|E

The research focuses on the modifications applied to a parametric sign language synthesizer (based on phonetic descriptions of the signs). We propose some modifications that will allow for the synthesis <b>of</b> different perceived <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> within synthetic signed messages. Three of these proposals focus on modifications to three different signs' phonologic parameters (the hand shape, the movement and the non-hand parameter). The other two proposals focus on the temporal aspect of the synthesis (sign speed and transition duration) and the representation of muscular tension through inverse kinematics procedures. These resulting variations have been evaluated by Spanish deaf signers, who have concluded that our system can generate the same signed message with three different <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> which are correctly identified by Spanish Sign Language signers...|$|R
