500|$|The Beetons {{decided to}} revamp The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine, {{particularly}} the fashion column, which the historian Graham Nown describes as [...] "a rather drab piece". They travelled to Paris in March 1860 to meet Adolphe Goubaud, {{the publisher of}} the French magazine Le Moniteur de la Mode. The magazine carried a full-sized <b>dress</b> <b>pattern</b> outlined on a fold-out piece of paper for users to cut out and make their own dresses. The Beetons came to an agreement with Goubaud for the Frenchman to provide patterns and illustrations for their magazine. The first edition to carry the new feature appeared on 1 May, six weeks after the couple returned from Paris. For the redesigned magazine, Samuel was joined as editor by Isabella, who was described as [...] "Editress". As well as being co-editors, the couple were also equal partners. Isabella brought an efficiency and strong business acumen to Samuel's normally disorganised and financially wasteful approach. She joined her husband at work, travelling daily by train to the office, where her presence caused a stir among commuters, most of whom were male. In June 1860 Isabella and Samuel travelled to Killarney, Ireland, for a fortnight's holiday, leaving their son at home with his nurse. The Beetons enjoyed the sightseeing, although on the days it rained, they stayed inside their hotel and worked on the next edition of The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. Isabella was impressed with the food they were served, and wrote in her diary that the dinners were [...] "conducted in quite the French style".|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Construction {{workers in}} Hong Kong face high health risks of heat stress, solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation, and hazardous substances. A suitable work wear can lower exposure to these hazards, {{but the actual}} dressing behavior of construction workers remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: Thisstudy examines the current <b>dressing</b> <b>patterns</b> of construction workers and evaluates their limitations. METHODS: The <b>dressing</b> <b>patterns</b> of construction workers were investigated through unconcealed videotaped observation and questionnaire survey to enhance {{the reliability and validity}} of this research. RESULTS: Results indicate that construction workers were willing to wear short-sleeved shirts for a cooler feeling, although such <b>dressing</b> <b>patterns</b> may not protect them against solar ultraviolet radiation or hazardous substances. Their preferred dark-colored long pants can decrease the direct exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation and hazardous substances, but they absorb a large amount of radiation heat that increases the hazards of heat stress to the wearers. CONCLUSIONS: Thermal-related attributes were the most significant concerns of construction workers, which serve as key elements for designing appropriate work clothes for construction workers.
