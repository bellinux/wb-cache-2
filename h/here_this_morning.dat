60|$|MARY. [Giving him a match] D'you mind {{writing in}} <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> Dad? Your study hasn't been done. There's nobody but Cook.|$|E
60|$|Ser. Yes, please your worship; {{there was}} one <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> wanted to speak to you; he said his name was Corporal Breakbones.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{nice thing}} to do," [...] he {{went on in the}} same sneering manner. [...] "A man with {{business}} shouldn't come 'ere. You've tyken some poor man's breakfast <b>'ere</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> that's wot you've done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is an enemy, you say!" [...] cried Mr. Lawrence. [...] "Is that so? Yes, I saw him. He was <b>here</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and I {{chased him}} away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better, your Grace," [...] he answered, [...] "as I {{was saying}} to <b>this</b> gentleman <b>here,</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> He's cooler like and swings more level. I'd have known his touch on a gun anywhere, though." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Polly--my daughter--my child," [...] {{said the}} merchant, endeavoring {{to control his}} feelings; [...] "did she not come <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with Colonel Egerton?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Alone!' he said, 'and John <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning!</b> Is there {{anything}} the matter, my dear? But no,' he added, 'your face tells quite another story.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{young man}} arrived <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{pretending to be}} my nephew, James Crocker. He is an impostor. I want you to watch him very carefully." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is all nonsense, Clara," [...] said Mowbray. [...] "Lord Etherington calls <b>here</b> <b>this</b> very <b>morning,</b> {{and wishes}} {{to be made}} known to you. I expect you will receive him as a {{particular}} friend of mine." ...|$|R
5000|$|May 27 â€” [...] "Left <b>here</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> The {{route is}} a little broken today and the heat oppressive. Camped this night at a {{handsome}} little creek about 15 miles from {{the place where we}} stayed last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{do little}} else at Lavedan {{even when we}} are awake," [...] he grumbled. [...] "There was no reason why {{monsieur}} should rise." [...] Then, holding out a paper, [...] "Monsieur Stanislas de Marsac was <b>here</b> betimes <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with Mademoiselle his sister. He left this letter for you, monsieur." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. The {{party is}} to-night. He {{has been in}} <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{to tell me that}} he has seen his son, and they have fixed this evening.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{will not}} be surprised, sir, when I inform you that I have called <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> on behalf of my friend, Doctor Slammer, of the 97th.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder!" [...] Louise murmured. [...] "Did {{you know}} that that terrible man from the hills--John Strangewey's brother--has been <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning?</b> He frightened me almost to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Adieu, my adorable Sister: I am so tired, I cannot stir; {{having left}} on Tuesday night, or rather Wednesday morning at three o'clock, from a Ball at Monbijou, and arrived <b>here</b> <b>this</b> Friday <b>morning</b> at four. I {{recommend}} myself to your gracious remembrance; and am, {{for my own}} part, till death, dearest Sister,"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{you tell}} the men where to carry them," [...] she cried, [...] "and I will get the supper in no time! Betty Handshall stayed <b>here</b> until <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but she went away after dinner, for she was afraid if she stayed {{she would be in}} the way, not knowing how much help you would bring with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, it's {{all done}} {{as well as}} hands can do it," [...] said Zephaniah. [...] "Moses has been <b>here</b> since starlight <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and Moses has pretty good faculty about such matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! When I {{have done}} my breakfast," [...] said the Traveller, [...] "I'll go there. I came over <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{to find it}} out and see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] he said. [...] "My man of {{business}} will be <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{and he will}} attend to them. I will not detain you, Mr. Ducaine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good! I'm Gayes--Mr. Gayes of Gayes Brothers. My people {{wrote me}} last night from Leicester {{that you would be}} <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> You are crossing, aren't you, on the Elletania?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right. It does {{relate to}} him, and I {{will tell you}} directly;" [...] (resuming her work, and seeming {{resolved}} against looking up.) [...] "He has been <b>here</b> <b>this</b> very <b>morning,</b> on a most extraordinary errand. It is impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a subject,--to announce an attachment--" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Here</b> then, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> Lucia seated {{herself by}} the sundial, all in black, {{on a stone}} bench on which was carved the motto 'Come thou north wind, and blow thou south, that my garden spices may flow forth.' Sitting there with Pepino's poems and The Times she {{obscured}} about one-third of this text, and fat little Daisy would obscure the rest... " ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Snipper the Crossbill," [...] replied Jumper promptly. [...] "I haven't {{seen him}} yet this winter, but I {{know he is}} <b>here</b> because only <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I found some pine seeds on the snow under a certain tree." ...|$|R
60|$|DEAR FOLKS,--Arrived <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and am clear {{worn out}} with riding and {{climbing}} in {{and over and}} around this monstrous rock and its fortifications. Summer climate and very pleasant.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{beautiful}} starlight night,' said Mr Pecksniff, looking up. 'Behold the planets, {{how they}} shine! Behold the--those two persons who were <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> have left your house, I hope, Mrs Lupin?' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{got your}} {{letter of the}} 3rd of February <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> As I am off at seven to-morrow morning, I answer it at once, though indeed I have nothing to say.|$|E
60|$|We arrived <b>here</b> {{at seven}} <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and shall {{probably}} remain awaiting our mail, until {{four or five}} this afternoon. The weather in the passage here was delightful, and we had scarcely any motion beyond that of the screw.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{followed}} by a short silence. Miss Bertram began again. [...] "You seemed to enjoy your drive <b>here</b> very much <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I was glad to see you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad {{to see you}} <b>here</b> <b>this</b> fine <b>morning,</b> Miss Harleth," [...] said Lord Brackenshaw, {{a middle-aged}} peer of aristocratic {{seediness}} in stained pink, with easy-going manners which {{would have made the}} threatened deluge seem of no consequence. [...] "We shall have a first-rate run. A pity you didn't go with us. Have you ever tried your little chestnut at a ditch? you wouldn't be afraid, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{heard about}} the first business, but not about this matter of the jewels; except that {{he gave me a}} slight outline as we drove <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It is a curious business.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was not <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> sir," [...] responded the porter, {{somewhat}} reluctantly, [...] "but I'll ask Bill. Do you recollect, Bill, to {{have got}} a barrel from Bournemouth this morning containing specimens?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True; I can {{understand}} this, {{and have no}} difficulty in believing you now. But have you come <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> simply {{to let me know}} the danger which besets me from this quarter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I didn't {{know that}} nobody else comes fishing here, I should think that {{somebody}} had been <b>here</b> <b>this</b> very <b>morning</b> and caught all the fish or else frightened {{them so that they}} are all in hiding," [...] said he, as he trudged on to the next little pool. [...] "I never had such bad luck in all my life before. Hello! What's this?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Right halfback Dave Allerdice {{also took}} a beating in the game. He played the entire game despite {{breaking}} his collarbone early in the game. The Detroit Free Press wrote: [...] "When the students <b>here</b> learned <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that Allerdice, Michigan's fullback, had played the entire game with Pennsylvania yesterday with a broken collar bone, they could not comprehend that they had unconsciously witnessed the greatest act of heroism ever displayed on the gridiron." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} of that!" [...] was the answer. [...] "I made {{inquiries}} last night {{about the people who}} would most likely be consignees <b>here,</b> and <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I went to a house on Harbor Street,--Beaver & Hughes. This house, in a way, is the Jamaica agent of the owners. I got there before the office was open, but I didn't find out much. She delivered some cargo to them and had sailed on time!" ...|$|R
