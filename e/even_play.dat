5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of playing fields in the valleys, many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or <b>even</b> <b>play</b> on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded but many of the clubs survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{also participated}} in the first {{integrated}} bowl game in the Deep South. The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt {{should be allowed to}} play because he was black, and whether Georgia Tech should <b>even</b> <b>play</b> at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played which made the game the first integrated Sugar Bowl and the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the stadium}} was opened on time, the late sod {{was not the}} only issue on opening day. The stadium's seats, which had {{previously}} been installed in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived just in time. Construction of the backstop was still being completed on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the visiting Braves had concerns about the safety of playing on the quickly installed infield, initially refusing to <b>even</b> <b>play</b> on the surface. Left fielders complained about the extra-steep slope in left field that prevented them from seeing home plate. Only two women's restrooms and one men's restroom were functioning; a few portable toilets were also available.|$|E

25|$|Jackson was {{medically}} {{cleared to}} play Game Three, but manager Bob Lemon refused to start him or <b>even</b> <b>play</b> him, allegedly acting under orders from Steinbrenner. The Yankees lost that game and Jackson played {{the remainder of}} the series, hitting a home run in Game Four. However, they lost the last three games and the World Series to the Dodgers.|$|E
25|$|EA came {{furthermore}} under fire, as {{the game}} as released in 2013 required an internet connection to <b>even</b> <b>play</b> the singleplayer mode; however, reports surfaced that the internet connection requirement could be easily removed. According to a blog post in October 2013 by Maxis Emeryville General Manager, Patrick Buechner, the team was considering an offline mode, which would allow for mod support. An offline mode for SimCity was subsequently made available by EA in March 2014.|$|E

25|$|Bright's {{claim for}} {{national}} selection was helped by retirements of Ashley Mallet and Terry Jenner {{as well as}} the poor batting and fielding of rivals David Hourn and Jim Higgs. He was picked on the 1977 Tour of New Zealand. Kim Hughes was meant to be 12th man for the third test against Pakistan, but when he fell injured Ray Bright stepped in. There was some talk he might <b>even</b> <b>play</b> that game in tandem with Kerry O'Keefe but in the end Australia went with one spinner.|$|E
25|$|Waratah {{and some}} others claimed that the Australian rules {{resulted}} in a more exciting game, but the rugby authorities repeatedly rejected suggestions to switch codes or <b>even</b> <b>play</b> intercolonial matches under alternating rules against Victoria. In response, the proponents of the Australian game formed the NSW Football Association in 1880 and in 1881 the first Australian rules game between NSW and Victoria was played in Sydney. The NSWFA was small, {{with only a few}} clubs, including Waratah who switched code in 1882, and competition did not begin in earnest until 1889, when clubs competed for the Flanagan Cup. Having trouble gaining access to enclosed grounds, and therefore gate receipts, the association also had trouble with antagonism between its clubs, and it collapsed in 1893.|$|E
25|$|Following these premierships, Carlton {{went through}} a tumultuous period off-field. Some players had become {{frustrated}} by low payments and hard training standards, and responded by refusing to train or <b>even</b> <b>play</b> matches. The club removed Worrall from the coaching role (he retained the role of secretary), and after significant changes at board level after the 1909 season, Worrall left the club altogether. Many players who had supported Worrall left the club {{at the end of}} the season. Then, in 1910, several players were suspected of having taken bribes to fix matches, with two players (Alex Lang and Doug Fraser) both found guilty and suspended for 99 matches. Despite this backdrop, Carlton continued its strong on-field form, reaching the 1909 and 1910 Grand Finals, but losing both.|$|E

500|$|Even {{prior to}} Hanneman's death, King had {{expressed}} {{doubt as to}} who would <b>even</b> <b>play</b> on the album. He stated that if work on the album {{could be done in}} June 2013, then it was hoped that the album could be out by the following September or October. After Hanneman's passing, Holt was asked if he will be featured on the album, to which he replied that he would probably be playing some solos on the album, but {{that the rest of the}} guitar work would all be King. King later confirmed this sentiment, but explained that Holt would not be participating in any of the writing, noting: [...] "fans aren't ready for it." ...|$|E
500|$|The music used in {{the segment}} of the episode where Squidward's marching band is playing while coming down the street was from Nick Carr, the series' music editor. He found a piece of marching band music that was a band {{intentionally}} playing poorly, but sound designer Jeff Hutchins said, [...] "You could still discern the tune." [...] Hutchins thought [...] "Well, let's take this one step further. What if they couldn't <b>even</b> <b>play</b> their instruments, let alone a tune?" [...] He brought his portable DAT recorder to a musical instrument retail store and met two men who worked on its loading dock, packaging and shipping the instruments. Hutchins made the two men play most of the instruments terribly. He said, [...] "I got these two guys to squeak, blast, and squawk {{on most of the}} instruments they sold." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{influences}} include B movies, computer games, kung-fu and wrestling. [...] "Do You Karate?", [...] "a thumping bass driven flourish of a song", {{displays the}} band's [...] "trademark twin-synth attack" [...] and the Pixies-style [...] "Canhead" [...] {{has been described}} as [...] "a concise ode to fish and chips". Musically they are fond of My Bloody Valentine, Mclusky and Tom Waits, Grand Pocket Orchestra, Adebisi Shank, Jape and Giveamanakick. They dislike guitars and have been known to perform with kitchen implements such as pots and pans when on stage; MayKay and Pockets <b>even</b> <b>play</b> keyboards with their heads. They purposefully construct lengthy record titles to [...] "piss off" [...] journalists and radio presenters and their self-defined [...] "karate rock" [...] genre was directed at the NME after the British magazine tried to place them in the same category as two other female-fronted bands.|$|E

500|$|Side B {{begins with}} [...] "Baby, I Love You". Johnny {{constantly}} claims {{in his book}} Commando that he hated the song and the band didn't <b>even</b> <b>play</b> on it, only Joey and some studio musicians. Joey exclaimed that he [...] "hated" [...] the song, despite it obtaining a level of popularity in Europe. The song is a cover version of the original by The Ronettes, and contained a string section arrangement that Leigh deemed [...] "gooey" [...] and that it [...] "sounded right out of Redbone's 'Come and Get Your Love.'" [...] He also confessed that the song [...] "almost made [...] embarrassed." [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School" [...] originally appeared on the soundtrack to Rock 'n' Roll High School, a film directed by Allan Arkush. The movie depicts a story line in which the Ramones are obsessed over by female high school student Riff Randell along with other pupils attending the school. The album concludes with [...] "High Risk Insurance", which is a reaction to politics of that era.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could <b>even</b> <b>play</b> in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|Some of the album's {{songs were}} {{recorded}} by Saadiq with his live band, which included drummer Lemar Carter, bassist Calvin Turner, and guitarist Rob Bacon. Bacon, {{who had played}} with Saadiq since 2002, said of their grittier approach to guitar, [...] "I have relative pitch, as opposed to perfect pitch, so there'd be times when I'd spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument. Then he'd come in and pick up his guitar and just start playing it however it was left the day before. On one of the tracks I had to play over all this stuff {{that was out of}} tune. Raphael was like, 'That's what makes it funky!'". Musical guests such as vocalist Yukimi Nagano, keyboardist Larry Dunn, bass player Larry Graham, keyboardist Amp Fiddler, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph also contributed to the album's recording sessions, with Saadiq selecting their parts for certain tracks. The song [...] "Go to Hell" [...] was conceived from one of Amp Fiddler's Mellotron ideas. Saadiq recorded a duet with Graham called [...] "The Perfect Storm", included as a hidden track on the album: [...] "I played bass, but I put my bass down [...] The first day I tried to play bass for him, I couldn't <b>even</b> <b>play.</b> I froze three times. He's my all-time idol!".|$|E

500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of awe at the NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, “You draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that’s not so difficult. I can even do it with my left hand”. Such statements made the Buccaneers’ road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard “Batman” Wood echoed those sentiments: “It was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, beat us in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted to maybe <b>even</b> <b>play</b> us a little harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay’s comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48–10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay’s lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E
