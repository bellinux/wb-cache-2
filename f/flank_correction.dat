40|$|To {{increase}} quality, reduce heavy-duty gear noise, {{and avoid}} edge contact in manufacturing helical gears, a closed-loop feedback correction method in topographic modification tooth flank is proposed {{based on the}} gear form grinding. Equations of grinding wheel profile and grinding wheel additional radial motion are derived according to tooth segmented profile modification and longitudinal modification. Combined with gear form grinding kinematics principles, the equations of motion for each axis of five-axis computer numerical control forming grinding machine are established. Such topographical modification is achieved in gear form grinding with on-machine measurement. Based on a sensitivity analysis of polynomial coefficients of axis motion and the topographic flank errors by on-machine measuring, the corrections are determined through an optimization process that targets minimization of the tooth flank errors. A numerical example of gear grinding, including on-machine measurement and closed-loop feedback correction completing process, is presented. The validity of this <b>flank</b> <b>correction</b> method is demonstrated for tooth flank errors that are reduced. The approach is useful to precision manufacturing of spiral bevel and hypoid gears, too...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{time-to-market}} for automotive {{and other}} gear-involved products is still reducing. This demands new production technologies for the manufacturing of functional gear prototypes. At the moment gear prototypes are made using classical series production technologies, such as gear hobbing and grinding. However, these technologies require design specific dedicated tools, making {{the production of}} a functional gear prototype expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents an experimental investigation and comparison of different alternative production technologies for the manufacturing of functional gear prototypes. Wire-EDM, Selective Laser Melting and milling using standard milling tools, have been compared for {{the production of a}} spur gear out of 16 MnCr 5 steel. A strategy for the wire-cutting of a spur gear was developed, resulting in a total machining time of 22 h – with very good gear quality in terms of geometrical accuracy and surface roughness. This same gear has been produced by SLM, with a total machining time of 17 h. Two different milling strategies have been developed on a milling machine, resulting in a total machining time of 14 h 15 min. The shape accuracy and surface roughness were compared using a CMM and a surface profiler. Taking these results into account and considering {{the fact that it is}} impossible to make helical gears or machine micro <b>flank</b> <b>corrections</b> using wire-EDM, it was concluded that the milling is the most promising production technology for functional gear prototypes. The fact that functional prototypes could be made without the current lead time (± 10 weeks) is a great improvement for the production of gear prototypes, meeting the shorter time-to-market requirements of today's industry...|$|R
