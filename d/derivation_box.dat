3000|$|Random <b>derivation</b> <b>box</b> (RDB). The relay {{is placed}} in a {{randomly}} selected network <b>derivation</b> <b>box.</b> In general, derivation boxes are accessible although {{they do not have}} an already installed outlet. Thus, a relay can be installed inside the box or nearby.|$|E
30|$|The MP plays {{a special}} role inasmuch it connects the home network {{with the energy}} {{supplier}} network through circuit breakers (CBs). We distinguish two cases. The first case, which we refer to as single-sub-topology networks, is when a single CB feeds all the <b>derivation</b> <b>boxes</b> of the home network. The second case, which we refer to as multi-sub-topology networks, is when many sub-topologies, each comprising a group of <b>derivation</b> <b>boxes,</b> have their own electrical circuit that is interconnected at the MP through a CB. The latter case can be, for instance, representative of a multi-floor house, where each floor is a sub-topology. In Figure 3, we report {{an example of a}} two-sub-topology network.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of ODF and OAF protocols for rate improvements, power saving, and coverage extension over in-home PLC networks. To this end, we first describe, in “Multi-carrier system parameters” section, the OFDM system parameters. Then, in “Experimental channels” section, we describe the sites where the experimental channels have been measured. Since channel measurements were limited to pairs of outlets, to investigate performance with the relay placed in the MP or in <b>derivation</b> <b>boxes</b> and to allow for more general network topologies, we also consider {{the use of a}} statistical channel generator in “Statistical channel generator” section. Numerical results are finally presented and discussed in “Achievable rate improvements with ODF and OAF” and “Power saving with ODF and OAF” sections.|$|R
30|$|The second—and of {{practical}} relevance—contribution {{is related to}} the application of relaying to the specific and peculiar in-home PLC scenario. Differently from the wireless case, where the relay can be placed wherever between the source and the destination nodes, in in-home PLC networks, the relay can only be placed in accessible points of the network, i.e., in the outlets or in the main panel (MP) or, in principle, in the <b>derivation</b> <b>boxes.</b> To investigate the benefits that can be obtained by the use of the relay placed in the network outlets, we make use of experimental measured channels. Furthermore, to infer the effect on performance in a broader set of in-home topologies, with the placement of the relay in different accessible points, we show results using a PLC channel generator based on a statistically topology model and transmission line theory [17, 18]. The topology model is representative of Italian and EU scenarios. Both achievable rate improvements and power saving are investigated. Furthermore, we also consider OAF to benchmark results with a simple relay scheme. Finally, we note that some preliminary results of this study have been presented in [19].|$|R
3000|$|Backbone <b>derivation</b> <b>box</b> (BDB). The relay {{is located}} in a {{randomly}} selected <b>derivation</b> <b>box</b> that belongs to the backbone between the source and the destination nodes. Note that, for intercluster channels, the source and destination nodes are at least divided by the source and destination derivation boxes.|$|E
30|$|The {{specific}} and peculiar {{application of the}} algorithms to the in-home PLC scenario has been considered. The results show that, in general, ODF performs better than OAF. Significant rate improvements and power savings can be obtained depending on the relay position {{and the size of}} the network. In the considered single circuit (single sub-topology) network, with high reliability, achievable rate gains (up to 50 %), or power savings (up to 3 dB), are offered by ODF when the relay is placed in the <b>derivation</b> <b>box</b> that feeds the source node or in a <b>derivation</b> <b>box</b> that lies on the backbone link between the source and the destination nodes. In the considered two circuits network connected at the MP, e.g., a typical two-floor house network, the best relay location is in the MP. Also in this case, substantial achievable rate improvements (up to 27 %), power savings (up to 1.9 dB) and coverage extension (up to 47 %) have been found.|$|E
30|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} half duplex time division relay protocols to possibly provide achievable rate improvements, power saving, and coverage extension in home power line communication (PLC) networks. We consider a network where the communication between the source and the destination nodes follows an opportunistic protocol, namely, the relay is used whenever it allows {{with respect to the}} direct transmission: (a) for achievable rate improvements, under a power spectral density (PSD) mask constraint; or (b) for power saving, under a PSD mask and a rate target constraint. Opportunistic decode and forward (ODF), and opportunistic amplify and forward (OAF) are considered. At the physical layer, we assume the use of multi-carrier modulation. Under these assumptions, we find the optimal resource allocation, namely, the optimal power and time slot allocation, between the source and the relay nodes that maximizes the achievable rate, or minimizes the total transmitted power for both ODF and OAF. For the power minimization problem of ODF, we show that the joint problem of power and time slot allocation of DF is very hard to be solved and thus implemented. Therefore, to reduce complexity, we propose a simplified algorithm that considers two convex sub-problems. Through numerical results, we show that its performance is very close to the optimum. Finally, since over in-home PLC networks, the relay can only be placed in accessible points of the network, i.e., in outlets, or in the main panel, or in <b>derivation</b> <b>boxes,</b> for each opportunistic protocol, we also investigate the influence on performances from the relay position. Results are obtained using both measured channel responses and generated ones; thanks to the use of a statistically representative simulator. They show that significant rate improvements and power savings can be obtained {{as a function of the}} relay position and network size.|$|R
