50|$|The {{shifting}} mechanism was chosen {{with the additional}} input of Richard Ansdale. Space requirements, {{and the length of}} the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster,</b> meant that the selection mechanism would have to be mounted inside the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster,</b> rather than the usual motorcycle arrangement of dog clutches between the gears, an external drum to control their engagement and forks to connect the two. The mechanism needed to lock the selected gear onto the shaft, never engage more than one at a time, and all had to work at racing speeds.|$|E
5000|$|The 2nd running was on August 11, 2007 {{and drew}} over 800 riders. Posters and jerseys {{featured}} a rooster crowing at the sunrise formed by a bicycle <b>gear</b> <b>cluster</b> over rolling green hills. The tag-line was, 'From sunrise [...]' ...|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the layout}} of the gearbox, the {{layshaft}} is normally mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The gear lever enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the dog clutches to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the layshaft. The layshaft <b>gear</b> <b>cluster</b> is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor bronze bushes, or for high-load applications needle rollers.|$|E
50|$|For {{gearboxes}} in general, <b>gear</b> <b>clusters</b> {{mounted on}} a layshaft may either turn freely on a fixed shaft, or {{may be part of}} a shaft that then rotates in bearings. There may be multiple separate clusters on a shared shaft and these are allowed to turn freely relative to each other.|$|R
25|$|Douglas {{was more}} than a simple {{assembly}} plant for parts imported from Piaggio; many of the models made by Douglas had a high percentage of content manufactured by Douglas (eg cylinder heads, <b>gear</b> <b>clusters,</b> brake drums and other mechanical parts) or by UK supply companies (eg seats, carburetors, tyres, and some electrical components were made in the UK). Models made by Douglas were primarily the Vespa 125 and 150 (VBB).|$|R
50|$|The Oishi brothers, {{owners of}} Hodaka, {{had taken an}} {{extended}} trip to Europe in the late '50s {{and during that time}} they purchased close to 50 European and English motorcycles to take back to Japan to study. It is also rumored Hodaka might have indeed designed the complete Yamaguchi SPB50, not just the engine. Hodaka was also a producer of machine tools and it has been said they borrowed the concept of one of their quick-change <b>gear</b> <b>clusters</b> in one of their metalworking lathes to construct the shift mechanism in the Hodaka gearbox, with the resulting spring-loaded shifting mechanism being patented.|$|R
50|$|The tubular 'selector sleeve' {{slid back}} and forth over the input shaft and was splined to rotate with it. The gears of the input shaft were not {{attached}} to it and could rotate freely. They rode on the outside of the selector sleeve, not on the shaft itself. The output shaft of the gearbox had all five gears splined to it and in constant mesh with the other gears. On the outside of the selector sleeve was a ring of dogs, which could engage one gear at a time as the sleeve was slid {{back and forth}} through the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster.</b> The faces of these dogs were not flush, but were slightly offset, so that they engaged one by one.|$|E
50|$|The Lotus Twelve was {{the first}} to use the infamous Lotus 'Queerbox' transaxle. This was {{developed}} to be, in typical Chapman fashion, the smallest and lightest five-speed transmission possible, also to have a low driveshaft line allowing a low driving position, thus lower centre of mass and air resistance. Chapman also chose a transaxle over the usual gearbox and rear axle layout, as had been used in the first Twelve, as this gave a lower polar moment of inertia. The initial design, the work of Chapman and Harry Mundy, began with the principle of the most compact layout, with the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster</b> arranged in a closely spaced stack, akin to a motorcycle. As the gears shared common axes, and all teeth were cut to the same size, all the pairs of gear had the same number of teeth in total, 44. The stack was only 3+5//8 in long overall. This was likely to require sequential shifting, but that was no drawback in a racing car. The gears would also be easily changeable, to suit different circuits. Gears could be used with the same ratio in any position, to suit both hillclimbing or fast circuits, provided that they remained in a monotonic sequence.|$|E
40|$|Fractographic study {{confirmed}} that the driving gear of the multiplicator had failed by fatigue. There was multiple fatigue crack initiation and in all the cases, the fatigue crack had initiated at the tooth root. In two cases, the teeth got fractured and lost by tooth bending fatigue. In another case, after initiation, the fatigue crack had propagated into {{the hub of the}} gear and continued propagation further along the hub fillet. After propagation to a critical length, this fatigue crack had resulted in fracturing of a segment of the gear. Following this fracture, the impact with the input gear of the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster</b> had resulted in second fracture and chewing off of remaining teeth in the driving gear. Subsequently, the gear assembly had seized leading to torsional overload failure of the quill shaft transmitting power from the AGB to the multiplicator. The fatigue failure in the driving gear appears to be stress related. Evidences suggest that probably, the load on the gear assembly was more than the usual. The power transmission system down the multiplicator needs to be examined as a whole for establishing the cause(s) for excessive load on the gear assembly...|$|E
50|$|Where {{large numbers}} of gear ratios, six or more, are to be {{provided}} then these will require a third or more <b>gear</b> <b>clusters</b> on the layshaft. To maintain the proportions of the overall gearbox as more compact, rather than becoming long and thin, these gearboxes may use twin layshafts. This requires an additional driven gear for each layshaft, but the mechanism is otherwise very similar. The use of multiple layshafts also developed into the multiple clutch gearbox, used for some buses, where each ratio has its own layshaft and separate plate or hydraulic clutches, rather than dog clutches, are used to select between them.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-speed}} transmission {{having an}} input shaft and an output shaft, the transmission being capable of transitioning between fixed ratios, the high-range ratio being direct 1 : 1 and the low-range ratio being about 2 : 1. The transmission is a simple lightweight, yet robust, configuration utilizing only two gear meshes, being comprised of an input <b>gear,</b> a <b>cluster</b> <b>gear,</b> and an output gear. The transmission is controlled with a clutch and a sprag and with the {{input and output shafts}} turning in the same direction...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and distribution of}} squid and fish collected by Rectangular Midwater Trawls in the upper 200 m were investigated during the BROKE-West (Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment-West) survey (January-March 2006) in CCAMLR Subdivision 58. 4. 2 of the Southern Ocean. A total of 332 individuals were collected, with the most abundant fish species being Pleuragramma antarcticum (34 %), Notolepis coatsi (27 %) and Electrona antarctica (26 %); and the most abundant squid being Galiteuthis glacialis (64 %). Abundances of all species were among the lowest recorded using this type of <b>gear.</b> <b>Cluster</b> analysis revealed two distinct communities: a notothenioid-dominated coastal community and an oceanic community dominated by mesopelagic fish and squid. Environmental factors related to this segregation were explored using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). The notothenioid P. antarcticum was associated with shallow areas with high chlorophyll a concentrations. Larval stages of E. antarctica, N. coatsi and G. glacialis were found over deeper water and were positively correlated with higher temperatures and a deeper-reaching mixed layer. Postmetamorphic stages of E. antarctica were caught mostly after sunset and were negatively correlated with solar elevation. The observation of higher densities {{in the eastern part}} of the sampling area reflects a temporal rather than a geographical effect. Samples of the three most abundant fishes, E. antarctica, P. antarcticum and N. coatsi, were analysed for gut content. All species fed on a variety of mesozooplankton including copepods, amphipods and euphausiids, which is consistent with previous reports on similar life stages. Mean body energy density was highest for E. antarctica (27 kJ g - 1), while it was similar for P. antarcticum and N. coatsi (22 kJ g - 1). The high energy content emphasizing the importance as a food resource for top predators in the Southern Ocean...|$|E
5000|$|Mixing of gearsets can be {{achieved}} due to the similarity between the various transmissions, but some gears must be interchanged in sets. First and second gear are integral to the input shaft and cannot be interchanged independently. All transmissions have a third gear ratio of 1.38:1. However, third and fourth <b>gear</b> are <b>clustered</b> on the counter shaft which was available with two different fourth gear ratios: 1.03:1 or [...]94:1. Fifth gear is independently interchangeable and available with a [...]80:1 and [...]72:1 ratio.|$|R
40|$|Exploratory {{data mining}} using {{artificial}} neural networks offers an alternative dimension to data mining, in particular techniques <b>geared</b> towards data <b>clustering</b> and classification. In this paper, we argue {{the case for}} using neural networks as a viable data mining tool that can provide statistical insights and models from large data-sets. We demonstrate how Self-Organizing Kohonen Maps, an unsupervised learning neural network paradigm, can be efficaciously used for data mining purposes, in particular for data clustering applications. We show that high-dimensional data can be projected to a lower dimension and that data can be clustered together whilst preserving essential information. The Kohonen Map based data-clustering technique {{is applied to the}} 1991 World Bank social economics indicators, to show how multi-dimensional data sets can be reduced to two-dimensional (feature) maps, manifesting clusters of similar data items...|$|R
