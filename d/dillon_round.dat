25|$|In the 1960â€“1 <b>Dillon</b> <b>round</b> of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the United States secured tariff-free {{access for}} its {{soybeans}} to the European market. In the 1960s, the United States exported over 90% of the world's soybeans. By 2005, the top soybeans exporters were Argentina (39% of world soybean exports), United States (37%) and Brazil (16%), while top importers were China (41% of world soybean imports), European Union (22%), Japan (6%) and Mexico (6%).|$|E
50|$|As the <b>Dillon</b> <b>Round</b> {{went through}} the {{laborious}} process of item-by-item tariff negotiations, it became clear, long before the Round ended, that a more comprehensive approach was needed {{to deal with the}} emerging challenges resulting from the formation of the European Economic Community (EEC) and EFTA, as well as Europe's re-emergence as a significant international trader more generally.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, an {{agreement}} with <b>Dillon</b> <b>Round</b> led to a massive influx of US soybeans, exempt from European customs. Soy, rich in protein, is needed as livestock feed. In June 1973, following an exceptional drought, the US government decreed an embargo on the export of seeds and oilcake. This caused prices to soar, reflecting an interdependence of French and European farmers.|$|E

Contested over 112 laps, it was the 18th race of the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. Aric Almirola was leading when the race was called for rain and scored his first career win. Brian Vickers was second, while Kurt Busch, Casey Mears, and top rookie Austin <b>Dillon</b> <b>rounded</b> out the top five. Behind Dillon, the top rookies of the race were Alex Bowman in 13th, and Michael Annett in 21st.|$|R

40|$|While the EU is a {{customs union}} in {{merchandise}} trade (goods), {{it has not}} yet reached this stage of integration in service trade. How far the EU is from a customs union in service trade is very difficult to assess because of the nonquantitative nature of trade restrictions in this sector. The paper tries to present first indirections of how far the EU is from being a customs union by calculating frequency indices of trade measures using the Hoekman approach based on the February 2003 EU first offer regarding service trade in the Doha Round. The calculations show that differences in national policies against nonmember states are particulary relevant in modes of supply via factor movements. Inter alia, policy measures comprise national needs tests, residence criteria, and nationality criteria. The paper concludes that there is reason to assume that {{in the course of the}} Doha Round negotiations some if not many of national measures will be given up. Therefore multilateral trade negotiations will be instrumental to bring the EU to a complete customs union as it happened in goods trade between 1958 and 1968 when the <b>Dillon</b> <b>Round</b> and the Kennedy Round helped to complete the customs union in industrial goods. trade liberalization, services, EU policy, Doha Round...|$|E
50|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held on August 30; {{the first two}} were dominated by Mike Skeen, while {{the third and fourth}} were led by Chase Elliott. 30 drivers entered the race, with qualifying taking place on August 31. Skeen, Elliott, Chris Lafferty and Jennifer Jo Cobb were required to qualify on time. James Buescher won the pole position with a lap speed of 109.189 mph, his second pole of 2013 and fifth of his career. Skeen, Elliott, Miguel Paludo and Ty <b>Dillon</b> <b>rounded</b> out the top five, while the top ten included Max Papis, Chad Hackenbracht, Darrell Wallace Jr. and Brendan Gaughan. The top-qualifying Canadian driver was Alex Guenette, who qualified 14th. Bryan Silas was ordered {{to the rear of the}} field due to unapproved adjustments.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{rounds of}} Knockout Qualifying took place, the first {{instance}} that the new qualifying format {{was used in the}} Sprint Cup Series on a super speedway. Brian Scott captured his first career pole with a time of 48.293 and a speed of 198.290 mph. Paul Menard, A. J. Allmendinger, Casey Mears and Austin <b>Dillon</b> <b>rounded</b> out the top five. The drivers had a wide range of opinions on the new format. [...] "I don't know if anybody can really quite capture how intense that is. I'm telling you, it's just nerve-racking. You're trying to make all the right decisions as well as not wreck. It wasn't too crazy, but it was crazy enough to be fun," [...] said Jeff Gordon. [...] "It's hard because everybody wants to lag and nobody wants to go because the speed is at the back and not the front," [...] said Brad Keselowski. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. did not like the new format at Talladega. [...] "It just wasn't much fun. I'd like to do some heat races or something maybe. That would be a little funner than this." [...] Kasey Kahne and Truex, Jr. started {{at the rear of the}} field after failing post-qualifying inspection. Kahne's car was too light and Truex's car failed to meet height requirements. [...] "Basically we had a malfunction with a ballast container," [...] Kahne's crew chief Kenny Francis said in a manufacturer release. [...] "The cap that holds the ballast in came out. It could be mechanical or human error we are not really sure what happened. At the end of the day 25 pounds of ballast came out and we were 25 pounds light at the scales. The time was disallowed and we will have to start at the back." [...] Dave Blaney, Eric McClure, Joe Nemechek and J. J. Yeley failed to qualify for the race.|$|R
5000|$|At the Boston Garden, Eddie is {{becoming}} increasingly drunk. After he leaves to use the restroom and get another <b>round,</b> <b>Dillon</b> is joined by a young man he has told Eddie is his [...] "wife's nephew" [...] who will be joining them at the game, but who is late. In reality he is a young hood who is being groomed by Dillon and will be in on the hit. When Eddie returns to the seats, he is sloppy drunk and sentimental. He soliloquizes about Bobby Orr, the hockey great who helped lead the Bruins to two Stanley Cup victories in 1970 and 1972 (the latter the year the film was made in Boston).|$|R
40|$|While the EU is a {{customs union}} in {{merchandise}} trade (goods), {{it has not}} yet reached this stage of integration in service trade. Trade policies between individual Member States and non-Member States vary in services. Given the remaining national sovereignties in regulating service trade against other EU Member States also, the EU is not yet even a free trade area. How far the EU is from a customs union in service trade is very difficult to assess because of the non-quantitative nature of trade restrictions in this sector. This article gives a first hint of the distance from a customs union by calculating frequency indices of trade measures by refining the 1995 Hoekman index. The database is the EU's first offer in service trade in the WTO Doha round in February 2003. It emerges that the deviation from a customs union is not substantial, but still exists because of differences in national policies against non-Member States which are particularly relevant in the mode of supply via labour flows. "Inter alia", policy measures comprise economic needs tests, residence and nationality criteria. The article concludes that there is reason to assume that, {{in the course of the}} Doha round negotiations, some if not most of the national measures will be given up. Therefore, multilateral trade negotiations will be instrumental in bringing the EU to a complete customs union as happened in goods trade between 1958 and 1968 when the <b>Dillon</b> and Kennedy <b>rounds</b> helped to complete the customs union in industrial goods.
