Winnie Winkle was reprinted in Dell Comics, {{and for a time}} her <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> on a cigar box lid. In retrospect, Winnie Winkle is seen as one of the comic strips heralding a new, more independent role for American women after World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} covered in detail by Time, and Arafat's <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> {{on the cover of}} the 13 December 1968 issue, {{bringing}} his image to the world for the first time. Amid the post-war environment, the profiles of Arafat and Fatah were raised by this important turning point, and he came to be regarded as a national hero who dared to confront Israel. With mass applause from the Arab world, financial donations increased significantly, and Fatah's weaponry and equipment improved. The group's numbers swelled as many young Arabs, including thousands of non-Palestinians, joined the ranks of Fatah.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan Project {{became public}} {{knowledge}} after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Oppenheimer {{became a national}} spokesman for science who was emblematic of {{a new type of}} technocratic power. He became a household name and his <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> on the covers of Life and Time. Nuclear physics became a powerful force as all governments of the world began to realize the strategic and political power that came with nuclear weapons. Like many scientists of his generation, he felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.|$|E

25|$|Such was his {{impact on}} the Finnish {{political}} scene that Kekkonen's <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> on the 500 Markka banknote during his term as President. The series of Finnish Markka banknotes used at this time was the second-to-last design series in {{the entire history of}} the currency. Very few Finns have ever got their face on a Markka note during their lifetime, and Kekkonen was the last to do so. This banknote was declared Finland's most beautiful note according to voting organised by the commemorative coins and medal marketer Suomen Moneta on 1 April 2011.|$|E
500|$|Along with Gill, John Kelly and Alan Aldridge were {{credited}} {{for designing}} the album's artwork. For {{the back cover}} of the LP, Harrison chose a photo of part of the Berlin Wall – a stock image from the Camera Press picture agency – which Kelly and Aldridge then manipulated and mirrored to represent a corner. Taylor describes the result as innovative for its time, with the wall made to look [...] "proud and sharp as the prow of a liner". The sleeve was designed so that the rear <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> upside down relative to the front. In America, some copies of the LP had the Berlin Wall image mistakenly printed on the front, which made for [...] "a less than exciting cover to be sure", in Madinger and Easter's opinion.|$|E

500|$|In September 2001, D.C. {{police and}} federal {{prosecutors}} were {{contacted by the}} lawyer of an informant, held in a D.C. jail, {{who claimed to have}} knowledge of Levy's killer. The informant, whose identity was protected for his safety, said that Ingmar Guandique, a 20-year-old illegal alien from El Salvador also being held in the jail, told him that Condit paid him $25,000 to kill Levy. Investigators ruled out the story about Condit, because Guandique had already admitted to assaulting two other women in the same park where Levy's remains were found. Guandique failed to show up for work on the day of Levy's disappearance. His former landlady recalled that his <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> scratched and bruised at around that time. The investigators on the Levy case did not interview the other Rock Creek Park victims. Police chief Ramsey avoided calling Guandique a suspect and described him as a [...] "person of interest", telling reporters not to make [...] "too big a deal" [...] about him. Assistant chief Terrance W. Gainer said that if Guandique had been considered a suspect, D.C. police would have been after him [...] "like flies on honey".|$|E
500|$|To promote [...] "Oh Mother" [...] and Back to Basics, Aguilera {{performed}} the song {{on a number}} of occasions. On July 20, 2006, Aguilera {{performed the}} track at the Koko jazz club in London, which was held in front of 1,500 fans and invited guests. The 40-minute concert comprised songs from the then-upcoming Back to Basics and other songs, including [...] "Lady Marmalade" [...] (2001) and [...] "Beautiful" [...] (2002). MTV UK was positive toward the performance, wrote, [...] "The gig reflected the jazz club mood of Christina's new album, with a swinging brass-heavy backing band and fit dancers bounding sexily around the stage". Later, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] was also performed during her worldwide Back to Basics Tour (200607). As she performed the track, the clip of a man repeatedly punching a woman as blood dripped from her <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> on the screen. The tour was preceded by newspaper headlines that flashed across a big screen, such as, [...] "Christina goes from 'dirrty' to demure" [...] and [...] "Christina cleans up her act". The performance is included on the video release [...] (2008). A live video of the performance of [...] "Oh Mother" [...] during the tour, taken from the accompanying DVD, was premiered in late 2007. Nick Levine for Digital Spy called it a [...] "cheap-looking" [...] video.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, DiCaprio {{starred in}} James Cameron's Titanic (1997) as twenty-year-old Jack Dawson, a penniless Wisconsin man who wins two {{tickets for the}} third-class on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. DiCaprio {{initially}} refused to portray the character but was eventually encouraged to pursue the role by Cameron, who strongly believed in his acting ability. Against expectations, the film {{went on to become}} the highest-grossing film to date (it was surpassed in 2010 by Cameron's film Avatar), grossing more than $1.843 billion in box-office receipts worldwide, and transformed DiCaprio into a commercial movie superstar, resulting in fan worship among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as [...] "Leo-Mania". In May 1998, for example, his <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> on the covers of at least four teen magazines, and three books about DiCaprio were among the top six paperbacks on The New York Times Best Seller list. More than 200 fans contacted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to protest his not being nominated for the 70th Academy Awards. He was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a second Golden Globe nomination. Upon the success of Titanic, DiCaprio stated in 2000: [...] "I have no connection with me during that whole Titanic phenomenon and what my face became around the world [...] I'll never reach that state of popularity again, and I don't expect to. It's not something I'm going to try to achieve either." ...|$|E

500|$|Aware of {{what does}} {{and does not}} work in {{television}} animation, Schooley and McCorkle knew that Kim needed to be a physically attractive character. Kim's appearance evolved dramatically {{over the course of}} three months. The character was originally designed to look like [...] "a pretty standard-looking athletic blonde", which was gradually changed in favor of a more distinctive appearance. At one point, Kim's design was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. However, the Disney Channel eventually determined that Lara [...] "is ... not a very real character." [...] Finally, the creators decided to give Kim a more realistic appearance akin to that of a 14-year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell, concluding, [...] "She has a nice, very appealing design, but we just wanted to keep it out of that realm of video game heroine." [...] The creators admitted that Kim would have been their [...] "dream girl" [...] in high school, joking, [...] "She would have been way out of our class though." [...] Director Chris Baily wanted Kim to be designed with [...] "graphic sensibilities" [...] {{similar to those of the}} show's backgrounds, creating a 3D character [...] "whose feet can be planted on the ground and communicate a sense of space." [...] For example, when the character is dressed in all-black, Kim was drawn without a white outline so that she virtually disappears when she moves in front of a black background, yet her [...] "simple design" [...] and flesh allows audiences to [...] "fill in where her body is" [...] naturally. The show's female characters are the only characters drawn with lips, only the upper of which is visible. Describing Kim as [...] "a mostly graphic heroine", Animation: A World History: Volume III: Contemporary Times author Giannalberto Bendazzi agreed that the character's [...] "limited animation" [...] was intentional. In the fourth season, the character's signature crop top and cargo pants are replaced by a T-shirt and pants because the former outfit was damaged during a fight with Shego. Some viewers noted that Kim's <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> to be [...] "rounder" [...] than it had been drawn in previous seasons. Kim was animated by Rough Draft Korea.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 April 2001, a mugging {{and attack}} upon 76-year-old white World War II veteran Walter Chamberlain by three Asian youths was amongst {{the first major}} provocations {{which led to the}} riots. Mr. Chamberlain was {{approached}} as he walked to his home after watching a local amateur rugby league match. He was mugged and badly beaten, receiving fractured bones in the face amongst other injuries. His battered <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> {{on the front of the}} Manchester Evening News, and the story spread to all the major national newspapers. In the Mail on Sunday, his story was told under the headline 'Whites beware'. In the Mirror, his <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> under the headline [...] "Beaten for being white: OAP, 76, attacked in Asian no-go area". Media pundits began to speculate on the apparent transformation of young Asian males - from the stereotype of hard-working boys, who respected their parents, to the new stereotype of angry, violent thugs. An Asian male (a Mr. Fokrul Islam) was ultimately charged for the crime of racially aggravated grievous bodily harm on 1 October 2001, some time after the riots. Walter Chamberlain and his family in an attempt to try to calm tensions in the borough stated at the time that the mugging was just that, and not at all racially motivated."It was a violent assault on an elderly man", said Mr. Chamberlain's son Steven. [...] "As a family we don't think it was a race issue at all." [...] Since this story was attributed to fuelling further hatred in the local communities race crimes against all sections of society are no longer reported as such for fear of further trouble.|$|E
2500|$|The opening {{episode of}} Series 2, [...] "A Slight Case of Reincarnation", {{apparently}} set in 1902, reminded viewers of the Face, {{who had not}} been seen since [...] "A Vintage Year for Scoundrels"; his reappearance in the present day being explained in the next episode [...] "Black Echo" [...] by his having frozen himself back in 1902, with Louise (who, of course, aged naturally) watching over him during the years in between until the time came for him to be revived. The <b>Face</b> <b>appeared</b> in four more episodes during Series 2 – namely [...] "Face in a Mirror", [...] "Tunnel of Death", [...] "The Resurrectionists" [...] and [...] "A Sinister Sort of Service" [...] – in which he would urge on the main villain(s) of each story, but while Adam would defeat the villain(s) on each occasion, the Face himself would never be captured or vanquished, always escaping to fight another day and vowing vengeance on Adam when they met next time.|$|E

2500|$|According to Doris Warner, {{who was in}} attendance, {{about halfway}} through the film {{she began to feel}} that {{something}} exceptional was taking place. Suddenly, Jolson's <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> in big close-up, and said [...] "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothing yet!" [...] Jolson's [...] "Wait a minute" [...] line prompted a loud, positive response from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing, hearing, someone speak on a film for the first time. So much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. Applause followed each of his songs. Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, [...] "the audience became hysterical." [...] After the show, the audience turned into a [...] "milling, battling, mob", in one journalist's description, chanting [...] "Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!" [...] Among those who reviewed the film, the critic who foresaw most clearly what it presaged for the future of cinema was Life magazine's Robert E. Sherwood. He described the spoken dialogue scene between Jolson and Besserer as [...] "fraught with tremendous significance.... I for one suddenly realized {{that the end of the}} silent drama is in sight".|$|E
2500|$|On , Catherine rose {{early in}} the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon {{settling}} down to work on papers at her study. Her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, had asked the Empress if she had slept well, and Catherine reportedly replied she had not slept so well in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 that morning, Catherine went to her dressing room and collapsed from a stroke while on the toilet. Worried by Catherine's absence, her attendant, Zakhar Zotov, opened the door and peered in. Catherine was sprawled on the floor. Her <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> purplish, her pulse was weak, and her breathing was shallow and laboured. The servants lifted Catherine from the floor and brought her to the bedroom. Some 45 minutes later, the royal court's Scottish physician, Dr. John Rogerson, arrived and determined that Catherine had suffered a stroke. Despite all attempts to revive the Empress, she fell into a coma from which she never recovered. Catherine was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45. An autopsy performed on her body the next day confirmed the cause of death as stroke. (Later, several unfounded stories circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death.) ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the final}} {{dramatic}} scene involving Harcourt's demise, the rigged effects were handled in two stages. The first stage involved a dissolving head and body, {{while the second}} stage incorporated a flesh-less arm thrusting out of seawater. Rosengrant noted, [...] "While the dissolving makeup had to look extreme, it also had to appear realistic {{within the limits of}} the alien anatomy Winston's crew had designed. We wanted to avoid the amorphous 'blob-of-blood' look you see in so many of these slasher and monster pictures. We {{wanted to be able to}} see Harcourt's bone structure rather than just the glob hanging off of it." [...] For the visual appearance he added, [...] "Of course, we did use methocel slime to make it wet and nasty-looking, but the basic understructure was rooted in anatomy." [...] For Harcourt's facial disintegration, the coordinators came up with a foam rubber base makeup superimposed with a layer of gelatin appliances. Elek explained, the crew [...] "dug out chunks from the foam rubber pieces, filled the holes with Bromo Seltzer, then laid the gelatin appliances over the whole thing and colored them so you could not see the holes below. Once the stuntman, the camera and everyone else was in position, we took a large syringe filled with hot water and injected it into each of the Bromo Seltzer pockets as the camera started rolling. As the Bromo Seltzer started to fizzle, the hot water began eating its way through the gelatin skin and his <b>face</b> <b>appeared</b> to bubble and melt." [...] In the end, Mahan remarked, [...] "We figured that going from something like the alien queen in Aliens to these straight prosthetic makeups would be simple, but it was really a lot of work." ...|$|E
