40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} two dietarydoses of vitamins E and C supplemented separatelyand together, {{on the content of}} vitamin E in the yolk, onthe lipid stability of fresh and stored eggs, and on theirsensory and functional properties. Hy-Line Brown hens(n = 216) received a basal diet for 8 wk supplementedwith 100 or 200 mg DL-α-tocopheryl acetate (E 100 or E 200,respectively) /kg, 500 or 1, 000 mg ascorbic acid (C 500 and C 1000, respectively) /kg, or 100 mg DL-α-tocopherylacetate plus 500 mg ascorbic acid (E 100 +C 500) /kg,whereas the control group received no supplementation. Fresh eggs and eggs stored 30, 60, and 90 d at 4 C or stored 28 d at room temperature were analyzed for vitamin E content and TBA-reactive substances (TBARS). We alsoevaluated functional properties of fresh and cooked eggsand sensory properties of boiled and scrambled eggs. Theyolk content of vitamin E depended on the level of dietaryaddition and decreased after 90 d of storage at 4 C orafter 28 d at 25 C. Vitamin supplementation had no effecton <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>refrigerated</b> eggs, whereas 4 wk of storage atroom temperature increased TBARS in the control and thegroup supplemented with the highest doses of vitamins.

40|$|To {{provide new}} {{insights}} into the mechanisms through which seminal plasma proteins (SPP) are able to protect spermatozoa, we tested the hypothesis that apoptosis can contribute to the negative effect of refrigeration on ram spermatozoa, and that SPP prevent this damage. Having proved the presence of key constituents of apoptosis-related pathways in ram sperm protein extracts, we carried out a comparative analysis {{of the effects of the}} addition of SPP before refrigeration (158 C, 30 min) and induced-apoptosis with betulinic acid or fibroblast-associated receptor ligand, assessing sperm quality parameters and apo-ptotic markers. The protective effect of SPP on plasma membrane integrity and potential, motility and mitochondrial inner membrane potential, and surface (cardiolipin content) was evidenced in refrigerated and induced-apoptosis samples. The addition of SPP resulted in lower values of phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA damage, and caspase activity. Therefore, apoptosis in <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>refrigerated</b> ram spermatozoa can occur due to activation of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic mediated pathway, and SPP might interfere with both pathways. The addition of SPP also resulted in higher proportions of viable, noncapacitated sperm and fertilizing ability (ZBA rate). This report demonstrates that SPP support survival of ram sperma-tozoa acting not only at the plasma membrane but also by inhibition of capacitation, and proposes the possibility that SPP might interfere with the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways. This opens new, interesting perspectives for the study of cellular regulatory mechanisms in spermatozoa that could be crucial for the improvement of ram semen preservation protocols. apoptosis, capacitation, refrigeratio...|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of milk preserved by refrigeration and CO 2 addition for {{the manufacture of}} Afuega'l Pitu, a Spanish acid-coagulated short-ripened cheese, was evaluated at pilot scale using an autochthonous cheese starter. Cheeses manufactured, after milk pasteurisation, from vacuum degasified refrigerated CO 2 -treated samples (pH 6. 2) were compared with two different control cheeses made from pasteurised milk either <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>refrigerated.</b> The multiplication and acidification capacity of lactic acid bacteria {{as well as the}} production of volatile compounds during cheesemaking and ripening were not affected by the previous refrigeration and CO 2 -treatment of raw milk nor by the residual CO 2 still present in pasteurised milk after degasification and pasteurisation. Residual CO 2 retarded the proteolysis although no differences on proteolysis and sensory properties were detected at the optimum time of consumption (15 days) between cheeses made from CO 2 -treated milk and those made from untreated control milk. CO 2 -treatment effectively prevents the decrease in cheese yield caused by the microorganisms present in raw milk of poor microbial quality. These results support the interest of the CO 2 -addition in preservation of milk for cheesemaking, specially when it has a high initial microbial load; the method can be satisfactorily used in the manufacture of Afuega'l Pitu cheese and may be extended to the production of other acid-coagulated cheeses.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the viability of fresh, cooled and vitrified donkey embryos by the 4 ’, 6 ’-diamidino- 2 -phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining method, was previously used for the evaluation of embryo damage (described as the percentage of dead per total cells) in the donkey species (Panzani et al. Theriogenology 2012; 77 : 563 – 9). Eighteen 7 to 8 days old, quality I donkey embryos, recovered by uterine lavages with Ringer Lactate (RL), were divided in 3 groups: 1) Fresh (n= 6, 7 -days old; FR); 2) Cooled for 24 hours in a 5 ml test tube filled with the same RL recovered at the first uterine lavage (n= 6, 8 -days old; RL 24); 3) Vitrified using the Equine Vitrification Kit (Bioniche Animal Health, USA) and the technique described for the horse (Eldridge-Panuska et al. Theriogenology 2005; 63 : 1308 – 19) (n= 6, 7 -days old; VIT). After 24 hours of refrigeration in Equitainer® (RL 24), after thawing (VIT) or directly after being recovered (FR), embryos were washed three times in Emcare Holding Solution (EHS), measured, moved for 5 min into EHS containing 1 μg/mL DAPI and washed three more times in EHS. Dead embryonic cells (DAPI +) were directly counted under a fluorescence microscope, while the total cell number was estimated as described previously (n= 0. 0106 d 2 + 2. 0542 d – 375. 28; n= cell number, d= embryo diameter in µm) (Moussa et al., Proc 20 th Scientific Meeting of the IETS 2004; 160). The proportion of DAPI stained cells was compared using One-Way ANOVA and LSD post-hoc test. The proportion of dead cells in the embryos of the 3 groups was lower than that reported to be the maximum limit for viability of horse embryos (Moussa et al. Theriogenology 2005; 64 : 1619 – 32) in fresh embryos it was similar to that previously reported in donkeys (070. 3 vs 0. 91. 17) (Panzani et al., 2011).

SAMPLE Urine specimens from 20 proteinuric (UPC > 0. 5) and 20 nonproteinuric (UPC ≤ 0. 2) dogs. UPC and SDS-AGE were performed on urine specimens stored at room temperature (20 °C) and 4 °C for up to 5 days and at - 20 ° and - 80 °C for up to 360 days; some specimens were subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles. Results were compared with those obtained for fresh urine specimens. UPC was not affected by storage at room temperature or by freezing. A decrease in UPC was observed for specimens from nonproteinuric dogs after 5 days at 4 °C (10 %) and from both groups after 90 days at - 20 ° and - 80 °C (≤ 20 % and ≤ 15 %, respectively). The SDS-AGE profiles revealed no visual changes regardless of duration of storage for specimens stored at room temperature, 4 °C, and - 80 °C, except for 1 profile after 360 days at - 80 °C. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles did not affect SDS-AGE profiles.

Samples of MC (n = 827) were collected from 67 farms in 12 states. Colostrum was analyzed for IgG by radial immunodiffusion (RID) and refractive index (nD) by a digital refractometer. The relationship between nD and IgG was strong (r = 0. 73; P 3 ̆c 0. 05; n = 823). Samples analyzed by refractometry fresh and went through 1 freeze/thaw cycle prior to RID analysis resulted in the strongest relationship between IgG and nD (r = 0. 93 and 0. 90, respectively). The MC samples collected <b>fresh</b> (not <b>refrigerated</b> <b>or</b> frozen) on the farm but frozen two or more times prior to analysis by refractometry and RID had a weak relationship between IgG and nD (r = 0. 01).

This study evaluated the effect of storage temperature on the survival of C. jejuni in chicken meat stored for seven days at 4 °C and for 28 days at- 20 °C. The influence of selective enrichment on recovery of Campylobacter was also evaluated. Thirty fresh chicken meat samples were analyzed and 93. 3 % was contaminated with termotolerant Campylobacter spp. with average count of 3. 08 Log 10 CFU/g on direct plating.

The second objective was to compare the effects that pasteurization and freezing had on colostrum IgG concentration and total bacteria counts compared to raw refrigerated colostrum. A controlled trial was completed on a 6, 000 -cow dairy in California where colostrum was harvested twice daily, pooled, and then divided into three different treatment groups and processed accordingly. One treatment was pasteurized at 60 oC for 60 min and then frozen, the other two were both fresh, one going into the freezer and the other into the refrigerator. Samples of all treatment groups were taken to determine total plate count, total E. Coli count, and total IgG immediately before the colostrum was fed. Newborn calves were randomly assigned to be fed 4 quarts of either pasteurized frozen (Past, n= 60), fresh-frozen (FF, n= 60), or fresh-refrigerated (FR, n= 60) colostrum within 2 hours of birth. Calves were weighed daily and picked up after receiving 2 or 3 feedings of treatment colostrum (dependent on time of birth) and taken to a custom heifer raising facility where they were weighed and monitored for morbidity (number of treatments) until weaning (60 d). Pasteurization improved the serum IgG count in the calves compared to fresh and fresh frozen treatments.

The researcher’s {{goal was to}} determine the effectiveness of a nutrition education intervention on low-income children. The USDA and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics provided most of the research used to create the intervention. The definition of “healthy” used for this study was defined by the USDA (2014) as “whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat free or low-fat dairy, and lean meats that are perishable (<b>fresh,</b> <b>refrigerated,</b> <b>or</b> frozen) or canned as well as nutrient-dense foods and beverages encouraged by the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. ” Initially, the researcher established a partnership with the Chattanooga Area Food Bank and Inner City Ministry. The nutrition education intervention occurred at Inner City Ministry’s afterschool program. Inner City Ministry’s director randomly selected seven participants from their fifth grade class. These participants consisted of six girls and one boy. Their height, weight, and physical activity levels varied. The intervention consisted of six classes during the three-month period. Each class lasted forty-five minutes and was comprised of a lecture, an activity, and a healthy snack. The activities included games and hands-on learning activities. The parents were encouraged to participate in the program through handouts and one class. Pre and post surveys were used to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. The results, which are furthered analyzed in this paper, show that the intervention was successful. Future researchers are encouraged to use similar methods to test the effectiveness of their nutrition education programs...|$|R
