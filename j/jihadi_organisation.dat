40|$|In recent years, a {{spate of}} attacks has destabilised a swathe of Kenya’s {{peripheral}} counties as well as bringing terror to its capital, Nairobi. As violent insecurity spreads, it has fomented fear and stoked ethnic and regional divisions, precipitating security crackdowns and roiling the country’s infamously tumultuous politics. These developments belie sweeping constitutional reforms {{that have taken place}} to address and prevent violence in Kenya. Since Kenya stepped up its military involvement in Somalia in 2011, ostensibly to buffer the country from violence wrought by Al-Shabaab – the Somalia-based <b>jihadi</b> <b>organisation</b> – attacks have multiplied, ranging from the September 2013 siege of Nairobi’s Westgate shopping centre, to village massacres, to the targeted killings of police and religious figures. Yet Kenya’s government, while widening its military engagement in Somalia, was at first slow to recognise and respond to the hand of Al-Shabaab in the country’s widening violent insecurity since the start of its Somalia military operations. This study adds to existing analyses of Kenya’s shifting political and security dynamics by examining the role of external influences on its system of violence.

40|$|This report {{looks at}} the origins and {{development}} of the ISIS support network in Indonesia. Introduction Support for the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS) in Indonesia raises the risk of violence there even though the capacity of violent extremist groups remains low. This could change with the eventual return home of Indonesians now fighting in Syria and Iraq who will have the training, combat experience, and leadership potential now lacking in Indonesia’s extremist community. The 22 September 2014 exhortation by IS spokesman Al-Adnani to kill foreigners linked to the U. S. -led coalition could also provide an incentive to Indonesian ISIS supporters to target Westerners as a way of earning approval from leaders of the self-declared caliphate. The Indonesian translation of that exhortation includes this passage: If you do not have bombs or bullets, and a kafir (infidel) from America or France or one of their allies comes out, hit him {{in the head with a}} rock, carve him up with a knife, hit him with your car, throw him off a high building or poison him! Would-be terrorists in Indonesia for the last four years have focused exclusively on domestic targets, mostly the police, and they continued to do so even after the caliphate was announced. The instruction from Al-Adnani, however, could be taken seriously by those who have both pledged allegiance to IS and have already used or attempted to use violence. This report examines the ISIS support network in Indonesia, how it emerged, who joined it and how it has evolved. It also {{looks at the}} Indonesian government’s response. While that response has been forceful, the government still needs to translate decrees into action. It has instructed prison officials to step up monitoring of convicted terrorists, for example, yet Al-Adnani’s grim message was translated by one of those prisoners and posted on radical websites within 24 hours of its issuance. President Yudhoyono’s government announced a ban on ISIS on 4 August after the appearance on YouTube of a video called “Joining the Ranks”, in which an Indonesian calling himself “Abu Muhammad al Indunisi” urges others to follow his example and join the jihad in Syria. Abu Muhammad turned out to be an activist named Bahrum Syah with links to an extremist organisation once known as Al Muhajiroun. Al Muhajiroun’s founders, Omar Bakri Muhammad and Anjem Choudary, have gone on to establish a global network of advocacy groups supporting the establishment of Islamic law, if necessary by violent means. The first branch, in the UK where Choudary is based, was called Islam 4 UK, later Sharia 4 UK. Each national branch had “Sharia 4 ” in its title; Sharia 4 Indonesia was established in 2010. A small group of Indonesians inspired by Bakri and Choudary became the engine of the pro-ISIS network in Indonesia. The group runs the website www. al-mustaqbal. net, hereafter referred to as Al-Mustaqbal. It has links to most of the terrorist groups still operating in Indonesia, including the Mujahidin of Eastern Indonesia (Mujahidin Indonesia Timur, MIT) and the Mujahidin of Western Indonesia (Mujahidin Indonesian Barat, MIB). It sponsored most of the ceremonies across Indonesia pledging loyalty to IS after the latter on 29 June 2014 announced the establishment of a caliphate. And its fighters in Syria, including Bahrum Syah, have formed an Indonesian-Malaysian unit of ISIS in Syria that reportedly aims at eventually establishing an archipelagic Islamic State in Southeast Asia, to be called Daulah Islamiyah Nusantara. The report also examines how the announcement of the caliphate has split the Indonesian jihadi community, leading to deep divisions among convicted terrorist prisoners and the splintering of a leading <b>jihadi</b> <b>organisation,</b> Jamaah Anshorul Tauhid (JAT). The individual who has emerged as the most important ideological promoter of ISIS is Aman Abdurrahman, a cleric imprisoned in the maximum security complex on the island of Nusakambangan, off the south coast of Java. It is he who became the mentor of the Sharia 4 Indonesia group and whose followers constitute the glue that binds disparate elements of the Indonesian ISIS network together. The appearance of ISIS may be a rare example of international developments becoming a direct driver of jihadi recruitment in Indonesia. In the past, the drivers have been overwhelmingly local. When Indonesians went to Afghanistan to train in the mid- 1980 s and early 1990 s, they were spurred by repression at home and the desire to develop the capacity to fight Soeharto. The bombing campaign of Jemaah Islamiyah between 1999 and 2002 was sparked by communal conflict at home, in Ambon and Poso. Despite all the rhetoric about support for Palestine, very few Indonesians have ever gone to fight there. The appeal of ISIS is different, a combination of religious prophecies involving Sham (greater Syria); the string of victories in Iraq in June that gave a sense of backing a winner; the resonance of the concept of the caliphate; and sophisticated use by ISIS of social media. At the same time, ISIS has triggered a bigger backlash than ever seen before in the Indonesian Muslim community, suggesting that support will stay limited to a fringe of the radical fringe. The individuals involved are nonetheless dangerous, and it is cause for concern that inmates of high security prisons continue to be among the most active propagators of ISIS views and teachings. Indonesian prison management has improved in recent years, but there is a long way to go. The incoming Jokowi government will have to decide whether to continue the counter-terrorism policies of the Yudhoyono government or ramp them up, including by pressing for strengthened legal tools. Either way, it is critical that leadership of the counter-terrorism effort be left in the hands of the police, who over the last decade have accumulated all the institutional knowledge of radical networks...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{ten years}} after the Bali bombing that brought {{terrorism}} in Indonesia to international attention, the country’s violent extremists are weak and divided but still active. In the face of strong police pressure, they are finding ways to regroup on the run, in prison and through internet forums, military training camps and arranged marriages. In many cases, the same individuals keep reappearing, using old networks to build new alliances. The fact that they have been singularly inept in their operations in recent years {{does not mean that the}} danger of attacks is over. There are signs that at least some are learning lessons from past failures and becoming more sophisticated in recruitment and fundraising. Better understanding of how extremists regroup could lead to more effective counter-radicalisa­tion programs. The biggest blow to terrorist capacity in recent years was the break-up in early 2010 of a training camp in Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, where an alliance of almost all major jihadi groups in the country had planned to establish a base. Many senior leaders were captured or killed and a wealth of information discovered that led to the arrest, trial and imprisonment of some 200 individuals. Instead of cowing the jihadis into submission, however, police operations inspired a new wave of activity motivated by the desire for revenge, with new partnerships and training centres established and new plans set in motion. Activity has been particularly noticeable in Medan, North Sumatra; Poso, Central Sulawesi; Solo, Central Java; Bima, West Nusa Tenggara; and parts of East Kalimantan. Underground activity has been directly or indirectly assisted by radical preachers whose meetings provide inspiration and meeting grounds for jihadis and sympathisers. Some pro-Sharia (Islamic law) advocacy groups that do not use violence themselves but whose teachings are in line with jihadi views play a similar role. Almost all the plots since 2010, and there have been more than a dozen, are connected directly or indirectly to the fugitives from Aceh. The ease with which wanted men can move around, communicate with friends in prison, share information and skills, disseminate ideology, purchase arms, conduct training and recruit new followers shows how much basic preventive work still needs to be done. Many of the jihadi groups operating today have links to Jamaah Anshorut Tauhid (JAT), a group set up by radical cleric Abu Bakar Ba’asyir in 2008 that has replaced Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) as the country’s largest and most active <b>jihadi</b> <b>organisation.</b> JI, responsible for the 2002 Bali attack, is now the object of scorn from more militant groups, accused of abandoning jihad. It continues to exert an influence through its schools, however, and many disaffected former members remain active through other organisations. Several smaller groups have emerged as well, often composed of inexperienced young amateurs who lack the skills, discipline and strategic vision of the generation that trained on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border between 1985 and 1994 and produced the Bali bombers. Materials posted on radical websites suggest that the more educated extremists have learned important lessons from the Aceh experience, especially in terms of awareness of the extent to which their ranks have been infiltrated by the “enemy” – the Indonesian state. They conclude that they must be much more careful about vetting members, protecting communications and guarding secrets. If jihadis were to heed these lessons, the task of the police could become much harder. There has been less introspection within the government about why recruitment continues to take place or why there are so many more terrorist plots – even if most have been poorly conceived. Indonesia’s counter-terrorism successes have all been due to good law enforcement. The police have become skilled at identifying and arresting those responsible for violent crimes and interdicting plots as long as there is evidence, such as illegal possession of guns or explosives, on which to act. But virtually no effective programs are in place to address the environment in which jihadi ideology continues to flourish. RECOMMENDATIONS To the Government of Indonesia: 1.  Design a study to examine the networks extremists use to find sanctuary when they believe they are being pursued by police or that the place they are living has become insecure. Such a study could help define the support base for violent extremists in a way that could inform counter-extremism programs. Prisoners arrested in connection with the Aceh camp would be one possible respondent pool. 2.   Design a program aimed at reducing the influence of extremist clerics that would include: a)  developing a consensus on what constitutes incitement and hate speech, then getting broad agreement from Muslim community leaders that such rhetoric is unacceptable; b)  ensuring that no government building and no institution receiving government funding can host anyone promoting such teachings; c)  identifying four or five target areas or specific institutions where extremist influence is high; d)  undertaking research in those areas to develop a profile of the followers of these clerics, with attention to socio-economic, educational and employment backgrounds of members and questions about what attracts them to the teaching; and e)  developing pilot programs, in consultation with community leaders and scholars, that might effectively challenge the teachings of extremist clerics; these should be regularly monitored, evaluated and adjusted as necessary. 3.   Strengthen capacity within the National Anti-Terrorism Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Terorisme, BNPT) to analyse ideological debates on radical networks for clues as to changes of targets and tactics. 4.   Develop procedures for better information sharing among the BNPT; the Corrections Directorate within the law and human rights ministry; police; and prosecutors about extremist networks and individuals within them, with a view to their obtaining better understanding of not only the backgrounds of individual inmates but also the context in which they operate. 5.   Speed up efforts to put in place a system under the Corrections Directorate for identifying and monitoring high-risk detainees, both while in detention as well as after their release, to include: a)  adoption of a professional risk assessment protocol, with evaluations of inmates conducted by trained officials and based on careful research; and b)  a pilot project to work out possible weaknesses and make adjustments accordingly. 6.   Upgrade analytical capacity of corrections staff so that data systems now in operation can be used to improve supervision, as well as budgeting and planning. 7.   Design and implement a policy of zero tolerance toward any religiously-inspired violence, including maximum sentences for vandalism, assault and threats of violence, with clear instructions to all government employees, including police, to shun interaction with groups or members of groups that have a known history of such activity. 8.   Implement more serious post-operation assessments within the police to study what might have been done differently, especially when use of lethal force has resulted in serious injury or death, and increase training in the study of non-lethal options when confronting active shooters. 9.   Close loopholes in airport security that allow passengers to present false identification without fear of detection. 10.   Make more systematic use of the expertise of young Indonesian scholars when developing policy on countering extremism...|$|E

40|$|Globalisation is {{affecting}} communities {{of people in}} sometimes surprising ways. One such impact of globalisation {{has been on the}} Islamic identity of salafi jihadi groups. Globalisation is driving a decontextualised and deculturalised conception of Islam within salafi <b>jihadi</b> <b>organisations</b> and this fuels identity conflicts with other Muslim groups based on competition between cultural and 'anticultural' forces. This identity conflict culminates in terrorism as a rational and political attempt to 'securitise' group identities that are under attack. This paper seeks to shed light on what is animating salafi jihadi terrorism and examines the Indonesian organisation Jemaah Islamiyah as a case study. The paper concludes that globalisation is leaving a 'footprint' on societies, influencing political and religious movements and inflaming identity conflicts, and that this leads to terrorism. It is thus important that theorists develop detailed proposals to offset the negative impacts of globalisation on global security...|$|R
40|$|Violent {{extremism}} in Indonesia {{is increasingly}} taking {{the form of}} small groups acting independently of large <b>jihadi</b> <b>organisations.</b> This report by the International Crisis Group looks at how ideological shifts originating in the Middle East have combined with local circumstances to produce a trend that favours targeted killings over indiscriminate bombings, local over foreign targets and individual or small group action over operations by more hierarchical organisations. The report provides detailed case studies of small violent groups that have emerged in Indonesia in 2009 and 2010 in Medan and Lampung, on Sumatra, and in Bandung and Klaten, on Java. All involved at least one former prisoner. Three of the four had links to Jama’ah Anshorul Tauhid (JAT), the organisation founded by radical cleric Abu Bakar Ba’asyir, but seem to have planned and carried out operations on their own. Three of the four also involved mosque-based study groups that evolved into hit squads. All were committed {{to the idea of}} ightiyalat, secret assassinations, a concept that has gained popularity in part through the translations into Indonesian of radical tracts by members of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. By contrast, advocates of “organisational” as opposed to “individual” jihad believe that if the ultimate goal is an Islamic state, then public support is critical. Rather than engage in violence, groups like Jemaah Islamiyah and JAT are focused for the moment on building up a mass base, by finding issues that resonate with their target audience. Increasingly this means a greater focus on local rather than foreign “enemies”, with officials who are seen as oppressors, particularly the police; Christians; and members of the Ahmadiyah sect topping the list. It also means a greater willingness than in the past to join coalitions with non-jihadi groups. While the two approaches may seem very different, they are in fact complementary. The larger <b>jihadi</b> <b>organisations</b> have the networks and the funds to support religious outreach via radio stations, religious study sessions, magazines and other media through which well-known radical ideologues can disseminate the basic principles of salafi jihadism. They provide the broader community from which small groups committed to “individual” jihad emerge...|$|R
