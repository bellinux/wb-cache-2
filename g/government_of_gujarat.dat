40|$|Background: This paper {{examines}} two state-led public–private demand-side {{financial support}} programs aiming to raise hospital delivery rates in two neighbouring Indian states—Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. The national Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) was complemented with a public–private partnership program Janani Sahayogi Yojana (JSaY) in Madhya Pradesh in which private obstetricians were paid to deliver poor women. A higher amount {{was paid for}} caesarean sections (CS) than for vaginal deliveries (VD). In Gujarat state, the state program Chiranjeevi Yojana (CY) paid private obstetricians a fixed amount for a block 100 deliveries irrespective of delivery mode. The two systems thus offered an opportunity to observe the influence of supplier-induced demand (SID) from opposite incentives related to delivery mode. Methods: The data from the two programs was sourced from the Departments of Health and Family Welfare, <b>Governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gujarat</b> and Madhya Pradesh, India. Results: In JSaY program the CS rate increased from 26. 6 % (2007 – 2008) to 40. 7 % (2010 – 2011), against the background rate for CS in Madhya Pradesh, of only 4. 9 % (2004 – 2006). Meanwhile in CY program in Gujarat, the CS rate decreased to 4. 3 % (2010 – 2011) against a background CS rate of 8. 1 % (2004 – 2006). Conclusions: The findings from India are unique in that they not only point to a significant impact from {{the introduction of the}} financial incentives but also how disincentives have an inverse impact on the choice of delivery method.
