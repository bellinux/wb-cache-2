25|$|For {{model year}} 1999 a minor {{facelift}} was introduced. Apart from very minor cosmetic changes like the square XC-style roof rails replacing the rounded version {{and a slightly}} changed logo for the front grill, it concentrated on the mechanicals. Volvo introduced <b>dual</b> <b>stage</b> frontal airbag deployment logic and its second generation side airbag which was increased in volume to offer better protection. WHIPS was also introduced {{as part of the}} standard equipment. New engine management systems with drive-by-wire throttle replaced the mechanical throttle on turbo models and an upgraded traction control now called STC was introduced. The ABS was upgraded from a three-channel to a four-channel system, while all-wheel drive models received thicker rear discs and redesigned rear calipers. The 4-speed automatic transmissions were upgraded to adaptive shift logic.|$|E
25|$|In {{the safety}} aspect the Statesman comes with Bosch Electronic Stability Control, {{traction}} control, ABS brakes, EBD, BAS and a tyre pressure monitoring system as standard Front, side and curtain airbags come as standard {{which is another}} incentive to improve the Caprice's safety equipment, this {{also contributed to the}} fact that the Caprice’s safety rating surpass that off its main rival, the LTD. Development commenced with the largest virtual crash modelling program Holden has ever undertaken. Emphasis was placed on considering the range of impact scenarios that occur in real world accident situations and differing occupant criteria. Safety technologies were benchmarked along with the world’s leading luxury brands and major engineering programs delivered a stiffer body structure and vastly increased usage of advanced strength steels. Multiple load corridor strategies for frontal, side and rear impacts improve passenger compartment integrity. They are complemented by an improved multi-point airbag sensing system and an adaptive restraint system which includes <b>dual</b> <b>stage</b> front airbags, thorax side impact airbags, curtain airbags and front seat active head restraints as standard equipment. Structurally optimised crush zones absorb crash energy and other occupant protection features include a steering column ride-down mechanism and breakaway brake pedal.|$|E

2500|$|The Lexus LFA {{is powered}} by a 72-degree bank angle 4.8-liter V10 engine {{equipped}} with dual VVT-i carrying the 1LR-GUE designation with a maximum output of [...] delivered at 8,700rpm. Its maximum torque output of [...] arrives at 6,800rpm, 90percent of which is available from 3,700rpm. The engine redlines at 9,000rpm, but with a fuel cutoff set at 9,500rpm, and is constructed using forged aluminum pistons, forged titanium connecting rods, and solid titanium valves. The V-angle of the LFA's V-10 engine is set to 72-degrees to fully balance the firing force from the pistons. This 72-degree angle allows for even firing from the pistons without the use of a split-journal crankshaft, thus improving engine efficiency as well as lowering overall weight. Dry sump lubrication prevents engine oil starvation through high speed corners and lowers the engine's center of mass. Air is fed directly from beneath the hood through a visible slit passing into a <b>dual</b> <b>stage</b> variable intake manifold and then into ten individual throttle bodies before finally exiting from a dual-stage titanium muffler.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the investigation of}} the <b>Dual</b> Fuel Two <b>Stage</b> Combustion Engine using 1 D simulation software Ricardo WAVE. The study is carried out against a typical baseline single cylinder direct injection (DI) naturally aspirated diesel engine of 330 cc and a compression ratio of 17. 6. The compression ratio of the concept engine is reduced to 12 whilst the capacity is kept the same by increasing the clearance volume. It is postulated {{that at the end of}} the compression process the first stage of combustion is achieved by directly injecting petrol fuel inside the cylinder producing a stratified charge which would be ignited with the aid of a spark plug. The quantity of petrol injected should produce an amount of heat just enough to bring the cylinder pressure at the end of its combustion to be equal to that of the DI diesel engine at the end of its compression process. The second stage of combustion will then start by directly injecting diesel fuel inside the cylinder, the amount is such that the total heat added in both stages are equivalent to that added during the baseline diesel engine.
