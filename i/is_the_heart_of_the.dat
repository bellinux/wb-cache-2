Development of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E

This building contains two murals: one about the Totonacs by Teodoro Cano Garcia and the other by Xolotl Martinez Hurtado de Mendoza. The construction of the building dates from 1810 although it was destroyed by forces associated with Pancho Villa in 1915. The building was reconstructed in 1929, with remodeling done in 1979 and 1999. The plaza is officially named the Israel C. Téllez Park, which contains grass {{and a number of}} trees. In this plaza are weekend events such as the Danzón Fridays as well as live music on Saturday and cultural events on Sundays.

500|$|Fleming used known {{brand names}} and {{everyday}} details {{to produce a}} sense of realism, which the writer Kingsley Amis calls [...] "the Fleming effect". Amis describes [...] "the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world... bolted down {{to some sort of}} reality, or at least counter-balanced." [...] The journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees the novel as [...] "the most fantastical, gothic and melodramatic; and at times frankly, even knowingly, over the top", while Black considers the fantastic element of Doctor No's underground lair to be a [...] "weak" [...] and [...] "bizarre" [...] part of the story. When the writer Raymond Chandler reviewed the novel, he thought [...] "that the long sensational business which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book not only borders on fantasy. It plunges in with both feet. Ian Fleming's impetuous imagination has no rules." [...] Writing in 1963, Fleming acknowledged his plots were [...] "fantastical while often being based in truth. They go wildly beyond the probable but not, I think, beyond the possible".|$|E
500|$|Starship Troopers {{has been}} {{identified}} as being a part of a tradition in U.S. science fiction that assumes that violent conflict and the militarization of society is inevitable and necessary. Although the Mobile Infantry, the unit to which Rico is assigned, is seen as a lowly post by the characters in the story, the novel itself suggests that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army and the most honorable unit in it. In a commentary written in 1980, Heinlein agreed that Starship Troopers [...] "glorifies the military ... Specifically the P.B.I., the Poor Bloody Infantry, the mudfoot who places his frail body between his loved home and the war's desolation – but is rarely appreciated... he has the toughest job of all and should be honored." [...] The story is based on the social Darwinist idea of society as a struggle for survival based on military strength. It suggests that some conflicts must be resolved by force: one of the lessons Rico is repeatedly taught is that violence can be an effective method of settling conflict. These suggestions derive in part from Heinlein's view that in the 1950s the U.S. government was being too conciliatory in its dealings with communist China and the Soviet Union.|$|E
