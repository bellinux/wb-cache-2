Municipally, the network is used by city inspectors and employees, with plans in place for the police and fire departments to use <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> In 2007, when the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapsed, the wireless system helped coordinate rescuers and emergency services. The city and USI Wireless have won praise for the network, which has been singled out for being one of the few successful municipal wireless ventures nationwide among a number of stalled or failed projects.|$|E
5|$|A second form of mimicry {{occurs when}} two aposematic organisms {{share the same}} anti-predator {{adaptation}} and mimic each other, {{to the benefit of}} both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of mimicry is known as Müllerian mimicry, after Fritz Müller, a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are Müllerian mimics; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a negative experience with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Müllerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which looks very similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area.|$|E

5|$|Extinction is the {{disappearance}} of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction. Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct, and extinction {{appears to be the}} ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier Permian–Triassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction. The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event; global warming may further accelerate <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E
5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting on it now and threatening to impact on <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E

Scalia also noted that biological parents also had legal rights {{and that there was no}} reason in law or policy to dilute those rights.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, in {{response}} to illegal metal detecting near the hoard find, a follow-up excavation of the field {{was carried out by}} the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service. The hoard burial hole was re-excavated, and a single post hole at the southwest corner was identified; this may have been the location of a marker post to enable the depositors of the cache to locate and recover <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Soil was removed in [...] spits for analysis in the area [...] around the find spot, and metal detectors were used to locate metal artefacts. This excavation recovered 335 items datable to the Roman period, mostly coins but also some box fittings. A series of late Bronze Age or early Iron Age post holes, which may have formed a structure, were found. However, no structural features of the Roman period were detected.|$|E
500|$|The {{next issue}} {{contained}} [...] "The Scientists' Revolt", by Edgar Rice Burroughs, a name guaranteed to help sales.

Palmer eventually acquired it, and rewrote it, setting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Despite the weakness of the lead story, the second issue was a marked improvement over the first, with well-received stories by Nelson S. Bond and John Russell Fearn (as [...] "Thornton Ayre"). Burroughs returned to Fantastic Adventures in 1941, with a series of novelettes in his Carson of Venus series; there were four in all between March 1941 and March 1942, each with cover art by J. Allen St. John, and the result was a significant boost to Fantastic Adventures circulation.|$|E

500|$|Rubin {{encouraged}} a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach and wanted {{the group to}} bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, [...] "we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's {{in the process of}} recording that we really do our writing." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in.

500|$|The Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year is {{an annual}} cricket award, {{presented}} to the young player who is adjudged {{to have been the}} best of the year in English county cricket.

Only players that are qualified to represent the England cricket team, and are aged under 23 on 1 May of the awarding year, are eligible for the prize. With the exception of 1986, when a joint award was made, the accolade has been presented to one individual each season.

500|$|The basic {{concepts}} of most DKP systems are simple. [...] Players are given points {{for participating in}} raids or other guild events and spend those points on the item of their choice when the boss 'drops' the item. [...] A player who does not {{get a chance to}} spend their DKP accumulates it between raids and is able to spend <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> [...] These points, while earned and spent like currency, are {{not the same thing as}} the virtual currency provided by the game company for the virtual world. [...] The points themselves represent only the social contract that guilds extend to players. [...] Should that player leave the guild or the guild disband, those points become valueless. [...] These measures vary considerably in usage. [...] Some guilds eschew formalized 'loot' systems completely, allowing guild leaders to direct which players receive items from bosses. [...] Some use complex measures to determine item price while others use an auction system to allocate goods via bidding. [...] A few common variations are described below.|$|E

Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition.

When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language.

[...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E
