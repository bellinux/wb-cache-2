5|$|Seal <b>impressions</b> {{found in}} Peribsen's tomb at Abydos show several deities: Ash, Min and Bastet, {{suggesting}} they were venerated during Peribsen's {{time on the}} throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting monotheism. The heretic theory of Newberry, Černý, Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological information available during their lifetimes. Most of the found clay seal <b>impressions</b> were still undeciphered and untranslated at their time.|$|E
5|$|The debate {{continues}} over why Peribsen {{chose this}} name. Earlier theories have favoured {{the idea that}} Egypt was split in two realms during Peribsen's time or {{that he was a}} heretic, who sought to start a new monotheistic religion with Seth as the only worshipped god. However, newer evidence and evaluations tend to show that the Egyptian kingdom was unified, but witnessed a vast and profound reform during the second dynasty. Seal <b>impressions</b> from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials, pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal <b>impressions</b> show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen, refuting the monotheism theory, with other contemporary inscriptions indicating that the Egyptian grammar was perfected during his reign: In particular, the earliest seal <b>impressions</b> with complete sentences date back to Peribsen's reign. Thus, Peribsen's reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the soft tissue of temnospondyls. A block of sandstone, {{described}} in 2007 from the Early Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania, included <b>impressions</b> of the bodies of three temnospondyls. These <b>impressions</b> show, when alive, they had smooth skin, robust limbs with webbed feet, and a ridge of skin on their undersides. Trackways referable to small temnospondyls have also been found in Carboniferous and Permian rocks. The trackways, called batrachichni, are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments, suggesting the animals had some ties to the water.|$|E
