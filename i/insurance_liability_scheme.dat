40|$|BACKGROUND Repeated {{analyses}} of the Swedish national workers’ compensation claims data material in the Occupational No-Fault <b>Liability</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Scheme</b> have pointed to {{the high incidence of}} severe hand injury associated with getting caught in rotating (drilling, milling, boring, turning, grinding) machines in the metal manufacturing and engineering industry (Jedeskog & Larsson, 1988; Larsson, 1990; Persson, 1992). In an analysis of all permanently disabling injuries sustained in the Swedish engineering industry during 1986, six out of ten injuries associated with machines for drilling, boring and threading were caused by the operator getting caught in the rotating tool or work-piece with his/her glove or other garment (Larsson, 1990). In a repeated analysis of the national claims data material from the Swedish engineering industry for the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, half of all injuries sustained at the same types of rotating machines were due to glove getting caught in the rotating action (Persson, 1992). A development project aimed at reducing the risk of traumatic hand injury associated with rotating action machines was initiated in 1994 by the Institute for Human Safety and Accident Research (IPSO), in co-operation with the Swedish Institute of Production Engineering Research. The main focus of the work has been to develop an improved solution to emergency braking and to drastically reduce inertia rotation in the relevant machine types. QC 2011070...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{dramatic}} {{increases in}} prices for medical <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> {{directors and officers}} insurance, and other lines of commercial <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> together with the exit of some insurers from those lines of business, has placed <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> on the public agenda. At the same time, asbestos and environmental losses continue to mount under general <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> policies sold long ago, when {{no one could have}} predicted the extent or cost of such losses. In combination, these and other related events have raised serious concerns about the insurability of liability risks and have prompted calls for dramatic efforts to roll back the advance of liability law in the U. S. and Europe. With this ‘‘crisis’’ as the background, this essay represents a preliminary effort to explore <b>insurance</b> for <b>liability</b> risks, with the goal of articulating a framework that will guide more systematic and empirical study. In the main part of this essay I describe a new conceptual framework for analysing <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> risks. The framework helps explain why predicting losses can be so difficult in the <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> context and why cycles in insurance pricing are more extreme in <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> than in other lines of insurance. Much of this difficulty is already understood to follow from the ‘‘long tail’’ or ‘‘duration of liability’’ problem in <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> The primary contribution of the new framework is breaking apart what I will call ‘‘liability developments risk’’ for separate analysis, facilitating a better understanding of when and why the duration of liability matters. In concluding, I use a brief analysis of medical <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> to offer some observations on insurability and to sound the call for systematic empirical research aimed at improving how <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> institutions manage <b>liability</b> developments risk...|$|R

By using data from experimental repayment games conducted in Vietnam, with noisy signals that resemble actual microcredit programs, we found that subjects were motivated to free-ride under the joint <b>liability</b> <b>scheme.</b> While most empirical {{research in this area}} has focused on the problem of contagion, our findings point to the significance of investigating free-riding behavior under joint <b>liability</b> <b>schemes.</b> Analyses reveal that the free-riding tendency may be led by the irresponsiveness of repayment and shouldering behavior to the partner’s seemingly strategic default in the previous round...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates market-consistent {{valuation}} of <b>insurance</b> <b>liabilities</b> {{in the context}} of Solvency II among others and to some extent IFRS 4. We propose an explicit and consistent framework for the {{valuation of}} <b>insurance</b> <b>liabilities</b> which incorporates the Solvency II approach as a special case. The proposed framework is based on replication over multiple (one-year) time periods by a periodically updated portfolio of assets with reliable market prices, allowing for "limited liability” {{in the sense that the}} replication can in general not always be continued. The asset portfolio consists of two parts: (1) assets whose market price defines the value of the <b>insurance</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and (2) capital funds used to cover risk which cannot be replicated. The capital funds give rise to capital costs; the main exogenous input in the framework is the condition on when the investment of the capital funds is acceptable. We investigate existence of the value and show that the exact calculation of the value has to be done recursively backwards in time, starting at the end of the lifetime of the <b>insurance</b> <b>liabilities.</b> We derive upper bounds on the value and, for the special case of replication by risk-free one-year zero-coupon bonds, explicit recursive formulas for calculating the value. In the paper, we only partially consider the question of the uniqueness of the value. Valuation in Solvency II and IFRS 4 is based on representing the value as a sum of a "best estimate” and a "risk margin”. In our framework, it turns out that this split is not natural. Nonetheless, we show that a split can be constructed as a simplification, and that it provides an upper bound on the value under suitable conditions. We illustrate the general results by explicitly calculating the value for a simple exampl...|$|R
