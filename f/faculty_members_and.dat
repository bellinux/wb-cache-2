5|$|As Mormonism gained {{popularity}} in the Pacific, church-sponsored schools became more common.

5|$|In 1929, Walsh and {{the other}} members of the Board of Regents {{resigned}} in the wake of the collapse of the Florida economy. UM's plight was so severe that students went door to door in Coral Gables collecting funds to keep it open. A reconstituted ten-member Board was chaired by UM's first president Bowman Foster Ashe (1926–1952). The new board included Merrick, Theodore Dickinson, E.B. Douglas, David Fairchild, James H. Gilman, Richardson Saunders, Frank B. Shutts, Joseph H. Adams, and J. C. Penney. In 1930, several <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> more than 60 students came to UM when the University of Havana closed due to political unrest. UM filed for bankruptcy in 1932.
