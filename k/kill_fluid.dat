50|$|The {{objective}} in a well kill, {{is to make}} the pressure {{at the bottom of the}} <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> equal (or slightly greater) than the pressure of the reservoir fluids.|$|E
5000|$|The {{intention}} of a well kill (or {{the reality of}} an unintentional well kill) is to stop reservoir fluids flowing to surface. This of course creates problems when it is desirable to get the well flowing again. In order to reverse the well kill, the <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> must be displaced from the well bore. This involves injecting a gas at high pressure, usually nitrogen since it is inert and relatively cheap. A gas can be put under sufficient pressure {{to allow it to}} push heavy <b>kill</b> <b>fluid,</b> but will then expand and become light once pressure is removed. This means that having displaced the <b>kill</b> <b>fluid,</b> it will not itself kill the well. Low density ("light") liquids such as diesel fuel, or the [...] "base fluid" [...] for a [...] "(synthetic) oil-based mud" [...] can also be used, depending on availability and pressure-management issues for a specific well. The reservoir fluids should be able to flow to surface, displacing the gas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pressure}} of the reservoir fluids {{at the bottom of}} the hole is 38MPa. We have a <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> with a weight density of 16kN.m−3. What will need to be the height of the hydrostatic head in order to kill the well? ...|$|E

50|$|Pump-in subs (also {{known as}} a flow T) allow for the {{injection}} of fluid into the pressure control string. Normally these are used for wellsite pressure testing, which is typically performed between every run into the well.

50|$|This {{is similar}} to reverse circulation, except the <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> is pumped into the {{production}} tubing and circulated out through the annulus. Though effective, {{it is not as}} desirable since it is preferred that the well bore fluids be displaced out to production, rather than the annulus.|$|E
50|$|This {{is often}} the tidiest way of making a planned well kill. It {{involves}} pumping <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> down the 'A' annulus of the well, through a point of communication {{between it and the}} production tubing just above the production packer and up the tubing, displacing the lighter well bore fluids, which are allowed to flow to production.|$|E
5000|$|Drilling a [...] "relief well" [...] {{to relieve}} the {{pressure}} of a well producing without restraint (a [...] "blowout"). In this scenario, another well could be drilled starting {{at a safe distance}} away from the blowout, but intersecting the troubled wellbore. Then, heavy fluid (<b>kill</b> <b>fluid)</b> is pumped into the relief wellbore to suppress the high pressure in the original wellbore causing the blowout.|$|E
25|$|This component, placed {{towards the}} foot of the {{completion}} string, is used to provide two way isolation from the formation for completion operations without the need for <b>kill</b> weight <b>fluids.</b> Their use is sporadic as they do not enjoy the best reputation for reliability when it comes to opening them {{at the end of the}} completion process.|$|R
60|$|I {{believe it}} is well ascertained that the bladder of the frog acts as a {{reservoir}} for the moisture necessary to its existence: such {{seems to be the}} case with the tortoise. For some time after a visit to the springs, their urinary bladders are distended with fluid, which is said gradually to decrease in volume, and to become less pure. The inhabitants, when walking in the lower district, and overcome with thirst, often take advantage of this circumstance, and drink the contents of the bladder if full: in one I saw <b>killed,</b> the <b>fluid</b> was quite limpid, and had only a very slightly bitter taste. The inhabitants, however, always first drink the water in the pericardium, which is described as being best.|$|R

50|$|The first {{response}} to detecting a kick {{would be to}} isolate the wellbore from the surface by activating the blow-out preventers and closing in the well. Then the drilling crew would attempt to circulate in a heavier <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> to increase the hydrostatic pressure (sometimes {{with the assistance of}} a well control company). In the process, the influx fluids will be slowly circulated out in a controlled manner, taking care not to allow any gas to accelerate up the wellbore too quickly by controlling casing pressure with chokes on a predetermined schedule.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cheapest}} {{way to do}} it {{is similar}} to bullheading, where the light fluid (nitrogen, or low density liquid) is pumped in under high pressure to force the <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> into the reservoir. This, of course, runs a high risk of causing well damage. The most effective way is to use coiled tubing, pumping the gas/diesel down the coil and circulating out the bottom into the well bore, where it will displace the kill mud to production. (Of course, getting a coiled tubing spread to the location may take weeks of work and logistics.) ...|$|E
50|$|This is {{the most}} common method of a {{contingency}} well kill. If there is a sudden need to kill a well quickly, without the time for rigging up for circulation, the more blunt instrument of bullheading may be used. This involves simply pumping the <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> directly down the well bore, forcing the well bore fluids back into the reservoir. This can be effective at achieving the central aim of a well kill; building up a sufficient hydrostatic head in the well bore. However, it can be limited by the burst-pressure capabilities of the tubing or casing, and can risk damaging the reservoir by forcing undesired materials into it. The principal advantage is that it can be done with little advanced planning.|$|E

Exogenous histamine markedly inhibited the ConA-induced ascites. Release of endogenous vasoactive agents from the mast cells by Compound 48 / 80 had a similar, but slight effect. Cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizing agent, and chloropyramine, a histamine H 1 receptor antagonist was ineffective. Although histamine increases endothelial permeability, it did not enhance the formation of ascitic fluid, on the contrary, it inhibited the ConA-induced ascites, presumably due to its known hypotonic effect. It is concluded that ConA-induced ascites is not mediated by mast cell histamine...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} the usual {{experience}} that influenza virus pneumonia of mice is readily transmitted by serial passage; that is, suspensions of lungs from mice which die {{as the result of}} intranasal introduction of the virus produce death, or at least extensive pulmonary lesions, when introduced into normal mice by the intranasal route. However, during the adaptation of the Cam strain of influ-enza A prime virus to nice, we observed that, although the infected allantoic <b>fluid</b> <b>killed</b> the mice on the third or fourth day with complete pulmonary consol-idation, suspensions of lungs obtained from those animals did not produce pul-monary lesions when introduced into the lungs of normal mice.

40|$|The {{malignant}} growth potential of embryonal carcinoma cells may {{be controlled by}} environmental factors. For example, embryonal carcinoma cells placed into normal blastocysts may not exhibit the continued growth expected of malignant cells but rather may lose {{all aspects of the}} malignant phenotype and become apparently normal embryonic cells. Loss of the malignant phenotype of embryonal carcinoma cells occurs early in these injected blastocysts and has been used as the basis of assays to study the mechanisms of regulation of embryonal carcinoma by the blastocyst. In this regard, P 19, an embryonal carcinoma that makes midgestation chimeras, was regulated by blastocele fluid plus contact with trophectoderm but not by blastocele fluid plus contact with inner cell mass (ICM). In contrast, ECa 247, which makes trophectoderm, was regulated by exposure to blastocele fluid plus contact with trophectoderm or ICM. During the course of these experiments, dead embryonal carcinoma and ICM cells were observed, and blastocele fluid was then shown to kill ECa 247 and normal ICM cells of early blastocysts with trophectodermal potential. P 19 cells and ICM cells with potential to make the embryo were not <b>killed</b> by blastocele <b>fluid.</b> Programmed cell death occurs in the ICM of the blastocyst during the transition from early (when ICM has the potential to make trophectoderm) to late (when the ICM lacks the potential to make trophectoderm). It is postulated that this programmed cell death is designed to eliminate redundant ICM cells with trophectodermal potential, and its mechanism of action is mediated by epigenetic factors in blastocele fluid...|$|R
50|$|The most typical use for {{coiled tubing}} is {{circulation}} or deliquification. A hydrostatic head (a column of fluid {{in the well}} bore) may be inhibiting flow of formation fluids because of its weight (the well {{is said to have}} been killed). The safest (though not the cheapest) solution would be to attempt to circulate out the fluid, using a gas, frequently nitrogen (Often called a Nitrogen Kick). By running coiled tubing into the bottom of the hole and pumping in the gas, the <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> can be forced out to production. Circulating can also be used to clean out light debris, which may have accumulated in the hole. Coiled tubing umbilicals can convey hydraulic submersible pumps and jet pumps into wells. These pumps allow for inexpensive and noninvasive well cleanouts on low-pressure CBM (coal bed methane) gas wells. These umbilicals can also be run into deviated wells and horizontal laterals.|$|E
40|$|There {{are plenty}} of {{uncertainties}} and enormous challenges in deep water drilling due to complicated shallow flow and deep strata of high temperature and pressure. This paper investigates density of dynamic <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> and optimum density during the kill operation process in which dynamic kill process {{can be divided into}} two stages, that is, dynamic stable stage and static stable stage. The dynamic <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> consists of a single liquid phase and different solid phases. In addition, liquid phase is a mixture of water and oil. Therefore, a new method in calculating the temperature and pressure field of deep water wellbore is proposed.

30|$|To kill a live {{closed-in}} {{gas well}} by bull-heading down the tubing, the selected pump rate should be {{high enough to}} ensure efficient displacement of the gas into the formation (i.e. to avoid the <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> bypassing the gas).

Given these constraints, the optimum kill rate, required hydraulic horsepower, density, and type of kill fluids have to be selected.|$|E
40|$|The major {{problems}} {{associated with the use of}} corticosteroids for the treatment of ocular diseases are their poor intraocular penetration to the posterior segment when administered locally and their secondary side effects when given systemically. To circumvent these problems more efficient methods and techniques of local delivery are being developed. The purposes of this study were: (1) to investigate the pharmacokinetics of intraocular penetration of hemisuccinate methyl prednisolone (HMP) after its delivery using the transscleral Coulomb controlled iontophoresis (CCI) system applied to the eye or after intravenous (i. v.) injection in the rabbit, (2) to test the safety of the CCI system for the treated eyes and (3) to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of HMP intraocular distribution after CCI delivery to i. v. injection. For each parameter evaluated, six rabbit eyes were used. For the CCI system, two concentrations of HMP (62. 5 and 150 mg ml(- 1)), various intensities of current and duration of treatment were analyzed. In rabbits serving as controls the HMP was infused in the CCI device but without applied electric current. For the i. v. delivery, HMP at 10 mg kg(- 1) as a 62. 5 mg ml(- 1) solution was used. The rabbits were observed clinically for evidence of ocular toxicity. At various time points after the administration of drug, rabbits were <b>killed</b> and intraocular <b>fluids</b> and tissues were sampled for methylprednisolone (MP) concentrations by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Histology examinations were performed on six eyes of each group. Among groups that received CCI, the concentrations of MP increased in all ocular tissues and fluids in relation to the intensities of current used (0. 4, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mA/ 0. 5 cm(2)) and its duration (4 and 10 min). Sustained and highest levels of MP were achieved in the choroid and the retina of rabbit eyes treated with the highest current and 10 min duration of CCI. No clinical toxicity or histological lesions were observed following CCI. Negligible amounts of MP were found in ocular tissues in the CCI control group without application of current. Compared to i. v. administration, CCI achieved higher and more sustained tissue concentrations with negligible systemic absorption. These data demonstrate that high levels of MP can be safely achieved in intraocular tissues and fluids of the rabbit eye, using CCI. With this system, intraocular tissues levels of MP are higher than those achieved after i. v. injection. Furthermore, if needed, the drug levels achieved with CCI can be modulated as a function of current intensity and duration of treatment. CCI could therefore be used as an alternative method for the delivery of high levels of MP to the intraocular tissues of both the anterior and posterior segments...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} and tissue distribution of 5 -fluorouracil administered intraperitoneally with two isotonic carrier solutions: HAES-steri (neotype 6 % hydroxyethyl starch), a novel carrier solution with middle molecular weight and physiologic saline (0. 9 % sodium chloride solution), a traditional carrier solution for intraperitoneal chemotherapy, in rats. METHODS: A total of 60 Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into groups {{according to the}} carrier solution administered. Each group was further randomized according to the intraperitoneal dwell period (1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h). At {{the end of the}} procedure the rats were <b>killed,</b> the peritoneal <b>fluid</b> was withdrawn completely and quantitated. Drug concentrations in peritoneal fluid, plasma, and tissues were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean volumes remaining in the peritoneal cavity were significantly higher with HAES-steri than those with physiologic saline at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h (P = 0. 047, 0. 009, 0. 005, 0. 005 and 0. 005 respectively, the percentages of remaining peritoneal fluid volume were 89. 9 ± 5. 6 vs 83. 4 ± 4. 9, 79. 9 ± 2. 8 vs 56. 2 ± 15. 7, 46. 8 ± 5. 5 vs 24. 7 ± 9. 7, 23. 0 ± 2. 8 vs 0. 0 ± 0. 0 and 4. 2 ± 1. 7 vs 0. 0 ± 0. 0 respectively). Mean concentrations in peritoneal fluid were significantly higher with HAES-steri than those with physiologic saline at 3, 12 and 18 h (P = 0. 009, 0. 009 and 0. 005 respectively, the concentrations were 139. 2768 ± 28. 2317 mg/L vs mg/L, 11. 5427 ± 3. 0976 mg/L vs 0. 0000 ± 0. 0000 mg/L and 4. 7724 ± 1. 0936 mg/L vs 0. 0000 ± 0. 0000 mg/L respectively). Mean plasma 5 -fluorouracil concentrations in portal vein were significantly higher with HAES-steri at 3, 12, 18 and 24 h (P = 0. 009, 0. 034, 0. 005 and 0. 019 respectively, the concentrations were 3. 3572 ± 0. 8128 mg/L vs 0. 8794 ± 0. 2394 mg/L, 0. 6203 ± 0. 9935 mg/L vs 0. 0112 ± 0. 0250 mg/L, 0. 3725 ± 0. 3871 mg/L vs 0. 0000 ± 0. 0000 mg/L, and 0. 2469 ± 0. 1457 mg/L vs 0. 0000 ± 0. 0000 mg/L respectively), but significantly lower at 1 h (P = 0. 009, the concentrations were 4. 1957 ± 0. 6952 mg/L vs 7. 7406 ± 1. 2377 mg/L). There {{were no significant differences in}} the plasma 5 -fluorouracil in inferior caval vein at each time-point. 5 -fluorouracil concentrations were significantly greater with HAES-steri at 18 h in gastric tissue (P = 0. 016, the concentrations were 0. 9486 ± 0. 8173 mg/L vs 030392 ± 0. 0316 mg/L), at 18 h in colon (P = 0. 009, the concentrations were 0. 1730 ± 0. 0446 mg/L vs 0. 0626 ± 0. 0425 mg/L), at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h in liver (P = 0. 009, 0. 013, 0. 034 and 0. 013 respectively, the concentrations were 0. 6472685 ± 0. 5256 mg/L vs 0. 1554 ± 0. 1043 mg/L, 0. 8606826 ± 0. 7155 mg/L vs 0. 0014 ± 0. 0029 mg/L, 0. 0445 ± 0. 0330 mg/L vs 0. 0797 ± 0. 1005 mg/L and 0. 0863 ± 0. 0399 mg/L vs 0. 0034 ± 0. 0075 mg/L respectively) and at 18 h in lung (P = 0. 009, the concentrations were 0. 0886 ± 0. 0668 mg/L vs 0. 0094 ± 0. 0210 mg/L). There were no differences in 5 -fluorouracil concentrations in renal tissue at each time-point. CONCLUSION: The use of intraperitoneal 5 -fluoro-uracil with HAES-Steri carrier solution provides a pharmacokinetic advantage for a local-regional killing of residual tumor cells and improve the accumulated penetrability of 5 -fluorouracil with decreased systemic toxicity. Further clinical feasibility studies on the use of HAES-steri as carrier solution for intraperitoneal chemotherapy with 5 -fluorouracil are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} years, some {{domestic}} overflow and blowout events {{have shown that}} we can not apply conven-tional methods to successful well killing under some certain conditions, therefore, bullheading as an unconventional well killing can be considered. Bullheading by pumping <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> into wellbore makes the wellbore gas compressed so that bot-tomhole pressure exceeds formation pressure and gas leaks off to the formation. In this study, applicable conditions of bullheading have been discussed. Based on gas compressibility law and gas-liquid flow behavoir, bullheading operation is divided into three stages, including gas compression stage, gas seepage stage and gas-liquid seepage stage. The mathe-matical model for each stage is formulated to predict and interpret well killing mechanism. The calculated results showed good agreement with field case data. This paper might serve as an operational guideline during bullheading...|$|E
40|$|A kick can {{be defined}} as an {{unintended}} influx of formation fluids into a borehole. If the kick can’t be controlled it will evolve into a blowout. In this case a relief well would have to be drilled to stop the influx. To be able to kill the blowing well one need to increase the bottom hole pressure. When the bottom hole pressure in the well becomes greater than the reservoir pressure the influx is stopped. The method used to increase the bottom hole pressure is called dynamic kill. When drilling a relief well from a floater <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> is pumped from the relief well rig. The <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> goes down the kill and choke line through the BOP [Blow Out Preventer], into the annulus of the relief well, it continues further down the annulus to the intersect point and in to the blowing well. To be able to increase the BHP [Bottom Hole Pressure] one needs to deliver enough volume of mud at high enough pump rate. The blowing well will be stopped by pumping so fast that the pressure in the blowing well exceeds the formation pressure. When fluid is flowing in pipes it looses pressure; friction pressure. These friction pressure losses occurs in the pipes on the rig, in the kill and choke line and in annulus in both relief well and the blowing well. Different simulation tools has been used to run simulations to find out how the friction pressure is affected by water depth (length of kill and choke line), ID; [Internal Diameter] size on kill and choke line and mud-type used. These results are represented graphically. The water depth varied from 100 m- 1200 m, ID on kill and choke line from 3 ” to 4, 5 ” and mud weights varied from 1, 8 sg to 2, 2 sg.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsBlowouts {{represent}} one of {{the largest}} risks oil companies are exposed to during exploration and exploitation of petroleum resources, and the increasing complexity of e. g. drilling operations states the need for more sophisticated well control modeling tools. Dynamic kill is a technique combining the static head of a <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> with frictional pressure losses in order to suppress the reservoir pressure and kill the blowout. The technique can be modeled dynamically with the use of two-phase flow simulators based on conservation equations and closure laws for the different flowing phases. The result is a better understanding of blowout scenarios and parameters like bottom hole pressure, flow rate, pump rate, mud volume and <b>kill</b> <b>fluid</b> density. In this thesis a transient two-phase model based on the Advection Upstream Splitting Method (AUSMV) scheme has been constructed for the simulation of a dynamic kill. The starting point was a simple two-phase code for gas and liquid extended to a dynamic kill model suitable for oil and liquid. The extension was done through several programming steps: A numerical approach for finding the pressure parameter was implemented and verified, the friction model was changed to suit an oil blowout in a vertical well, a model for the productivity index (PI) was used to simulate the inflow of oil, the velocity of sound for the mixture fluid was changed according to recommendations, and finally a frictional pressure gradient for the relief well was implemented in order to find the required pump pressure for the dynamic kill operation. After running several simulations with different kill rates and observing the results, the model proved to be sufficient in describing a dynamic kill operation for a simplified oil blowout. The simulations revealed that the model contained a stiff source term, the PI model, switching on/off on a short timescale creating oscillations in the curve. To avoid the oscillations the model required a more sophisticated time integration procedure involving small time steps far below the CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy) criterion. In addition the blowing well was found to be slightly friction dominated, the increase in friction was larger than the reduction of the hydrostatic pressure when oil displaced water in the well. Future recommendations for the model include the implementation of several phases and the opportunity to simulate kill fluids with different densities. Wellbore geometries, blowout configurations and models for flow regimes and transitions should also be implemented. This will make the model more versatile for different dynamic kill scenarios in the future...|$|E
40|$|The worst {{scenario}} of drilling operation is blowout which is uncontrolled flow of formation fluid into the wellbore. Blowouts result in environmental damage with potential risk of injuries and fatalities. Although not all blowouts result in disaster, outcomes of blowouts are unknown {{and should be}} studied before starting an operation. Plans {{should be available to}} prevent blowouts or provide safe and secure ways of controlling the well before the drilling operation starts. The plan should include procedures in case of any blowout incident as a proactive measure. A few commercial softwares are available in the industry for dynamic kill and transient modeling. All models are proprietary and very complex which reduces the flexibility of the program for specific cases. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a pseudo transient hydraulic simulator for dynamic kill operations. The idea and concept is to consider the flow of each phase as a single phase flow. The summation of hydrostatic and frictional pressure of each phase determines the bottomhole pressure during the dynamic kill operation. The simulator should be versatile and capable of handling special cases that may encounter during blowouts. Some of the main features of the proposed dynamic kill simulator include; quick and robust simulation, fluid properties are corrected for pressure and temperature, sensitivity analysis can be performed through slide bars, and capable of handling variety of wellbore trajectories. The results from the proposed simulator were compared to the result of commercial software, OLGA ABC. The results were in agreement with each other.

40|$|Depleted reservoirs, damaged {{wells and}} high GOR ratio wells {{need to be}} estimulated in order to {{increase}} their production or to start it, normally, after wells under such circumstances have been intervened. Gas injection has been a default solution in decades for estimulating well production. The main reason for using gas at high injection rates is to circulate the column of fluids inside the well up to the surface and reduce the differential pressure across the wellbore so that the well may eventually produce by itself. As a simple analysis, mechanical pumps do the same function, they increase the fluid rate and decrease the differential pressure so that fluids can flow easier and be transported from one point to another. This study suggests the use of downhole Electrical Submersible Pumps and Progressive Cavity Pumps driven by electrical motors and not rods on subsea wells, in order to perform the same operation as nirogen injection. To reduce the differential pressure across the wellbore, transport the fluids from the wellbore to the surface, initially, so that the well may recover its flowing capacity. The pumps are not to be placed permanently and are intended to be suspended by means of intervention tools (CT & WL). Intervention operations are driven currently by three different kinds of equipments, BOP, LWRP and RLWI. Results suggest the use for pumping devices above the DHSV in cases where the well has been shut in and filled with <b>kill</b> <b>fluid.</b> Such intervention can be even driven by RLWI. However, wells with GOR ratios greater than 200 m 3 /m 3 may represent great technical and safety challenges.
