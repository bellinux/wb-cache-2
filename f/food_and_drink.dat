40|$|The <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> {{manufacturing}} {{industry is a}} diverse and complex sector. There are ample possibilities for performance improvement and innovation in the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> industry {{as well as a}} variety of challenges ranging from a lack of financial and human resources, fragmented consumer interests and concerns to the implementation of various, and new, regulations related to health, the environment, labour conditions, etc. The sector is caught between novelty and tradition. In contrast to all other products, <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> are ingested, healthy or unhealthy, from infants to old age, which calls for rather unique requirements for safety and health. But also other dimensions like taste, consistency, olfactory properties play a role along with ethical, religious and psychosocial aspects. The <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> {{manufacturing industry}} has strong links with down- and upstream sectors like agriculture, life sciences, packaging, logistics and retail, which also from an innovation perspective do play an important role. Although <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> are essential for human life and have a large influence on human health and wellbeing, the industrial sector of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> manufacturing is generally defined as mid-to-low tech in the literature (e. g.
