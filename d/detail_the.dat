5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in <b>detail</b> <b>the</b> physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
