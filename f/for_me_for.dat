[...] He subsequently describes major Lagosian intersections, including Ojuelegba, Surulere, and Ogogoro Centre, which lack the supervision of a traffic officer. They are characterized by aggressive, temperamental drivers, who force their vehicles into inextricable traffic jams: [...] "For Ojuelegba, moto dey come from south / Moto dey come from north / Moto dey come from east / Moto dey come from west / And policeman no dey for centre / Na confusion be that-i o / He go say he pafuka o." ...|$|E

500|$|Alkan's later {{correspondence}} {{contains many}} despairing comments. In {{a letter of}} about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: [...] "I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do... no one to devote myself to. My situation makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has lost its attraction <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> I can't see the point or goal." [...] This spirit of anomie may have led him to reject requests in the 1860s to play in public, or to allow performances of his orchestral compositions. However, {{it should not be}} ignored that he was writing similarly frantic self-analyses in his letters of the early 1830s to Masarnau.|$|E

[...] Samir Nasri, who left Arsenal to join Manchester City in 2011, in the lead-up to the match described the abuse he received from Arsenal supporters since his transfer as [...] "stupid."
