She unselfishly does what others expect of her, doing things like helping Charley escape their father to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> <b>and</b> living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in Our Mutual Friend, and even that is debatable, since she only did it because Wrayburn appeared to be on his deathbed.|$|E

25|$|An ethnic-based {{war that}} lasted {{for over a decade}} {{resulted}} in more than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 140,000 others internally.

25|$|Currently Nigerian {{women are}} making many advancements within their society. In recent years, three male {{dominated}} professions, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Nigerian Bar Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, have been led by female presidents. The subsequent {{creation of the}} National Commission for Women and a ministerial portfolio for Women Affairs provide additional avenues {{for the promotion of}} women's educational issues and the enhancement of {{the role of women in}} national development by way of a statutory body and a Ministry. Today, more children <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> learn to read and write than in previous decades. As a result, younger persons are much more likely to be literate than older persons. In a survey done by the International Education Statistics measured Nigerian literacy across different 5-year age groups. Among persons aged 15 to 19 years - those who were of primary school age in the 1990s - the literacy rate is 70%. Among persons 80 years or older, only 13% are literate. Additionally, the gap between boys and girls aged 15 to 19 is only 11%.|$|E
25|$|Practically all {{speakers}} of Nobiin are bilingual in Egyptian Arabic or Sudanese Arabic. For the men, this was noted {{as early as}} 1819 by the traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in his Travels to Nubia. The forced resettlement {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century also brought more Nubians, especially women and children, into daily contact with Arabic. Chief factors in this development include increased mobility (and hence easy access to non-Nubian villages and cities), changes in social patterns such as women going more often to the market to sell their own products, and easy access to Arabic newspapers. In urban areas, many Nubian women <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> are fluent in Arabic; they usually address their children in Arabic, reserving Nobiin for their husband. In response to concerns about a possible language shift to Arabic, Werner notes a very positive language attitude. Rouchdy (1992a) however notes that use of Nobiin is confined mainly to the domestic circle, as Arabic is the dominant language in trade, education, and public life. Sociolinguistically, the situation may be described as one of stable bilingualism: the dominant language (Arabic in this case), although used widely, does not easily replace the minority language since the latter is tightly connected to the Nubian identity.|$|E

500|$|At Brook Farm, {{women had}} the {{opportunity}} to expand beyond their typical sphere of tasks and their labor was highly valued. They did have tasks that were typical of other women at the time such as simple food preparation, and shared housekeeping. However, during the harvest time women were allowed to work in the fields and men even helped out with laundry during the cold weather. Because no single religion could impose its beliefs on the community, women were safe from the typical patriarchy associated with religion at the time. Because of the community's focus on individual freedom, women were autonomous from their husbands and were also allowed to become stockholders. Women also {{played an important role in}} providing sources of income to the community. Many devoted time to making, as Brook Farmer Marianne Dwight described, [...] "elegant and tasteful caps, capes, collars, undersleeves, etc., etc.," [...] for sale at shops in Boston. Others painted screens and lamp shades for sale. Women were allowed to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>and,</b> because of the well-known education of women at Brook Farm, many female writers and performers visited the farm. George Ripley's wife Sophia, who had written an outspoken feminist essay for The Dial on [...] "Woman" [...] before moving to Brook Farm, was very educated and was able to teach history and foreign languages at the farm.|$|E
