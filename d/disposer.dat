25|$|A garbage {{disposal}} is a device, usually electrically powered, installed under a kitchen sink between the sink's drain and the trap which shreds food waste into pieces {{small enough to}} pass through plumbing. The {{garbage disposal}} was invented in 1927 by John W. Hammes. After eleven years of development, his InSinkErator company put his <b>disposer</b> {{on the market in}} 1968.|$|E

His works discuss the pagans {{at the time of}} revelation as accepting Allah's Rububiyyah but rejecting His Uluhiyyah, whereby they continued to worship idols.|$|E
500|$|One {{option for}} {{separating}} food waste at source is the in-sink food-waste <b>disposer</b> (FWD). [...] It {{was invented in}} 1928 and is used in 50% of households in the USA, 34% in New Zealand, 20% in Australia and increasingly in some European countries, notably Sweden. [...] A FWD has no blades or knives, it has a grind chamber, the floor {{of which is a}} spinning disc with lugs spin the waste against the perforated wall of the chamber, particles exit when they are small enough. measured particle size distribution and found 98% <2mm. [...] They also measured settleability and found the ground waste would be carried/resuspended easily in conventionally designed sewers. estimated the Global Warming Potentials (100 year) of options for food waste management were landfill +740 kgCO2e/t food waste, incineration +13, centralised composting -14 and that anaerobic digestion was about -170 kgCO2e/t food waste whether it was kerbside collected and transported by truck or FWD to sewer to AD at a wastewater treatment works. [...] In a follow-up paper, analysed data from Surahammar, Sweden comparing the time when there were no FWD with the present when 50% of households have FWD. [...] This study verified laboratory etc. work published earlier by other workers. [...] They found there was no increase in wastewater treatment works' cost, nor the volume of wastewater but that there was a 46% increase in biogas.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} liability {{issues in}} the context of internationally traded goods like hazardous waste. If waste <b>disposers</b> of a small open economy are judgement-proof, then the extension of liability to waste exporters distorts the factor allocation and may reduce disposal care. Hence the optimal extension is partial at most. However, extending liability increases incentives of the waste importing country to hold domestic <b>disposers</b> liable. Interaction through the price system and through contracts that condition payments for disposal services on the occurrence of an accident yield identical outcomes if <b>disposers</b> are judgement-proof. extended liability, hazardous waste trade, externalities, moral hazard...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} introducing food waste <b>disposers</b> as a waste minimization option within urban waste management schemes, taking the Greater Beirut Area (GBA) as a case study. For this purpose, the operational and economic impacts of food <b>disposers</b> on the solid waste and wastewater streams are assessed. The integration of food waste <b>disposers</b> can reduce the total solid waste to be managed by 12 to 43 % under market penetration ranging between 25 and 75 %, respectively. While the increase in domestic water consumption (for food grinding) and corresponding increase in wastewater flow rates are relatively insignificant, wastewater loadings increased by 17 to 62 % (BOD) and 1. 9 to 7. 1 % (SS). The net economic benefit of introducing food <b>disposers</b> into the waste and wastewater management systems constitutes 7. 2 to 44. 0 % of the existing solid waste management cost under the various scenarios examined. Concerns about increased sludge generation persist and its potential environmental and economic implications may differ with location and therefore area-specific characteristics {{must be taken into}} consideration when contemplating the adoption of a strategy to integrate food waste <b>disposers</b> in the waste–wastewater management syste...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{the state}} of Florida changed its {{licensing}} regulations for workers and firms selling cremation services several times. In 1979, the state introduced a new category of funeral licenses that lowered barriers to entry for firms selling exclusively no-frill cremations, ones involving neither a viewing nor memorial service. The new licenses for “direct <b>disposers</b> ” (and their establishments) required substantially less training and fewer facilities than the licenses of funeral directors and funeral homes. Twenty years later, direct <b>disposers</b> had captured 19. 6 percent of the cremation market in Florida and 8. 6 percent of the overall death care market. In 2000, {{the state of}} Florida embarked {{on a series of}} adjustments, gradually bringing the requirements for direct <b>disposers</b> closer to the requirements facing full-service funeral homes. Using firm-specific data on prices of direct cremations and the annual number of cremations handled, we estimate that these seemingly small regulatory changes cut direct <b>disposers</b> market share in half and cost consumers roughly $ 5. 9 million per year, which equals roughly 5. 7 percent of their cremation expenditures. ...|$|R

The news spread like fire in the kingdom and people were coming from all places to watch the execution. A huge pit was dug up and a large quantity of wood was piled up. Then the biggest fire people ever witnessed was lit. The flames were so high up in the sky that even the birds could not fly over it for fear of being burnt themselves. Ibrahim's hands and feet were chained, and he was put in a catapult, ready to be thrown in. During this time, Angel Jibril came to him and said: [...] "O Ibrahim! Is there anything you wish for?" [...] Ibrahim could have asked to be saved from the fire or to be taken away, but Ibrahim replied, [...] "Allah is sufficient for me, He is the best <b>disposer</b> of my affairs." [...] The catapult was released and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire. Allah then gave an order to the fire, [...] "O fire! Be coolness and safety for Ibrahim." [...] A miracle occurred, the fire obeyed and burned only his chains. Ibrahim came out from it as if he was coming out from a garden, peaceful, his face illuminated and not a trace of smoke on his clothes. People watched in shock and exclaimed: [...] "Amazing!

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to show that though French public policy advocates sustainable development, it unwittingly deters non-institutionalized sustainable practices. To illustrate this paradox, {{this research}} focuses on bulky item collection and the urban gleaning to which it gives rise. A qualitative study shows that urban gleaning comes into conflict with the hygiene norm that pre-exists concerns about sustainability. To ease these tensions and authorize themselves to glean, gleaners draw on a repertoire of justifications around sustainability that condemns waste and attributes altruistic intentions to <b>disposers.</b> In turn, to put their items out on the sidewalk, <b>disposers</b> must negotiate tensions in relation both to the hygiene norm (not polluting public space) and to the sustainability norm (not throwing away items that could still be used by other people). To justify their act, <b>disposers</b> construct an image of gleaners, to whom they can “pass on” their possessions. This double process appears to create a new form of sustainable circulation through which objects are redistributed and which has important implications for macromarketing...|$|R

Beginning with a tu quoque, that the Arminian doctrine involves consequences as bad as the Calvinistic view, he proceeds to object to the term [...] "author of sin," [...] though he ends by admitting that, in a certain sense, it is applicable; he proves from Scripture, that God is the <b>disposer</b> and orderer of sin; and then, by an elaborate false analogy with the darkness resulting from the absence of the sun, endeavours to suggest that he is only the author of it in a negative sense; and, finally, he takes refuge in the conclusion that, though God is the orderer and <b>disposer</b> of those deeds which, considered in relation to their agents, are morally evil, yet, inasmuch as His purpose has all along been infinitely good, they are not evil relatively to him.|$|E

Similarly, in the United States there have been some political and environmental issues with garbage <b>disposers.</b> For many years, New York City had banned their use.
