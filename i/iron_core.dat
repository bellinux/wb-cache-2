5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This <b>iron</b> <b>core</b> is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede (Jupiter III), {{the third}} Galilean moon {{is named after}} the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's beloved. Ganymede is the largest natural {{satellite}} in the Solar System at 5262.4 kilometers in diameter, which makes it larger than the planet Mercury – although only at about half of its mass since Ganymede is an icy world. It is the only satellite in the Solar System known to possess a magnetosphere, likely created through convection within the liquid <b>iron</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ganymede's {{magnetic}} field is probably created by convection within its liquid <b>iron</b> <b>core.</b> The meager {{magnetic field}} is buried within Jupiter's much larger magnetic field and would show {{only as a}} local perturbation of the field lines. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone). Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Whether the satellite has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.|$|E

These generate the same {{voltage and current}} ranges as <b>iron</b> <b>cored</b> transformers, but in much smaller, lighter designs at high frequency (not the common 50-60 Hz). They are gradually replacing <b>iron</b> <b>cored</b> transformers in neon signs.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an <b>iron</b> <b>core,</b> Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
5|$|Mercury (0.4AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the closest}} planet to the Sun and the {{smallest}} planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses). Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large <b>iron</b> <b>core</b> and thin mantle {{have not yet been}} adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at}} Jupiter in 1995 after a six-year journey from Earth {{to follow up}} on the discoveries of the two Voyager probes and ground-based observations taken in the intervening years. Io's location within one of Jupiter's most intense radiation belts precluded a prolonged close flyby, but Galileo did pass close by shortly before entering orbit for its two-year, primary mission studying the Jovian system. Although no images were taken during the close flyby on 7 December 1995, the encounter did yield significant results, such as the discovery of a large <b>iron</b> <b>core,</b> similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner Solar System.|$|E

5|$|The {{prominent}} markings that criss-cross {{the moon}} {{seem to be}} mainly albedo features, which emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa because its surface is tectonically active and young. Some theories suggest that Jupiter's gravity is causing these markings, as one side of Europa is constantly facing Jupiter. Also, volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of Europa, and even geysers have been considered as a cause. The color of the markings, reddish-brown, is theorized {{to be caused by}} sulfur, but scientists cannot confirm that, because no data collection devices have been sent to Europa. Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an <b>iron</b> <b>core.</b> It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Venus (0.7 AU {{from the}} Sun) is close {{in size to}} Earth (0.815 Earth masses) and, like Earth, has a thick {{silicate}} mantle around an <b>iron</b> <b>core,</b> a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752°F), most likely due {{to the amount of}} greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large <b>iron</b> <b>core,</b> it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E

25|$|Ordinary power {{transformers}} have an <b>iron</b> <b>core</b> {{to increase}} the magnetic coupling between the coils. However at high frequencies an <b>iron</b> <b>core</b> causes energy losses due to eddy currents and hysteresis, {{so it is not}} used in the Tesla coil.|$|E

25|$|Any {{reconstruction}} of mercurian geologic history must include the inference that {{at an early}} time the planet was differentiated into a core and crust. Mercury has a weak magnetic field coupled with high density. Both facts can most easily {{be accounted for by}} the presence of an <b>iron</b> <b>core,</b> possibly liquid, roughly 4,200km in diameter, overlain by a silicate crust a few hundred kilometers thick. The postulated volcanic origin of a substantial fraction of the Mercurian plains also implies a thick silicate crust, and thereby supports the existence of a large <b>iron</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{electrical}} conductivity of the metal, when a solid one-piece metal core {{is used in}} alternating current (AC) applications such as transformers and inductors, the changing magnetic field induces large eddy currents circulating within it, closed loops of electric current in planes perpendicular to the field. The current flowing through {{the resistance of the}} metal heats it by Joule heating, causing significant power losses. Therefore, solid <b>iron</b> <b>cores</b> are not used in transformers or inductors, they are replaced by laminated or powdered <b>iron</b> <b>cores,</b> or nonconductive cores like ferrite.|$|R
40|$|The {{elemental}} {{content of}} the <b>iron</b> <b>cores</b> of haemosiderins isolated from animal and human tissues has been determined to ascertain whether changes in composition are correlated with structural differences previously identified in these mineralisation products. Significant differences were observed in the elemental composition of haemosiderins isolated from patients subjected to desferrioxamine-chelation therapy compared to patients who had been venesected. The P/Fe molar ratio was considerably higher in haemosiderin isolated from treated primary haemochromatosis (0. 83), compared to untreated primary haemochromatosis (0. 10) and treated secondary haemochromatosis (0. 25), and this {{could account for the}} amorphous nature of these <b>iron</b> <b>cores.</b> The levels of M/Fe (M = Ca, Cu, Zn) were reduced in the haemosiderins derived from treated secondary haemochromatosis patients, possibly due to the chelation of these ions by desferrioxamine therapy. In an experimentally iron-loaded rat, receiving either desferrioxamine or 1, 2 -diethyl- 3 -hydroxypyrid- 4 -one, selective decreases in these three elements were also observed after two weeks of desferrioxamine therapy. Such changes may be important determinants in the modification of biomineralisation of the <b>iron</b> <b>cores...</b>|$|R

25|$|Galileo {{arrived at}} Jupiter on December 7, 1995, after a six-year journey from Earth during which it used gravity assists with Venus and Earth to boost its orbit out to Jupiter. Shortly before Galileos Jupiter Orbit Insertion maneuver, the {{spacecraft}} performed the only targeted flyby of Io of its nominal mission. High-resolution images were originally planned during the encounter, but {{problems with the}} spacecraft's tape recorder, used to save data taken during encounters for later playback to Earth, required the elimination of high-data-rate observations from the flyby schedule to ensure the safe recording of Galileo atmospheric probe data. The encounter did yield significant results from lower data rate experiments. Analysis of the Doppler shift of Galileos radio signal showed that Io is differentiated with a large <b>iron</b> <b>core,</b> similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner Solar System.

The {{apparent}} viscosity {{model of the}} semi-solid A 356 aluminum alloy, based on fitting of experimental data obtained by the Couette type viscometer, {{was developed in the}} paper. The commercial package CastSoft 6. 0 coupled with the model was used to simulate the mould filling of the semi-solid A 356 aluminum alloy in the key-shaped component with <b>iron</b> <b>cores.</b> The simulation results showed that the position of the <b>iron</b> <b>cores</b> has an important effect on the filling of the semisolid slurry, and it is easy to obtain the completely filled key-shaped component when the <b>iron</b> <b>cores</b> were near to the inlet. The filling tests verified that the simulation results have good agreement with the experimental results. The fitting results indicated that the developed {{apparent viscosity}} model is practical and feasible and {{it can be used to}} simulate the mould filling process of the semisolid A 356 aluminum alloy slurry.
