50|$|Topps {{purchased}} {{their chief}} competitor, Bowman Gum, in 1956. Topps {{was the leader}} in the trading card industry from 1956 to 1980, not only in sports cards but in entertainment cards as well. Many of the top selling non-sports cards were produced by Topps, including Wacky Packages (1967, 1973-1977), Star Wars (beginning in 1977) and Garbage Pail Kids (beginning in 1985). Topps inserted baseball cards as prizes into packs of gum until 1981, when the gum became {{a thing of the}} past and the cards were sold without the <b>gum.</b> <b>Collectors</b> were delighted, since the oil from the gum was ruining an otherwise pristine or valuable card.|$|R
40|$|Low {{returns from}} {{marketing}} of {{non-timber forest products}} such as gum arabic restrict the collection of these products. A hypothesis is tested that access to good markets motivates collectors to harvest and market gum arabic. Analyses of the choice of participation in group marketing, sale price, quantity of gum collected and the final choice of market outlet are done. Decision outcomes include fixed transaction costs at the collection stage and proportional costs at the marketing stage. Original data from 348 <b>gum</b> <b>collectors</b> in the Sylvopastoral zone and Eastern region of Senegal were used. Results confirm the stated hypothesis; indeed the marketing context and outcome play {{a big role in}} collection systems of gum arabic in Senegal. The costs incurred in finding the good market can be regarded as an investment, whereby the collector may continue to transact with the same trading partner (and hence in the same market). The need for infrastructural development, strengthening groups and market expansion are emphasised as key policy interventions...|$|R
40|$|In the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, {{localized}} {{cutaneous leishmaniasis}} (LCL) caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana {{is a typical}} wild zoonosis restricted to the forest, and humans are only accidentally involved. The transmission of L. (L.) mexicana has been related to the patient’s occupation: “chicleros ” (<b>gum</b> <b>collectors)</b> and agricultural workers. The objective {{of this study was}} to document L. (L.) mexicana seasonally of transmission in endemic areas of LCL in the state of Campeche, Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The timing of incidence of LCL in humans during 1993 - 1994, as well as the rate and time of infection in rodents and sand flies between February 1993 and March 1995 were analyzed. Rodents and sand flies were found infected between November and March, when men carried out their field activities and are exposed. Based on results analyzed, it is concluded that L. (L.) mexicana in the endemic area of LCL in the state of Campeche, Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, presents a seasonal transmission restricted to the months of November to March. The knowledge of the timing of the transmission cycle in an endemic area of leishmaniasis is very important because intervention measures on the high-risk focus and population might be restricted. Key words: Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana- seasonal transmission- Mexico Leishmaniases are mostly zoonotic diseases. The outset of the disease in patients, the relative abundanc...|$|R
40|$|Quality, quantity, {{availability}} and economics {{are the key}} factors that affect the marketing of any product, irrespective of whether it is for domestic, national or international market. The consumer requires the product to be available in time, be of desired quality and quantity. The market of gum arabic {{is a good example}} of how the interplay of quality, quantity, {{availability and}} economics affect a product market. In Kenya, trade in gum arabic has remained informal due to inadequate marketing arrangements attributed to limited participation of <b>gum</b> arabic <b>collectors</b> in the development of the sector and a non-conducive business environment, which does not favor private sector expansion. This paper looked at the market chains of gum arabic, the stakeholders participating in the management and marketing of A. senegal products and the constraints to gum arabic production and collection within the Kenyan drylands. The results confirmed that the market chain of gum arabic was and is still poorly organized with only one company and a few individual traders being the major buyers. Wildlife related factors and price were the key constraints to gum arabic collection while production was limited by unreliable rainfall due prolonged droughts. Quality of the gum and road network determined the price with different grades attracting different rates per kilogram in different areas. SALTLICK and AWF were the chief stakeholders involved in A. senegal tree resources management. The study has shown that there is willingness of the locals to engage in full time gum collection if ready market can be availed to them. Nevertheless, numerous constraints need to be addressed to make gum arabic collection an attractive venture to the local communities’ key among them being the purchase price...|$|R
