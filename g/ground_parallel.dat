25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play {{is coming from the}} corner {{to the front of the}} net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the <b>ground,</b> <b>parallel</b> to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to push. This works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E
2500|$|Play {{is started}} at the {{beginning}} of each quarter and after each goal with a face-off. During a face-off, two players lay their sticks on the <b>ground</b> <b>parallel</b> to the mid-line, the two heads of their sticks on opposite sides of the ball. At the whistle, the face-off-men scrap for the ball, often by [...] "clamping" [...] it under their stick and flicking it out to their teammates. When one of the teams has possession of the ball, they bring it into their offensive zone and try to score a goal. Due to the offsides rule, settled play involves six offensive players versus six defensive players and a goalie.|$|E
60|$|While I {{examined}} my friend's {{wounds and}} readjusted the bandages, my companions cut down two poles. These we {{laid on the}} <b>ground</b> <b>parallel</b> {{to each other and}} about two feet apart, and across them laid our three coats, which we fastened in a rough fashion by means of some strong cords which I fortunately happened to have with me. On this rude litter we laid our companion, and raised him on our shoulders. Peterkin and I walked in rear, each supporting one of the poles; while Makarooroo, being the stoutest of the three, supported the entire weight of the other ends on his broad shoulders. Jack bore the moving better than we had expected, so that we entertained sanguine hopes that no bones were broken, but that loss of blood was all he had to suffer from.|$|E

60|$|Leaving {{our camp}} near Ashangi, the road ran on level <b>ground</b> <b>parallel</b> {{to the lake}} for a mile or so, and then, the {{mountains}} approaching {{to the edge of}} the water, we had to climb over the spur. The height was not very great, but it was one of the roughest, and certainly the steepest climb we have yet had. Once on the crest, the hill sloped gradually down, and we presently came upon the water again near the head of the lake. This spot was the next day the scene of a fatal accident. Two or three officers came down to shoot, and one of the birds fell into the water. One of their servants, who was a good swimmer, at once went in to fetch it out. It is probable that he was seized with cramp, for he sank suddenly. Captain Pottinger at once jumped in, and swam out to the spot, but was unable to see anything of him. Our camping-ground was about two miles distant from the head of the lake, upon flat ground. The distance from Ashangi was little over six miles.|$|E
60|$|A, B, are two pegs {{driven into}} the ground and {{standing}} about a foot out of it. A stake, A B, is lashed across them; a row of pegs, E, are {{driven into the}} <b>ground,</b> <b>parallel</b> to A, B, and about 6 inches apart. Two sets of strings are then tied to A B; one set are fastened by their loose ends into clefts, in the pegs E, and the other set are fastened to the stick, C D. If there be ten strings in all, then 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, are tied to C D, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, to A B. By alternately raising and depressing C D, and by pushing in a handful of rushes between the two sets of strings after each of its movements, and, finally, by patting them home with a flat stick, this rough sort of weaving is carried on very successfully. Mats are also plaited in breadths, and the breadths are stitched together, side by side. Or a thicker kind of mat may be made by taking a wisp of straw and working it in the same way in which straw beehives are constructed. Straw is worked more easily after being damped and beaten with a mallet.|$|E

50|$|Parallels {{are first}} {{machined}} to rough dimensions, leaving a few millimeters {{to allow the}} rest to be <b>ground.</b> <b>Parallels</b> that only have 2 or 4 precision faces will often have the tool-marks from the machining on the non-ground sides. They are then paired {{and placed in a}} grinding machine, and each face is ground until the overall dimensions are correct - they are paired during this stage so that even if the dimensions are not correct, they are still parallel to each other. Then, the individual finishes are applied, from drilling to machining a chamfer along the edges to remove any burrs or sharpened edges. They may also be lapped to achieve a mirror smooth surface. Most parallels are also hardened.|$|R

40|$|Symbol {{grounding}} has originated {{within the}} connectionist-symbolic debate {{so as to}} gap the bridge between the two approaches. This paper provides an overview about recent results concerning symbol grounding, which is critically reviewed here. A thorough analysis reveals that symbol <b>grounding</b> <b>parallels</b> transcendental logic and is best viewed as automated model construction. If this diagnosis is true, the necessary next question must be which sort of models are generated in symbol grounding systems. The {{answer to this question}} very much depends on the kind of network architecture employed for grounding. An illustrative neural network architecture is used to explain how a dynamic symbol grounding system generates a formal model.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{increasing}} the contact area of a grounding system with the earth is the installation of counterpoise wires. Counterpoise wires improve the reliability of overhead power transmission lines. They are conductors buried in the <b>ground</b> <b>parallel</b> to or {{at an angle to}} the line conductors. This paper presents an electrokinetic model refinement via a perturbation finite-element method to calculate the grounding resistance of counterpoise wires. The perturbation method is herein developed for refining the electric field distribution in soil starting from simplified models, based on electric field distributions from 2 -D models, that evolve towards a 3 -D accurate model. The analysis of the distribution of the electric field and of the electric potential around the tower footing allows accurately determining the tower footing resistance. The comparisons between the grounding resistance simulated and calculated analytically of a counterpoise wire are presented. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A {{thin-film}} polarization-dependent reflectarray {{based on}} patterned metallic wire grids is realized at 1 THz. Unlike conventional reflectarrays with resonant elements {{and a solid}} metal <b>ground,</b> <b>parallel</b> narrow metal strips with uniform spacing are employed in this design to construct both the radiation elements and the ground plane. For each radiation element, {{a certain number of}} thin strips with an identical length are grouped to effectively form a patch resonator with equivalent performance. The ground plane is made of continuous metallic strips, similar to conventional wire-grid polarizers. The structure can deflect incident waves with the polarization parallel to the strips into a designed direction and transmit the orthogonal polarization component. Measured radiation patterns show reasonable deflection efficiency and high polarization discrimination. Utilizing this flexible device approach, similar reflectarray designs can be realized for conformal mounting onto surfaces of cylindrical or spherical devices for terahertz imaging and communications...|$|E
