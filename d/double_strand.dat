5|$|Double-strand DNA {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. Homologous recombination occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as herpesvirus, recombination occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either the parental configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during homologous recombination, giving patch products (if in same orientation during <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> break repair) or splice products (if in different orientations during <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). <b>Double</b> <b>strand</b> breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
25|$|TBP is {{involved}} in DNA melting (<b>double</b> <b>strand</b> separation) by bending the DNA by 80° (the AT-rich sequence to which it binds facilitates easy melting). The TBP is an unusual protein in that it binds the minor groove using a β sheet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{replisome}} is {{a complex}} molecular machine that carries out replication of DNA. The replisome first unwinds <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA into two single strands. For each of the resulting single strands, a new complementary sequence of DNA is synthesized. The net result is formation of two new <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA sequences that are exact copies of the original <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA sequence.|$|R
40|$|Antibodies {{raised in}} rabbits against daoxyguanylate and daoxycytidylate bind to 3 H-(lambda) <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA and the binding is base specific. The {{concentrations}} of antibody populations that bind to <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA {{are much less}} than those binding to denatured DNA. Due to their low concentrations, these antibodies ware not detected in earlier studies.

At least {{a portion of}} the at least one <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA molecule is denatured. At least one chemical moiety that prohibits recrystallization of the at least one denatured portion to which the at least one chemical moiety is attached is attached to at least one nucleotide in the at least one denatured portion of the at least one <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA molecule...|$|R
25|$|Unenriched {{sequencing}} libraries {{often have}} abundant undesired sequences. Cas9 can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> breakage {{with up to}} 99% efficiency and without significant off-target effects as seen with restriction enzymes. Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries.|$|E
25|$|Once {{these have}} been {{assembled}} into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein {{with the help of}} the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and – depending on the Cas9 variant – creates a single or <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> break in the DNA.|$|E
25|$|During {{repair of}} DNA <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> breaks, or repair of other DNA damages, incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause {{epigenetic}} gene silencing. DNA repair deficiencies (level 4 in the figure) cause increased DNA damages (level 5 in the figure) which result in increased somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations (level 6 in the figure).|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for the construction}} of <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA microcircles is described that overcomes the natural limits of established circularization procedures. Starting with two synthetic oligonucleotides which are able to form dumbbell shaped structures, two subsequent ligation reactions yield a microcircle of <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA of 42 base pairs. This is by far the smallest circle of <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA yet described. These microcircles can be constructed in quantities required for high resolution structural analyses such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy...|$|R
50|$|The authors {{speculated that}} this {{response}} was an evolutionary trend toward redundant immune response against RNA viruses. If one cell is already undergoing cell death {{to attempt to}} stop spread of a virus, then the RNAi immune response has been ineffective. This causes another immune response that attempts to stop the virus which is binding <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> RNA and keeping <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> so that it cannot be transcribed into virus proteins. The mechanism of maintaining <b>double</b> <b>stranded</b> RNA is not known.|$|R

25|$|Multiple Cas1 {{proteins}} {{have been}} characterised and their structures resolved. Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner. Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either (single strand) ssRNA- or (<b>double</b> <b>strand)</b> dsDNA- specific endoribonuclease activity.|$|E
25|$|Several {{formulas}} {{are used}} to calculate Tm values. Some formulas are more accurate in predicting melting temperatures of DNA duplexes. For DNA oligonucleotides, i.e. short sequences of DNA, the thermodynamics of hybridization can be accurately described as a two-state process. In this approximation one neglects the possibility of intermediate partial binding states {{in the formation of}} a <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> state from two single stranded oligonucleotides. Under this assumption one can elegantly describe the thermodynamic parameters for forming double-stranded nucleic acid AB from single-stranded nucleic acids A and B.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, the {{proteins}} {{expressed by the}} hMre11 (defective in ATLD) and Nbs1 (defective in NBS) genes exist in the cell as a complex, along with a third protein expressed by the hRad50 gene. This complex, known as the MRN complex, {{plays an important role}} in DNA damage repair and signaling and is required to recruit ATM to the sites of DNA <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> breaks. Mre11 and Nbs1 are also targets for phosphorylation by the ATM kinase. Thus, the similarity of the three diseases can be explained in part by the fact that the protein products of the three genes mutated in these disorders interact in common pathways in the cell.|$|E

25|$|Properly spaced {{single strand}} {{breaks in the}} host DNA can trigger {{homology}} directed repair, which is less error prone than the non-homologous end joining that typically follows a <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break. The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence {{is now part of}} the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} method for genome editing uses CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) {{sequences}} and the endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9). These components {{are an integral}} part of the immune response for some bacteria. and have been repurposed for genome engineering. In this system, sequences matching foreign bacteriophage or plasmid DNA are incorporated as “spacer” sequences into the bacterial genome located between repeating CRISPR loci. Cas endonucleases are able to initiate <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> breaks within these foreign DNAs that are complement to the transcribed CRISPR RNAs (crRNA, or “protospacers”), thus degrading them. A conserved protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM, sequence 5’-NGG-3’) located immediately downstream of the protospacer in the cellular genome is necessary for Cas9 cleavage. Together, this system allows for adaptive immunity to the dynamic viral genetic material.|$|E
25|$|A-T {{has been}} {{described}} as a genome instability syndrome, a DNA repair disorder and a DNA damage response (DDR) syndrome. ATM, the gene responsible for this multi-system disorder, encodes a protein of the same name which coordinates the cellular response to DNA <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> breaks (DSBs). Radiation therapy, chemotherapy that acts like radiation (radiomimetic drugs) and certain biochemical processes and metabolites can cause DSBs. When these breaks occur, ATM stops the cell from making new DNA (cell cycle arrest) and recruits and activates other proteins to repair the damage. Thus, ATM allows the cell to repair its DNA before the completion of cell division. If DNA damage is too severe, ATM will mediate the process of programmed cell death (apoptosis) to eliminate the cell and prevent genomic instability.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} the DNA damage theory of aging {{it is important}} to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of errors that occur in DNA. Damage and mutation are fundamentally different. DNA damage is any physical abnormality in the DNA, such as single and <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine residues and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired using the complementary undamaged sequence in a homologous chromosome if it is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. Replication may also be blocked and/or the cell may die. Descriptions of reduced function, characteristic of aging and associated with accumulation of DNA damage, are given later in this article.|$|E
25|$|DNA damage {{can also}} cause {{epigenetic}} changes. DNA damage is very frequent, occurring on average about 60,000 times a day per cell {{of the human body}} (see DNA damage (naturally occurring)). These damages are largely repaired, but at the site of a DNA repair, epigenetic changes can remain. In particular, a <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> break in DNA can initiate unprogrammed epigenetic gene silencing both by causing DNA methylation as well as by promoting silencing types of histone modifications (chromatin remodeling - see next section). In addition, the enzyme Parp1 (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase) and its product poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) accumulate at sites of DNA damage as part of a repair process. This accumulation, in turn, directs recruitment and activation of the chromatin remodeling protein ALC1 that can cause nucleosome remodeling. Nucleosome remodeling has been found to cause, for instance, epigenetic silencing of DNA repair gene MLH1. DNA damaging chemicals, such as benzene, hydroquinone, styrene, carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene, cause considerable hypomethylation of DNA, some through the activation of oxidative stress pathways.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{respiration}} rates {{caused by}} mutated COXI {{may have caused}} two additional traits in the Utricularia–Genlisea clade: i) greatly increased rates of nucleotide substitution and ii) a dynamic decrease of genome size, including Utricularia species {{with some of the}} smallest haploid angiosperm genomes known. A recent study conducted three cDNA libraries from different organs of U.gibba (~80Mb) as part of a large scale Utricularia nuclear genome sequencing project. They recorded increased nucleotide substitution rates in chloroplast, mitochondrial, and cellular genomes. They also recorded increased levels of DNA repair-associated proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-detox. ROS is a product of cellular metabolism that can potentially cause cellular damage when accumulated in high amounts. Interestingly, they determined the expression of DNA repair and ROS detox was ubiquitous rather than trap-specific. Due to this ubiquitous expression, relative ROS detoxification is expected to be lower in trap structures due to the high respiratory rate caused by trap activations, eventually leading to higher toxic effects and mutagenesis. Mutagenic action of enhanced ROS production may explain both high rates of nucleotide substitution and the dynamic evolution of genome size (via <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> breaks).|$|E

25|$|Reisch and Prather pioneered a {{technique}} that combines both the λ-red and CRISPR/Cas9 recombination systems to form a novel methodology called no-SCAR (Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering) for E. coli genome modifications. In this method, a plasmid containing the gene for Cas9 expression (cas9) is first transformed into E. coli cells. After selecting for the transformants using antibiotic resistance, another plasmid containing the targeted gene {{of interest in the}} form of sgRNA and the λ-red operon is transfected. After induced expression of the λ-red recombineering system, linear DNA to be incorporated into the E. coli genome is transformed into the cells. The expression of Cas9 and the sgRNA are then induced, which results in the Cas9 locating the E. coli target DNA based on the sgRNA complement. Cas9 is able to initiate a <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> break and the λ-red system is able to bring the linear DNA to E. coli genome for homologous recombination. The cells are then cured of the plasmid containing the specific sgRNA and then the next plasmid containing the specific sgRNA target sequence can be transformed and the process is repeated.|$|E
25|$|Following {{successful}} recombination of {{the linear}} DNA {{to the target}} genome, plasmid origins and markers can be re-used {{as a result of}} the plasmid curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37oC, denatures the plasmid. This allows for easy plasmid curing that does not include any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX plasmid, another pKDsg-XXX plasmid with a different sgRNA can subsequently be transfected into the E. coli cells to introduce further mutations to the target cellular sequences. After all mutations are introduced, both plasmids should be cured. Unfortunately, the pCas9cr4 plasmid lacks an inherent curing mechanism, so Reisch and Prather pioneered a plasmid curing mechanism by introducing a pKDsgRNA whose sgRNA is complement to the pCas9cr4 plasmid. Specifically, they constructed a pKDsg-p15A which targeted the p15A origin of replication of the pCas9cr4 plasmid. After recombinants were selected for, expression of Cas9 and sgRNA was induced with the addition of aTc. After plating on selective plates and growing at 37oC, they observed no colony formation on the LB plates containing chloramphenicol indicating loss of the pCas9cr4 plasmid due to a Cas9-mediated <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> break in the plasmid. Additional plasmid mini-preps demonstrated that neither plasmid was retained in the cells, therefore indicating plasmid curing. This technique can easily be applied to curing other plasmids as well.|$|E
500|$|In eukaryotes, {{two primary}} models for how {{homologous}} recombination repairs double-strand breaks in DNA are the double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathway (sometimes called the double Holliday junction model) and the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway. In {{the case of}} <b>double</b> <b>strand</b> breakage, the 3' end is degraded and the longer 5' end invades the contiguous sister chromatid, forming a replication bubble. As this bubble nears the broken DNA, the longer 5' antisense strand again invades the sense strand of this portion of DNA, transcribing a second copy. When replication ends, both tails are reconnected to form two Holliday Junctions, which are then cleaved {{in a variety of}} patterns by proteins. An animation of this process can be seen [...]|$|E
