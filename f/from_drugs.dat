5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, <b>from</b> <b>drugs</b> like penicillin and steroids to foods like Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects <b>from</b> <b>drugs</b> used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on {{juvenile}} justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income <b>from</b> <b>drugs</b> and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E

25|$|Barbiturates {{induce a}} number of hepatic CYP enzymes (most notably CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), leading to exaggerated effects from many prodrugs and {{decreased}} effects <b>from</b> <b>drugs</b> which are metabolized by these enzymes to inactive metabolites. This can result in fatal overdoses <b>from</b> <b>drugs</b> such as codeine, tramadol, and carisoprodol, which become considerably more potent after being metabolized by CYP enzymes. Although all known {{members of the class}} possess relevant enzyme induction capabilities the degree of inhibition overall as well as the impact on each specific enzyme span a broad range with phenobarbital and secobarbital being the most potent enzyme inducers and butalbital and talbutal being among the weakest enzyme inducers in the class.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, {{before the}} {{relative}} laxity of the state, drug trafficking became a common and {{quick way to}} accumulate wealth. Proceeds <b>from</b> <b>drugs</b> had a strong influence on {{the economy of the}} city. Money of dubious origin soon infected many institutions and public and private companies. Money laundering generated an economic boom which declined sharply in the mid-1990s when the central government declared war on drugs.|$|E

25|$|Drugs {{continue}} to {{be taken off the}} market due to late discovery of hepatotoxicity. Due to its unique metabolism and close relationship with the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is susceptible to injury <b>from</b> <b>drugs</b> and other substances. 75% of blood coming to the liver arrives directly from gastrointestinal organs and then spleen via portal veins that bring drugs and xenobiotics in near-undiluted form. Several mechanisms are responsible for either inducing hepatic injury or worsening the damage process.|$|E
25|$|By early 1969, Joplin was {{allegedly}} shooting at least $200 worth of heroin per day (equivalent to $1300 in 2016 dollars) although {{efforts were made}} to keep her clean during the recording of I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!. Gabriel Mekler, who produced Kozmic Blues, told publicist-turned-biographer Myra Friedman after Joplin's death that the singer had lived in his house during the June 1969 recording sessions at his insistence so he could keep her away <b>from</b> <b>drugs</b> and her drug-using friends.|$|E

25|$|Several {{drugs can}} cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, {{withdrawal}} or from chronic use. These include alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, sedatives (including prescription benzodiazepines), opioids (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin), stimulants (such as caffeine, cocaine and amphetamines), hallucinogens, and inhalants. While many often report self-medicating anxiety with these substances, improvements in anxiety <b>from</b> <b>drugs</b> are usually short-lived (with worsening of anxiety in the long-term, sometimes with acute anxiety {{as soon as}} the drug effects wear off) and tend to be exaggerated. Acute exposure to toxic levels of benzene may cause euphoria, anxiety, and irritability lasting up to 2 weeks after the exposure.|$|E
25|$|Although disease-specific {{interventions}} are important, further {{strengthening of the}} public-health system will be needed if China is to halve the prevalence of tuberculosis {{and the number of}} deaths caused by the disease. To increase access, a package of essential public-health services for rural inhabitants and urban migrants should be provided with governmental subsidies. This package should include services for at least tuberculosis, immunisation, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and maternal and child health. The government must also address the warped incentives in hospitals that encourage the generation of profits <b>from</b> <b>drugs,</b> tests, and state-of-the-art technologies. This profit generation fuels the inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including tuberculosis. Finally, the government should provide operational costs for public-health services and full salaries for health-care workers, especially at and below the county level, where most of the rural population live. The number of staff needed for essential public-health functions should be carefully calculated, and public-health workers must be given fair pay. Without this, the development and maintenance of a motivated and skilled public-health workforce {{to meet the challenges of}} the 21st century will be difficult.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the factors related to {{abstinence}} from heroin and methamphetamine (MAMP) use and to seeking help from medical services in Taiwanese drug users. Atotal of 196 heroin users and 226 MAMP users were recruited in this study. Their experience of previous abstinence <b>from</b> <b>drug</b> use and the routes taken to seek help for abstinence were determined at interview. Demographic data, characteristics of drug use and reasons to abstain <b>from</b> <b>drug</b> use were compared between subjects who had and those who had never tried to abstain <b>from</b> <b>drug</b> use before, as well as between the subjects who had previously sought help from medical services and those who had tried to abstain <b>from</b> <b>drug</b> use by themselves. Those who had previously tried to abstain from heroin use had longer durations of heroin use, spent more money on getting heroin, were more likely to have a criminal record of illicit drug use and had longer durations of being detained due to illicit drug use compared with those who had never tried to abstain from heroin use. Those who had sought help from medical services for abstinence were more likely to be heroin users and to spend more money on getting illicit drugs, and tried to abstain due to concerns about relationships with family. Demographic data, characteristics of drug use and reasons to abstain <b>from</b> <b>drug</b> use were different between drug users who had different experiences of abstinence...|$|R
