40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a number}} of aspects of a government policy of rescuing firms or <b>enterprises</b> that are <b>in</b> <b>difficulties,</b> with {{particular attention to the}} East European context. The first part of Chapter 2 examines a concept introduced by Janos Kornai, the "soft budget constraint", and argues that it should be interpreted as a state policy of bailouts of <b>enterprises</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>difficulties.</b> The second part of the chapter examines the effect on incentives of a state policy of bailouts, arguing that in principle a bailout policy has an ambiguous effect on enterprise performance. Chapter 3 looks at the causes behind a government policy of bailouts. A game-theoretic model is presented in support of the argument that a cause of a bailout policy may be that the government is unable to make a credible commitment not to bail out an enterprise. The model also shows that if the government can acquire a "reputation for toughness", its threat of "no bailouts" may be credible. The phenomenon of "storming" or rush-work to meet a deadline is also analysed. In Chapter 4 a model of economic natural selection is developed. The model demonstrates that profit-maximisation does not "summarise appropriately" the conditions for firm survival. If firms have market power, profit-maximisers are not necessarily the best survivors. The economic model presented derives from the biologists' "evolutionarily stable strategy" (ESS) model. An appendix presents a version of the ESS model for finite populations. Finally, the thesis looks at empirical evidence on financial bailouts using data from the 500 largest <b>enterprises</b> <b>in</b> Polish industry, 1983 - 88. Chapter 5 discusses the data and the tax/subsidy system. Chapter 6 looks at how these enterprises were subsidised, and presents evidence, based on econometric estimates of government subsidy policy, that subsidies were used to rescue loss-making enterprises...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the adjustments}} of state-owned <b>enterprises</b> <b>in</b> Russia {{to the economic}} reforms started in early 1992, drawing on evidence from enterprise visits, larger enterprise surveys, and aggregate data on the enterprise sector, and making direct comparisons to comparable experiences in Poland, Hungary and the (former) CSFR, the leaders in transition from socialism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). We find that <b>enterprise</b> adjustment <b>in</b> Russia has broadly followed the pattern observed in the leading CEE economies in transition. Demand and output have dropped, and many enterprises have changed their product mix in response without substantial new investment; firms are looking for new customers, though progress in terms of exports is still limited; they are containing wage costs and shedding labour, albeit more slowly than firms in the CEE countries; the levels of interenterprise credit (payables and receivables) has increased but has stabilized at levels comparable to those observed both in other transition countries {{as well as in}} West European economies; enterprises have been moving payment methods and avoiding extending trade credit if possible. However, there are also signs that adjustment <b>in</b> the <b>enterprise</b> sector is uneven, that the overall pace of adjustment is low by CEE standards, and that governmental transfers are behind this. Whereas financial environment of enterprises is still soft, and the state is the source of this softness. The financial transfers to enterprises take two forms: subsidies, and directed credits. The case of directed state credits is analyzed in some detail, and evidence is presented suggesting that they are allocated accordingly to "need" meaning that the recipient <b>enterprise</b> is <b>in</b> financial <b>difficulties</b> and/or it is politically important...|$|R

For example, RMAA projects accounted for 53. 2 % of the total construction market and the percentage of RMAA accidents to all construction accidents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) increased considerably in 2007. The RMAA sector has a huge potential for safety improvement. This study aims to explore and evaluate the difficulties of implementing safety practices in RMAA work. The mixed methods approach was adopted, and semistructured interviews and a two-round Delphi survey were conducted for the data collection.
