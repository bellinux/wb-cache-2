25|$|Chromatin and its {{interaction}} with enzymes has been researched, and a conclusion being made is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> {{and an important}} factor in gene expression. Vincent G. Allfrey, a professor at Rockefeller University, stated that RNA synthesis is related to histone acetylation. The lysine amino acid attached {{to the end of the}} histones is positively charged. The acetylation of these tails would make the chromatin ends neutral, allowing for DNA access.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> to {{note here}} that Turner was {{extremely}} conservative in {{his use of}} the word “Indian.” Instead he referred to the different Indian peoples by their culture’s name, such as Yaqui or Aztec, in order to humanize and emphasize their identities. For Turner, Díaz “created a machine and oiled the machine with the flesh and blood of a people. He rewarded all except the people; the people were the sacrifice.” Indians were seen as chattel and although Díaz’s regime justified its means for this treatment, Turner emphasizes this point. Additionally, Turner does not explicitly mention the científicos, but he makes a stand against the “scientific knowledge” of that time in regard to race; in a way, against positivism. He indirectly brings up issues surrounding the Indian questions of labor—through haciendas—and of education. Turner points out that regardless of the public primary schools that had been built, “what promise does study hold out for a youth born to shoulder a debt of his father and carry it {{to the end of his}} days?” At its core, Turner’s question embodies the meaning of slavery, because that is precisely what he saw.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the Welsh name [...] "Arthur" [...] remains a matter of debate. Some suggest it {{is derived from the}} Roman nomen gentile (family name) Artorius, of obscure and contested {{etymology}} (but possibly of Messapian or Etruscan origin). Some scholars have suggested <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> to this debate that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as Arthur, or Arturus, in early Latin Arthurian texts, never as Artōrius (though {{it should be noted that}} Classical Latin Artōrius became Arturius in some Vulgar Latin dialects). However, this may not say anything about the {{origin of the}} name Arthur, as Artōrius would regularly become Art(h)ur when borrowed into Welsh.|$|E

2500|$|An {{evolutionarily}} stable strategy (ESS) is {{a strategy}} which, if adopted by a population in a given environment, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy that is initially rare. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> in game theory, behavioural ecology, and evolutionary psychology. An ESS is an equilibrium refinement of the Nash equilibrium. It is a Nash equilibrium that is [...] "evolutionarily" [...] stable: once it is fixed in a population, natural selection alone is sufficient to prevent alternative (mutant) strategies from invading successfully. The theory {{is not intended to}} deal with the possibility of gross external changes to the environment that bring new selective forces to bear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second step}} in his {{argument}} is that in acting according to an economic function, employees serve the impersonal (business, legal or political) interests of an abstract authority, which may have {{little or nothing to}} do with their own personal interests. They have to keep the two kinds of interests separated, and [...] "manage them" [...] appropriately in a [...] "mature, professional" [...] way. In this way, they [...] "personify" [...] or [...] "represent" [...] interests, and who they personally are, may well be completely irrelevant to that – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> {{only to the extent that}} their true personality fits with the role.|$|E
2500|$|Anita Malfatti's {{style of}} {{painting}} {{has been criticized}} for not evolving artistically after her shocking reintroduction to Brazil's artistic vision. Although Lucie-Smith is quite harsh saying that none of her works after The Idiot are of any importance, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> to say that her style became much more toned down and [...] "respectable" [...] than it had been. Malfatti's exhibition in 191718 was even a toned-down version of what her artistic style was. Although she did not exhibit any of her nude pieces in her exhibition her style was still seen as extremely avant-garde. Her changing style can be well explained through a comparison of pieces throughout her career. The Idiot is her most influential piece and can be compared to a piece from the 1940s, O Canal e a Ponta, a much less controversial style and subject matter.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{discussion}} of sexual orientation research, Stein criticized several other authors for {{their views on the}} subject. He finds research that claims to have identified genes that cause homosexuality in drosophilia (fruit flies), including a 1995 study by Jean-François Ferveur et al. that was published in Science magazine, to be guilty of anthropomorphism. He argued that such research is irrelevant to understanding sexual orientation in humans. Stein called the journalist Chandler Burr's A Separate Creation (1996) [...] "unsophisticated" [...] and criticizes Burr for failing to discuss social constructionist views and uncritically accepting [...] "courtship" [...] behavior between male fruit flies as an example of animal homosexuality. Stein criticized Michael Ruse's views on social constructionism as expressed in [...] (1988). Stein criticized the neuroscientist Simon LeVay, writing that in The Sexual Brain (1993), LeVay fails to discuss social constructionism even though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> to his subject. Stein argued that in Virtually Normal (1995), Andrew Sullivan failed to show that social constructionism is false. Stein argued that it has not been shown that sexual orientations are non-arbitrary groups ("natural kinds") and that the ethics of sexual orientation research are open to question.|$|E
2500|$|Computationalism is a {{philosophy}} of mind theory stating that cognition {{is a form of}} computation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> to the Simulation hypothesis in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a [...] "virtual people" [...] simulation. For example, {{it is well known that}} physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy. If computationalism is correct and if there is no problem in generating artificial consciousness or cognition, it would establish the theoretical possibility of a simulated reality. Nevertheless, the relationship between cognition and phenomenal qualia of consciousness is disputed. It is possible that consciousness requires a vital substrate that a computer cannot provide and that simulated people, while behaving appropriately, would be philosophical zombies. This would undermine Nick Bostrom's simulation argument; we cannot be a simulated consciousness, if consciousness, as we know it, cannot be simulated. The skeptical hypothesis remains intact, however, and we could still be envatted brains, existing as conscious beings within a simulated environment, even if consciousness cannot be simulated. It has been suggested that whereas virtual reality would enable a participant to experience only three senses (sight, sound and optionally smell), simulated reality would enable all five (including taste and touch).|$|E

60|$|If Lincoln {{was right}}, {{he was right}} in {{guessing}} {{that there was not}} really a Northern nation and a Southern nation, but only one American nation. And if he has been proved right, he has been proved right by the fact that men in the South, as well as the North, do now feel a patriotism for that American nation. His wisdom, if it really was wisdom, was justified not by his opponents being conquered, but by their being converted. Now, if the English politicians must insist on this parallel, they ought to see that the parallel is fatal to themselves. The very test which proved Lincoln right has proved them wrong. The very judgment which may have justified him quite unquestionably condemns them. We have again and again conquered Ireland, and have never come an inch nearer to converting Ireland. We have had not one Gettysburg, but twenty Gettysburgs; but we have had no Union. And that is where, as I have remarked, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> to remember that flying fantastic vision on the films that told so many people what no histories have told them. I heard when I was in America rumours of the local reappearance of the Ku-Klux Klan; but the smallness and mildness of the manifestation, as compared with the old Southern or the new Irish case, is alone a sufficient example of the exception that proves the rule. To approximate to any resemblance to recent Irish events, we must imagine the Ku-Klux Klan riding again in more than the terrors of that vision, wild as the wind, white as the moon, terrible as an army with banners. If there were really such a revival of the Southern action, there would equally be a revival of the Southern argument. It would be clear that Lee was right and Lincoln was wrong; that the Southern States were national and were as indestructible as nations. If the South were as rebellious as Ireland, the North would be as wrong as England.|$|E
