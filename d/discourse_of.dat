40|$|Longstanding inequalities {{have existed}} for Black men {{in mental health}} care service provision, with Black men being {{over-represented}} at the coercive end of the mental health system but under-represented in terms of seeking help voluntarily. An understanding of {{the social context of}} Black men, as well as Black men's conceptions of wellbeing and help-seeking may be useful in developing more accessible services. Nine Black men were interviewed and their transcripts analysed using Foucauldian discourse analysis. Four discourses were identified; <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> oppression and discrimination, <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> Black masculinities, <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> communities and <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> professional systems. <b>Discourses</b> <b>of</b> oppression and discrimination were identified as influential to the other three discourses. These discourses are discussed in the context of Black men's conceptions of wellbeing and helpseeking. Links to how these discourses act to subjugate help-seeking practices are highlighted. Implications of the results are discussed at the policy, service, clinical and research level...|$|R

I provide an alternate perspective, one that views <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> corporate citizenship, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability as ideological movements that are intended to legitimize and consolidate the power of large corporations. I also problematize the popular notion of organizational 'stakeholders'. I argue that stakeholder theory of the firm represents a form of stakeholder colonialism that serves to regulate the behavior of stakeholders.

40|$|This article {{examines}} forms of implicit discrimination towards Muslim children in children’s <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> Otherness.

Building on Critical Race Theory and Critical Discourse Analysis, this article shows that children’s <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> Otherness acted in tacit discriminatory ways by constructing difference as problematic, which positioned Muslim children as the ‘bad Other’. These findings show the intersectionality of discrimination experienced by Muslim children in school, and offer a reflection {{on the role of}} multiculturalism in schools and the limitations <b>of</b> uncritical <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> tolerance in fostering an understanding of difference and Otherness...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{falls under the}} broader Apartheid Archives Project. The aim {{of the project was}} to collect the narratives of black and white South Africans, of their earliest quotidian or everyday racist experiences. This project focused particularly {{on the nature of the}} experiences of racism of (particularly ‘ordinary’) white South Africans under the old apartheid order and their continuing effects on individual and group functioning in contemporary South Africa, especially on the ways in which white South Africans are positioned by racialised discourses and the reproduction of power relations through these positions. The project utilised narratives that were written by white South Africans and were available on the Apartheid Archive Project’s database. In total, the narratives of twelve white, middle-aged, middle class South Africans were analysed using Parker (1992) and Willig’s (2008) guidelines for analysis <b>of</b> the <b>discourses</b> which converge with Foucault’s ideas. This research report gives prominence to the <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> race present in the narratives of white South Africans which were examined and it also focuses on how racialised discourses offer the narrators different subject positions to occupy in present day South Africa. Three discursive themes were identified, namely rationalising discursive strategies, race and racism <b>discourses</b> and <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> redemption. Rationalising discursive strategies were found to utilise <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> innocence, <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> denial and <b>discourses</b> that avoid complicity. These discourses enabled the narrators to be positioned as victims. Race and racism discourses included othering <b>discourses,</b> <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> whiteness and <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> interracial relationships. Through an appeal to these kinds <b>of</b> <b>discourses</b> narrators were able to occupy opposing positions, such as perpetrator, hero, privileged and non-racial. Finally, <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> redemption were also found to be prominent in the narratives. These comprised <b>of</b> religious <b>discourses</b> and notions <b>of</b> white liberalism. The utilisation <b>of</b> such <b>discourses</b> enabled constructions <b>of</b> the narrators as moral, virtuous and honest...|$|R
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> sensibility, a {{moral philosophy}} and aesthetic {{that had become}} popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the city}} was garrisoned for Charles I. Seven {{thousand}} pounds was spent on fortifications, but on the appearance of parliamentary forces the gates were thrown open and the city surrendered. It became a significant post for the New Model Army under William Waller. Bath was retaken by royalists following the Battle of Lansdowne fought on the northern {{outskirts of the city}} on 5 July 1643. Thomas Guidott, a student of chemistry and medicine at Wadham College, Oxford, set up a practice in the city in 1668. He was interested in the curative properties of the waters, and he wrote A <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water in 1676. It brought the health-giving properties of the hot mineral waters {{to the attention of the}} country, and the aristocracy arrived to partake in them.|$|E
5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E
5|$|The medieval era is {{represented}} by the remains of the city walls in Upper Borough Walls. There are no other surviving buildings from this period. Several areas of the city underwent development during the Stuart period, in response to the increasing number of visitors to the spa and resort town who required accommodation. The St Thomas à Becket Church was built between 1490 and 1498 by John Cantlow, Prior of Bath Abbey and took the place of an older Norman church. The church was commonly called Old Widcombe Church and used to be the principal church of the parishes of Widcombe and Lyncombe. The Domesday survey of 1086 shows a small settlement around the church although no trace of it remains. In 1847 a much larger church, St Matthews, was built in Widcombe parish. On 22 April 1847, it was announced that the church bells, which had for centuries been in the tower of St. Thomas à Becket, were to be removed and installed in the new St. Matthew's. Widcombe Manor was originally built in 1656 and then rebuilt in 1727 for Philip Bennet the local MP. Thomas Guidott, moved to Bath and set up practice in 1668. He became interested in the curative properties of the waters and he wrote A <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water in 1676. This brought the health-giving properties of the hot mineral waters {{to the attention of the}} country and soon the aristocracy started to arrive to partake in them.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the ways in}} which <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> abortion and <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> national identity were constructed and reproduced through the events of the X case in the Republic of Ireland in 1992. This case involved a state injunction against a 14 -year-old rape victim and her parents, to prevent them from obtaining an abortion in Britain. By examining the controversy the case gave rise to in the national press, I will argue that the terms of abortion politics in Ireland shifted from arguments based on rights to arguments centred on national identity, through the questions the X case raised about women's citizenship status, and women's position in relation to the nation and the state. <b>Discourses</b> <b>of</b> national identity and <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> abortion shifted away from entrenched traditional positions, towards more liberal articulations...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} {{construction}} of gendered and ethnicised national identities in Australia and Japan. I conceptualise national identities as <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> national belonging, <b>discourses</b> which are actively negotiated and ever-shifting. Specifically, I examine authorised, mass mediated and folk <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> national identity in these two national settings. I draw my data from the following: Australian and Japanese state and academic publications; a sample of television advertisements in Australia and Japan; and focus groups and in-depth interviews with participants in two communities, 'Plainsview,' Tasmania and `Hirogawa,' Hokkaido. I pursue three main objectives in the thesis: I examine the ways national identities are constituted in authorised discourses, the mass media and face-to-face interactions in Australia and Japan; I examine the way <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> national identity reflect, reinforce and challenge current power relations in Australia and Japan; and I examine the place of globalisation in Australian and Japanese constructions of national identity. I argue that authorised, mass mediated and folk <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> national identity in Australia and Japan are imbricated in complex ways. Widely circulating <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> national identity are not imposed on the masses in a top-down fashion, but {{are the product of}} active negotiations of meaning. Neither do such discourses go uncontested. I demonstrate that individuals in a variety of social locations challenge dominant <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> national identity and construct counter-narratives of nation. Furthermore, I argue that <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> national identity which marginalise women and ethnic Others in Australia and Japan, both mirror and help sustain the continued subordination of these social groups. At the same time, counter-narratives of nation constructed by Australians and Japanese both reflect and contribute to the changing status of marginalised groups in these two settings. Finally, I critique the notion that globalising political, economic and other social changes are destabilising national identities and rendering them less salient. Evidence presented in the thesis suggests that globalised social conditions are conducive to the generation of gendered and ethnicised <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> national identity in Australia and Japan...|$|R
