25|$|If {{none of the}} six schools chosen {{accept the}} pupil, the Ministry of <b>Education</b> <b>will</b> work towards finding a school based on {{proximity}} and location, rather than academic excellence of the school, without consulting the student. This makes proper selection of the six choices important. Priority organisation of the choices is also important; if the pupil's score both meets {{the requirements of the}} school of his or her third choice and second choice for example, the second choice will be allocated without the pupil being able to change his or her decisions.|$|E

25|$|Senior {{secondary}} education often refers {{to three years}} high school (or called senior middle school) education, as from grade 10 to grade 12. Normally, students who have finished six years of primary <b>education</b> <b>will</b> continue three more years of academic study in middle schools as regulated by the Compulsory education law {{at the age of}} twelve. This, however, is not compulsory for senior {{secondary education}}, where junior graduates may choose to continue a three-year academic education in academic high schools, which will eventually lead to university, or to switch to a vocational course in vocational high schools.|$|E
25|$|In October 2014, Paramount {{partnered with}} Google to promote Interstellar across {{multiple}} platforms. The film's website was relaunched to be a digital hub hosted on a Google domain. The website collected feedback from film audiences, and {{linked to a}} mobile app. The app featured {{a game in which}} players could build solar system models and use a flight simulator for space travel. The Paramount-Google partnership also included a virtual time capsule compiled with user-generated content to be available in 2015. The initiative Google for <b>Education</b> <b>will</b> also use the film as a basis for promoting lesson plans for math and science in schools around the United States.|$|E
25|$|Section 7 {{is about}} {{curriculum}} and it states that National Education Commission has to ensure curriculums {{used in the}} country have boundaries and standards and guarantee autonomy of curriculum formations if it meets these standards. Ministry of <b>Education</b> <b>will</b> set the standards of National Education Curriculum with approval from the Commission. Schools can teach in either Burmese or English or both languages and if necessary, an ethnic language and Burmese {{can be used in}} primary education. It also mentions that in States and Regions, ethnic language and literature program can be implemented through state and regional governments starting from elementary level and upgraded step by step.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, {{school fees}} for grades 1 to 10 were officially {{abolished}} but hidden costs remained. Other costs include loss of children's wages or unpaid labour for agriculture, tending livestock or housework. Whether children work depends on relative household wealth. Labour-intensive assets such as farms can hire labour if they generate sufficient profit but poorer households may need {{their children to}} help with these assets. This can relate to family size, with larger families sending their younger children to school because older children can help their parents. Attendance is reduced when children have to travel long distances to school since this increases personal risk and transport costs. There are also cultural attitudes against educating girls since <b>education</b> <b>will</b> only benefit her husband's household.|$|E
25|$|The {{current state}} of {{dissection}} in India is deteriorating. The number of hours spent in dissection labs during medical school have decreased substantially over the last twenty years. The future of anatomy <b>education</b> <b>will</b> probably be an elegant mix of traditional methods and integrative computer learning. The use of dissection in early stages of medical training has been shown more effective in the retention of the intended information than their simulated counterparts. However, there is use for the computer generated experience as review in the later stages. The combination of these methods are intended to strength the students understanding and confidence of anatomy, a subject that is infamously difficult to master. There is a growing need for anatomist—seeing as most anatomy labs are taught by graduates hoping to complete degrees in anatomy—to continue the long tradition of anatomy education.|$|E
25|$|About {{governance}} : Two approaches shall {{enable us}} to tackle the problems of higher education institutions’ governance in Africa. The first one is current. It consists of rationalizing, valorizing and modernizing both the university foundations and their various systems of functioning. It supposes to put on better the whole university structure : better management, transparency in the decision-making and the participation of all actors in the decision-making. The second approach of governance fundamentally questions {{the efficiency of the}} systems of functioning of universities, too much centered on the hierarchical authority of the State, and on that of the university and academic administration, whether it is to define the financing, programs, the qualifications and even the courses of training. The governance of higher <b>education</b> <b>will</b> succeed only if it allows creating a common space of meeting between the actors : political, socioeconomic, students, teaching and civil society.|$|E

25|$|On the {{philosophy}} behind {{the process of}} reservation itself, the people in favour of reservation feel that reservation is necessary to undo and counter the 'evils' of centuries of caste system that prevailed in the country. Reservation proponents also contend that merit as it is defined today {{is something that is}} achieved with the help of cramming, tutoring, constant guidance, quality schooling and knowledge of English and poor Dalits, poor MBC's lack most of these. This (the argument cnetering on cramming, tutoring, etc.) the anti-reservationists do not accept, pointing out that not all high-scorers at the exams can hope to eventually succeed in translating their knowledge into skills, but low-scorers especially in higher <b>education</b> <b>will</b> also score badly on the skill ladder proportionately much more than high-scorers. They also suggest that the examination-based approach to merit evaluation calls for a modification to better reflect meritorious performance in practical demonstration of skills, but casteist reservation does not have anything to offer as a solution in this regard. Which, they add, only goes to expose the foul game of the politicians of India many of whom have a record of strongly alleged offences and crimes of numerous types.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} of centuries of social injustice through the caste system (see below, {{in the next}} Section) is not accepted by those who {{point out that the}} caste system, although differently known and practised in different societies, is a tribal hangover from the past, which had some merit in that it ensured, or 'reserved', specified jobs to be done castes which had a preference to do so. They have no sanction in the Vedas (the Upanishads Section) in which only speak of four broad 'Varnas' or divisions according to the temperament of people and of inter-Varna switch, or mobility, based on individual efforts when he/she happens to be borne to a man of a particular Varna. This process, called 'Samskara' is, approximately, conscious individual refinement. In a true sense, therefore, the talk of deliberate subjugation of or discrimination of upper castes against lower castes has no basis, even though distortions of the principle has happened historically, without sanction of the Vedas. Hence reservation, the anti-reservationists seem to say, is just a mask for demanding reservations under the cloak of casteism over-riding merit and blissfully ignoring that Vedas do not sanction this. At any rate, after several decades of Varna reservation for the lowest social strata comprising certain classes constitutionally enshrined as 'scheduled castes' and 'scheduled tribes', and otherwise open competition to all people irrespective of any criteria other than merit and aptitude, there is no justification for the political parties to demand extend reservation of educational admission and job opportunities to more classes ('other backward castes'). It is pointed out that more opportunities in keeping with the uncontrolled growth in population, in all spheres of economic activity as well as <b>education,</b> <b>will</b> be the only right answer and not reservation. However, since proportional representation is the basis of modern democracy as it is practised, these anti-reservationists point out, this, in India, has led to its most abominable abuse, resulting in a democracy which is of and by Indians but against their own interests, since a disunited country oblivious of equality of opportunity because of prohibitive reservation levels, can never compete successfully in the global context, nor achieve much in its own management of internal economy.(Already due to politicisation of trade unions, India's labour productivity remains among the lowest in the world, as a UK study had pointed out a few years ago.) The abuse of political power to demand reservation for all other than the so-called 'forward ' communities is, according to the contesters, just a vote bank politics to woo the majority represented by the beneficiary communities to cast their votes in their favour. Since, however, there are no opponents among political parties to educational and job reservations, in view of their universal vote bank politics, such reservation in themselves cannot favour any particular parties at the elections.|$|E

To reinforce this forbidden physical intimacy, Sihanaka have historically used a formal term of address when speaking to these particular family members. Mothers are traditionally subject to several fady, such as not being allowed to look at dead infants, eat veal, or eat a particular type of banana once their child had learned to say the word for it. Parents were traditionally responsible for educating their own children, and while today those who can afford a formal <b>education</b> <b>will</b> study at school, parents and the broader community remain collectively engaged in educating children into social and cultural norms and practices. Male children are circumcised by their families no later than the age of seven.|$|E
