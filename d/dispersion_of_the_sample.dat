30|$|Although {{many studies}} {{investigated}} analytical systems for both analytical and point-of-care (POC) applications [14 – 16], detecting biomolecules at concentrations below {{the limit of}} detection (LOD) is still a critical issue for analytical devices. To address this problem, an ICP-based preconcentrator has been developed [17, 18] for enhancing the LOD. In many cases, the preconcentration plug, particularly used for the delivery of preconcentrated samples to external equipment and devices, needs to deliver the samples with minimal dispersion; however, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> plug is a critical issue [19]. When the electric field is removed, the force balance between external hydraulic force/electric field and depletion force cannot be maintained. Hence, the ICP preconcentration plug is drastically dispersed in the fluidic channel, which severely hampers the use of preconcentration devices with external analytical devices (i.e., mass spectrometry and sensors).|$|E

Using the latest equipment for subsurface imaging, that included a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope, gold mobilisation features were indentified.
