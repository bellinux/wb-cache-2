40|$|O trabalho {{consiste}} em uma análise experimental comparativa do processo de combustão e de transferência de calor ao longo de uma fornalha flamotubular. Os combustíveis utilizados são o óleo diesel e o biodiesel proveniente de óleo de fritura. Uma outra parcela deste trabalho é investigar os níveis de emissões gasosas no processo de combustão do biodiesel em fornalha flamotubular. Não seria possível realizar esta pesquisa sem uma fornalha flamotubular dotada de câmaras calorimétricas, janelas de observação e extração de gás, e totalmente instrumentada. Assim, foi efetuado em paralelo o projeto e a construção de uma fornalha calorimétrica flamotubular. Os parâmetros utilizados para se analisar os combustíveis na fornalha são: rendimento térmico, taxa de fluxo mássico, temperatura de chama e perda de carga. Observou-se que o óleo diesel apresentou maior taxa de transferência de calor para a maioria das seções expostas à chama. Na região onde o corpo da chama não está presente, a taxa de transferência de calor do biodiesel torna-se ligeiramente superior. Em relação às emissões gasosas observaram-se baixos níveis de poluentesThis work {{consists in}} a comparative experimental {{evaluation of the}} process of combustion and heat transfer along a flame tube furnace. The fuels used are diesel oil and ethyl ester from waste vegetable oil (biodiesel). Another part of this work investigates the percentage of pollutants and emissions of gases in the flame tube furnace. It would not be possible to carry out this research without a flame tube furnace endowed with calorimetric chambers, windows of observation and extraction of gases, and totally instrumented. Thus, the project and the construction of a flame tube calorimetric furnace were done parallel. The parameters used to analyze the fuels in the furnace are: thermal efficiency, mass flow rate, temperature of flame and <b>draught</b> <b>loss.</b> It was observed that diesel oil presented higher heat transfer rate {{in most parts of the}} furnace that was near the flame. In the region where the body of flame is not present, the heat transfer rate of biodiesel becomes a little higher. In relation to emission of gases, it was observed low indexes of pollutant...|$|E

50|$|She {{was built}} by New Admiralty yard, Saint Petersburg. Construction started on 29 October 1888, and she was {{launched}} on 3 July 1893. Completed in 1894, she was 600 tons over her designed displacement which led {{to an increase in}} <b>draught</b> and a <b>loss</b> in speed. Her trials were difficult and she had to return to Kronstadt to have repairs after 19 days. Several modernisation schemes to correct the defects were considered but did not proceed due to extensive demands on the Russian shipbuilding industry.|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a severe, highly {{communicable}} {{viral disease}} of cloven-hoofed animals including cattle, buffaloes, pigs, sheep and goats. Although FMD does {{not result in}} high mortality in most outbreaks, the disease is debilitating and leads to significant economic losses from its impact on trade. FMD has {{a significant impact on}} livestock systems due to lower production of infected animals resulting from reduced food intake, reduced meat and milk production and <b>draught</b> capacity, and <b>losses</b> from reduced trade and tourism-related activities (Kazimi and Shan 1980; Morris et al. 2002; Perry et al. 2002). Before this study, there was little epidemiological information on which to formulate logical procedures for control. A further constraint to the development of extension programs for the control of FMD is the lack of information about the disease, including its prevalence and incidence and the direct and indirect losses incurred. The current study was developed to better understand the pattern of FMD and the risk attributed to the spread of the disease in Cambodia. This information will be used to underpin the estab¬lishment of a progressive zoning approach to control FMD in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate different injection methods for slurry on ley established on various soils. In full-scale experiments the placements of the slurry as well as ammonia emissions and yields were measured after injection in open slots with three techniques: pressurised injec-tion (PI), shallow injection with V-shaped discs (SIO 1), and shallow injection with two angled discs (SIO 2). The performance between the injectors varied and only the SIO 2 was able to place the slurry in ley below soil surface on all three soil types. The ammonia release was on average halved after injection with SIO 2 compared to band spreading, however there was an average loss of 19 kg N ha- 1. A tine for shallow injection in closed slots (tubulator) was therefore developed. In small scale with single tines, the tubulator was compared to SIO 2 with regards to slurry placement, ammonia emissions and <b>draught</b> requirements. Ammonia <b>losses</b> after injection with the tubulator tine were only 1. 6 % of the total applied ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) compared to 27 % with the SIO 2. The draught requirement for the tubulator was roughly the same, or a little higher than the SIO 2 tine. In the full-scale experiments, the reduced loss of ammonia nitrogen with SIO 2 did not result in higher DM yield or higher nitrogen efficiency of the second cut as compared to band spreading...|$|R
