Her body was later reburied in Mayagüez, on November 13 of that year. Salvador Brau, a historian and close friend, later wrote that once Betances returned to Puerto Rico with Lita's body, he suspended all personal activities besides his medical work, spent {{a considerable amount of}} time caring for her tomb at the Mayagüez cemetery, and assumed the physical aspect that most people identify Betances with: <b>dark</b> <b>suit,</b> long unkempt beard, and [...] "Quaker" [...] hat.|$|E

He is most commonly described as very tall and thin with unnaturally long, tentacle-like arms (or merely tentacles), which he can extend to intimidate or capture prey. In most stories his face is white and featureless, but occasionally his face appears differently to anyone who sees it. He appears to be wearing a <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> and tie.

500|$|The vast {{majority}} of pupils at Carre's continue on to the Sixth Form, and there were 240 students on roll in 2013. Along with St George's Academy, Carre's {{is part of the}} Sleaford Joint Sixth Form, which was founded in 1983 and included Kesteven and Sleaford High School until it withdrew in 2010. It provides a common timetable across both sites and allows for pupils to choose from A-Level options offered at both schools. Pupils may apply to be based at either school, where their pastoral and tutorial activities take place. There are entry requirements based on GCSE attainment. Sixth Formers can be selected to be prefects, who have responsibilities around the school under the supervision of staff; they are headed by a Head Boy and Girl. The students are required to wear business-dress; for males, this consists of a <b>dark</b> <b>suit,</b> a [...] "non-vivid" [...] shirt and the school's sixth form tie; females must dress in [...] "smart business wear".|$|E

500|$|Andersen then fled to Sweden, and {{travelled}} {{on to the}} United Kingdom, {{where he}} was recruited by Professor Leif Tronstad for work with the British Special Operations Executive. In this context he used the surname Ostein during the war. In the United Kingdom, Andersen suggested a series of further assassinations in Oslo, naming targets and describing plans for how {{to carry out the}} killings. The British saw great potential as an agent in a man with Andersen's background. Andersen and his group was parachuted from a Halifax bomber to Kjerkeberget near Sandungen in Nordmarka, Oslo. Received by Gunnar Sønsteby and Sverre Ellingsen, this was the first parachute drop received by the resistance group Milorg's District 13. The group spent a month training Milorg resistance people in weapons handling. They were originally intended to carry out assassinations of leading Norwegian Nazis and informers as part of Operation Bittern, first and foremost police minister and Germanske SS Norge leader Jonas Lie, but this was refused by the local resistance leaders because of fears of reprisals. Andersen had suggested killing the top-ranking Nazi leader, and the SOE approved. According to a plan formulated by the SOE, Andersen was to don a light suit, enter Lie's office in broad daylight, shoot the police minister {{in the head with a}} Colt pistol, change to a <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> hidden underneath the light one, and disappear in the confusion. Andersen commented on the SOE plan: [...] "Lie might survive this assassination attempt, but I won't." [...] Andersen instead wanted to kill Lie on his way from the office to his home. The Bittern operation was severely criticized by the Norwegian Home Forces in a letter to the Norwegian exile government in London.|$|E

2500|$|At , the Academy canvas {{is larger}} than Eakins' {{customary}} format of [...] for a bust portrait. He is seen in formal attire, wearing a <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> with buttoned waistcoat, white shirt and a dark tie. His hair is unkempt and his mustache unevenly trimmed; the contrast between clothing and grooming alludes to a rebellious nature restrained by cultural mores. Compared to the smaller portrait, {{there is a greater}} sense of space and less intense physical immediacy— for John Updike, the National Academy picture [...] "tames down a more truculent and even satanic earlier version"— though in both paintings Eakins makes direct eye contact with the viewer, a motive he very rarely used except for subjects with whom he was most familiar. Rarer still is such emphasis on the eye's liquid reflection, which accents the emotional impact of the image. The pose of the upper body is the same as that which Eakins used in Portrait of Leslie W.

[...] Another central figure in a UFO legend, Albert Bender supposedly was silenced by menacing men in black in 1953 because he had discovered the answer to the UFO mystery.

2500|$|Formal or sober {{clothing}} is typically worn beneath the gown so, for example, men would often wear a <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> {{with a white}} shirt and a tie, or clerical clothing, military or civil uniform, or national dress, and women would wear equivalent attire. Some older universities, particularly Oxford and Cambridge, have a prescribed set of dress (known as subfusc) to be worn under the gown. Though some universities are relaxed about what people wear under their gowns, it is nevertheless considered bad form to be in casual wear or the like during graduation ceremonies, and a number of universities may bar finishing students from joining the procession or the ceremony itself if not appropriately dressed (though this sometimes refers only to requiring the proper wear of academic dress and not what is worn beneath it, if unseen). [...] In the Commonwealth, gowns are worn open, while in the United States, it has become common for gowns to close at the front, as did the original roba.|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Romano was {{an elderly}} man living with his two nieces, Pauline and Mary Bruno. On August 10, 1918, Pauline and Mary awoke {{to the sound of}} a commotion in the {{adjoining}} room where their uncle resided. [...] Upon entering the room, the sisters discovered that their uncle had taken a serious blow to his head, which resulted in two open cuts. [...] The assailant was fleeing the scene as they arrived, yet the girls were able to distinguish that he was a dark-skinned, heavy-set man, who wore a <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> and slouched hat. [...] Romano, although seriously injured, was able to walk to the ambulance once it arrived, yet died two days later due to severe head trauma. The home had been ransacked, yet no items were stolen from Romano. Authorities found a bloody axe in the back yard, and discovered that a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. [...] The Romano murder created a state of extreme chaos in the city, with residents living in constant fear of an axeman attack. Police received a slew of reports, in which citizens claimed to have seen an axeman lurking in New Orleans neighborhoods. [...] A few men even called to report that they had found axes in their back yards. John Dantonio, a then-retired Italian detective, made public statements in which he hypothesized that the man who had committed the axeman murders was the same who had killed several individuals in 1911. The retired detective cited similarities in the manner by which the two sets of homicides had been committed, as reason to assume that they had been conducted by the same individual. Dantonio described the potential killer as an individual of dual personalities, who killed without motive. [...] This type of individual, Dantonio stated, could very likely have been a normal, law-abiding citizen, who was often overcome by an overwhelming desire to kill. [...] He later went on to describe the killer as a real-life [...] "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde".|$|E
