40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{preparing}} this final {{project was to}} determine 1) the types of machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing process of <b>input</b> <b>funnel,</b> chopper shaft lid, and output funnel 2) the equipment needed to fulfill safety manufacturing process, 3) the sequence process, 4) the time required in the manufacturing process; 5) the costs in making funnel, chopper shaft lid, and output funnel 6) performance when the machine is operated. The methods used in the manufacturing of <b>input</b> <b>funnel,</b> chopper shaft lid, and output funnel are the working plan identification, the material identification, the selection of machinery and equipment used, and the determination of work processes to be used. While the process stages include preparation of materials, paint materials, the cutting process, the formation process, and the surface finish. The material used is eyzer plate with a thickness of 1. 2 mm. Machineries and equipments used are hydrolic JORG plate cutting machine type 40662, Edwards Truefold manual bending machine, plate rolling machine BSR/ 2 / 45, Hitachi drilling machine, SMAW welding machine brands OTC KR 400, a compressor and spray gun, steel ruler, roll feet, elbows ruler, protractor, etcher, pointer, plate shears, caliper, hand drill machine BOSCH 65 B 20 - 2, miserly, anvil and hammer. The time required based on real-time process is approximately 987 minutes or 16 hours and 45 minutes. Performance test on fodder chopping machine is able to chop 1. 5 kg fodder in 1 minute. <b>Input</b> <b>funnel,</b> chopper shaft lid, and output funnel are able to withstand the fodder so {{it will not be}} scattered. ...|$|E
40|$|Cross-modal {{activity}} in visual cortex of blind subjects {{has been reported}} during performance of variety of non-visual tasks. A key unanswered question is through which pathways non-visual <b>inputs</b> are <b>funneled</b> to the visual cortex. Here we used tomographic analysis of single trial magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded from one congenitally blind and two sighted subjects after stimulation of {{the left and right}} median nerves at three intensities: below sensory threshold, above sensory threshold and above motor threshold; the last sufficient to produce thumb twitching. We identified reproducible brain responses in the primary somatosensory (S 1) and motor (M 1) cortices at around 20 ms post-stimulus, which were very similar in sighted and blind subjects. Time-frequency analysis revealed strong 45 to 70 Hz activity at latencies of 20 to 50 ms in S 1 and M 1, and posterior parietal cortex Brodmann areas (BA) 7 and 40, which compared to lower frequencies, were substantially more pronounced in the blind than the sighted subjects. Critically, at frequencies from Î±-band up to 100 Hz we found clear, strong and widespread responses in the visual cortex of the blind subject, which increased with the intensity of the somatosensory stimuli. Time-delayed mutual information (MI) revealed that in blind subject the stimulus information is funneled from the early somatosensory to visual cortex through posterior parietal BA 7 and 40, projecting first to visual areas V 5 and V 3, and eventually V 1. The flow of information through this pathway occured in stages characterized by convergence of activations into specific cortical regions. In sighted subjects, no linked activity was found that led from the somatosensory to the visual cortex through any of the studied brain regions. These results provide the first evidence from MEG that in blind subjects, tactile information is routed from primary somatosensory to occipital cortex via the posterior parietal cortex...|$|R
40|$|The two {{equilibrium}} receptor organs (statocysts) of Nautilus are avoid sacks, half-filled {{with numerous}} small, free-moving statoconia and half with endolymph. The inner surface of each statocyst {{is lined with}} 130, 000 - 150, 000 primary sensory hair cells. The hair cells are of two morphological types. Type A hair cells carry 10 - 15 kinocilia arranged in a single ciliary row; they {{are present in the}} ventral half of the statocyst. Type B hair cells carry 8 - 10 irregularly arranged kinocilia; they are present in the dorsal half of the statocyst. Both type of hair cells are morphologically polarized. To test whether these features allow the Nautilus statocyst to sense angular accelerations, behavioural experiments were performed to measure statocyst-dependent funnel movements during sinusoidal oscillations of restrained Nautilus around a vertical body axis. Such dynamic rotatory stimulation caused horizontal phase-locked movements of the funnel. The funnel movements were either in the same direction (compensatory funnel response), or in the opposite direction (funnel follow response) to that of the applied rotation. Compensatory funnel movements were also seen during optokinetic stimulation (with a black and white stripe pattern) and during stimulations in which optokinetic and statocyst stimulations were combined. These morphological and behavioural findings show that the statocysts of Nautilus, in addition to their function as gravity receptor organs, are able to detect rotatory movements (angular accelerations) without the specialized receptor systems (crista/cupula systems) that are found in the statocysts of coleoid cephalopods. The findings further indicate that both statocyst and visual <b>inputs</b> control compensatory <b>funnel</b> movements...|$|R
