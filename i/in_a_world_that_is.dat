500|$|... is a Japanese action {{role-playing}} game, {{developed by}} Mistwalker and AQ Interactive for the Wii video game console. Nintendo published the title in all regions except for North America, {{where it was}} published by Xseed Games. Initially released in Japan in 2011, the game was released in western territories through 2012. The Last Story takes place upon the island fortress of Lazulis, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> slowly being drained of life by an unknown force. The story focuses {{on a group of}} mercenaries looking for work on Lazulis; one of their number, Zael, dreams of becoming a knight. After receiving the mystical [...] "Mark of the Outsider", Zael becomes involved with a noblewoman named Calista in an ongoing war between humans and the beast-like Gorak. During gameplay, the player controls Zael as he and the mercenary group to which he belongs undertake missions on Lazulis. Zael can command the rest of the mercenary squad during missions, and fights in battles that involve action, tactical and stealth elements. Multiple online multiplayer modes are also present.|$|E
500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, Late Registration {{serves as}} an {{exhibition}} of [...] "the stealthy power of West's storytelling." [...] West stated that his goal for the album was to touch on topics that {{people from all walks}} of life could find relatable, while remaining true to himself: [...] " [...] raps that were just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith." [...] The opening track [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] is a [...] "mournfully contemplative" [...] song that [...] "talks about being honest with yourself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not." [...] The song is written from the perspective of an afflicted, impoverished American quietly lamenting the fallacies of society and questioning the ways of the world around him. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within [...] "Gold Digger" [...] in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married to a woman who manipulates him for financial gain. However, another story arises within the third verse, which illustrates a once destitute black male who earns a fortune and decides to leave a loyal, unselfish girlfriend for a white woman.|$|E
500|$|Hoping {{to write}} a song that would {{successfully}} [...] "portray [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so protected and safe", Ashman and Menken drew inspiration from a story-telling style that is often reserved for traditional operettas. As Beauty and the Beasts opening number, [...] "Belle", a [...] "pivotal moment...in the narrative", {{plays a significant role}} in the film by introducing both the film's heroine, Belle, after whom the song is named, and Gaston, the film's villain. While Belle, a book-loving and intelligent nonconformist who has grown frustrated with her predictable village life, longs for an adventure similar to the ones she reads about in her books, Gaston is a narcissistic hunter who seeks her hand in marriage. In roughly five minutes, the song explains both Belle and Gaston's roles in Beauty and the Beast to the audience. The song also voices the opinions of the townsfolk and [...] "sets up the overall theme and foreshadows what makes the town so oppressive to [...] "; [...] while the villagers award Belle high praise for her doubtless Beauty, they see her as odd because of her love of books and ridicule her for her non-conformity. However, they appraise Gaston for his looks and masculinity.|$|E

This reliance is especially evident in Western medicine. Even so, Heidegger makes ang allusion to this reliance {{in what he calls}} the allure or [...] "character of exactness." [...] In effect, people are inherently attached to [...] "exactness" [...] because it gives them a sense of purpose or reason <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> largely defined by what appears to be [...] and irrationality.

2500|$|While {{composing}} the orchestral {{score that}} accompanies the film's prologue, Menken {{was inspired by}} the French suite The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns, referring to it as his own version of Saint-Saëns' composition. Menken believes that all properly structured musicals should feature an [...] "I Want" [...] song because they are essentially [...] "about a character having a big dream, then [...] some obstacle to that quest." [...] "Belle", the film's opening number, is an [...] "orchestra-driven", [...] "snare-tapping" [...] song.

Musically, Menken based [...] "Belle" [...] on the narrative style of a traditional operetta, describing it as [...] "something to portray Belle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so protected and safe." [...] Menken described the film's following musical number, [...] "Gaston", as a hilarious [...] "drinking song sung by basically a group of Neanderthal level guys in praise of a complete lug-head", referring to Ashman's choice of song lyrics as humorous and [...] "tongue in cheek".|$|E
2500|$|Two {{characters}} comprising a supercouple {{will usually}} reunite and marry, while {{the most significant}} obstacle for the pairing is the soap opera genre itself; as soap operas typically continue for decades, there is no closure for the pairing unless both characters leave the show together or one of them dies. It is because of this, that after the usual fairytale wedding, if the supercouple remains on the series, writers do not allow the item to {{live happily ever after}} as a couple in a fairy tale would but rather subject them to a continual cycle of being separated and reunited. This factor has contributed to two characters of a supercouple normally divorcing and remarrying each other a few or several times. Author Diana Reep argues that the supercouple phenomenon creates [...] "serious storyline problems" [...] for producers and writers due to characters' being destined for only one lover:The problem supercouples create for storytellers is that, as characters, therefore, they are unchanging in a narrative form that emphasizes evolving characters and relationships... and as ideals, supercouples bring closure to a relationship <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> based in continuing expectations of change.|$|E

2500|$|Accordingly, Baudrillard {{argued that}} the excess of signs and of meaning in late 20th century [...] "global" [...] society had caused (quite paradoxically) an effacement of reality. In this world neither liberal nor Marxist utopias are any longer {{believed}} in. We live, he argued, not in a [...] "global village", to use Marshall McLuhan's phrase, but rather <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> ever more easily petrified by even the smallest event. Because the [...] "global" [...] world operates {{at the level of}} the exchange of signs and commodities, it becomes ever more blind to symbolic acts such as, for example, terrorism. In Baudrillard's work the symbolic realm (which he develops a perspective on through the anthropological work of Marcel Mauss and Georges Bataille) is seen as quite distinct from that of signs and signification. Signs can be exchanged like commodities; symbols, on the other hand, operate quite differently: they are exchanged, like gifts, sometimes violently as a form of potlatch. Baudrillard, particularly in his later work, saw the [...] "global" [...] society as without this [...] "symbolic" [...] element, and therefore symbolically (if not militarily) defenseless against acts such as the Rushdie Fatwa or, indeed, the September 11 terrorist attacks against the United States and its military and economic establishment.|$|E

A chauffeur {{took her to the}} fields to inform her husband. According to his daughter, Jeanie Laube, [...] "My mom said, 'You won the Nobel Peace Prize,' and he said, 'No, I haven't',... It took some convincing... He thought the whole thing was a hoax". He was awarded the prize on December 10. In his Nobel Lecture the following day, he speculated on his award: [...] "When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution to the 'green revolution', they were in effect, I believe, selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of agriculture and food production <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hungry, both for bread and for peace". His speech repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population. [...] "The green revolution has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.|$|E

[...] Hans remembers the day that Ondine left and asks, [...] "But why does she proclaim to the world that she deceived me with Bertram?" [...] In addition to being preoccupied with Ondine, Hans is worried because the servants are starting to speak in poetry and there is a Wittenstein legend that this always happens just before misfortune strikes.
