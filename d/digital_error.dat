50|$|Another {{improvement}} to many flash ADCs is {{the inclusion}} of <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> correction. When the ADC is used in harsh environments or constructed from very small integrated circuit processes, there is a heightened risk that a single comparator will randomly change state resulting in a wrong code. Bubble error correction is a digital correction mechanism that prevents a comparator that has, for example, tripped high from reporting logic high if it is surrounded by comparators that are reporting logic low.|$|E

5000|$|The Gilbert-Elliott {{model is}} a simple channel model {{introduced}} by Edgar Gilbert and E. O. Elliott [...] widely used for describing burst error patterns in transmission channels, that enables simulations of the <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> performance of communications links. It {{is based on a}} Markov chain with two states G (for good or gap) and B (for bad or burst). In state G the probability of transmitting a bit correctly is k and in state B it is h. Usually, it is assumed that k = 1. Gilbert provided equations for deriving the other three parameters (G and B state transition probabilities and h) from a given success/failure sequence. In his example, the sequence was too short to correctly find h (a negative probability was found) and so Gilbert assumed that h = 0.5.|$|E

30|$|Currently {{pervasive}} {{communication systems}} in practice are almost digital-based. Shannon’s source-channel separation theorem has long convinced people that {{information can be}} transmitted without loss of optimality by a two-step procedure: compression and encoding. This fundamental result has {{laid the foundation for}} the typical structure of modern digital communication systems—the tandem structure of source coding followed by channel coding. Although digital communication systems have been well developed over the last decades, they has inherent drawbacks. First, to transmit continuous-alphabet sources, signals are quantized, which introduces permanent loss in information. Second, to precisely represent real-valued signals via digits, the bandwidth is usually expanded. Moreover, the subsequent channel coding procedure makes transmission further bandwidth demanding. Third, the <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> correction codes are highly signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) dependent. Take turbo and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes as examples. When the receiving SNR is under some threshold value, the decoding performance is usually very poor. On the contrary, once SNR exceeds this threshold, their bit error ratio (BER) falls down drastically in a narrow SNR range (waterfall region). This ungraceful degradation in performance can cause problems in applications. A typical scenario is the broadcasting system, where the SNR for different receivers can vary over a large range. At the same time, the <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> correction codes are not energy efficient since more transmission power slightly increases performance as long as the receiving SNR is modestly above the threshold. Last but not least, <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> correction codes with satisfying performance usually require a long block length, which introduces high latency for decoding and processing at the receiver.|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, {{a direct}} {{conversion}} receiver (DCR), zero IF or homodyne receiver applying in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) sampling has been revisited {{in conjunction with}} <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> compensation. Contrary to common practice, our main interest {{is focused on the}} investigation of performance degradation in conjunction with the processing of ultra-wideband frequency division multiplex (FDM) signals. To this end, all potential error sources have been identified and introduced into a comprehensive error model. This error model comprises path individual DC-offsets, gain, phase and time delay mismatch, bidirectional crosstalk between the input ports of the down-converters, quantisation and overflow saturation (clipping) errors, as well as time jitter due to sample-and-hold circuits and clock generator. For all of these error sources an exact error analysis has been carried out. Furthermore, a typical error scenario taken from an ultra-wideband application in satellite communications has been used to demonstrate the overall performance degradation {{as a result of the}} combination of these error contributions. For this application, the major degradations are caused by DC-offsets that heavily impair the channel centred at zero frequency, branch time delay difference that are most pronounced in edge channels, and gain mismatch. Each of these three error sources introduces, on its own, a performance degradation such that error compensation measures are compulsive. In contrast, all other error contributions are of minor influence. To reduce degradation, blind <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> compensation methods have been investigated to estimate and compensate the most important errors. In particular, a novel approach to compensate for I/Q time delay mismatch has been developed. The combination of this novel delay mismatch compensation method with known DC-offset, gain, and phase compensation techniques results in highly improved signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR). This enhancement due to <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> compensation will be demonstrated by simulation by applying the above ultra-wideband scenario. I...|$|E

30|$|Among {{the family}} of analog coding schemes, one special class is {{constructed}} through chaotic dynamic systems. In dynamic systems, the signal sequence is generated by iteratively invoking some predefined mapping function. To be specific, the next signal (state) is obtained by performing a mapping to the current signal (state), and the whole signal (state) sequence is initialized by the input signal. For a chaotic dynamic system, the function governing the signal generation (state transition) is chosen as chaotic functions. Chaotic functions are characterized by their fast divergence, which is more well known as the remarkable butterfly effect. This property means that even a very tiny difference in initial inputs will soon result in significantly different signal sequences. From the signal space expansion viewpoint, this indicates that a pair of points in source space with small distance will have a large distance in the code space. So chaotic dynamic systems can potentially entitle signals with error resistance. The seminal work [16] proposes an analog system based on the tent map dynamic system, and its performance is extensively discussed in [17]. As with the analysis performed in [18, 19], the drawback of the tent map code is that its performance convergence Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) requires very high SNR. Rosenhouse and Weiss [20] propose an improvement scheme by protecting the itinerary of the tent map codes with <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> correction codes. However, this hybrid-digital-analog scheme still suffers from the drawbacks rooted in <b>digital</b> <b>error</b> correction codes.|$|E
