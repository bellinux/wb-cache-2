5|$|After Icos's {{experimental}} drugs {{failed in}} clinical trials, <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> {{was in a}} prime position to purchase the company. In October2006, <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> announced that it had reached terms to acquire Icos for $2.1billion, or $32 a share. After receiving pressure from large institutional shareholders as well as proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) suggesting the deal should be rejected, Lilly increased its offer to $2.3billion or $34 per share, a 6% increase. Again, resistance was voiced by some large shareholders, and ISS advised shareholders against accepting the new offer, which it still deemed insufficient. On January 25, 2007, at a special meeting, 77% of the shareholders voted {{in support of the}} acquisition. <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> closed the transaction to acquire Icos for $2.3billion on January29, 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, chemist <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly,</b> a Union colonel {{during the}} Civil War, founded <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> and Company, a {{pharmaceutical}} company. His initial innovation of gelatin-coating for pills {{led to a}} rapid growth {{of the company that}} eventually developed as Indiana's largest corporation, and one of the largest corporations in the world. Over the years, the corporation developed many widely used drugs, including insulin, and it became the first company to mass-produce penicillin. The company's many advances made Indiana the leading state in the production and development of medicines.|$|E

5|$|Icos {{is famous}} for tadalafil (Cialis), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. This drug was {{discovered}} by GlaxoSmithKline, developed by Icos, and manufactured and marketed in partnership with <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly.</b> Boosted by a unique advertising campaign led by the Grey Worldwide Agency, sales from Cialis allowed Icos to become profitable in 2006. Cialis was the only drug developed by the company to be approved. LeukArrest, a drug to treat shock, and Pafase, developed for sepsis, were both tested in phaseIII clinical trials, but testing was discontinued after unpromising results during the trials. <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> acquired Icos in January 2007, and most of Icos's workers were laid off soon after. CMC Biologics, a Danish contract manufacturer, bought the remnants of Icos and retained the remaining employees.|$|E
5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity and the rise of labor unions in the city. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. New industries in Indianapolis included pork-packing plants and foundries, as well as numerous manufacturers, small businesses, retail shops, and banks. In 1876 Colonel <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory on Indianapolis's Pearl Street, founding what later became <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> and Company. The Union Railroad Transfer and Stock Yards Company, another major employer, opened in 1877. After the war, Indianapolis continued to develop into a transportation hub. Existing railroad lines expanded and new ones were established, linking Indianapolis to other cities across the nation.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Cialis {{generated}} $971million in sales, leading Icos to post its first-ever quarterly {{profit in}} August. In May 2009, tadalafil, {{to be sold}} as Adcirca by United Therapeutics, was approved in the United States {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary arterial hypertension based on data from a pivotal study begun before the sale of Icos to <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to donations from individuals, the BSA receives extensive donations from major corporations. In 2010, their top corporate donors were, in order, Intel, Emerson, Verizon, 3M, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Pfizer, Valero, UPS, U.S. Bank, <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly,</b> GE, and Monsanto. However, Intel and UPS cut funding to BSA in 2012.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the acquisition, <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> gained {{complete}} ownership of Cialis, and promptly shut down Icos operations and laid off Icos personnel, except for 127employees working at the biologics facility. Icos was the largest biotechnology company in the state of Washington {{at the time of the}} acquisition, and employed around 700people. In December2007, CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S, a Copenhagen-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell biologics facility and retained the existing 127employees.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> {{experienced}} dramatic growth during Daniels' {{tenure at}} the company. Prozac sales made up 30–40% of Lilly's income during the mid-to-late 1990s, and Lilly doubled its assets to $12.8 billion and doubled its revenue to $10 billion during the same period. When Daniels later became Governor of Indiana, he drew heavily on his former Lilly colleagues to serve as advisers and agency managers.|$|E
50|$|The “wonder drug” {{replaced}} earlier medications, tricyclic antidepressants, {{which were}} less effective with {{serious side effects}} such as headaches, blurred vision and hypertension. By 1999, Prozac was bringing in $2.5 billion per year, 25% of <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly’s</b> revenue. The drug helped erase the stigma of depression, inspiring celebrities and public figures to flaunt rather than hide their sufferings.|$|R
50|$|A {{compound}} {{related to}} torcetrapib, Dalcetrapib (investigative name JTT-705/R1658), was also studied, but trials have ceased.

The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created {{a great deal of}} consternation amongst the Confederates.|$|R
5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth in Hoosier {{cities and towns}} ushered {{in a new era}} of economic prosperity. By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural that it previously had been. Overall, the war caused Indiana's industries to grow exponentially, although the state's southern counties experienced growth after the war at a slower rate than its other counties. The state's population shifted to central and northern Indiana as new industries and cities began to develop around the Great Lakes and the railroad depots erected during the war. In 1876 Colonel <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory in Indianapolis, founding what later became <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> and Company. Indianapolis was also the wartime home of Richard Gatling, inventor of the Gatling Gun, one of the world's first machine guns. Although his invention was used in some Civil War-era campaigns, it was not fully adopted for use by the U.S. Army until 1866. Charles Conn, another war veteran, founded C. G. Conn Ltd. in Elkhart, Indiana, where the manufacturing of musical instruments became a new industry for the town.|$|E

5|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, the John Herron Art Institute placed an {{emphasis}} on professionalism and growth in collections. Wilbur Peat, director of the museum from 1929 until 1965, acquired significant portions of the collection. Peat also made connections with benefactors such as Dr. George H. A. Clowes, Booth Tarkington, and <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly.</b> Caroline Marmon Fesler, president of the Art Association of Indianapolis, gave a number of artworks in the 1940s, including 20th-century modern artworks and Post-Impressionist works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Seurat. After years of debate surrounding expansion and relocation of the museum and school, the great grandchildren of <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly,</b> J.K. Lilly III and Ruth Lilly, donated the family estate, Oldfields, to the Art Association of Indianapolis in 1966. One year later {{it was decided that}} the school would become a part of Indiana University's Indianapolis campus in an effort to assist with accreditation. That same year it was confirmed that the museum would relocate to Oldfields, with the new Krannert Pavilion opening to the public in October 1970. In 1969, prior to moving to the new site, the Art Association of Indianapolis officially changed its name to the Indianapolis Museum of Art.|$|E
40|$|Countries face a {{new threat}} that strikes at {{their ability to}} balance {{protection}} of intellectual property rights against other priorities, such as public health. They {{may have to pay}} substantial compensation to companies that dislike domestic intellectual property laws. This threat is much more significant than the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS”), a landmark international agreement concluded twenty years ago, {{that for the first time}} required all countries to provide “minimum” levels of intellectual property rights; before that time, countries were not obligated to provide any such rights at all. Since the conclusion of TRIPS, policymakers and scholars have strived to preserve local flexibilities to consider domestic policies, such as public health. However, those flexibilities may quickly evaporate if companies can bring claims against countries for compromising private investments under so-called “investor-state arbitration” claims. This is not a theoretical problem—Eli Lilly is currently seeking $ 500 million in compensation from Canada because Canadian courts invalidated two of its patents under prevailing law. In addition, there are unique issues raised by Eli Lily’s claim that transcend broader concerns raised by scholars and commentators concerning investor-state disputes. In particular, if <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly’s</b> claim succeeds, it will disrupt internationally accepted norms that permit countries to have different standards of protection. This Article provides a detailed analysis of <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly’s</b> case of first impression. In so doing, the Article both explains why an arbitration tribunal should reject <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly’s</b> claims, and predicts the likely impending threats to domestic regulation of public health that intersect with the interests of pharmaceutical companies. This Article ultimately proposes specific language to incorporate in pending agreements to forestall such predicted harms...|$|R

5|$|As sales {{expanded}} rapidly {{he began}} to acquire customers outside of Indiana. Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878. James, and the subsequent sales team that developed, marketed the company's drugs nationally. Other family members were also employed by the growing company; Lilly's cousin Evan Lilly {{was hired as a}} bookkeeper and his grandsons, Eli and Josiah (Joe), were hired to run errands and perform other odd jobs. In 1881 Lilly formally incorporated the firm as <b>Eli</b> <b>Lilly</b> and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates. By the late 1880s Colonel Lilly had become one of the Indianapolis area's leading businessmen, with a company of more than one hundred employees and $200,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.|$|E
