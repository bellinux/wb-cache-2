5|$|Napoleon, {{with the}} reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the {{position}} empty.

5|$|On 6 April 1941, Adolf Hitler {{resolved}} {{to end the}} conflict in the Balkans and subjugate Allied-sympathetic states. The Invasion of Yugoslavia began in the morning.

5|$|The Third Amendment (Amendment III) to the United States Constitution places {{restrictions}} on the quartering of soldiers in private homes without the owner's consent, forbidding the practice in peacetime.

5|$|They {{followed}} Conrad's route fairly peacefully, although Louis {{came into}} conflict with king Geza of Hungary when Geza discovered Louis <b>had</b> <b>allowed</b> an attempted Hungarian usurper to join his army.

5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver <b>had</b> <b>allowed</b> to occur. As soon as {{the news of the}} attack reached Istanbul, the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet forced Enver to wire a ceasefire order to Souchon. Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey. Though many in the government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted. On 31 October Enver informed the Germans of the planned apology and said {{there was nothing he could}} do.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a report}} by the Diário de Notícias, Portugal <b>had</b> <b>allowed</b> {{considerable}} slippage in state-managed public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades. When the global crisis disrupted the markets and the world economy, together with the US subprime mortgage crisis and the eurozone crisis, Portugal {{was one of the first}} economies to succumb, and was affected very deeply.|$|E
5|$|Although as a British subject Singh's primary {{interest}} was women's rights in England, {{she and her}} fellow suffragettes also promoted similar activities in the colonies. She valued her Indian heritage, but was not bound by allegiance to a single nation and supported the women's cause {{in a number of}} countries. Her title, Princess, was useful. Singh sold a suffragette newspaper outside Hampton Court Palace, where Queen Victoria <b>had</b> <b>allowed</b> her family to live. According to a letter from Lord Crewe, King George V was within his rights to have her evicted.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had never}} before served in the Far East, as CEFEO commander, Leclerc was charged with {{recovering}} French Indochina. This territory, comprising the present day states of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, had been conquered by the French during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Vichy regime <b>had</b> <b>allowed</b> the Japanese to use Indochina as a base from which to attack the Allies in Malaya, Burma and China. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese had deposed the French colonial government, taken direct control of Indochina, defeated the French army in several engagements, and imprisoned surviving French soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Although pranks that {{involved}} public locations, figures, and organisations {{were always a}} feature of the series, the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity, both positive and negative. Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police <b>had</b> <b>allowed</b> their entry into the restricted zone. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.|$|E

Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson. Drummer Daniel Woodgate (Woody) and bass player Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, replacing Garry Dovey and Rodgers, respectively. After briefly changing their name to Morris and the Minors, the band renamed itself as Madness in 1979, paying homage {{to one of their}} favourite songs by ska/reggae artist Prince Buster. The band remained a sextet until late 1979, when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a backing vocalist and dancer.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's {{two films}} of 1938, Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces, both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former had Cagney {{in a comedy}} role, and {{received}} mixed reviews.

Ironically, the script for Angels was one that Cagney had hoped to do while with Grand National, but the studio had been unable to secure funding.|$|E

5|$|During the Seven Years' War (in America, {{known as}} the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone {{population}} remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the {{rate of natural increase}} was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain <b>had</b> <b>allowed</b> the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.|$|E

Maryland's rushing defense (83.9yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1points allowed per game) ranked first in the nation. Maryland had outscored its opponents 298–31. No ACC team scored more total points until 1967. Maryland's star quarterback, Bernie Faloney, had been injured midseason and saw limited game action {{for the remainder of the}} year.
