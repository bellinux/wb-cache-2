5|$|The next day, however, loyal {{crew members}} regained {{control of the}} ship and they ran her aground and {{surrendered}} to the authorities. In August 1905, 75 mutineers were tried. Koshuba and two others were executed and 19 sailors got 185 years of <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|E
5|$|I'm {{playing a}} heinous criminal. In fact, {{there are about}} 12 or 15 of us, the last {{remaining}} prisoners on a prison asteroid, which is hurtling through space.

5|$|In April 1857, 85 {{men of the}} {{regiment}} refused to accept cartridges for their carbines and were tried by court-martial, convicted, and sentenced to up to 10 years' <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b> After the men were imprisoned, {{the regiment}} freed their jailed comrades and headed to Delhi, where their arrival led to {{the outbreak of the}} Indian Mutiny. Following the events of the mutiny, all the Bengal Light Cavalry regiments were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|In July 1889, the Metropolitan Police {{uncovered}} a male brothel operated by Charles Hammond in London's Cleveland Street. Under police interrogation, the male prostitutes and pimps revealed {{the names of}} their clients, who included Lord Arthur Somerset, an Extra Equerry to the Prince of Wales. At the time, all homosexual acts between men were illegal, and the clients faced social ostracism, prosecution, and at worst, two years' imprisonment with <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on 20 February 1948, Prokofiev's {{estranged wife}} Lina {{was arrested for}} 'espionage', as {{she had tried to}} send money to her mother in Spain. After nine months of interrogation, she was sentenced by a three-member Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR to 20 years of <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b> She was {{eventually}} released after Stalin's death in 1953 and in 1974 left the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The French {{intended}} to deport Long to French Guiana, but {{the outbreak of}} World War I in 1914 interrupted their plans.

5|$|After David Duggan, {{leader of}} the Conservative Party {{and one of the}} men named, raised his concern over the {{pamphlet}} in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, police raided the Social Credit League's Edmonton headquarters. Social Credit whip Joe Unwin and Social Credit Board advisor George Frederick Powell were arrested and charged with criminal libel and counselling to murder. Both were convicted of the libel charge, and Justice William Carlos Ives sentenced them to <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{was based}} in Gloucestershire. One night, he {{threatened}} to punch his commanding officer, resulting in his being sentenced for insubordination to a three-week disciplinary course with <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b> In mid-November, he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle-upon-Tyne where he trained in the used of radar. During his stay there, Miller sustained a back injury during a wrestling match: the injury was to cause him recurring and enduring problems, particularly diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E

60|$|He {{ceased to}} struggle; she {{never let him}} go. Her hands had locked {{themselves}} with an inseparable twist of fingers on his robust back.

5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were {{at the mercy of the}} porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of <b>hard</b> <b>labour</b> if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|Garrow {{made much}} use of jury nullification {{to limit the}} {{punishment}} for his convicted clients, {{in a time when}} many crimes carried the death penalty (the so-called Bloody Code). In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, meaning a conviction would result in the death penalty; Garrow convinced the jury to convict the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|E
5|$|In November, Gambira {{was sentenced}} to 68 years in prison, at least 12 years {{of which would be}} <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b> In early 2009, five years were taken off his total sentence, {{reducing}} it to 63 years. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International protested his sentence, calling for his immediate release. Aung Ko Ko Lwin, Gambira's brother who had sheltered him from authorities, {{was sentenced to}} twenty years in prison, and Moe Htet Hlyan, Gambira's brother-in-law, was also imprisoned. Aung Ko Ko Lwin and Moe Htet Hlyan were sent to Arakan State and Mon State, respectively, to serve their sentences.|$|E
5000|$|Girerd {{was said}} to have worked at a foundry from morning to evening, while his mother also urged him to do the <b>hardest</b> <b>labour</b> on the farm. Due to being overworked he had been in a mental {{institution}} in Grenoble for a few months in 1959. In the months prior to the murders he showed signs of fatigue and uttered fears of a coming nuclear war, being especially worried about the fate of his children.|$|R

50|$|The Elmesthorpe Road was {{commenced}} {{during these}} dark days as Relief Work. Many {{of the workers}} received no more than bread and meat for their <b>hard</b> <b>labours.</b> At this time over 1,200 people were out of employment. The work {{was sponsored by the}} Right Hon. the Earl of Lovelace and his daughter, the Lady Anne Noel, and carried out in 1862-3. They also forwarded £800 to the unemployed cotton workers to work worsted instead of cotton.|$|R
5|$|The Jews of the {{occupied}} territories were subjected to forced labour by the Hungarian authorities, with about 4,000 Bačka and Baranja Jews being sent to <b>hard</b> <b>labour</b> camps within Hungary, 1,500 Bačka Jews being among the 10,000 Hungarian Jews sent to perform labour tasks for the Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front in September 1942, and about 600 Bačka Jews sent {{to work in the}} Bor copper mine in the German-occupied territory of Serbia in July 1943. Only 2 per cent of those sent to the Eastern Front survived the war.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{definitely}} {{prove to}} the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b> However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months, and in 1896 they were released at {{the order of the}} High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch. The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive. The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{returned}} to Beijing {{after three years}} of <b>hard</b> <b>labour,</b> but six years later, China fell into the even greater turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. Xin Fengxia and Wu Zuguang were both denounced {{at the beginning of the}} period. She became disabled below her left knee after a severe beating. Their friend Lao She drowned himself after being similarly tortured. During the tumultuous decade Wu and Xin both served years of forced labour. In December 1975, she became paralyzed after suffering a stroke, and Wu took care of her for the rest of her life.|$|E

5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on road or other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking <b>hard</b> <b>labour,</b> typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the coming four years, the Pickingill family moved to Canewdon, where another son, George, was born in 1876. The couple and their four {{children}} were then recorded in the 1871 census, where Pickingill was again listed as working as an agricultural labourer. In the 1881 census, the couple were recorded as living with two of their children, Mary Ann and George, and Pickingill was again identifying as a labourer. On 17 August 1887, a homeless man named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and brought to trial in Rochford on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to those of the other items. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment with <b>hard</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was pulled over by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for not wearing his uniform cap. An altercation resulted, and Miller posed {{as though he were}} about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary course with <b>hard</b> <b>labour,</b> from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained in the use of radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his stay there, Miller was thrown on his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E
