5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} Fasciculus Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication was The Way to Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and <b>enough</b> <b>sleep.</b> His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E

25|$|During this camp, {{soldiers}} follow special commando combat training, {{in addition}} to survival training, where soldiers are left alone is a deserted area without food, water, or any mean to aid them. Soldiers {{have to cope with}} nature, sustain themselves in face of harsh conditions, and perform the requested mission. Soldiers at this stage are also deprived from having <b>enough</b> <b>sleep,</b> as they are only allowed to sleep for two to three hours a day.|$|E
50|$|The infamous Minggu Suai Kenal (Orientation Week) of ILPKL is done twice a year. It is a {{tradition}} where the freshmen will be ragged with military style physical training for a week to see which students are really determined to study and to develop discipline and cooperation. They {{will be forced to}} strive in the forest, endure physical exercises without getting <b>enough</b> <b>sleeps</b> and abused with unkind words by the facilitators. The results are the disciplined and hardworking students.|$|R

25|$|The {{treatment}} of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting <b>enough</b> <b>sleep,</b> exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy {{may also be}} helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|Astronauts {{must remain}} alert and {{vigilant}} while operating complicated equipment. Therefore, getting <b>enough</b> <b>sleep</b> {{is a crucial}} factor of mission success. Weightlessness, a confined and isolated environment, and busy schedules coupled with {{the absence of a}} regular 24-hour day make sleep difficult in space. Astronauts typically average only about six hours of sleep each night. Cumulative sleep loss and sleep disruption could lead to performance errors and accidents that pose significant risk to mission success. Sleep and circadian cycles also temporally modulate a broad range of physiological, hormonal, behavioral, and cognitive functions.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} {{narcolepsy}} is unknown with potentially several causes. In up to 10% of cases {{there is a}} family history of the disorder. Often those affected have low levels of the neuropeptide orexin which may be due to an autoimmune disorder. Trauma, infections, toxins, or psychological stress may also play a role. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and sleep studies, after ruling out other potential causes. Excessive daytime sleepiness can also be caused by other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, major depressive disorder, anemia, heart failure, drinking alcohol, and not getting <b>enough</b> <b>sleep.</b> Cataplexy may be mistaken for seizures.|$|E

2500|$|The ideal goal {{of anger}} {{management}} is {{to control and}} regulate anger {{so that it does}} not result in problems. [...] Anger is an active emotion that calls the person feeling it to respond. People get into anger issues because both the instigator and instigated lack interpersonal and social skills to maintain self-control. They can train to respond to their anger as unwanted and unpleasant rather than react to its need. Turning a blind eye or forgiveness is a tool to turn anger off. Getting <b>enough</b> <b>sleep,</b> exercise and good diet are tools which can assist in preventing anger. Professionals who deal with those who have trouble managing anger include occupational therapists, mental health counselors, drug and alcohol counselors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists.|$|E

I don't begin to feel half awake till we have gone some miles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{took the}} {{sleeping}} draught which you had so kindly given me, {{but for a}} long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind. All of them connected with death, and vampires, with blood, and pain, and trouble." [...] Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly, [...] "Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep. Sure <b>enough</b> <b>sleep</b> must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this. You will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me. Beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist, or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared, stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others. The waxen face, the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line, the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between, and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralyzed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan.|$|E

50|$|The average {{sleep time}} has {{significantly}} decreased {{over the last}} two decades. Teens typically need to receive nine hours of sleep a night. But, statistics reveal that less than twenty percent actually do receive <b>enough</b> <b>sleep</b> each night. People who do not get <b>enough</b> <b>sleep</b> each night, tend to eat more because a hormone stimulates their appetite, exercise less, and become more depressed. Looking at a screen before bed increases your alertness and may prevent you from falling asleep right away. A study has discovered teenagers are more likely to exhibit behavior problems and have trouble paying attention during the day if they spend time on blue light devices at night.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first century}} Greek writer Strabo called both Megasthenes and his {{succeeding}} ambassador Deimachus liars, {{and stated that}} [...] "no faith whatever" [...] could be placed in their writings. The Indika itself contained numerous fantastical stories of people with backwards feet, ears large <b>enough</b> to <b>sleep</b> in, no mouths, or other strange features. Strabo directly contradicted these descriptions, assuring his readers that Megasthenes' stories, along with his recounting of India’s founding by Hercules and Dionysus, were mythical with little to no basis in reality.|$|R
