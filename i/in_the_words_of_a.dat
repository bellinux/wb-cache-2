5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's {{frequent use of}} religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or {{might have been a}} device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E
5|$|Through his freemason {{contacts}} with Pierre Maurice Glayre, Piattoli won {{the confidence of}} Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski, becoming his agent in Paris and, {{by the end of}} 1789, his private secretary and librarian, although without any official title. Acting as a sort of cultural aide, Piattoli, who had strong ties to the reformist and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers—Ignacy Potocki in particular—and the king. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was “like a tireless spring”, constantly mediating between the two factions.|$|E

It can be claim that Sheikh Shabestari made the best and finest Gnostic and theological implications into poetic form. He was impressed by three philosophical-theological schools including the philosophy of Ibn Arabi, the theological school of Ash'ari and the romance of Sanaee. The {{first part of the}} study focuses on the Gnostic concepts and terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Shabestari. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following sections, we discuss the Gnostic concepts and the theory <b>of</b> pantheism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh. Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari, {{is one of the most}} important issues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of Gnostic mainstreaming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speech of philosophers and famous mystics of Islam. To understand Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari, it is necessary to philosophically investigate and analyze schools and Gnostic and philosophical movements before him which have influenced him. Therefore, in this study we have tried to talk about schools influencing him in addition to describing Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari. Apart from this, we investigate how the Gnosticism of Sheikh Shabestari revolves around a main idea that is pantheism...|$|R

500|$|Many historians regard Offa as {{the most}} {{powerful}} Anglo-Saxon king before Alfred the Great. His dominance never extended to Northumbria, though he gave his daughter Ælfflæd in marriage to the Northumbrian king Æthelred I in 792. Historians once saw his reign as part of a process leading to a unified England, but this is no longer the majority view. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recent historian: [...] "Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy."

The claim that Momchil was born in that region may be reinforced by 15th-century Ottoman registers, according to which his name was the most popular male name in that area. There exist at least a few legends which tie his birth to a particular place, for example the village of Fakia in Strandzha, though evidence is nonexistent. [...] In any case, Momchil was born of humble origin. This was a main factor in his decision to join a band of brigands (hajduks) which was active in the scarcely governed border areas between Bulgaria, Byzantium and Serbia.|$|E

500|$|Geoffrey {{was born}} in Greece, {{possibly}} in Karytaina, soon after his father's arrival there (about 1222/3). Hugh of Briel died in early 1238, not yet forty years old, and was succeeded by the young Geoffrey. The main source on Geoffrey's life are the various versions of the Chronicle of the Morea, which, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> Bon, [...] "narrates with so much detail and indulgence" [...] the [...] "many and colourful adventures" [...] of [...] "a peculiar and charming figure, very representative of the generation of Frankish seigneurs born in Greece". The Chronicle credits Geoffrey {{with the construction of}} the castle of Karytaina, the [...] "Greek Toledo" [...] as William Miller calls it. Geoffrey enjoyed a high reputation as a warrior, and was deemed to be the [...] "best knight in the Morea". According to the Aragonese version of the Chronicle he maintained a school of chivalry at the castle Karytaina, where the sons of the Greek nobles were trained as knights in the Western manner.|$|E
500|$|Maintaining {{the bright}} and danceable feel from Com Truise's 2011 debut studio album Galactic Melt and garnering {{more of a}} melodic {{approach}} than previous releases of the project, Wave 1 {{is a combination of}} synth soul, drum and bass, synth funk, electro, and, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Pitchfork Media reviewer, [...] "fussy 80s computer-pop".

[...] Because this was also meant to be a part of the story where the music starts changing, he had taken inspiration from several acts including New Order and Prince to have a much broader range of tempos and styles in each track.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1976 Miller {{was invited}} to {{substitute}} for the regular pianist in the Duke Ellington Orchestra (led by the late bandleader's son, Mercer Ellington). Miller had performed the same role for one weekend around a year earlier, and the new work was to be for only three weeks, but he ultimately toured with the orchestra for almost three years. His membership of the orchestra helped him, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> piano magazine, to get [...] "respect as a powerful, two-fisted pianist adept at delivering entrancingly lyrical and gracefully introspective runs as well as dazzling and buoyant passages." [...] He left in January 1980, after being recruited by vocalist Betty Carter, with whom he toured for eight months that year. He was then part of Shaw's band from 1981 to 1983, thereby, in Miller's view, fulfilling his destiny from their earlier meetings. In 1981 he made his studio recording debut, on Shaw's United. During the early 1980s he also accompanied vocalist Carmen Lundy, and played and recorded with saxophonist Johnny Griffin.|$|E
