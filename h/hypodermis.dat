5|$|Salkin {{had noted}} that its {{tropical}} position might mean that B.dentata {{was a key}} species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the <b>hypodermis,</b> contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} stages of its development, the wing-bud is not {{provided}} with special organs of respiration such as tracheation, as it resembles {{in this respect}} the other portions of the <b>hypodermis</b> {{of which it is}} still a part. It should be noted, however, that the histoblast is developed near a large trachea, a cross-section of which is shown in, which represents sections of these parts of the first, second, third and fourth instars respectively. At the same time the tracheoles uncoil, and extend in bundles in the forming vein-cavities of the wing-bud. At the molt that marks the beginning of the pupal stadium stage, they become functional. At the same time, the larval tracheoles degenerate; their function having been replaced by the wing tracheae.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the wing buds is of a thickening of the <b>hypodermis,</b> which {{can be observed in}} insect species as early the embryo, and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in the embryo, or embryogenesis, a cluster of cells grow underneath the ectoderm which later in development, after the lateral ectoderm has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, can be seen in those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second instar the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last instar, or fifth, the wing is pushed out of the wing-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after eclosion, the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E
25|$|Skin is {{composed}} of three primary layers: the epidermis, the dermis and the <b>hypodermis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The skin envelope. The breast skin is {{in three}} (3) layers: (i) the {{epidermis}}, (ii) the dermis, and (iii) the <b>hypodermis.</b> The epidermis is 50–100µm thick, and {{is composed of}} a stratum corneum of flat keratin cells, that is 10–20µm thick; it protects the underlying viable epidermis, which is composed of keratinizing epithelial cells. The dermis is mostly collagen and elastin ﬁbers embedded to a viscous water and glycoprotein medium. The fibers of the upper dermis (“papillary dermis”) are thinner than the fibers of the deep dermis, thus the skin envelope is 1–3mm thick. The thickness of the <b>hypodermis</b> (adipocyte cells) varies from woman to woman, and body part.|$|E

The skin of the nipple and areola is further composed of a modified and specialized myoepthelium {{that is responsible for}} contraction in response to stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Dicot stems {{with primary}} growth have pith in the center, with {{vascular}} bundles forming a distinct ring visible when the stem is viewed in cross section. The {{outside of the}} stem is covered with an epidermis, which is covered by a waterproof cuticle. The epidermis also may contain stomata for gas exchange and multicellular stem hairs called trichomes. A cortex consisting of <b>hypodermis</b> (collenchyma cells) and endodermis (starch containing cells) is present above the pericycle and vascular bundles.|$|E
25|$|The {{subcutaneous}} tissue (also <b>hypodermis</b> and subcutis) {{is not part}} of the skin, and lies below the dermis of the cutis. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue, adipose tissue and elastin. The main cell types are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes ({{subcutaneous tissue}} contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{remaining}} nonvisceral fat is found just below the skin in a region called the <b>hypodermis.</b> This subcutaneous fat {{is not related to}} many of the classic obesity-related pathologies, such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke, and some evidence even suggests it might be protective. The typically female (or gynecoid) pattern of body fat distribution around the hips, thighs, and buttocks is subcutaneous fat, and therefore poses less of a health risk compared to visceral fat.|$|E
25|$|The Przewalski horse's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vegetation. There are many plant species {{in a typical}} Przewalski horse environment including: Elymus repens, Carex spp., Fabaceae, and Asteraceae. While the horses eat {{a variety of different}} plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, the Przewalski horses have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, Przewalski horses favor Elymus repens, Corynephorus canescens, Festuca valesiaca, and Chenopodium album. In early summer they favor Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium and in late summer, they gravitate towards Elymus repens and Vicia cracca. In winter, for example, the horses eat Salix spp., Pyrus communis, Malus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Rosa spp., and Alnus spp. Additionally, Przewalski horses may dig for Festuca spp., Bromus inermis and Elymus repens that grow beneath the ice and snow. The Przewalski horse’s winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses. Studies have suggested that in the wintertime, Przewalski horses experience <b>hypodermis.</b> <b>Hypodermis</b> is a condition in which one’s metabolic rate slows down. This means that in the winter time, Przewalski horse’s process their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, Przewalski horses most often eat Elymus repens, Trifolium pratense, Vicia cracca, Poa trivialis, Dactylis glomerata and Bromus inermis.|$|E
25|$|Philodendrons {{have both}} aerial and {{subterranean}} roots. The aerial roots occur in many {{shapes and sizes}} and originate {{from most of the}} plant's nodes or occasionally from an internode. The size and number of aerial roots per node depends on the presence of a suitable substrate for the roots to attach themselves. Aerial roots serve two primary purposes. They allow the philodendron to attach itself to a tree or other plant, and they allow it to collect water and nutrients. As such, the roots are divided morphologically into these two categories. Aerial roots used for attaching to trees tend to be shorter, more numerous, and sometimes have a layer of root hairs attached; those used for collecting water and nutrients tend to be thicker and longer. These feeder roots tend to attach flush with the substrate to which the philodendron is attached, and make their way directly downwards in search of soil. In general, feeder roots tend to show both positive hydrotropic and negative heliotropic behaviors. Characteristic of roots in philodendrons is the presence of a sclerotic <b>hypodermis,</b> which are cylindrical tubes inside the epidermis that can be one to five cells long. The cells that line the sclerotic <b>hypodermis</b> are elongated and tend to be hardened. Underneath the epidermis is a unique layer of cells in a pattern of long cells followed by short cells.|$|E
25|$|Ectodermal {{dysplasia}} {{is characterized}} by absent sweat glands resulting in dry (hypohydrotic), often scale-like skin, sparse and usually coarse scalp hair that is often blonde, sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, and small brittle nails. In addition, abnormalities of ectodermal derivatives, neuroectodermal derivatives, and mesectodermal derivatives are often found. The ectodermal derivative abnormalities can affect the epidermis including mammary, pituitary and sweat glands, as well as hairs, dental enamel, nails, lens, and the internal ear. Neuroectodermal derivatives that can be affected include sensory placodes, cutaneous pigmental cells, and hair buds. Mesectodermal derivatives affected can include the dermis, <b>hypodermis,</b> dentin, head muscles and conjunctival cells, cervicofacial vascular endothelial cells, {{and part of the}} maxillofacial skeleton.|$|E
500|$|Like other mammals, {{the skin}} of baleen whales has an epidermis, a dermis, a <b>hypodermis,</b> and {{connective}} tissue.

50|$|Skin {{comprises}} three layers: epidermis, dermis, and <b>hypodermis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>hypodermis</b> acts as {{an energy}} reserve.

5000|$|The {{human skin}} (integument) is {{composed}} of {{a minimum of two}} major layers of tissue: the epidermis and dermis. (The <b>hypodermis</b> or subcutaneous layer {{is not part of the}} skin.) The epidermis forms the outermost layer, providing the initial barrier to the external environment. Beneath this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue. [...] The deepest layer, the <b>hypodermis,</b> is primarily made up of adipose tissue. Substantial collagen bundles anchor the dermis to the <b>hypodermis</b> in a way that permits most areas of the skin to move freely over the deeper tissue layers.|$|E
