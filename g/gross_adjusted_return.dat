40|$|ABSTRACT. Approaches to {{reducing}} irrigation inputs to crops {{have been studied}} for the past 50 to 60 years in research settings. Fewer efforts {{have been made to}} document limited irrigation responses over a number of seasons on commercial fields. This study compared farm−based irrigation management (FARM) with best management practices (BMP), late initiation of irrigation (LATE), and a restricted allocation (ALLOC). These irrigation management strategies each occupied 1 / 8 of a center pivot system in southwest Nebraska in continuous corn production, on four cooperating farms, which were replicated at the same sites for 3 to 6 years. Irrigation variables were achieved by irrigating or not irrigating, or by speeding up or slowing down the center pivot. When the grain yields and irrigation amounts were normalized each year using the FARM treatment as the basis, on average for three of four locations, the BMP treatment yielded equal to the FARM treatment, the LATE treatment yielded 93 % of the FARM treatment and the ALLOC yielded 84 % of the FARM treatment. At the same time, it took 76 % and 57 % of the water for the LATE and ALLOC treatments, respectively, to achieve these yields. The <b>adjusted</b> <b>gross</b> <b>returns</b> (yield price – irrigation treatment costs) of the irrigation treatments were analyzed for each location. When the gross returns were normalized using the FARM treatment as the basis, FARM and BMP returns were equal across combinations of high and low input commodity prices and pumping costs. The LATE treatment gross return was 95 % of FARM return. The gross return for the ALLOC treatment was 85 % to 91 % of the FARM treatment. The higher the water costs, the lower the difference between the highest and lowest returning water treatments. Relationships between evapotranspiratio...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore the}} {{performance}} of risk arbitrage over 1990 to 1999 for three types of mergers: stock swap, cash tender and collar mergers. Furthermore, I construct passive/naïve indices for risk arbitrage strategies and test the indices. ^ In the performance analysis, I found: (i) Risk arbitrage generates lower returns and losses than an unhegded strategy for target stocks but higher returns and losses than the unhedged strategy for acquirer stocks. (ii) Changing exchange ratios may not always negatively affect the returns. (iii) Overall, successful mergers generate superior returns, compared with unsuccessful mergers. (iv) The inclusion of dividend and income on cash balances (derived from the short sales of the acquirer 2 ̆ 7 s shares) added moderately to the computed returns. (v) Time weighted annualized returns are different from equal weighted annualized returns. ^ In the passive/naïve indices analyses, I found: (i) Risk arbitrage produces higher risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>returns</b> than unhedged strategies. (ii) In risk arbitrage, the stock swap index shows the highest risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>returns.</b> The highest volatility in cash tender offer positions causes a risk arbitrage strategy to produce the lowest risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>returns.</b> (iii) On average, active indices generate the best risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>returns</b> among indices. (iv) Passive/naive risk arbitrage indices have low and negative betas. These negative systematic risk levels are due {{to the presence of}} higher systematic risks for acquirer indices compared with those of target indices. (v) Active indices have low and positive systematic risks. And they have a positive relationship with unhegded strategies. These results imply that the active indices tend to be partially hedged. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} an {{on-going}} investment trend in mutual funds in Sweden. As of 2010, 82 % of the Swedish population between the age of 18 and 74 own at least one mutual fund and if one should include the pension fund, the ratio would rise to an impressive 99 %. About one quarter of this capital is put into Swedish mutual equity funds, which means that these mutual funds have a huge impact on ordinary investors. After reviewing literature on this subject, the authors found that for an ordinary investor, investment decisions often relay on vague arguments or an intuitive feeling on how the market will evolve. So the purpose with this study is to see whether any of the available and easy accessible information of Swedish mutual funds should be used as a purchasing decision for an ordinary investor. Can an ordinary investor yield a better than average risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>return</b> using Morningstar Rating, Morningstar Style box, a fund’s size, a fund’s management fee or a fund’s historical performance when purchasing Swedish mutual equity funds? The paper had two major findings. Firstly, both Morningstar Rating and past performance could, even though the relation was weak, be used as an investment tool when screening the market for Swedish mutual equity funds that have better than average risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>return.</b> The authors found statistical evidence that higher star ranked mutual funds have better than average risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>return</b> than lower star ranked mutual funds, and that mutual funds with higher past performance have better than average risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>return</b> than mutual funds with lower past performance. However, the authors would not recommend ordinary investor to focus too much on these findings since the relation was weak. Secondly, no evidence could be found concerning a fund’s size and a fund’s management fee in respect of finding Swedish mutual equity funds that have better than average risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>return.</b> Also, some minor conclusions could be drawn regarding Morningstar Style Box, such as that high risk categorized mutual funds performed better than their low risk counterpart and that mutual funds that invested mostly in large companies underperform the mid and small size companies-investing funds. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to explain the performance of equity funds by using three methods, which are risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>return</b> (RAR), risk ratio (RR), and snail trail method. The second objective is to compare equity funds performance towards market performance. The samples of this research are equity funds actively listed in BAPEPAM for period January 2008 until December 2012. The data is taken from each company’s monthly net assets value (NAV) for period January 2008 until December 2012. Mutual fund with zero NAV in the end of calculation and with foreign currency of NAV is not used as sample. The performance analysis of equity funds is calculated by using Risk <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Return</b> with Sharpe Ratio method, Risk Ratio, and Snail Trail. The benchmark is JCI or Jakarta Composite Index for period January 2008 – December 2012. From the three methods used, most of the equity funds are adjusted well and ready to face the risk. In fact, there are still some equity funds with underperform performance compare to the benchmark in both risk and return.

40|$|Observed {{high-frequency}} {{prices are}} contaminated with liquidity costs or market microstructure noise. Using such data, we derive a new asset return variance estimator {{inspired by the}} market microstructure literature to explicitly model the noise and remove it from observed returns before estimating their variance. The <b>returns</b> <b>adjusted</b> for the estimated liquidity costs are either totally or partially free from noise. If the liquidity costs are fully removed, the sum of squared high-frequency returns - which would be inconsistent for return variance when based on observed returns - becomes a consistent variance estimator when based on <b>adjusted</b> <b>returns.</b> This novel estimator achieves the maximum possible rate of convergence. However, if the liquidity costs are only partially removed, the residual noise is smaller and closer to an exogenous white noise than the original noise. Therefore, any volatility estimator that is robust to noise relies on weaker noise assumptions if {{it is based on}} <b>adjusted</b> <b>returns</b> than if it is based on observed returns...|$|R

We use fund characteristics including size, age, and expense ratio and managerial attributes including manager structure and management education to explain fund performance.
