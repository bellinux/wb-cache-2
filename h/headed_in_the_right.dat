500|$|Cleveland fans' {{hopes were}} high upon {{the arrival of}} the new team. However, as an {{expansion}} team the Browns were forced to build a new roster from scratch using rookies, free agents, and the players other teams chose not to protect in the expansion draft. [...] With a new team composed of a mix of fresh faces and castoffs, the Browns floundered. The Steelers shut out the Browns 43–0 in the season opener at Cleveland Browns Stadium on September 12, 1999, the first of seven straight losses. A 2–14 season in 1999 was followed by a 3–13 record in 2000 after Couch suffered a season-ending thumb injury. Early in 2001, Policy and Lerner fired Palmer. The coach and the team, Policy said, were not <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction.|$|E
500|$|... "Moments" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{many of whom}} praised its musical arrangement and memorability. Alex Hughes from The Huffington Post characterised the song as [...] "heartbreaking". Hollywood Life and AllMusic both rated [...] "Moments" [...] {{as one of the}} best songs on Up All Night. Herald Sun writer Cameron Adams referred to the track as a [...] "classic boy band ballad". Entertainment Weeklys Adam Markovitz cited the lyrics [...] "be your life, your voice, your reason to be", writing that [...] "Lyrics like that won't help the group earn much respect in music circles. But if a tween-pop empire is what these boys are after, they're definitely <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction". Erica Futterman for Rolling Stone opined that the track's lyricism is [...] "quintessentially swoonworthy" [...] toward an audience aged approximately 8 to 12 and female.|$|E
500|$|Beshear {{clashed with}} the state Council on Postsecondary Education over its hiring of Brad Cowgill as its president. Beshear said state law {{required}} that the Council conduct a national search for its president and that they hire someone with experience and an established reputation in higher education; he claimed that Cowgill, a Lexington lawyer and state budget director for former Governor Fletcher, was not qualified for the position and that the council hired him without a national search. Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway issued a non-binding opinion that the hiring was illegal under state law, and Cowgill resigned rather than wage a legal battle with Beshear. Beshear, who had considered asking all of the council members to resign or abolishing the council altogether {{in favor of a}} new one, praised Cowgill's decision. Democratic House Budget Committee Chairman Harry Moberly said Cowgill [...] "had the council <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction" [...] and added [...] "I would have been satisfied if Brad had the permanent position, but I do not criticize the governor for the role he had played [...]" [...] Senate President David Williams called Beshear's interference in the matter [...] "unfortunate".|$|E

500|$|Up All Night {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, which indicates [...] "generally favourable reviews". AllMusic's Matthew Chisling commended the album for its {{appeal to the}} teenage audience, [...] "limitless potential for the time being, this is a perfectly sized, and targeted, collection." [...] PopMatters Zachary Houle called the album a [...] "laudable addition to the boy band pantheon" [...] and a [...] "well-crafted slice of pop you can pop bubbles to". Digital Spy's Robert Copsey commended the album for [...] "a collection of pg pop rock with killer choruses" [...] and summarised it as [...] "an adorable as expected debut with a surprising amount of bite". Cosmopolitans Sophie Goddard lauded the album for a collection of [...] "toe-tappers that are just impossible to dislike". The Independent editor Simon Price gave the album two out of five stars, and in an assessment wrote: [...] "the album consists of fifteen instalments of inoffensive daytime radio pop, of which half the songs sound like [...] "I Want It That Way" [...] by the Backstreet Boys, the other half like [...] "Free Fallin'" [...] by Tom Petty, it will sell by the zillion." [...] Daily Stars John Earls complimented the group for creating an album [...] "that doesn't take the easy route", quipping that the album has [...] "big personalities" [...] and [...] "belting fun pop anthems", whilst Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone criticised the album for lacking personality. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly perceived that the album [...] "won't help the group earn much respect in music circles. But if a tween-pop empire is what these boys are after, they're definitely <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction".|$|E
500|$|... 343 {{started with}} a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through {{development}}. Halo 4s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told {{they were going to be}} working on Halo 4. [...] "We had people who we hired who hated Halo because of 'X,'" [...] said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. [...] "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." [...] This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, Halo 4 executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make [...] "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. [...] With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an [...] "epiphany moment" [...] that proved the team was <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was [...] "very traditional [...] ". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.|$|E
