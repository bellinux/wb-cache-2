2500|$|Another Jewish {{tradition}} tells {{that when}} Jacob {{was brought to}} be buried in the cave, Esau prevented the burial claiming he had the right {{to be buried in}} the cave; after some negotiation Naphtali was sent to Egypt to retrieve the document stating Esau sold his part in the cave to Jacob. As this was going on Hushim, the son of Dan who was hard of hearing, did not understand what was going on, and why his grandfather was not being buried, so he asked for an explanation; after being given one he became angry and said: [...] "Is my grandfather to lie there in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt?" [...] He then took a club and killed Esau, and Esau's head rolled into the cave. This means that the head of Esau is also buried in the cave. Some Jewish sources record the selling of Esau's right to be buried in the cave – according to a commentary on the [...] "Book of Exodus", Jacob gave all his possessions to acquire a tomb in the Cave of the Patriarchs. He put a large pile of gold and silver before Esau and asked, “My brother, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> your portion of this cave, or all this gold and silver?” Esau's selling to Jacob his right to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs is also recorded in Sefer HaYashar.|$|E

6000|$|But the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all {{the other}} seals laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered, and a young seal about his own age said, [...] "This is all very well, Kotick, but you can't come from no one knows where and order us off like this.

6000|$|Half {{the controversies}} about {{the freedom of}} the will would have had no existence, if this pithy {{paragraph}} had been well pondered by those who oppose the doctrine of necessity. For they rest upon the absurd presumption that the proposition, [...] "I can do as I like," [...] is contradictory to the doctrine of necessity. The answer is; nobody doubts that, at any rate within certain limits, <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> as <b>you</b> like. But what determines your likings and dislikings? Did you make your own constitution? Is it your contrivance that one thing is pleasant and another is painful? And even if it were, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> to make it after the one fashion rather than the other? The passionate assertion of the consciousness of their freedom, which is the favourite refuge of the opponents of the doctrine of necessity, is mere futility, for nobody denies it. What they really have to do, if they would upset the necessarian argument, is to prove that they are free to associate any emotion whatever with any idea whatever; to like pain as much as pleasure; vice as much as virtue; in short, to prove, that, whatever may be the fixity of order of the universe of things, that of thought is given over to chance.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> Switzerland to all {{the other}} {{countries}} of your acquaintance?" [...] asked Mr. Sharp: [...] "England I leave out of the question, for, though we, who belong to the island, see so many charms in it, it must be conceded that strangers seldom join us very heartily in its praises. I think most travellers would give the palm to Italy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{that you look}} upon it in that light," [...] he remarked, still without the least sign of discomposure. [...] "We will, {{if you do not}} mind, waive the {{discussion}} for the moment. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> a small restaurant or a corner in a big one?

60|$|I cannot {{say that}} we shall not be glad to see you, but the weather is dreary and the {{distance}} long: {{and if you were}} to come, we {{might not be able to}} meet you and to speak to you with calmness.

60|$|Let us drop {{this school}} metaphor, this birch and all {{pertaining}} thereto. Our subject, I beg leave {{to remind the}} reader's humble servant, is novel heroes and heroines.

40|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{know your}} <b>preferred</b> {{employment}} outcome? Many of you reading this editorial {{may not have}} a disability, but if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> and <b>you</b> qualify to receive employment services, your options are being limited as you read this because of a policy known as Employment First. This approach sets “community-based, integrated employment – which pays at least the minimum wage – [as] the first option for employment services for youth and adults with significant disabilities” (Scaglione, 2015). Employment First is a federal policy that has been adopted in many states, and is currently being set in New York State after Governor Cuomo issued an Executive Order establishing an Employment First policy commission in September 2014 (Executive Order No. 136, 2014). To understand how this policy has come about, it is crucial that we understand its origins in the evolving definition of inclusion...|$|R
5000|$|Dear Peter, we {{know that}} you are worried about the things that happen to the {{families}} of your friends, and that you are afraid that something similar could happen to you and your father. We do not eat children raw at breakfast. Considering the fear you all have, and that your dad is a high-level journalist, who is more useful to us alive than dead, we have decided to send you this little note as a warning. For this reason, and in consideration to the work your father does, we offer him (and all of you: Peter, Victoria, Robert, David and Ruth) the option to leave the country, where {{you run the risk of}} being assassinated. <b>Do</b> what <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> and tell “daddy” and “mummy” to sell the house and the cars, and to go work in Paris in another of the Herald's newspapers. You can also elect to stay here, working for human rights, but we do not think that is what your parents or your aunts and uncles expecting you in England for Christmas would like. A big revolutionary salute to your dad. Montoneros.|$|R
