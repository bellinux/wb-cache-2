50|$|In June 2016, Bose {{released}} their QuietComfort 35 headphones, adding bluetooth functionality to the QuietComfort line {{alongside the}} QuietComfort 25. They {{have a slightly}} refined version of {{the design of the}} QuietComfort 25 headphones; the color has been changed to a matte black with a silver option as well. Stainless Steel is used for the pivots of the ear cups, with <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> <b>nylon</b> for the headband and ear cups as opposed to plastic, to ensure durability while remaining particularly lightweight for bluetooth headphones.|$|E
50|$|These current {{production}} knives are branded {{with both}} KA-BAR and Ek logos and are generally recognizable as Ek style knives while sharing few design details with previous {{generations of the}} knives. Current production knives are constructed of 1095 steel, and feature black parkerized blades {{in a variety of}} styles including Model 4 spear point double edged knife and Model 5 Clip point Bowie. All models feature <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> <b>nylon</b> handles that mirror the shape of previous generations. Handles are attached with traditional x-head fasteners. A composite sheath is provided.|$|E

50|$|The RR1 uses a rear {{rotary valve}} intake {{rather than a}} reed valve {{in an attempt to}} achieve more power. The engine came after the Babe Bee and looks very similar with its anodized, {{machined}} extruded aluminum crank case and fuel tank. The power improvement was negligible so Cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build Babe Bee. The engine was made for quite a few years and sold for $6.95. A left and right hand rotary valve was made, as were left hand 6x2 <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> <b>nylon</b> props for the RR-1. Some versions have a blue tank, others have a clear anodized tank. There were two versions of the tank back as well, to fit the corresponding tank. It has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around $300 in 2008.|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Glass</b> <b>filled</b> <b>nylon</b> {{composites}} (GFN) and hybrid graphene oxide reinforced <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> <b>Nylon</b> nanocomposites (GO-GFN) {{are prepared}} by blending the required base materials in {{injection molding machine}} at processing temperature of 275 °C. The specimens prepared are subjected to various mechanical property tests to reveal their hardness, tensile strength and flexural strength. The wear discs of GFN and GO-GFN composites as per ASTM standard are injection molded to analyze the tribological properties using pin on disc tribometer. The pin used is EN 8 Tool steel. The Coefficient of friction for the GFN composites for the wear load of 10 N is 0. 28. Addition of 0. 003 wt % GO to the GFN system has decreased the coefficient of friction significantly {{to the value of}} 0. 12. The decrease in C. O. F was correlated with the adhesion film formation in the pin surface. This work confirms the improvement in wear resistance of GO-GFN system which is attributed by the presence of graphene oxide only...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Polymer & polymer {{composite}} gears find increasing application {{because of}} the low material manufacturing cost, light weight & quiet operation compared with metal gears. Generally thermoplastic polymers like acetal polymer & nylon polymer are used for gear applications. But acetal and nylon gears have low load carrying capacity. To improve the performance of gears, geometry modification had been done like tooth width modification & cooling holes on tooth surface. But, for high power applications, these materials show poor performance. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} select the polymer which has good mechanical properties & good thermal stability. Poly-ether-ether-Ketone (PEEK) has high strength & stiffness, low coefficient of thermal expansion which is required for gears. The comparative performance spur gears of 30 % <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> PA 66 and 30 % <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> PEEK was investigated in this study. The results shows that 30 % <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> PEEK gears have high wear resistance and high torque transmission capacity as compare with 30 % <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> PA 66 gears...|$|R

40|$|In mould {{manipulation}} of materials during injection moulding {{can be used}} to overcome aesthetic and mechanical weaknesses inherent in a standard injection moulding. This can include manipulating polymer orientation for morphology enhancement or improving bulk properties such as weld lines.

With talc filled material this technique improved weld line strength significantly providing pin rotation speed did not exceed 100 rpm, <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> material also improved but to a much lesser degree.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the performance of}} a single zone building integrated with PV Trombe wall(PV-TW) in term of potential cost savings, energy consumption and emission reduction by varying PV Glazing types (i. e. PV Single Glazing, PV Double glazing, PV Double glazing filled with gas (Argon)). TRNSYS software is used for simulation in which inputs like climatic conditions, building construction details, thermal properties of materials, detail of PV-TW and orientation of the building were inserted. By comparing the results of all three types of glazing The annual cost saving due to application of single glass PV- TW was RM 485. 35; Double glass PV-TW was RM 819. 15 while Double <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> with argon PV-TW was RM 1016. 24. While CO 2 emission reduction is maximum in double <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> with argon PV-TW 2588 kg/yr followed by double and single glass PV-TW as 1768 and 1277 kg/yr respectively. The analysis suggests that the application of double <b>glass</b> <b>filled</b> with argon PV-TW in Malaysia climatic condition would be economically viable {{from the point of view}} of saving in cooling energy cost and CO 2 Emission...|$|R
