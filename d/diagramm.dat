40|$|We {{develop an}} {{approach}} for calculating the inclusive multigluon production within the JIMWLK high energy evolution. We give a formal expression of multigluon cross section {{in terms of}} a generating functional for arbitrary number of gluons n. In the dipole limit the expression simplifies dramatically. We recover the previously known results for single and double gluon inclusive cross section and generalize those for arbitrary multigluon amplitude in terms of Feynman <b>diagramms</b> of Pomeron - like objects coupled to external rapidity dependent field s(η). We confirm the conclusion that the AGK cutting rules in general are violated in multigluon production. However we present an argument to the effect that for doubly inclusive cross section the AGK <b>diagramms</b> give the leading contribution at high energy, while genuine violation only occurs for triple and higher inclusive gluon production.

5000|$|The fully notated tonary {{which he}} wrote for St. Benignus (F-MOf H159), is {{following}} the order of other tonaries, which were created {{under the influence of}} the Cluniac Monastic Association. These tonaries usually had sections dedicated to the antiphonary and the gradual, within the gradual and the antiphonary there were subsections like the antiphons which were sung as refrains during psalm recitation (introits and communions), responsories (the introduction of epistle readings), but also other genres of the proper mass chant as alleluia verses (the introduction of gospels), and offertories (a soloistic processional antiphon for the procession of the gifts). Several Aquitanian troper-sequentiaries had a libellum structure which sorted the genres in separate books like alleluia verses (as the first part of sequentiaries and tractus collections), offertorials, and tropers. But William of Volpiano subdivided these books into eight parts according to the octoechos system like the tonary, or the troparia in the Byzantine book Octoechos, and within these sections the chant was ordered according to the cycle of the liturgical year starting with advent. He used the neumes of Cluny, the central French forms, without changing them, but he added an own system of alphabetic notation in a second row, which defined the pitches of the melody precisely according to the Boethian <b>diagramm.</b> Like any other chant manuscript around 1000, the book was not written for a use during a ceremony, it was a [...] "book of memory" [...] for cantors who alone had the competence of reading and writing neumes, and the responsibility to organize the chant sung during the liturgical year. During his reforms, several Abbeys followed his example and his system was used by the teachers of the local grammar schools which included the daily practice of singing the liturgy.|$|E

Abstract The article analyses from {{a visual}} studies and historical perspective the unpublished {{sketch of a}} mountain profile found among the handwritten papers of Alexander von Humboldt’s estate. The small sheet of sketches, with its pasted additions, {{was at the heart}} of climatic-geographic academic enquiry into the reasons for worldwide differences in the levels of mountain snow lines. The unfinished, sketchy nature of the diagramme raises questions about its research context, about the epistemic value of draughtsmanship practice and about the heuristic role of mountains and their characteristic profiles in Humboldt’s research.

40|$|From phase <b>diagramms</b> and {{solubility}} {{measurements for}} hydrogen interstitially dissolved in metals {{it can be}} concluded, that {{in the space of}} the metal matrix the phase transition from the gaseous state to the liquid occurs, in complete analogy to free hydrogen. The critical point of the miscibility gap is identified with the critical point for the phase transition gas to liquid. From solubility measurementsdiagramms for the equation of state of the latticegas can be derived. These show the characteristic features known for a real free gas including the critical point and the two phase region bound by the coexistence curve. Furthermore, the diffusion constant of dissolved hydrogen exceeds the common value for solid state systems at room temperatures by 10 orders of magnitude and therefore is comparable with that in free liquids. Thus as a first approximation hydrogen in metals can be considered to be an example for the theoretically well investigated latticegas with its phase transition to a liquid. It will be shown that the experimental possibilities for investigation of the properties of the latticegas - especially in connection with static and dynamic critical phenomena - are as manifold as for a free gas...|$|R

The thesis emphasizes on the main aspects of this antenna pattern modeling and improvements on the antenna model approach: First, calibration and corrections terms applied on the antenna model are introduced, demonstrating the high accuracy of the model and resulting in significant simplifications for SAR system calibration.

Finally, a novel self-calibration approach is developed which improves the antenna model accuracy beyond the current specifications. Nominal acquisitions can be utilized to calibrate the antenna model and monitor its performance, eliminating the necessity of dedicated measurements over reference targets like rain forest.

40|$|Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) of hard {{coatings}} onto steels requires thorough controlling of dimensions and hardness. Dimensional and hardness problems {{depend on the}} metallurgical properties of the base and the heat treatments which are applied to the steel before and at the application of CVD. Some information on {{the control of the}} dimensions and the hardness of high-carbon high-chromium tool steels which have to be coated with hard compounds by CVD at high temperatures (HTCVD) was already presented some years ago (1). The paper which is now proposed will deal with some dimensional and hardness problems which are connected to the production of {{hard coatings}} on tool steels by means of CVD at medium temperatures (MTCVD). Such processes are usually applied to tools which have been already heattreated (at least quenched and tempered) and finally worked (ground and polished). Thus MTCVD involves an additional heat treatment (tempering) and may provoke metallurgical reactions in the base which cause changes in dimensions and hardness. Starting with some components in the microstructure of steels and their specific volumes, an introduction into the dimensional changes of steels due to hardening, tempering and subcooling will be presented. The dimensional stability of steels depends predominantly on the retained austenite and the degree of supersaturation with alloying elements. The hardness of high-carbon high-chromium tool steels will be discussed by means of spatial <b>diagramms</b> which show the hardness HV 30 as a function of austenitizing temperature Ta and tempering temperature Tt at constant tempering time tt, and also as a function of Ta and tt at constant Tt.

The foam structure itself is an important attribut of the product requirements for many technical foams. To control the quality of foams a reliable analysis method is essential. Characteristics which are determined are the cell density, the cell size and the area rate of the surface from the cells of a foam cut. For this analysis a system for optical cell analysis (OZELLA) was developed in this paper. As a result of OZELLA the user gets among other things the cell size distribution of the foam. All detected characteristics can be displayed in statistic <b>diagramms.</b> So a specific research of different process parameters for the foam production is possible. It has been shown, that the varitions of the test conditions of the production of foams {{can be seen in}} the structures analysis. With the system developed in this paper objective analysis of different closed cell foams is possible for the first time. It has been shown, that the stereo imaging method generates a 3 D contour map of the foam surface from two images of the foam structure, which are recorded from different directions. The 3 D map allows the reconstruction of the foam structure. Different methods of stereo image processing were tested. In this paper a system for canonical and non parallel axes of the cameras for stereo imaging has been designed and built. The confocal image analysis generates a good reconstruction of the 3 D-surface structures of foams. From the focus series, taken with different distances between the camera and the foam structure, the depth informations of the structure are filtered. In this paper new filter algorithms for the detection of the local sharpness were developed.

We show by a direct inspection that the phase transition diagram for the full symmetric Toda system in dimensions n= 3, 4 coincides with the Hasse diagram of the Bruhat order of symmetric groups S_ 3 and S_ 4. The method we use is based on the existence of a vast collection of invariant subvarieties of the Toda flow in orthogonal groups. We show how one can extend it to the case of general n. The resulting theorem identifies the set of singular points of dim=n Toda flow with the elements of the permutation group S_n, so that points will be connected by a trajectory, if and only if the corresponding elements are Bruhat comparable. We also show that the dimension of the submanifolds, spanned by the trajectories connecting two singular points, is equal to the length of the corresponding segment in the Hasse <b>diagramm.</b> This is equivalent to the fact, that the full symmetric Toda system is in fact a Morse-Smale system.

40|$|Provided a {{high degree}} of {{capacity}} utilisation, the transport of goods on rails represents an environmentally, economically and socially advantageous mode of transport when compared to road haulage. As its current low mode-share in Europe reveals, however, rail freight transport is a competitive alternative only in a minority of cases. Explanations for rail’s under utilisation have traditionally focused on the technical interoperability of the European railway system, but more recent research has broadened to include market organisation, political structures, and social or financial conditions that hinder rail freight transport. The present study analyses how alternative fields of action for addressing these challenges can be prioritised. The study begins by examining the approaches currently used for strategy evaluation, and investigates options for methodological enhancements. Furthermore, the study addresses the question under which circumstances approaches belonging to the class of multi-criteria-decision analyses are suitable for the specific evaluation contexts. Thereafter, a methodological framework is developed for the prioritisation of strategies that draws on the multi-criteria approach ELECTRE III, embedded with Monte-Carlosimulations as well as correlation analyses. Results of a series of guided expert interviews from the EU-project REORIENT and national macro indicators on the characteristics and effects of rail freight transport serve as input data for the assessment process. For the execution of the multi-criteria evaluation within the Monte-Carlo-simulation, the algorithm ELECTRE III was implemented as a self-contained software. The result of the evaluation reveals clearly that financial constraints, in particular, compromise the competitiveness of actors in the rail freight sector. On the basis of this result, proposals for the improvement of the situation are submitted. The main methodological conclusion is that although multi-criteria approaches can effectively support strategy evaluation in the field of rail freight transport, their complexity seriously undermines a broad application. In order to make the numerous procedural-steps of multi-criteria approaches more comprehensible to stakeholders, it is proposed to visualise the partial order of individual steps, for example by means of the Hasse <b>Diagramm</b> Technique...|$|E
