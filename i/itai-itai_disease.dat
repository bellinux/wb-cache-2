30|$|Cadmium (Cd) {{is one of}} the biologically nonessential, nonbiodegradable, {{persistent}} type {{of priority}} hazardous and heavy metal pollutants (Campbell 2006), which easily accumulates in sediments and aquatic organisms (by bioaccumulation and biomagnifications), and thus causing a gross biological impact. It is poisonous for plants, animals, and humans (Gupta and Gupta 1998) and recognized as a human carcinogen (IARC 1994). Human exposure to low level of Cd can result in renal diseases, osteomalacia, and lung cancer as well as damage the cardiovascular system, liver, and reproductive system (USEPA 1992; Hrudey et al. 1995; Belimov et al. 2005). Excessive intake of Cd leads to damage of human enzyme tissue, lung, kidney and renal system, skeletal deformation (Japanese <b>itai–itai</b> <b>diseases),</b> cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension (Nogawa et al. 2004; Argun et al. 2007).|$|R

The corresponding two retinol-binding forms (Holo I and II) were present as minor components (about 15 % of the total).

Investigations of the binding of apo-RBP with various terpenoids revealed that an isoprene structure possessing conjugated double bonds is necessary for binding, which is strengthened by the presence of a 0 -ionone ring. Carboxylic acids tested were bound to apo-RBP with high affinity, possibly due to ionic binding of the carboxylic anion with the protein, supported by hydrophobic residues of the compounds.

40|$|In the new {{curriculum}} of Chemistry in High School, the investigative learning has been emphasized {{in place of}} the descriptive one. This means that phenomena and materials should be elucidated on the basis of atom and molecule. And the author thinks that this is equivalent to the modernization of education of Chemistry. This would demand much efforts of teachers, because chemistry has made rapid progress in these days. The present paper was written for the lecture for "Modernization Course of Chemistry in High School" held at Educational Center in Omura City, Nagasaki Prefecture, on August 1, 1973. That describes the modernization of Chemistry, based on the case of Chemical Kinetics. Supplement : Environmental Degradation and Education of Science We are very concerned about Minamata <b>disease,</b> <b>itai-itai</b> and other environmental disasters. However it seems that people put the pollution over here and the consumption of resources over here. In other words, people are thiking that {{they would be able to}} survive as long as they could prevent the environmental pollution and keep food and fuel. This is not true. It is no exaggeration to say that pouring PCB and mercury into the oceans is to commit murder, because these compounds cause a breakdown of the oceans, which are part of the life-support systems of the earth, and first of all, the fishes from the sea that are main protein diet are poisoned. Then, could the problem of environmental pollution be resolved, if we could protect such pollution? I should like to say no. Let me give you an example of energy. In order to protect pollution, we need chemicals which absorb poisoning materials. The industry must produce the chemicals and needs energy for the production of chemicals. When energy is consumed, harmful gases appear in the air. We have to someplace get petroleum and transport it. Shipping oil in tankers put much petroleum into oceans. Those are direct environmental pollution. Once we use energy, energy should not be reproduced, and entropy continues to increase in our universe. However, it is fated to arrive at maximum point, where all activities should stop. This means death of our universe. The increase in entropy is indirect pollution of environment which we can not see. We can see that the activity itself for protection of pollution as well as all of our activities lead to environmental degradation, as mentioned above. I should like to show you another example. After we run out of petroleum, we can use nuclear energy. However for development of nuclear energy, we need some resources like uranium and energy, too. Consequently an increase in entropy is accelerated. How can we leave alive as long as possible? We need Education of Science in order to answer the question correctly...|$|R

50|$|<b>Itai-itai</b> <b>disease</b> {{was caused}} by cadmium {{poisoning}} due to mining in Toyama Prefecture. The earliest records of mining for gold in the area date back to 1710. Regular mining for silver started in 1589, and soon thereafter, mining for lead, copper, and zinc began. Increased demand for raw materials during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I, {{as well as new}} mining technologies from Europe, increased the output of the mines, putting the Kamioka Mines in Toyama among the world's top mines. Production increased even more before World War II. Starting in 1910 and continuing through 1945, cadmium was released in significant quantities by mining operations, and the disease first appeared around 1912. Prior to World War II, the mining, controlled by the Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., Ltd., increased to satisfy the wartime demand. This subsequently increased the pollution of the Jinzū River and its tributaries. The river was used mainly for irrigation of rice fields, but also for drinking water, washing, fishing, and other uses by downstream populations.|$|E

Although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E

" Pollution-related diseases became a matter of public concern and lawsuits were initiated by affected residents in an attempt to correct damages. <b>Itai-itai</b> <b>disease,</b> which I will discuss here, is such a pollution-related disease, like Minamata disease, on which you have just heard.

Impairment in renal tubular function, generalized osteomalacia and osteoporosis with the resultant multiple bone fractures are predominant clinical signs of the <b>Itai-itai</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Itai-itai</b> <b>disease</b> was the most severe manifestation of cadmium toxicity in patients documented in Japan who suffered chronic exposure to high cadmium concentrations in contaminated water and rice (Nogawa et al. 1987; Aoshima et al. 1988).|$|E

No physiological role of cadmium in human cellular metabolism has been reported so far and it is extremely toxic in very minute quantity (Aksoy et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2014). It has also been reported to cause osteoporosis and fractures, anemia, eosinophilia, anosmia, apoptosis, diabetes mellitus, oncogenes activation, <b>Itai–Itai</b> <b>disease</b> and chronic pulmonary problems (Waisberg et al. 2003; Edwards and Prozialeck 2009; Yazdankhah et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Environmental cadmium {{pollution}} causes cadmium poisoning. The first cadmium-polluted area ever {{discovered in}} the world was the Jinzu River basin in Toyama Prefecture in Japan. The most severe case of cadmium poisoning is <b>Itai-itai</b> <b>disease</b> (osteomalacia), which was officially recognized as a pollution-related disease by the Japanese government in 1968, and a less severe case is tubular kidney dysfunction. In other words, the occurrence of <b>Itai-itai</b> <b>disease</b> is only the "tip of the iceberg". The tubular kidney dysfunction is the earliest and most prevalent adverse result of chronic cadmium poisoning. The Japan Public Health Association Cadmium Research Committee, supported by the Environmental Agency, carried out health surveys in cadmium-polluted areas of 8 prefectures during the period of 1976 - 1984 and reported that many cases of tubular kidney dysfunction were found not only in Toyama but also in Ishikawa, Hyogo and Nagasaki prefectures. However, the Environmental Agency and the research committee have never certified this kidney dysfunction as a pollution-related disease. In 1970, the Japanese government set tentative acceptable standards of 1 ppm for brown rice and enacted the Agricultural Land Soil Pollution Prevention Law in 1971. Based on this Law, restoration projects of polluted soils of rice paddies were started. If cadmium nephropathy was certified as a officially pollution-related disease, acceptable standards for brown rice must be more strict than 1 ppm, because 1 ppm is a standard to prevent habitants from suffering from <b>Itai-itai</b> <b>disease.</b> This new strict standard arrives at increases in polluted rice and soils. This means increases in the expenses to buy polluted rice and to restore polluted soils. To offer indemnity to farmers for any reduction in his rice crop is the responsibility of polluting industries and to pay expenses to restore polluted soils is the responsibility of polluting industries, the central government and local authorities. This paper concludes that the main reason why cadmium nephropathy has not been certified as an official pollution- related disease is that the decision-making of the Environmental Agency and the research committee reflects the intention of the polluting industries and the government who regard the expenses above as too heavy a burden...|$|E
