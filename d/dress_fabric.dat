Twice we shot past the latter, and had time to notice how a battered log of driftwood tilted endways and went down, but as on the second revolution we swept toward a jutting fang of quartz I made a fierce effort, because here the stream had piled a few yards of shingle against {{the foot of the}} rock. The craft yielded to the impulse and drove lurching among the backwash. Then there followed a sickening crash. Water poured in deep over her depressed side as she swayed downward and over, and the next moment, with one hand on the ragged quartz and another gripping Grace's arm, I was struggling in the stream. Fortunately the <b>dress</b> <b>fabric</b> held, and my failing strength was equal to the strain, for I found a foothold, and crawled out upon the shingle, dragging her after me.

The shirtwaist dress was worn for all occasions, besides those that were extremely formal, and were modest in design. The dress could either have long or short sleeves, a modest neckline and skirt that fell below the knee. The bust was rounded but not particularly emphasized and the waistline was often belted in its normal position.

These dresses often were accompanied by coordination coats, which were made out of contrasting fabric but lined with the <b>dress</b> <b>fabric.</b> The jacket was often constructed in a boxy fashion and had wide lapels, wide shoulders and numerous pockets.

Some of the people who cheated them are Old Lady Possum and Gretchen Fox (the wife of Mayor Harrison Fox). As Christmas approaches, they hear of a talent contest in the nearby town of Waterville, and separately decide to enter to buy nice presents for each other—a nice guitar for Emmet, or a piano for Ma.

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine {{changes in the}} home market retail and {{distribution}} structure for British <b>dress</b> <b>fabric.</b> Increasing concentration of retail firms, with a transition to sales of ready-to-wear clothing rather than drapery fabrics for home dressmaking, was combined with challenges to the existing wholesale distribution structure by both manufacturers and retailers. This encouraged {{the establishment of a}} volatile fashion-driven consumer market in the interwar period. The retail structure in the home market changed significantly during the period, with the expansion of chain stores, establishment of manufacturers’ brands (supported by fixed retail prices) and broadening of access to consumer goods through the increasing availability of credit. Retailers and wholesalers changed their ordering practices in response to uncertainty of economic conditions and changes in demand, with smaller stocks held and a wider range of lines offered. A concentration of drapery sales in department stores, due to the costs of carrying a wide variety of lines, was intensified by the amalgamation of department stores. Further concentration away from the small independent drapery stores and wholesalers occurred with the establishment of large urban Co-operative retail stores and expansion of multiples that focused on sales of ready-to-wear clothing. A more dynamic competitive environment developed, with forwards integration from producers and backwards integration from retailers. The increase of branded lines by manufacturers and printers demonstrates their emergence in a more active entrepreneurial role rather the usual, passive commission-processing system. Some retail chains initiated controversial direct trading with manufacturers while department stores took on a merchanting role and commissioned textile prints or even produced small experimental ranges themselves. A fundamental shift in the production/ consumption process was the widening of the relevance of fashionability to all classes of textiles and across the social scale, with the consequent displacement of the ideal of durability. These changes led to a disappearance of the trickle-down time lag from couture to mass fashion whilst increasing market volatility. The establishment of the new model of consumption was viewed with concern by print companies due to the unpredictability of demand and higher production and promotion costs. However, the establishment of a fashionability model for all price levels of <b>dress</b> <b>fabric</b> increased personal choice and raised the significance of design in mass-market printed dress fabrics. These changes in the textiles retail and distribution structure indicate the transition to a recognisably modern mass consumer society...|$|E

She published her signature household manual under all three of her married names: Marjorie Blackwell, Marjorie Cooper and Marjorie Bligh. A pioneer recycler, Marjorie has for several decades been renowned for her spirited campaign against useful resources being poured into landfill.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the process and}} structures {{of the formation of}} taste and activation of fashion change within the British printed calico industry, from 1919 - 1940. The approach taken was to analyse the style trends, economic conditions and strategic policy of a number of case study companies. These case studies are contextualised by analysis of the broad structural and economic conditions in the industry, the interventions of Government and the contemporary ideological construction of pattern design. The thesis tests several historiographic views relevant to the structural analysis of taste formation. The assertion by the Balfour Committee in 1928 that the industry was divided into separate market and design style sections is investigated. A commonly held view that British interwar design was reactionary and regressive, and the general assumption that Modernism came to Britain in the 1930 s as a Continental influence, is challenged. Definitions and perceptions of Modernism are closely examined. A range of contradictory claims regarding the sources of design innovation and fashion leadership in the industry are assessed. In addition, claims that the British interwar cotton industry was not innovative in its response to economic conditions and theories of a link between macroeconomic conditions and innovation are considered. In relation to the formation of taste, the thesis concludes that there was a separation in the fields of taste construction for furnishing and <b>dress</b> <b>fabric,</b> with different sources of design production, markets and design styles, although textile production for both sections could occur within the same company. In the case studies analysed, the main source of innovation and taste construction in printed textile design appears to have been company design studios, rather than freelance artists, architects, designers or Parisian design studios. The influence of the economic context was evident in the impact of specific cost rises, alteration of print processes used and changing market demand due to macroeconomic conditions and international competition. A switch in the basis of mass market demand from durability to fashion in textiles and clothing during the interwar period promoted a production structure of short production runs, small orders and a wide design range. A relevant factor in the construction of taste Was the Modernist educational aims of the British Government during the interwar period, particularly in the impact on general and designer education. It switched to a policy of promoting exhibitions of innovative Modernist design as a basis for creating demand in the 1930 s, from a strategy that emphasised vertical integration of the textile industry to increase efficiency. The British printed textiles industry was innovative in its response to severe economic conditions, in terms of design, product development and the strategies of national printed textile industry organisations. A significant finding is the active role of the British printed textiles industry in initiating debate, producing exhibitions and developing designs that by 1919 had established a Modernist approach and visual language of decorative design. This version of Modernism was related to art-based concepts of form and expression, while also considering the design criteria of fitness to function. <b>Dress</b> <b>fabric</b> design - not hitherto seen as significant in the historiography of Modernism - was shown to have been strongly Modernist in emphasis in the case study companies examined. Modernism in pattern design appears to have been popular during the interwar period, rather than - as generally assumed - restricted to a small group of consumers with highly educated aesthetic tastes. These conclusions arise from and are substantiated by extensive empirical investigation of the design style and business history of case-study companies, supported by structural analysis of the industry...|$|E
