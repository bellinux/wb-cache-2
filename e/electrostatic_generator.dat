5|$|No formula {{could be}} more {{accurate}} than the values put into it; the values for the cross sections were dubious, and {{had not yet been}} determined for plutonium. Measurement of these values would be a priority, but the laboratory possessed just 1 gram of uranium-235, and only a few micrograms of plutonium. This task fell to Bacher's P Division. Williams P-2 (<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Generator)</b> Group carried out the first experiment in July 1943, when it used the larger of the two Van de Graaff generators to measure the ratio of the neutron per fission in plutonium against that of uranium-235. This involved some negotiation with the Metallurgical Laboratory to obtain 165 μg of plutonium, which was received at Los Alamos on 10 July 1943. Bacher was able to report that the number of neutrons per fission of plutonium-239 was 2.64 ± 0.2, about 1.2 times as much as uranium-235. Titterton and Boyce McDaniel of Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group attempted to measure the time it took for prompt neutrons to be emitted from a uranium-235 nucleus when it fissions. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 nanosecond. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a nanosecond too. Confirmation of the theorists' contention that the number of neutrons emitted per fission was the same for both fast and slow neutrons took longer, and was not completed until the autumn of 1944.|$|E

RNDr. Leoš Dvořák, CSc., Department of Physics Education Abstract: This {{bachelor}} thesis named <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> {{is divided}} into four main parts. The first part deals {{with the role of}} experiment in physics teaching on primary and high schools and brings some important arguments why the experiment plays irreplaceable role in teaching physics. Second part deals with the explanation of principles of operation of some particular types of real <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators.</b> Third part describes the concept of construction, its' improvements and experience with building of the Bonetti electrostatic machine, which can become a desirable instrument in schools thanks to its' properties and affordable cost. There are also results of measurements of some parameters of available generators mentioned. Fourth part consists of gathered school demonstrative experiments from electrostatics, which are chosen to match teachers' needs by their simplicity of performing and their applicability to demonstration of electrostatics for students.

50|$|Between 1945 and 1960, the French {{researcher}} Noël Felici {{developed a}} series of high-power <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators,</b> based on electric excitation and using cylinders rotating at high speed and hydrogen in pressurized containers.|$|R
25|$|In 1785, N. Rouland {{constructed}} a silk-belted machine that rubbed two grounded tubes covered with hare fur. Edward Nairne developed an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator</b> for medical purposes in 1787 {{that had the}} ability to generate either positive or negative electricity, the first of these being collected from the prime conductor carrying the collecting points and the second from another prime conductor carrying the friction pad. The Winter machine possessed higher efficiency than earlier friction machines. In the 1830s, Georg Ohm possessed a machine similar to the Van Marum machine for his research (which is now at the Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany). In 1840, the Woodward machine was developed by improving the Ramsden machine, placing the prime conductor above the disk(s). Also in 1840, the Armstrong hydroelectric machine was developed, using steam as a charge carrier.|$|E

500|$|Franklin was not {{the first}} to build an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator.</b> European {{scientists}} developed machines to generate static electricity decades earlier. In 1663 Otto von Guericke generated static electricity with a device that used a sphere of sulfur. Francis Hauksbee developed a more advanced <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator</b> around 1704 using a glass bulb that had a vacuum. He later replaced the globe with a glass tube of about [...] emptied of air. The glass tube was a less effective static generator than the globe, but it became more popular because it was easier to use.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{connection}} between magnetism and electricity was discovered, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> were invented. They operated on electrostatic principles, by using moving electrically charged belts, plates, and disks that carried charge to a high potential electrode. The charge was generated using either of two mechanisms: electrostatic induction or the triboelectric effect. Such generators generated very high voltage and low current. Because of their inefficiency {{and the difficulty of}} insulating machines that produced very high voltages, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> had low power ratings, and were never used for generation of commercially significant quantities of electric power. Their only practical applications were to power early X-ray tubes, and later in some atomic particle accelerators.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> had a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} investigations about the structure of matter, starting {{at the end of the}} 19th century. By the 1920s, it was evident that machines able to produce greater voltage were needed.|$|R
50|$|In 1893, C.F. Samms and J.B. Wantz {{founded the}} Victor Electric Company in a basement. By 1896 they made <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> for {{exciting}} x-ray tubes and electrotherapeutic devices.They had {{a staff of}} six and a capital of $3,000 invested in the company.|$|R
500|$|In 1704, Newton {{published}} Opticks, {{in which}} he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to {{be made up of}} extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation [...] "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another,... and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?" [...] Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator,</b> using a glass globe.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{followed}} in 1660 by Otto von Guericke, who invented an early <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator.</b> By {{the end of}} the 17th Century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction with an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator,</b> but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity. The first usage of the word electricity is ascribed to Sir Thomas Browne in his 1646 work, Pseudodoxia Epidemica. In 1729 Stephen Gray (1666–1736) demonstrated that electricity could be [...] "transmitted" [...] through metal filaments.|$|E
2500|$|In 1663, German {{physicist}} Otto von Guericke {{created the}} first <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator,</b> which produced static electricity by applying friction. The generator was made of a large sulfur ball inside a glass globe, mounted on a shaft. The ball was rotated {{by means of a}} crank and a static electric spark was produced when a pad was rubbed against the ball as it rotated. The globe could be removed and used as an electrical source for experiments with electricity. [...] Von Guericke used his generator to show that like charges repelled each other.|$|E

40|$|Ballistic energy {{conversion}} is the direct conversion of kinetic energy into electrical energy. Aqueous droplet-based platforms are eminently suitable for this method, as droplets can be conveniently supplied with both kinetic energy and electrical charge. Starting with the 19 th century gravity-driven Kelvin thunderstorm and the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> of Melcher and Zahn from the 1960 s, {{we describe the}} recent development of ballistic {{energy conversion}} both in experiment and theory. With this method experimental efficiencies of 48 % have been reached at 20 kV operating voltage with an extremely simple setup. Theory predicts maximal efficiencies of more than 90 %, operation at < 100 Volt. Downscaling also promises to remove {{one of the largest}} disadvantages of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators,</b> namely the low power density: power densities of 1 - 1000 kW/m 2 are predicted...|$|R
50|$|At a {{time when}} {{physicists}} were abandoning glass globe <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators,</b> which used sulphur or resin, to use glass plates instead, the Duke of Chaulnes built the largest machine of this type that had yet been seen. He used it to produce the effects of lightning {{for the first time}} in France.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Wimshurst {{developed}} a [...] "duplex machine". The device had two disks turning in opposite directions, with metallic conducting sectors on {{the surfaces of}} each. Compared to its predecessors, this machine was less sensitive to atmospheric conditions and did not require an electric power supply. This form of the machine was also improved by other developers (such as the Pidgeon machine developed by W. R. Pidgeon, which increased the electrical induction effect and its electrical output). In 1882, Wimshurst developed his [...] "Cylindrical Machine". By 1883, his improvements to the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator</b> led to the device being widely known as the Wimshurst machine. In 1885, {{one of the largest}} Wimshurst machines was built in England (and is now at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry).|$|E
2500|$|In October 1745, Ewald Georg von Kleist of Pomerania, Germany, {{found that}} charge could be stored by {{connecting}} a high-voltage <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator</b> by a wire to {{a volume of}} water in a hand-held glass jar. Von Kleist's hand and the water acted as conductors, and the jar as a dielectric (although details of the mechanism were incorrectly identified at the time). Von Kleist found that touching the wire resulted in a powerful spark, much more painful than that obtained from an electrostatic machine. The following year, the Dutch physicist Pieter van Musschenbroek invented a similar capacitor, which was named the Leyden jar, after the University of Leiden where he worked. [...] He also {{was impressed by the}} power of the shock he received, writing, [...] "I would not take a second shock for the kingdom of France." ...|$|E
2500|$|An <b>{{electrostatic}}</b> <b>generator,</b> or electrostatic machine, is an electromechanical generator {{that produces}} static electricity, or electricity at high voltage and low continuous current. The knowledge of static electricity {{dates back to}} the earliest civilizations, but for millennia it remained merely an interesting and mystifying phenomenon, without a theory to explain its behavior and often confused with magnetism. By the end of the 17th century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity. Electrostatic generators operate by using manual (or other) power to transform mechanical work into electric energy. Electrostatic generators develop electrostatic charges of opposite signs rendered to two conductors, using only electric forces, and work by using moving plates, drums, or belts to carry electric charge to a high potential electrode. [...] The charge is generated by one of two methods: either the triboelectric effect (friction) or electrostatic induction.|$|E
50|$|The contact {{electrification}} phenomenon {{allowed the}} construction of so-called 'frictional' <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> such as Ramsden's or Winter's machines, but it also led directly {{to the development of}} useful devices such as batteries, fuel cells, electroplating, thermocouples. Contact between materials is responsible for such modern electrical technology as semiconductor junction devices including radio detector diodes, photocells, LEDs, and thermoelectric cells.|$|R
25|$|Electrostatic {{machines}} are typically used in science classrooms to safely demonstrate electrical forces and high voltage phenomena. The elevated potential differences achieved have been {{also used for}} a variety of practical applications, such as operating X-ray tubes, medical applications, sterilization of food, and nuclear physics experiments. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> such as the Van de Graaff generator, and variations as the Pelletron, also find use in physics research.|$|R
25|$|By the 1750s, as {{the study}} of {{electricity}} became popular, efficient ways of producing electricity were sought. The generator developed by Jesse Ramsden {{was among the first}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> invented. Electricity produced by such generators was used to treat paralysis, muscle spasms, and to control heart rates. Other medical uses of electricity included filling the body with electricity, drawing sparks from the body, and applying sparks from the generator to the body.|$|R
2500|$|Others, {{including}} T. Cavallo (who {{developed the}} [...] "Cavallo multiplier", a charge multiplier using simple addition, in 1795), John Read, Charles Bernard Desormes, and Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette, developed further {{various forms of}} rotating doublers. In 1798, The German scientist and preacher Gottlieb Christoph Bohnenberger, described the Bohnenberger machine, along with several other doublers of Bennet and Nicholson types in a book. The most interesting of these were described in the [...] "Annalen der Physik" [...] (1801). Giuseppe Belli, in 1831, developed a simple symmetrical doubler which consisted of two curved metal plates between which revolved a pair of plates carried on an insulating stem. It was the first symmetrical influence machine, with identical structures for both terminals. This apparatus was reinvented several times, by C.F. Varley, that patented a high power version in 1860, by Lord Kelvin (the [...] "replenisher") 1868, and by A.D. Moore (the [...] "dirod"), more recently. Lord Kelvin also devised a combined influence machine and electromagnetic machine, commonly called a mouse mill, for electrifying the ink in connection with his siphon recorder, and a water-drop <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator</b> (1867), which he called the [...] "water-dropping condenser".|$|E
2500|$|In 1600, the English {{scientist}} William Gilbert {{returned to}} the subject in De Magnete, and coined the New Latin word electricus from [...] (ēlektron), the Greek word for amber, which soon {{gave rise to the}} English words [...] "electric" [...] and [...] "electricity". He was followed in 1660 by Otto von Guericke, who invented what was probably the first <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generator.</b> Other European pioneers were Robert Boyle, who in 1675 stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum; Stephen Gray, who in 1729 classified materials as conductors and insulators; and C. F. du Fay, who proposed in 1733 that electricity comes in two varieties that cancel each other, and expressed this in terms of a two-fluid theory. When glass was rubbed with silk, du Fay said that the glass was charged with vitreous electricity, and, when amber was rubbed with fur, the amber was charged with resinous electricity. In 1839, Michael Faraday showed that the apparent division between static electricity, current electricity, and bioelectricity was incorrect, and all were a consequence of the behavior of a single kind of electricity appearing in opposite polarities. It is arbitrary which polarity is called positive and which is called negative. Positive charge can be defined as the charge left on a glass rod after being rubbed with silk.|$|E

50|$|These {{machines}} {{belong to}} a class of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>generators</b> called influence machines, which separate electric charges through electrostatic induction, or influence, not depending on friction for their operation. Earlier machines in this class were developed by Wilhelm Holtz (1865 and 1867), August Toepler (1865), J. Robert Voss (1880), and others. The older machines are less efficient and exhibit an unpredictable tendency to switch their polarity. The Wimshurst does not have this defect.|$|R

2500|$|Multiple disk {{machines}} and [...] "triplex" [...] <b>electrostatic</b> machines (<b>generators</b> with three disks) were also developed extensively {{around the turn}} of the 20th century. In 1900, F.

In 1903, Alfred Wehrsen patented an ebonite rotating disk possessing embedded sectors with button contacts at the disk surface. In 1907, Heinrich Wommelsdorf reported a variation of the Holtz machine using this disk and inductors embedded in celluloid plates (DE154175; [...] "Wehrsen machine").
