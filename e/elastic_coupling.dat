5000|$|An <b>elastic</b> <b>{{coupling}}</b> transmits torque {{or other}} load {{by means of}} an elastic component. One example is the coupling used to join a windsurfing rig (sail, mast, and components) to the sailboard. In windsurfing terminology it is usually called a [...] "universal joint", but modern designs are usually based on a strong flexible material, and better technically described as an <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling.</b> They can be tendon or hourglass-shaped, and are constructed of a strong and durable elastic material. In this application, the coupling does not transmit torque, but instead transmits sail-power to the board, creating thrust (some portion of sail-power is also transmitted through the rider's body).|$|E

50|$|The X-29 design {{made use}} of the {{anisotropic}} <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> between bending and twisting of the {{carbon fiber composite material}} to address this aeroelastic effect. Rather than using a very stiff wing, which would carry a weight penalty even with the relatively light-weight composite, the X-29 used a laminate which produced coupling between bending and torsion. As lift increases, bending loads force the wing tips to bend upward. Torsion loads attempt to twist the wing to higher angles of attack, but the coupling resists the loads, twisting the leading edge downward reducing wing angle of attack and lift. With lift reduced, the loads are reduced and divergence is avoided.|$|E

40|$|The passive {{dynamics}} of bipedal limbs alone are sufficient {{to produce a}} walking motion, without need for control. Humans augment these dynamics with muscles, actively coordinated to produce stable and economical walking. Present robots using passive dynamics walk much slower, perhaps because they lack <b>elastic</b> muscles that <b>couple</b> the joints. <b>Elastic</b> properties are well known to enhance running gaits, but their effect on walking {{has yet to be}} explored. Here we use a computational model of dynamic walking to show that <b>elastic</b> joint <b>coupling</b> can help to coordinate faster walking. In walking powered by trailing leg push-off, the model's speed is normally limited by a swing leg that moves too slowly to avoid stumbling. A uni-articular spring about the knee allows faster but uneconomical walking. A combination of uni-articular hip and knee springs can speed the legs for improved speed and economy, but not without the swing foot scuffing the ground. Bi-articular springs coupling the hips and knees can yield high economy and good ground clearance similar to humans. An important parameter is the knee-to-hip moment arm that greatly affects the existence and stability of gaits, and when selected appropriately can allow {{for a wide range of}} speeds. <b>Elastic</b> joint <b>coupling</b> may contribute to the economy and stability of human gait...|$|R

40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{torsional}} vibration of a diesel engine shaft, the torsional stiffness of the flexible coupling {{is a key}} kinetic parameter. Since the material properties of the elastic element of the coupling might change after a long-time operation due to the severe working environment or improper use and the variation of such properties will change dynamic feature of the coupling, it will cause a relative large calculation error of torsional vibration to the shaft system. Moreover, the torsional stiffness of the <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> is difficult to be determined, and it is inappropriate to measure this parameter by disassembling the power unit while it is under normal operation. To solve these problems, this paper {{comes up with a}} method which combines the torsional vibration test with the calculation of the diesel shafting and uses the inherent characteristics of shaft torsional vibration to identify the dynamic stiffness of the <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> without disassembling the unit. Analysis results show that it is reasonable and feasible to identify the <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> dynamic torsional stiffness with this method and the identified stiffness is accurate. Besides, this method provides a convenient and practical approach to examine the dynamic behavior of the long running <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> is {{a feature}} {{specific}} to fiber-reinforced plastic mate-rials, {{and it is}} often used in structures to improve stabilities or for other purposes. In {{the investigation of the}} <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> properties, the commonly used finite element analysis (FEA) software package in structures does not usually provide a theoretical understanding. Thus, this study adopted a combined analytical and finite element beam model to address this problem. The model can provide better understanding on structures, and the computation time is far less than the FEA. This study examined several factors that may influence the couplings of wind turbine blades, such as material selection, coupling positions, and the wind force distribution. The results showed that mixed-use of carbon and glass fibers can provide better coupling prop-erties, and the blade developers should arrange the off-axis fibers to adapt to the operating conditions in order to reach better performance.

We found that the FLL of a field-cooled state without driving forces is not in an equilibrium state. Results obtained for magnetic fields applied at 0 ^∘ and 30 ^∘ relative to CuO_ 2 planes, show an enhancement of the <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> of the films at driving current densities several orders of magnitude smaller than the critical one.

30|$|Puwal and Roth (Puwal & Roth 2010; Punal & Roth 2012; Puwal & Roth 2013) have {{previously}} presented a linear mechanical bidomain model that separately considers the intracellular and extracellular spaces as <b>elastic</b> continua <b>coupled</b> by a spring force whose magnitude {{is proportional to}} the displacement difference of the two spaces. (Note that the terms “monodomain” and “bidomain” are standard terms in the cardiac research literature. Those familiar with elasticity theory may recognize these terms as “monophasic” and “biphasic”.) The advantage of the bidomain approach is that we may consider a particular microscopic parameter averaged over many cells, while still discussing macroscopic effects. In this case, the microscopic parameter {{is the nature of the}} force <b>coupling</b> <b>elastic</b> deformations of the intracellular and extracellular spaces.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} consistency, stability, and {{convergence}} of an hp discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method of Kopriva [J. Comput. Phys., 128 (1996), pp. 475 – 488] and Ko-priva, Woodruff, and Hussaini [Internat. J. Numer. Methods Engrg., 53 (2002), pp. 105 – 122]. The analysis {{is carried out}} simultaneously for acoustic, <b>elastic,</b> <b>coupled</b> elastic-acoustic, and electromag-netic wave propagation. Our analytical results are developed for both conforming and nonconforming approximations on hexahedral meshes using either exact integration with Legendre–Gauss quadra-ture or inexact integration with Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto quadrature. A mortar-based nonconform-ing approximation is developed to treat both h- and p-nonconforming meshes simultaneously. The mortar approach is constructed {{in such a way}} that consistency, stability, and convergence analyses for nonconforming approximations follow the conforming counterparts with minimal modifications. In particular, it casts hp-nonconforming interfaces into equivalent conforming faces on mortars, for which the analyses are easily carried out using standard approaches. Sharp hp-convergence results are then proved for nonconforming approximations of time-dependent wave propagation problems using both exact and inexact quadratures...|$|R

40|$|We have {{performed}} an experimental {{characterization of the}} dynamics of oscillating quartz tuning forks which are being increasingly used in scanning probe microscopy as force sensors. We show that tuning forks can be described as a system of coupled oscillators. Nevertheless, this description requires the knowledge of the <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> constant between the prongs of the tuning fork, which has not yet been measured. Therefore tuning forks have been usually described within the single oscillator or the weakly coupled oscillators approximation that neglects the coupling between the prongs. We propose three different procedures to measure the <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> constant: an opto-mechanical method, a variation of the Cleveland method and a thermal noise based method. We find that the coupling between the quartz tuning fork prongs has a strong influence on the dynamics and the measured motion is in remarkable agreement with a simple model of coupled harmonic oscillators. The precise determination of the <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> between the prongs of a tuning fork allows to obtain a quantitative relation between the resonance frequency shift and the force gradient acting at the free end of a tuning fork prong.

40|$|The {{stability}} of hingeless rotor blade oscillations in hover is examined theoretically using a simplified centrally-hinged, spring-restrained, rigid blade to approximate the deflections of actual elastic blades. The aerodynamic and inertial coupling between the flap and lead-lag {{degrees of freedom}} is primarily responsible for instability, however <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> and kinematic pitch-lag coupling both exert a powerful influence on hingeless rotor blade stability. Experimental results obtained from a two-bladed 1. 81 m diameter model rotor designed for minimum <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> have confirmed the results of linear theory. For this model configuration rotor blade stall at high pitch angles was found to counteract the destabilizing flap-lag coupling and increase the damping of lead-lag oscillations. It was possible to account for this effect with the theory by using drag data for stalled airfoils...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of colored noise induced by elastic fluctuations in single-molecule stretching experiments is theoretically and numerically studied. Unlike in the thermal white noise case currently {{considered in the}} literature, elastically induced hopping dynamics between folded and unfolded states is manifested through critical oscillations showing smaller end-to-end distance fluctuations (δx∼ 1. 25 nm) within the free energy wells corresponding to both states. Our results are derived by analyzing the <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> between the Handle-Molecule-Handle system and the laser optical tweezers (LOT) array.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} application of a lever coupling mechanism to improve the shock resistance of a dual-mass silicon micro-gyroscope with drive mode coupled along the driving direction without sacrificing the mechanical sensitivity. Firstly, the mechanical sensitivity and the shock response of the micro-gyroscope are theoretically analyzed. In the mechanical design, a novel lever coupling mechanism is proposed to change the modal order and to improve the frequency separation. The micro-gyroscope with the lever coupling mechanism optimizes the drive mode order, increasing the in-phase mode frequency to be {{much larger than the}} anti-phase one. Shock analysis results show that the micro-gyroscope structure with the designed lever coupling mechanism can notably reduce the magnitudes of the shock response and cut down the stress produced in the shock process compared with the traditional <b>elastic</b> <b>coupled</b> one. Simulations reveal that the shock resistance along the drive direction is greatly increased. Consequently, the lever coupling mechanism can change the gyroscope’s modal order and improve the frequency separation by structurally offering a higher stiffness difference ratio. The shock resistance along the driving direction is tremendously enhanced without loss of the mechanical sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Equations {{of motion}} for a rotor-propeller {{aircraft}} in cruis-ing flight {{have been developed}} and implemented in a computer pro-gram. The formulation is based on Galerkin's method using coupled mode shapes for the blade and wing. This procedure {{is applied to the}} analysis of two types of rotors, gimballed rotor and hingeless. The results are evaluated by means of eigenvalue analysis of the stability of the system and frequency response analysis of the gust and control response. In general, the results show that: (a) The choice of mode shape (rigid-body mode with spring restraint at the root, or <b>elastic</b> <b>coupled</b> mode) to construct the equations of motion affects the damping of the system significantly. The de-pendency of the damping on the mode shape is esti-mated for the first beam bending mode. The frequen-cies of the system have little dependence on the mode-shape type. (b) The results of the frequency response are quite similar to those of Johnson, in spite of the use of different models. However, the amplitude of the response is slightly different.

40|$|Many complex {{cellular}} processes from mitosis to cell motility {{depend on}} the ability of the cytoskeleton to generate force. Force-generating systems that act on elastic cytoskeletal elements are prone to oscillating instabilities. In this work, we have measured spontaneous shape and movement oscillations in motile fish epithelial keratocytes. In persistently polarized, fan-shaped cells, retraction of the trailing edge {{on one side of the}} cell body is out of phase with retraction on the other side, resulting in periodic lateral oscillation of the cell body. We present a physical description of keratocyte oscillation in which periodic retraction of the trailing edge is the result of <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> with the leading edge. Consistent with the predictions of this model, the observed frequency of oscillation correlates with cell speed. In addition, decreasing the strength of adhesion to the substrate reduces the elastic force required for retraction, causing cells to oscillate with higher frequency at relatively lower speeds. These results demonstrate that simple <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> between movement at the front of the cell and movement at the rear can generate large-scale mechanical integration of cell behavior...|$|E
40|$|In a {{decoupled}} design {{method for}} bend-twist adaptive blades the optimum induced twist at a reference operating condition is {{obtained in the}} aerodynamic design phase. In the structural design phase, the structural and material configuration need to be found such that the <b>elastic</b> <b>coupling</b> in the blade produces the desired induced twist obtained in the aerodynamic design phase.

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{authors have}} {{proposed}} mechanical models to predict long term tooth movement, considering both the tooth {{and its surrounding}} bone tissue as isotropic linear <b>elastic</b> materials <b>coupled</b> to either an adaptative elasticity behavior or an update of the elasticity constants with density evolution. However, tooth movements obtained through orthodontic appliances result from a complex biochemical process of bone structure and density adaptation to its mechanical environment, called bone remodeling. This process is far from linear reversible elasticity. It leads to permanent deformations due to biochemical actions. The proposed biomechanical constitutive law, inspired from Doblaré and García (2002)  [30], {{is based on a}} elasto-viscoplastic material coupled with Continuum isotropic Damage Mechanics (Doblaré and García (2002)  [30] considered only the case of a linear <b>elastic</b> material <b>coupled</b> with damage). The considered damage variable is not actual damage of the tissue but a measure of bone density. The damage evolution law therefore implies a density evolution. It is here formulated as to be used explicitly for alveolar bone, whose remodeling cells are considered to be triggered by the pressure state applied to the bone matrix. A 2 D model of a tooth submitted to a tipping movement, is presented. Results show a reliable qualitative prediction of bone density variation around a tooth submitted to orthodontic forces...|$|R
