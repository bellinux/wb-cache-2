500|$|Jacques René Zammit of The Malta Independent {{reviewed}} {{one episode}} in which Fry {{talked about the}} problems within journalism. Zammit wrote positively on Fry's comments saying, [...] "I share Stephen's worries completely. Every time <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to type my excessively long column, I am burdened {{by the thought that}} after all this is just a collection of thoughts by someone who may very well be perceived as a pompous ass – and if Stephen Fry has these disquisitions, then I definitely should be doing some worrying myself." ...|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club {{calling the}} storyline [...] "disappointing." [...] He {{wrote of the}} episode, [...] "At this juncture, disappointment is an expectation, something I have to fight against whenever <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to watch the show {{in an attempt to}} give each episode a fair shake." [...] He continued, [...] "This week, I was at a bit of a loss, because despite a return to an older, more successful formula, with a clearly plotted path, Family Guy didn't muster up enough material to fill out the A-plot of a half hour." [...] McFarland also stated that the episode did not live up to the 1967 drama film Cool Hand Luke, that the title of the episode was named after. He concluded his review of the episode by giving the episode a grade of C. Terren R. Moore of Ology also found the episode to be unimpressive, noting, [...] "It's good fun while it's on, but nothing here really sticks or adds to anything new to love about Family Guy." [...] Moore also commented, [...] "it's a pretty weak episode of Family Guy, where the most memorable joke of the night involves a thought bubble where Quagmire pulls a string of beads out of a woman's vagina." [...] In the conclusion of the review, Moore gave the episode a 6/10 score.|$|E

2500|$|Heap {{states that}} her song lyrics come from {{personal}} experience, {{but are not}} straightforwardly confessional. She has stated [...] "Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mum or my dad. I would never tell them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, when <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to write a lyric, {{it is in the}} heat of the moment, and something has just happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that several}} {{different}} versions of the prayer can be found. For example, some render the beginning verse of each major section as [...] "I arise today" [...] rather than [...] "I bind to myself today." [...] The more problematic verses can also be found in different renderings, such as the verse [...] "Against spells of women, and smiths, and druids" [...] as [...] "Against spells of witches and smiths and wizards" [...] and [...] "Christ in the fort, Christ in the chariot seat, and Christ in the poop [...] " [...] as [...] "Christ when I lie down, Christ when <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> Christ when I arise." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "For me, {{there will}} be days when I write a little poem in a little book, or make a little voice memo in my iPhone. For me, I need to be sitting at an {{instrument}} and be overwhelmed. I've tried {{to look back and}} see if a song just came out of a sunny day. [...] "Oh, today I'm going to write a song." [...] That's never been the case for me. It's always whether I'm just overwhelmed with some emotion. Whether it be I'm happy, I'm sad, I've fallen in love, I've fallen out of love. I'm lonely, I'm scared. Whatever it be that day. If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs. But I seem to just write in one sitting. There's very few occasions where I've gone back and worked on songs later. Normally, <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> the song comes out and I'm done." ...|$|E
