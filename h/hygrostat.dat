5000|$|A device used {{to measure}} {{humidity}} is called a hygrometer; one used to regulate it is called a humidistat, or sometimes <b>hygrostat.</b> (These are analogous to a thermometer and thermostat for temperature, respectively.) ...|$|E
50|$|Overuse of a {{humidifier}} {{can raise}} the relative humidity to excessive levels, promoting the growth of dust mites and mold, and can also cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (humidifier lung). A relative humidity of 30% to 50% is recommended for most homes. A properly installed and located <b>hygrostat</b> {{should be used to}} monitor and control humidity levels automatically, or a well-informed and conscientious human operator must constantly check for correct humidity levels.|$|E
50|$|Drum style (bypass) uses a pipe {{to bring}} water {{directly}} to a reservoir (a pan) attached to the furnace. The water level in the pan is controlled by a float valve, similar to a small toilet tank float. The wick is typically a foam pad mounted on a drum and attached to a small motor; hot air enters the drum {{at one end and}} is forced to leave through the sides of the drum. When the <b>hygrostat</b> calls for humidity, the motor is turned on causing the drum to rotate slowly through the pan of water and preventing the foam pad from drying out.|$|E
40|$|In many {{historic}} buildings, conservation heating {{has been}} used to control the RH in winter. Heat pumps are much more energy efficient than direct electric heating, so this technology may be adapted for climate control. Dehumidification has not been regarded as appropriate for historic buildings due to poor regulation, but recent development in electronic <b>hygrostats</b> makes this technology an attractive alternative. The annual energy consumption for both control strategies was calculated from statistical meteorological data for Denmark. The most energy efficient control strategy is determined by the U-value of the building, the air exchange rate and the volume. For large buildings conservation heating with heat pump technology seems to be the most energy efficient, unless the thermal insulation is very poor. For small buildings dehumidification is more efficient unless the building is very leaky. The two strategies for climate control were tested in historic houses owned by the National Museum in Denmark and used for exhibition only in the summer season. Kommandørgården has an uncontrolled climate in summer due to open doors in the opening hours. In winter the RH is controlled to 60 - 70 % by hygrostatic heating. Liselund is an 18 th century mansion located in a romantic garden on the island Møn at the Baltic Sea. The house is open only for guided tours in the summer, and the RH is controlled all year by dehumidification...|$|R
5000|$|Bypass {{flow-through}} style (bypass - {{also known}} as [...] "biscuit style" [...] or many other, similar variant names) uses a pipe to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve {{at the top of}} the humidifier. Air passes through an aluminum [...] "biscuit" [...] (often called a pad; the term [...] "biscuit" [...] emphasizes the solid rather than foamy form) which is similar to a piece of extremely coarse steel wool. The biscuit has a coating of a matte ceramic, resulting in an extremely large surface area within a small space. When the <b>hygrostat</b> calls for humidity, the valve is opened and causes a spray of water onto the biscuit. Hot air is passed through the biscuit, causing the water to evaporate from the pad and be carried into the building.|$|E
40|$|The surface {{conductivity}} {{changes of}} solid layers deposited on silicone rubber under high humidity {{as a function}} of conditioning time in room conditions were studied. The measurements were carried out on flat samples in a glass <b>hygrostat.</b> It was shown that the surface conductivity of kaolin layer deposited on RTV- 2 silicone decreases 4 times after 30 days of conditioning. However, the layer prepared from a natural dust from Glogow pollution test station shows different properties. The increase of layer hydrophobicity is related with the hygroscopicity decrease...|$|E
