He supported the Bill as it would exclude [...] "murderous atheists, who would pull down Church and state; religion and God; morality and happiness". The peroration included {{a reference to a}} French order for 3,000 daggers.

2500|$|If I {{send someone}} {{out of the}} room - for example, the mother and child - I {{carefully}} move father from his chair and put him into mother's chair. Or if I send the child out, I might put mother in the child's chair, at least temporarily. Sometimes I comment on this by saying, 'As you sit where your son was sitting, you can think more clearly about him.' Or, 'If you sit where your husband sat, maybe it will give you somewhat of his view about me'. Over a series of interviews with an entire family, I shuffle them about, so that what was originally mother's chair is now where father is sitting. The family grouping remains, and yet that family grouping is being rearranged, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> after when changing a family." ...|$|E

In 1969 she said I never have liked to work from my imagination. I like to work from a fact, and I {{will try to make}} something out of the fact. I enjoy that most. And I do my best work when I do that. I don't know whether it's just because I put it out of my mind that I don't like to make things up. Some artists are marvelous at just fantastic inventions. But I love the smell and the feel of life.
