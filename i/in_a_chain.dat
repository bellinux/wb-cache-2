5|$|A recent {{modification}} of the Nice model has the Solar System begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and after a series of encounters is ejected from the Solar System. The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined together <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> of peptide bonds. Each different protein {{has a unique}} sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E

Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E

30|$|Supply chain contract: It {{is taken}} to manage supplier–buyer {{relationships}} and to manage risks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> supply <b>chain.</b> Several parameters are clearly specified <b>in</b> <b>a</b> contract, i.e., quantity, price, time, and quality, when a buyer places an order and when a supplier fulfills the order [3]. Other parameters possibly specified <b>in</b> <b>a</b> supply <b>chain</b> contract include <b>an</b> incentive alignment. Each decision that is made by actors <b>in</b> <b>a</b> supply <b>chain</b> has its own implications. Rewards or penalties given to particular actors according {{to the results of}} their decision are stated as incentives. The incentive alignment itself refers to a way to resolve the conflict of interest among actors <b>in</b> <b>a</b> supply <b>chain</b> by offering incentive schemes that may direct their behavior to conform to customers’ focus and total profit [24, 41]. Auction, as an activity that facilitates sales of product between supplier and buyer, is possibly placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> supply <b>chain</b> contract under “price discovery,” a mechanism that gives a supplier transparency over product price [48].|$|R

Lake Lewis back-flooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River Valleys. In these relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters deposited the suspended materials eroded from the scabland regions north of Lake Lewis, and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding.|$|E

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringUncertainty <b>in</b> <b>a</b> modern supply <b>chain</b> {{structure}} originates at the supplier, {{manufacturing process}} and the consumer.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of <b>a</b> pulse <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear array of oscillators {{is influenced by}} the nature of the array and by its coupling to a thermal environment. For example, <b>in</b> some arrays <b>a</b> pulse can be speeded up while <b>in</b> others <b>a</b> pulse can be slowed down by raising the temperature. We begin by showing that an energy pulse (1 D) or energy front (2 D) travels more rapidly and remains more localized over greater distances <b>in</b> <b>an</b> isolated array (microcanonical) of hard springs than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> harmonic array or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> soft-springed array. Increasing the pulse amplitude causes it to speed up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hard <b>chain,</b> leaves the pulse speed unchanged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> harmonic system, and slows down the pulse <b>in</b> <b>a</b> soft <b>chain.</b> Connection of each site to a thermal environment (canonical) affects these results very differently in each type of array. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> hard <b>chain</b> the dissipative forces slow down the pulse while raising the temperature speeds it up. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> soft <b>chain</b> the opposite occurs: the dissipative forces actually speed up the pulse while raising the temperature slows it down. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> harmonic <b>chain</b> neither dissipation nor temperature changes affect the puls...|$|R
5|$|When {{a player}} {{moves to a}} tile {{occupied}} by a Cutie, that creature is slain along with any other Cuties of the same color directly connected to that tile. Chains of Cuties can be slain in this fashion, producing several souls. Each tile the player moves to is drained of life, causing the grass to wither and preventing the player from moving back to it, any Cuties destroyed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> outside of the initial tile become eggs. After a set period of turns the eggs hatch into random Cuties, which can again be harvested for souls. Any tiles drained by the player's presence return to life and are furnished with an egg when existing eggs hatch. The result {{of this is that}} every tile the reaper travels on takes twice as long to spawn a new Cutie compared to tiles that housed a Cutie destroyed by a chain attack. Players move to the next game level after a certain amount of moves, every new level increases the time taken for eggs to hatch by a turn. Moving onto a tile containing an egg destroys the egg and incurs a small point deduction, but destroying a golden egg increases the player's score. A golden egg is produced whenever 10 or more Cuties are killed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E

A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe he never made it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E

5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated {{to be as much}} as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E
