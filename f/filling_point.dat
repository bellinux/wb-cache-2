50|$|The {{fuel system}} was {{particularly}} troublesome, as leaks incurred during hard landings easily caused fires and explosions. Metal fuel lines and fittings, which failed in unpredictable ways, {{were used as}} {{this was the best}} technology available. Both fuel and oxidizer were toxic and required extreme care when loading in the aircraft, yet there were occasions when Komets exploded on the tarmac from the propellants' hypergolic nature. Both propellants were clear fluids, and different tanker trucks were used for delivering each propellant to a particular Komet aircraft, usually the C-Stoff hydrazine/methanol-base fuel first. For safety purposes, it left the immediate area of the aircraft following its delivery and capping off of the Komets fuel tanks from a rear located dorsal fuselage <b>filling</b> <b>point</b> just ahead of the Komets vertical stabilizer. Then, the other tanker truck carrying the very reactive T-Stoff hydrogen peroxide oxidizer would deliver its load through a different <b>filling</b> <b>point</b> on the Komets dorsal fuselage surface, located not far behind the rear edge of the canopy.|$|E

30|$|On the whole, the tracing {{results of}} the oil filling stages {{demonstrate}} a general oil filling orientation from south to north in the Tuoputai region.

Therefore, the source kitchen/bed for the Ordovician reservoir of the Tuoputai region is predicted to be to {{the south side of the}} study area, most likely in the Shuntuoguole Uplift, which lies between the Awati and Manjiaer Depressions (Fig.  1). The location of the source kitchen/bed is in agreement with the findings of previous studies (e.g., Wang et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2013 b; Xiao et al. 2016; Fang et al. 2016).|$|E
50|$|Non-{{pressure}} refuel systems operate via {{a closed}} loop system where all pressure is contained interior to signal lines, level control, and a shut-off valve. When the fuel tank <b>fill</b> <b>point</b> is reached, a bleed line signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a diaphragm valve at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled. Non-pressurized refueling systems do not require tank pressurization for automatic nozzle shut-off, thus allowing their use on thin-walled metallic and composite material fuel tanks.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} properties of simultaneous water filling for a wireless system with two mutually interfering transmitters and receivers with non-cooperative coding strategies. This is slightly {{different from the}} traditional interference channel problem which assumes that transmitters cooperate in their respective coding strategies, and that interference cancellation can be performed at the receivers. In this non-cooperative setup, greedy capacity optimization by individual transmitters through various algorithms leads to simultaneous water filling fixed points where the spectrum of the transmit covariance matrix of one user water fills over the spectrum of its corresponding interference-plus-noise covariance matrix, and in our paper we study the properties of these fixed points. We show that at a simultaneous water <b>filling</b> <b>point</b> the eigenvectors of transmit covariance matrices at each receiver are aligned, and identify three regimes which correspond to simultaneous water filling that depend on the interference gains: a) complete spectral overlap, b) partial spectral overlap, and c) spectral segregation. These imply that the transmit covariance matrices will be white in regions of both overlap and segregation, but not necessarily white overall. We also consider performance {{as a function of}} interference gain and show that complete spectral overlap is a strongly suboptimal solution over a wide range of gains. Overall...|$|E

50|$|Because {{the lines}} ran on or {{alongside}} roads {{it was decided}} to design the locomotives as tramway or 'box' locomotives (Kastenlokomotive).

International tourist arrival figures reached 1087 million in 2013 and 1133 million in 2014; of which 53 % and 54 % respectively accounted for air transport. The water on board aircraft is sourced from surface or ground water; piped {{to a central}} <b>filling</b> <b>point</b> and distributed to each aircraft by water service vehicles at the home base or at the destination airport. The {{purpose of this study}} was to ascertain the microbial, chemical (pH; Total and Free chlorine) and physical (temperature) quality of water from two aircraft, long- and short-haul, as well as from the original water source and the water service vehicle. A total of 154 water samples were collected and analysed. Long-haul flights were found to be significantly poorer in terms of microbial quality than short haul flights (p = 0. 015). Furthermore, correlation and regression analysis showed that the water service vehicle was a significant source of increased microbial load in aircraft. Microbial diversity was also demonstrated, with 37 bacterial species identified belonging to eight classes: γ-Proteobacteria; β-Proteobacteria; α-Proteobacteria; Bacilli; Actinobacteria; Flavobacteria; Sphingobacteria and Cytophaga; using phenotypic and 16 S rDNA sequence-based analysis.

An additional question surrounds {{the purpose of the}} wall. The Marcomanni Wars around 170 AD have been suggested as the reason, as has the invasion by the Alemanni in the 3rd century AD, but others have suggested that the walls were built primarily to defend the city against flooding or landslides - a not impossible reason if the industry carried on in the town led to extensive deforestation of the surrounding hills. A final suggestion is that the wall and gate were originally built for show, but hastily extended and improved to withstand the Alemanni.|$|R
40|$|During the {{delivery}} of unleaded petrol to a Snax service station on the Southend Arterial Road a small fire occurred in the manhole chamber containing the underground offset fill pipes. The manhole involved has four fill pipes and is constructed from GRP with a metal frame at the top. The pipes are plastic but have a metal transition fitting for connection to the tanker hose. When not in use the fittings have an aluminium cap with an o-ring seal in place. It is understood that {{the delivery}} driver had two hoses connected to the offset <b>fill</b> <b>points</b> and was delivering the product. One delivery had finished and he opened up the cap of the next <b>fill</b> <b>point</b> to commence delivery to that tank. He then went to place the cap on the pipe of the tank {{to which he had}} completed the first delivery when the ignition occurred. The fire was quickly extinguished and no one was hurt. Initially it was suspected that the probable cause of the ignition was static electricity igniting an uncommonly high concentration of petrol vapour. This is not an unreasonable assumption since the metal termination on the plastic pipe was ungrounded. In order for an ignition to occur at this point however there must be an electrostatic discharge between the cap and the termination fitting of sufficient energy to exceed the minimum ignition energy of the vapour mixture. Normally the caps made from aluminium are connected to the termination fitting by means of a short length of chain but in this case the chain was broken and consequently there was no electrical continuity between the fitting and the cap. It follows that electrostatic ignition would be reliant on either the fitting to be raised to high potential or the cap/delivery driver being raised to high potential...|$|R
