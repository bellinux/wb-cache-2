Mr. Davies, an innovator in education, founded five successful colleges including the internationally renowned Class Afloat.

[...] 2004 WIHA forms the International Practise Team, playing an exhibition and tournament schedule and training every day alongside the Lions.Both groups (International and Lions) are approximately the same age, the same skill/talent level and all practices are together (on and off ice). The International Practise Team players demonstrate clearly that they have developed in all aspects of the game faster than the Lions. This accelerated progress is attributed to the higher ratio of practice to games.As well, in games, the International players are all given equal ice time, as it is believed that this will result in the best individual development (long-term objectives) as well as a unique team experience. The Lions’ coaching staff, on the other hand, gives ice time to the players they believe can help the team win the game (short-term objectives).Although the International Practise Team is a midget-aged team, they defeat one of the top Quebec Junior AAA teams (Champlain Cougars) 3-2 at the end of the year.
