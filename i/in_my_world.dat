She described the tour as [...] "characteristically theatrical spectacle" [...] and would include songs from her whole career. However, picking the set list was hard since the singer wanted to perform the Rebel Heart songs {{as well as her}} previous discography, in order to satisfy all her fans. She found the task challenging since [...] "thematically the songs—the old and the new—they have to go together; sonically they have to go together." [...] The romantic and party theme of the show was an expansion of the name Rebel Heart, representing a journey with her personal statements and opinions. Love and romance were listed as the central theme of the show, with Madonna wanting the audience to feel inspired once they watch it. Along with it, she juxtaposed opposite ideas of sexuality and religion, saying that [...] "I'm very immersed in [...] not supposed to go together, but <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>world</b> it goes together". Inspirations for Rebel Heart Tour also came from shows like Cirque du Soleil and the Chinese New Year, as well as films like 300 and Grease. Jamie King esd the creative director for the show, while Megan Lawson and Jason Young choreographed the 20 dancers through intricate acrobatic dance steps. According to Madonna, since she started out as a dancer, for the tour she tried to find [...] "unique and original dancers to work with" [...] and create content and dance-forms that would inspire the audience.|$|E
