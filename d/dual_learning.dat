40|$|Background: The {{transition}} from preclinical to clinical training {{is perceived as}} stressful with a high workload being the main difficulty. To ease this transition, we implemented a <b>dual</b> <b>learning</b> year, where just-in-time skills training and clerkships alternated. Aims: To {{examine the effect of}} the <b>dual</b> <b>learning</b> year on students' stress and perceptions of workload and skills level, and to compare these data with a baseline measurement from a curriculum in which skills training was provided in advance of clerkships. Method: During the first Master year, students completed four rotations in which 5 weeks of skills training and 5 -week clerkships alternated. In the second clerkship week of each rotation, students (n = 476) completed questionnaires measuring their experienced workload, perceived skills level and stress. Analysis of variance was used for trend analysis and to determine differences with the baseline measurement (n 83). Results: During the <b>dual</b> <b>learning</b> year, 'experienced workload' decreased (F(1, 471) = 9. 408, p < 50. 01), 'perceived skills level' increased (F(1, 471) = 94. 202, p < 0. 001) and stress decreased (F(1, 471) = 3. 309, p < 0. 10). 'Experienced workload' was lower (F(5, 553) = 7. 599, p < 0. 001) and 'perceived skills level' was comparable to the baseline measurement. Conclusions: Compared to the baseline measurement and the results of earlier studies on transition difficulties, alternating just-in-time skills training and clerkships seem to ease the {{transition from}} preclinical to clinical training...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{research}} in machine learning and neural computation assumes that the teacher gives the correct answers to the learning algorithm. However, in many cases this assumption is doubtful, since dierent sorts of noise may disable the learner from getting the correct answers all the time. The noise could be caused by noisy communication, human errors, measuring equipment and many other causes. In some cases, problems which are eÆciently learnable without noise, become hard to learn when noise is introduced [3]. Partial answers to the noisy learning problem are known for speci c classes, ([11]), but in general, no simple parameters are known which distinguish between classes that are learnable {{in the presence of}} noise and those which become hard to learn.

40|$|This paper reviews {{research}} findings on <b>dual</b> language <b>learning</b> in preschool children. By <b>dual</b> language <b>learning,</b> I mean {{the acquisition of}} 2, or more, languages during the preschool years – prior to age 5. <b>Dual</b> language <b>learning</b> in the preschool years can occur simultaneously, as for example when parents regularly use two languages with their child from birth; or, it can occur successively, for example when children are exposed to and speak only one language at home during the first {{one or two years}} of life and then attend daycare or preschool programs in which another language is used. It is important to distinguish between these two forms of language learning because there may be differences with respect to their patterns and rates of development and possibly even the ultimate level of proficiency in the second language. However, it is not always easy to distinguish between simultaneous and successive <b>dual</b> language <b>learning.</b> First, we do not have an empirically-determined age {{that can be used to}} distinguish between simultaneous versus successive <b>dual</b> language <b>learning</b> because, at present, we do not have solid evidence concerning the precise ways in which these two forms of learning differ although we know that older second language learners (`adolescents and adults) differ from simultaneous bilinguals. Second, some children’s exposure to and acquisition of two languages during the preschool years may not fit neatly into either of these categories; for example, a child who speaks only Spanish at home during the first two years of life and has periodic but limited and passive exposure to English through playmates or TV and then begins to attend a preschool program at age 2 or higher where the child actively begins to need and use the language for interpersonal communication...|$|R
40|$|Many {{supervised}} learning tasks are emerged in dual forms, e. g., English-to-French translation vs. French-to-English translation, speech recognition vs. text to speech, and image classification vs. image generation.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on student teachers’ {{self-regulated}} learning in a <b>dual</b> <b>learning</b> programme, in which learning in practice and at university are combined. These programmes, especially one-year post-graduate teacher education programmes only form a very time-limited intervention in the professional development of a teacher. Therefore, it is extremely important that these programmes support the development of student teachers’ conceptions and skills necessary for their further professional development as a teacher. The quality of student teachers’ learning depends for a significant part {{on the ability to}} control and steer their learning. Currently, detailed descriptions of how and to what extent student teachers regulate their learning to teach, as well as how it develops throughout a <b>dual</b> <b>learning</b> programme are lacking. Therefore, the main research question of this dissertation was: What is the nature and development of student teachers’ self-regulated learning in a <b>dual</b> <b>learning</b> programme? To answer this research question, two empirical studies have been carried out. In the first study, student teachers’ regulation activities and their learning conceptions were examined with an open question log. The results showed that the relations among the various regulation activities could be described by an underlying structure of two dimensions: passive versus active regulation of learning and prospective versus retrospective regulation of learning. Active regulation dominated in practice schools, passive regulation at the university. Most student teachers showed multiple types of regulation while learning in a <b>dual</b> <b>learning</b> programme, and almost all student teachers showed at least once within their six learning experiences an active way of regulating their learning. Furthermore, the relation between student teachers’ learning conception and regulation pattern {{turned out to be more}} complex than has been suggested by academic learning theories. The large variety in regulation of learning within student teachers, showed that exploring one learning experience is not enough to give a valid estimation of student teachers’ regulation of learning. To be able to collect longitudinal data of multiple learning experiences in a larger sample, a structured log, called Learning Report, was developed based on the descriptions from the answers on the open questions from the first study. This instrument was used in the second study to describe student teachers’ development in self-regulated learning throughout a <b>dual</b> <b>learning</b> programme. A longitudinal design with three measurement occasions was adopted in this study, in which 81 (90 %) student teachers from two tracks of one dual teacher education programme participated. Results showed that student teachers became more passive in their regulation throughout the programme. In terms of learning orientations, only one third of the student teachers changed in the direction of the desired independent meaning-oriented way of learning, while the others changed away from it or kept the same orientation over time. Also differences between the job-track and intern-track of the programme in learning orientations were found, in favour of the job-track. The results show that more specific interventions need to be developed to increase student teachers’ conceptions and skills to become a self-regulated lifelong learning teacher...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades {{research}} into the notion of empowerment has been focused on the three primary dimensions of process, outcomes and environment within the contexts of the individual, community groups and business organisations. As a psychological attribute, empowerment at the individual level has been investigated significantly by such theorists as Rappaport (1995) and Zimmerman (2000). However, studies in this field neglect deep understanding of the reality of the individual's experiences of the empowerment process. Definitions within the literature refer to empowerment as being a process which occurs over time for the individual who is personally challenged to achieve power and control within his/her own life context by the application and reflection of learning new knowledge and skills. The purpose of this investigative case study is to examine the reality of the empowerment process as it occurs in the individual lives of a group of women who have actively participated in the learning environment of an investment club over a 2 year period in Brisbane. The three dimensions of empowerment support the structure of the study with the findings evidencing 'authentic empowerment' is achieved when the individual seeks to operate within the <b>dual</b> <b>learning</b> environments of the supportive group as well as the solo learning environment.

Three different notions of monotonicity are considered. Each of them reflects an alternative formalization of the requirement that the learner has to produce better and better generalizations when fed more and more data on the concept to be learned. Strong-monotonicity absolutely requires that only better and better generalizations be produced. Monotonic learning reflects the demand that for any two guesses the one output later has to be, with respect to the target language, at least as good as the earlier one. Weak-monotonicity is the analogue in learning theory of cumulativity. The corresponding three versions of dual monotonicity describe the requirement that the inference device only produces specializations that fit the target language better and better. <b>Dual</b> strong-monotonic <b>learning</b> generates a chain of shrinking specializations converging to the target language.

In the final part of the dissertation the perceived instructiveness of feedback given during clerkships was analysed and the faculty’s experiences with providing feedback by means of a digital pen were described. The instructiveness of feedback was positively influenced by the observation of students’ behaviour by the supervisor.

In this way, the manipulation can be operated efficiently with modest pixel modification. The framework of our approach is based on the Generative Adversarial Network.

The study further investigated the effect of the CLDSLM and DSLM methods on performance in conceptual understanding and scientific reasoning among students with different motivation levels. A quasi-experimental method with the 3 x 2 Factorial Design was applied in the study. The sample consisted of 240 stu¬dents in six (form four) classes selected from three different schools, i. e. two classes from each school, with students randomly selected and assigned to the treatment groups. The results showed that students in the CLDSLM group outperformed their counterparts in the DSLM group—who, in turn, significantly outperformed other students in the traditional instructional method (T) group in scientific reasoning and conceptual understanding. Also, high-motivation (HM) students in the CLDSLM group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the T groups in conceptual understanding and scientific reasoning. Furthermore, HM students in the CLDSLM group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the DSLM group in scientific reasoning but did not significantly outperform their counterparts on conceptual understanding. Also, the DSLM instructional method has significant positive effects on highly motivated students’ (a) conceptual understanding and (b) scientific reason¬ing. The results also showed that LM students in the CLDSLM group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the DSLM group and (T) method group in scientific reasoning and conceptual understanding.
