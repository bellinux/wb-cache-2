5|$|Despite {{reports that}} a {{prototype}} began taxiing tests on 30 June 1948, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> no prototype was actually built and that only manufacturing of the tailplane may have begun.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the common}} {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later {{evolved into a}} swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between {{the second and third}} funnels at or just below the surface.|$|E
50|$|So, it <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> pituri <b>is</b> not one {{substance}} and the term {{relates to the}} chewing of the leaves of various plants including Duboisia hopwoodii {{and more than one}} species of the native tobacco genus Nicotiana.|$|R

'It <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{he had the}} {{capacity}} and inclination to learn, {{that he was a}} proper subject for instruction, and needed only persevering attention. I therefore put him {{in the hands of an}} intelligent teacher, nothing doubting of his rapid progress.' ...|$|R
50|$|On 27 November 1987, Tomba scored {{his first}} World Cup victory, in a slalom at Sestriere, Italy. Two {{days later he}} won the giant slalom, beating his idol, Ingemar Stenmark. It <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Tomba <b>was</b> {{a force to be}} {{reckoned}} with within the alpine skiing world.|$|R
25|$|The {{history and}} {{identity}} of Tell Arbid have been {{emerging as the}} result of recent excavations. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the most prosperous period for the ancient Arbid was the IIIrd millennium B.C.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the term}} prostate-{{specific}} antigen is a misnomer: {{it is an}} antigen but is not specific to the prostate. Although present in large amounts in prostatic tissue and semen, it has been detected in other body fluids and tissues.|$|E
25|$|In Capitalism and Slavery, Eric Williams {{argued that}} the declining economies of the British West Indies led to the {{abolition}} of the slave trade and of slavery. More recent research has rejected this conclusion; it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the colonies of the British Caribbean profited considerably during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5000|$|On 11 July 1944, Roger Mais published, [...] "Now we Know", a {{stinging}} denunciation of British colonialism in Public Opinion, {{in which he}} explained <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> World War 2 was not a fight for freedom but a war to preserve imperial privilege and exploitation: ...|$|R
60|$|Douglas, without replying, {{called a}} cab. Marmaduke's loud {{conversation}} was irksome in the street, and it <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> unusually excited. At the museum they alighted, and {{passed through the}} courts into the grill-room, where they sat down together at a vacant table, and ordered luncheon.|$|R
50|$|It is {{revealed}} that Cogliostro was born as Cain, the first murderer, {{and since the}} beginning he wanted to rule Hell rather than serve it. It <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the only reason Cogliostro helped Spawn was to enable him to gain the throne of Hell, making him the new ruler.|$|R
25|$|Bilateral {{oophorectomy}} {{has been}} traditionally {{done in the}} belief that the benefit of preventing ovarian cancer would outweigh the risks associated with removal of ovaries. However, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> prophylactic oophorectomy without a reasonable medical indication decreases long-term survival rates substantially and has deleterious long-term effects on health and well-being even in post-menopausal women.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} {{of life on}} Mars is a subject of significant interest to astrobiology due to the planet's proximity and similarities to Earth. To date no proof has been found of past or present life on Mars. However, cumulative evidence <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> during the ancient Noachian time period, the surface environment of Mars had liquid water {{and may have been}} habitable for microorganisms. The existence of habitable conditions does not necessarily indicate the presence of life.|$|E
25|$|Cook did {{not lose}} a single man to scurvy, and his report came down in favour of malt and wort, {{although}} it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the reason for the}} health of his crews on this and other voyages was Cook's regime of shipboard cleanliness, enforced by strict discipline, as well as frequent replenishment of fresh food and green stuffs. Another rule implemented by Cook was his prohibition of the consumption of salt fat skimmed from the ship's copper boiling pans, then a common practice in the Navy. In contact with air the copper formed compounds that prevented the absorption of vitamins by the intestines.|$|E
50|$|Richardson {{was born}} at Capenhurst Hall in Cheshire. He was educated in England and France. His father, Richard, {{died when he was}} six. Despite an early {{sporting}} talent for cricket, it <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he would need to make his own living and so, encouraged by his mother, he followed his other talent for engineering.|$|R
25|$|At Orgreave {{the union}} failed {{to stop the}} {{movement}} of lorries. Furthermore, the violence was costing it public support. A Gallup poll showed 79% disapproval of NUM methods. It <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the government had the equipment, the forces, the organization, {{and the will to}} prevail against pickets. The number of miners at work grew to 53,000 by late June.|$|R
40|$|The {{acquired}} {{doses of}} Antarctic meteorites for dating of terrestrial ages were {{measured by the}} thermoluminescence (TL) intensity of fusion crust. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a significant correlation between the acquired dose and terrestrial age, which was previously measured by cosmogenic radionuclide abundance. Also, the ^ Cl method by accelerator mass spectrometry seems to provide a large terrestrial age occasionally...|$|R
25|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1873 {{there has been}} considerable debate about their origin. Three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and osteoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. After years of controversy it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> these cells develop from the self fusion of macrophages. It was {{in the beginning of}} 1980 that the monocyte phagocytic system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts. Osteoclast formation requires the presence of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) and M-CSF (Macrophage colony-stimulating factor). These membrane-bound proteins are produced by neighbouring stromal cells and osteoblasts, thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast precursors.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau {{insisted that}} the Big Four (United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China) {{participate}} in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, but their goal was frustrated when the Soviet Union would not join the IMF. In the past, {{the reasons why the}} Soviet Union chose not to subscribe to the articles by December 1945 {{have been the subject of}} speculation. But since the release of relevant Soviet archives, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Soviet calculation was based on the behavior of the parties that had actually expressed their assent to the Bretton Woods Agreements. The extended debates about ratification that had taken place both in the UK and the U.S. were read in Moscow as evidence of the quick disintegration of the wartime alliance.|$|E
500|$|Before {{recognition}} of E. cinnabarina as a species, E. lewisii was interpreted {{to be the}} sister of E. cardinalis. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> E. cinnabarina and E. cardinalis are sister species and that E. lewisii and E. erubescens are sister species. [...] In the hypothesized phylogeny, the 'cinnabarina/cardinalis' pair is sister to the 'lewisii/erubescens' pair.|$|E
50|$|Under Schoonees’s {{guidance}} {{the first}} part of the dictionary (A—C) was published in 1951, the second part (D—F) in 1955 and the third part (G) in 1957. It <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> dictionary could progress, but at the same it was equally <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> in spite of a sizeable expansion of the editorial team it would prove impossible to complete such a comprehensive work within a couple of years.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Tāufaʻāhau <b>was</b> very {{ambitious and}} {{wanted more than}} only Haʻapai. To stop him, in 1827, the chiefs of Tongatapu made Laufilitonga the Tuʻi Tonga, and made Tāufa's uncle Aleamotuʻa a Tuʻi Kanokupolu, {{preventing}} an island invasion, as fighting against family members {{was seen as a}} Tongan disgrace. In spite of this, at his baptism in 1831, Tāufa declared himself King George of Tonga.|$|R
5000|$|On November 30, the State Board of Elections {{ordered a}} recount of the Durham County votes. [...] The recount {{was to be}} {{completed}} by 7 p.m. on December 5. However, by that morning, early results showed no change in the tally. Bowing to the inevitable, McCrory announced on his campaign's YouTube channel that he was conceding the race to Cooper, saying <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the majority of our citizens had spoken." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1998, {{following}} large-scale frog {{deaths in}} Australia and Central America, research teams in both areas {{came up with}} identical results: a previously undescribed species of pathogenic fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> many recent extinctions of amphibians in Australia and the Americas are linked to this fungus. [...] This fungus belongs to a family of saprobes known as chytrids that are not generally pathogenic.|$|E
2500|$|The two-component vector ξ is {{acted upon}} by SL(2,C) {{in a manner}} {{compatible}} with (...) [...] It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the kernel of the representation of SL(2,C) on hermitian matrices is {±I}.|$|E
2500|$|... 1957 – Tigran Shmaonov {{reports that}} [...] "the {{absolute}} effective {{temperature of the}} radioemission background ... is 4±3K". It is noted that the [...] "measurements showed that radiation intensity was independent of either time or direction of observation ... it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Shmaonov did observe {{the cosmic microwave background}} at a wavelength of 3.2cm" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 brought the United States into the war, but with eight battleships sunk or damaged by air attack. On 10 December 1941 HMS Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser HMS Repulse were sunk by {{land-based}} torpedo bombers northeast of Singapore. It <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> surface ships could not operate near enemy aircraft in daylight without air cover; most surface actions of 1942-43 were fought at night as a result. Generally, both sides avoided risking their battleships until the desperate Japanese attack at Leyte Gulf in 1944.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Admiral Graf Spee was {{entering}} the River Plate estuary. Since the estuary had sandbanks, Harwood ordered the Achilles to shadow the Graf Spee while Ajax would cover {{any attempt to}} double back through a different channel. The sun set at 20:48, with Admiral Graf Spee silhouetted against the sun. Achilles had again closed the range and Admiral Graf Spee opened fire, forcing Achilles to turn away. During the battle, a total of 108 men had been killed on both sides, including 36 on Admiral Graf Spee.|$|R
50|$|Soon afterward, local tribes {{including}} the Grebo and the Kru attacked the State of Maryland {{in retaliation for}} its disruption of the slave trade. Unable to maintain its own defense, Maryland appealed to Liberia, its more powerful neighbor, for help. President Roberts sent military assistance, and an alliance of Marylanders and Liberian militia troops successfully repelled the local tribesmen. However, it <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Republic of Maryland could not survive as an independent state, and on March 18, 1857 Maryland was annexed by Liberia, becoming known henceforth as Maryland County.|$|R
2500|$|On June 29, 2012, the Supreme Court {{declined}} an FCC appeal. The FCC {{was attempting}} to reinstate the government's fine of US$550,000 which was overturned by the lower court based on FCC rules that were {{in place at the}} time of the broadcast, which were later changed. Chief Justice John Roberts said [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the brevity of an indecent broadcast – be it word or image – cannot immunize it from FCC censure...Any future 'wardrobe malfunctions' will not be protected on the ground relied on by the court below." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 January 2013, Giving Victims a Voice, {{a report}} into {{allegations}} of sexual abuse made against Jimmy Savile under Operation Yewtree by the Metropolitan Police Service and the NSPCC was published under the logo of the Crown Prosecution Service. Among its conclusions are that [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Savile was hiding in plain sight and using his celebrity status and fundraising activity to gain uncontrolled access to vulnerable people across six decades. For {{a variety of reasons}} the vast majority of his victims did not feel they could speak out and it's apparent that some of the small number who did had their accounts dismissed by those in authority including parents and carers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September, Rawlinson and Bacon became pessimistic and Haig {{postponed}} {{the operation}} again but {{told them to}} be ready for the second week of October. The 42nd Division moved from Ypres, relieved the 66th Division in late September and found that the area was under frequent German artillery-fire, bombing and gas attacks. The coastal sector was also beneath the flight path of German Gotha bombers attacking Dunkirk, which was bombed on twenty-three nights in September. Hopes rose after the Battle of Broodseinde (4 October) and again after the Battle of Poelcappelle (9 October), although the coastal operation could not start {{before the end of the}} month. After the First Battle of Passchendaele (12 October), Hush was cancelled; on 14 October, Rawlinson wrote, [...] "...things have not been running at all smoothly – it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> we shall do nothing on the coast here". The 1st Division left the camp at Le Clipon on 21 October and the rest of the Fourth Army followed on 3 November. On 23 April 1918, the Dover Patrol raided Zeebrugge and sank block ships in the canal entrance, to stop U-boats leaving port. The Belgian Army and the British Second Army began the Fifth Battle of Ypres on 28 September 1918 and on 17 October, Ostend was captured.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the canoe was {{approaching}} the passage in the reef, and the whole party hastened to the beach, where they held a hasty council of war, for it <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the canoe <b>was</b> {{one of the largest}} size-- capable of holding nearly a hundred men--and that it was quite full of naked savages. In a few words the captain explained to the men the character of the islanders, as ascertained by himself on previous voyages, and showed how hopeless would be their case if {{they turned out to be}} heathens.|$|R
6000|$|... "I overheard this Percy Paget say {{how he had}} put a valise in {{your yard}} in order to throw {{suspicion}} on you. I knew of that valise being found. You <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>cleared</b> on <b>that</b> point." ...|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear,</b> however, <b>that</b> {{the courts}} have in mind, a right to control only in principle. The {{employer}} not choosing to exercise that right does not render the contract something other than one of employment.|$|R
