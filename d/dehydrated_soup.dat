500|$|The {{popularity}} of chips and dip significantly {{increased in the}} United States during the 1950s, beginning circa 1954, due to changes in styles of entertaining in the suburbs and also due to a Lipton advertising campaign based upon using Lipton's instant <b>dehydrated</b> onion <b>soup</b> mix to prepare dip. The advertising campaign occurred {{on television and in}} supermarket display advertising, and promoted mixing the soup mix with sour cream or cream cheese to create a dip, to be served with potato chips or crudités. This dip began to be called California Dip. The advertising campaign realized significant success, and new, similar dip products were quickly developed thereafter. During this time, unique platters designed for chips and dip service were created that allowed for the containment of several types of chips, and service variations were devised that included serving the dip in a bread bowl or hollowed-out fruit.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare three methods for the {{detection}} and quantification of lupine as an allergen in food. The methods {{that were used in}} this work were the direct method: ELISA and the indirect methods: end-point PCR and real-time PCR. We examined the detection limit (the sensitivity with which we can detect the presence of the allergen in a sample) and the reliability for performing an analysis. We used 17 samples of plant species from a processing plant for <b>dehydrated</b> <b>soups</b> production and lupine samples from lupine processing companies. Its practical use is wide and it is used mainly in the bakery industry, in the manufacture of confectionery, pasta, sauces, as a substitute for soy and also in the production of gluten-free food, because it does not contain gluten. Lupine, however, is also included in the list of 14  allergenic substances, which in accordance with the EU legislation must be listed on food labels. The high risk group, which suffers from primary sensitization or cross-reaction with peanuts, are allergic patients. In the EU, people who are allergic to peanuts range from 0. 7 to 1. 5 %. In experiment 1, we detected the presence of lupine using primers for the detection of α- and δ-conglutine in the samples, using the end-point PCR method and the detection limit of this reaction was at the level of 100 ppm. For the vizualization of the DNA fragments, we used a  2 % agarose gel and UV visualizer. In experiment 2 we detected lupine using the TaqMan real-time PCR reaction and primers for the detection of α and δ-conglutine at the level of 10 ppm of lupine in sample. The CP values of lupine using primers for the detection of α-conglutine was 24. 85 ± 0. 12 and the reliability equation was R 2 = 0. 9767. The CP lupine values using primers for the detection of δ-conglutine was 22. 52 ± 0. 17 and the reliability equation was R 2 = 0. 9925. In experiment 3, we used a sandwich ELISA method for the detection of lupine and the detection limit was within the range of 2 - 30 ppm and the reliability of the method according to the reliability equation was R 2 = 0. 9975. The high sensitivity and equation of reliability justify the use of these methods for the detection and quantification of lupine in practice. The most sensitive indirect method for the detection of lupine in our study was the method of real-time TaqMan PCR with a detection limit  10   000 - 10 ppm of lupine. The most sensitive direct methot was ELISA with detection limit 2 - 30 ppm of lupine. </span...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of beverages containing various concentrations of sodium on fluid balance in children during exercise in a thermoneutral environment (22 °C). Hypotheses were that the ingestion of chicken noodle soup prior to exercise would cause: (1) increases in ad libitum drinking throughout exercise, (2) increases in urine osmolalities, and (3) decreases in urine volumes. Forty-five minutes after 12 children ingested water (0 mmol/L Na+), a carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage (16 mmol/L Na+), condensed chicken noodle soup (167 mmol/L Na+), or <b>dehydrated</b> chicken noodle <b>soup</b> (148 mmol/L Na +) the subjects completed 4 bouts of cycling at ~ 55 % VO 2 peak for 20 minutes followed by 10 minute rests. Urine volumes were greater in water and carbohydrate-electrolyte trials. Urine osmolalities were greater in soup trials. Ingestion of chicken noodle soup prior to exercise-induced dehydration led to decreases in urine volumes and increases in urine osmolality, suggesting tendencies of improved water retention...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Bacillus subtilis α-amylase {{was used}} to hydrolyze starch from peeled and whole {{potatoes}} (Solanum tuberosum). Effect of gelatinization temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, temperature of hydrolysis and presence of calcium ions were investigated. Optimum conditions for hydrolysis were when α-amylase levels were 0. 3 percent of the starch concentration {{in the presence of}} 400 ppm calcium at pH 7. 0 and 80 °C for 2 hr. After centrifugation to remove residual material, the supernatants were adjusted to pH 5. 0 to 5. 5 with 30 percent sulfuric acid and heated at 100 °C for 10 min to inactivate α-amylase. Treatment with four percent activated charcoal decolorized the clear hydrolysate before the product was spray dried. The dried product was a light yellow powder, slightly sweet, relatively bland in taste and readily soluble in water. Dried potato hydrolysate made from peeled potatoes had a dextrose equivalent of 30 and contained 85 percent carbohydrates, 8. 4 percent protein and 5. 5 percent ash; while the hydrolysate from whole potatoes had a dextrose equivalent of 26 and contained 86 percent carbohydrates, 8. 4 percent protein and 6. 0 percent ash. The composition of the carbohydrates of the two hydrolysates were similar except the hydrolysate from peeled contained a higher concentration of glucose and lower concentration of saccharides with a degree of polymerization greater than four. At concentrations of greater than 40 percent, the potato hydrolysate made from whole potatoes did not show as high a viscosity as commercial corn syrup solids with a dextrose equivalent of 24; the potato hydrolysate adsorbed twice as much moisture as the commercial corn syrup solids at 75 percent relative humidity at 23 °C for 30 days. Substitution of sucrose with whole potato hydrolysate in chocolate milk revealed that substitution of two parts of sucrose by two parts of potato hydrolysate could be used with a slight loss of desirability. Fifty and one hundred percent addition of whole potato hydrolysate to a commercial <b>dehydrated</b> vegetable <b>soup</b> mix showed no decrease in the desirability of the product. This work has shown that a useful potato hydrolysate containing significant amounts of protein can be prepared from either peeled or whole potatoes...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} assessment between {{the use of}} the Argentine anchoita (Engraulis anchoita) for reduction fisheries and human food and/or value-added products is the focus of this case study. General biological aspects, spatial and seasonal distribution and available biomass estimates of the target species are examined. Currently applied and promising potential methods of processing anchoita in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay are described and compared in terms of economic and nutritional impact. Engraulis anchoita is a small pelagic fish that occurs in the South West Atlantic Ocean (SWAO) with Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina sharing the so-called anchoita "Bonaerense" stock. Annual abundance estimates vary between 600 000 tonnes and 4. 5 million tonnes, with significant regional and yearly variations in biomass estimates along the shelves of the three countries. Fishing takes place predominantly between July and November. Catches in 2006 were reported to be around 30 000 tonnes in Argentina and 17 000 tonnes in Uruguay. It is estimated that up to 135 000 tonnes of anchoita could be sustainably exploited along the southern Brazilian coast. However, despite its abundance, this species is not fished there. The three countries exhibit different approaches to the utilization of E. anchoita. Argentina is the pioneer in the exploitation and manufacture of anchoita and the main manufacturer of different kinds of products for human consumption directed to both the domestic and export markets. More than 80 percent of this production is salted fish and the remainder is prepared as value-added food. In 2005, Argentine exported anchoitabased products at a value of US$ 26 million. At present, Uruguay processes its anchoita catch exclusively as fishmeal for export, although the preparation of products for human consumption is planned for the near future. Due to its unexploited fishery resources as well as considerable demand, Brazil has great potential for manufacturing new products that could contribute to both the domestic and export markets. Trial products have been developed that could address food security and poverty alleviation in the region and elsewhere. Alternative potential uses for new products from anchoita were assessed on the basis of prototypes developed in Brazil. It is concluded that novel products such as <b>dehydrated</b> risotto, <b>soup</b> and sausage have considerable strategic marketing value. An assessment of {{the costs and benefits of}} the production of fishmeal and new products for human consumption in Brazil revealed that the transformation of anchoita for human consumption results in significantly higher direct positive impacts on poverty and food security. Governmental social programmes supporting school meals and hospital diets are a promising entry point for the introduction of novel products to nutritionally challenged parts of society. The search for common solutions for improved utilization of anchoita should evolve from a strong technical-scientific interaction and mutual collaboration among the governments of the three countries.
