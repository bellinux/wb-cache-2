40|$|Altitude-test-chamber {{investigation}} of effects of flame-holder blocked area and <b>gutter</b> <b>width</b> on performance of 28 -inch diameter ram jet at simulated flight Mach number of 2. 0 for altitudes from 40, 000 to 55, 000 feet {{was conducted at}} NACA Lewis laboratory. Ten flame holders investigated covered gutter widths from 1. 00 to 2. 50 inches and blocked areas from 40. 5 to 62. 0 percent of combustion-chamber area. <b>Gutter</b> <b>width</b> did not appreciably affect combustion efficiency. Increase in blocked area from 40 to 62 percent resulted in 5 - to 10 -percent increase in combustion efficiency. Increasing <b>gutter</b> <b>width</b> resulted in improvement in fuel-air-ratio operating range...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{altitude}} test-chamber investigation {{of the effects of}} a number of design changes and operating conditions on altitude peformance of a 28 -inch diameter ram jet engine are presented. Most of the investigation was for a simulated flight Mach number of 2. 0 above the tropopause. Fuel-air distribution, <b>gutter</b> <b>width,</b> the presence of a pilot flame, cimbustion-chamber-inlet temperature, and exhaust-nozzle throat area were found to have significant effects on limits of combustion. Combustion efficiency increased with increasing combustion-chamber-inlet temperature and was adversely affected by an increase in the exhaust-nozzld area. Similiar lean limits of combustion were obtained for both Diesel fuel and normal heptane, but combustion efficiences obtained with Diesel fuel were lower than those obtained with normal heptane...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a full-scale experimental {{investigation into the}} effects of box gutter geometry on the open channel flow conditions above siphonic roofwater outlets. In particular, the effects of channel width (300, 400, 480 and 600 mm) and length (14. 86 and 32. 00 m) were investigated through measurements of flow rate, water depth and longitudinal velocity in the box gutter. The experimental results showed that for the same outlet flow rate, the depth {{of water in the}} gutter varied by up to 211 % for the two different gutter lengths tested. Generally, the greatest water depths for the different flow rates were recorded in the 400 -mm wide gutter and the lowest water depths were recorded in the 300 -mm wide gutter. It was also found that the maximum flow rate through the single 110 -mm diameter outlet varied depending on the width of the gutter. Practical application: The depth of water in the open channel box gutters above the outlets of siphonic drainage systems is an important design variable and it is imperative to be able to accurately estimate these water depths during all phases of operation to reduce flood damage risk. This research study has found that for the same flow rate, varying the length of gutter on either side of a siphonic outlet strongly influences the depth of water along the gutter and above the outlet. The results suggest that there may be an optimum <b>gutter</b> <b>width</b> and length for which different siphonic outlets may perform more efficiently...|$|E
30|$|Road geometrics data such as {{width of}} the roadway in the subject direction, outside lane width, median width, {{sidewalk}} width, shoulder width, parking lane <b>width,</b> curb <b>width,</b> <b>gutter</b> pan <b>width,</b> and width of extra paving beyond outermost lane stripe were collected using a measuring tape. Information {{on the presence of}} curb, gutter pan, median, bicycle lane, and sidewalk facilities were collected using a 2 -point scale: 1  = yes and 0  = no. Commercial activities on roadside area were rated on a 3 -point scale: 1  = high, 0.5  = moderate and 0  = negligible. The quality of roadway surface was rated using a 5 -point scale that varies from 5 (excellent) to 1 (worst). Interruptions by unauthorized stoppages of intermittent public transits were rated on a 3 -point scale: 1  = high, 0.5  = moderate and 0  = negligible. The frequency of all driveways and frequency of driveways carrying a high volume of traffic (driveways/km) were also collected during this survey.|$|R
40|$|A Semi-Automatic Building Extraction system {{using two}} or more {{digitized}} overlapping aerial images has been enhanced by increased automation for the measurement of saddle-back-roof buildings, hip-roof buildings and boxes. All newly developed modules have been incorporated in the object oriented design of the system. The new methods consist of a ground-point and roof-top matching tool and a robust determination of shape parameters, like e. g. <b>gutter</b> length and <b>width.</b> The current performance of building extraction is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. We examine the increased efficiency using the automated tools, the success rate of individual modules and the overall success rate {{using a combination of}} methods. A methodology for quantitative comparison is tested on footprints of buildings from classical stereo measurements and from semi-automatic measurements. A qualitative comparison in 3 D of multiple measurements of complete buildings is performed on three different datasets. 1 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Guttering is {{the most}} common method for {{conveying}} rainwater from the capture surface (normally a roof) to storage. The cost of such gutters is a relatively small fraction of the total system cost (typically under 20 %) but guttering failure accounts for much loss in RWH system performance. The optimum gutter may be defined as that which minimises the system cost per litre of water captured. There are a series of gutter variables within the control of the installer, including: <b>gutter</b> shape, slope, <b>width</b> and position relative to the roof edge. This paper focuses on an analysis of the sizing and positioning of gutters, based on several sources, including rainfall data from the humid tropics and experiments undertaken by the DTU at the University of Warwick and in Sri Lanka. For domestic RWH applications, it was found that relatively small gutters (around 5 to 8 cm wide), if hung accurately, offer high performance. Typically an economically optimum gutter would intercept and convey only 90 - 95 % of roof run-off to the cistern. Indeed, it appears that gutters are often oversized in practice. The use of a dual slope can improve the performance of guttering. Having concluded the technical analysis, rules of thumb and tabulated recommendations are presented, suitable for application by rainwater harvesting practitioners...|$|R
