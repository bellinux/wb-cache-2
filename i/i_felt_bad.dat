6000|$|I {{went home}} to dinner at Mr. Jones', and they welcomed me very kindly, and Mrs. Jones kept my plate full all the time during dinner, so that I had no chance to empty it. She seemed to see that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>bad,</b> and thought plenty of pudding might help me. At any rate, I never felt so bad yet but I could eat a good dinner.

But I always did admire you, and you know it. Some them little things you used to get off in the old Free Press--well, I could see 't you was smart. And I liked you; and it kind o' hurt me when I thought you'd been makin' fun o' me to that woman. Well, I could see 't I was a dumned old fool, afterwards. And I always wanted to tell you so. And I always did hope that I should be able to offer you that money again, twice over, and get you to take it just to show that you didn't bear malice."

[...] Didn't that {{do as well as}} a regular prayer? For I felt a great many in my heart.

She gets prettier every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and I--well, I'm Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't and got mad. It lasted all day. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon. But I thought he'd come to it, for I was in the right. He didn't come, and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged each other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{positive}} reaction, Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 2/4 {{saying that the}} episode had a few good scenes but was hampered by excessive violence. [...] "The violence in this episode is unrelenting and largely unmotivated. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> for Mason. ... The torture scenes that follow are {{out of character for}} Damon and extreme enough to make even Dick Cheney uncomfortable. ... The violence wouldn’t bother me so much if it was 1) in character; 2) in service of good-storytelling; or 3) socially responsible. Damon is erratic but not a sadist." ...|$|E

During the 12th stage of the 1950 Tour de France, while he was wearing the yellow jersey, {{he was forced to}} retire from the race (together with all the other Italian riders) by Bartali, captain of the Italian team, who had been threatened and assaulted by some French supporters accusing him of causing Jean Robic's fall.

5000|$|I don't {{know how}} the word got out that I lived next door, {{but all of a}} sudden the phone started ringing and ringing.

I made that up. When he came out of the St. Peter Guest House, rigor mortis had set in to such an extent that his body was in a U shape.

5000|$|In early 1958, Davis {{entered a}} {{relationship}} with Frances Taylor, a dancer who he had first met in Los Angeles five years prior, and they married on December 21, 1960. The relationship involved numerous incidents of Davis' domestic violence towards Taylor. Davis later wrote, [...] "Every time I hit her, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> {{because a lot of}} it really wasn't her fault but had to do with me being temperamental and jealous". One reason for his behavior was that by early 1963, Davis had increased his abuse of alcohol and cocaine in an attempt to reduce the pain from his hip and joint pain and discomfort caused from his recent diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. He also experienced hallucinations, [...] "looking for this imaginary person" [...] in his home to the point of searching the house wielding a kitchen knife. About a week after the photograph for Davis' album E.S.P. (1965) was taken, Taylor left Davis for the last time. They remained separated until they officially divorced in February 1968.|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with many praising the opening sequence and ending. IGN's Matt Fowler, who gave a lukewarm {{review of the}} episode, said that though Beth's death was predictable, it [...] "felt like a big moment and it's always wrenching to see other characters react {{to the death of}} their loved ones. I liked Beth, but <b>I</b> still mostly <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> about her death because Daryl and Maggie (who seemed to have to be reminded this week that Beth being gone at all was a topic she should care about) <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> about it."

Bloated and disgusting like a pig.” [...] Moving to LA and her marriage to actress Madeleine Sami helped Ladyhawke sober up enough to make changes to her life and the recording of 'Wild Things' took place, {{with most of the}} songs written about her new wife.|$|R
50|$|The {{first time}} Spears saw the doll she was displeased with its looks. She {{asked that the}} doll be changed because she felt it had the {{appearance}} of a bulldog chewing a wasp. As Spears reasoned, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a bit <b>bad</b> about ordering changes but hey, it's my doll. Following the changes to the doll's face, the dolls sold out in the United States in December.

The Bears then had three {{straight}} losses, including their sole home loss of the season. They were able to get four more wins, improving to a 7-5 mark following the first losing season in Tedford's tenure as head coach. This was Cal's third Holiday Bowl, the most recent being in 2006, and their prior record was 1-1. Coincidentally they had faced Texas teams in all of their Holiday Bowl matchups, with Texas Tech in 2004 and Texas A&M in 2006. Notably, the 2004 appearance resulted after Texas head coach Mack Brown had lobbied for an invitation to the Rose Bowl over Cal. Tedford said the incident [...] "was a long time ago. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> for our team because I really felt like we deserved to be in the Rose Bowl that year, but we're in 2011 now and it is a whole different situation."

One of her patients Jane Avent (Felicity Price) loses her baby while Rachel is on duty and subsequently files a lawsuit against Rachel. When Rachel {{gave birth to a}} son named Harry, Mathews told TV Week that Rachel would begin to behave differently. Rachel feels [...] "completely overwhelmed" [...] and it was something she could not prepare for. While Tony is okay as he previously had children. However Jane begins to harass Rachel, Mathews said that Jane does not think it is fair that Rachel gets to keep her baby. She also stated that everyone is unsure that Rachel should have remained in work while heavily pregnant. As the storyline progresses, Rachel becomes more [...] "possessive and controlling" [...] over Harry and [...] "abuses" [...] Tony for not keeping her informed about him. Rachel shows a [...] "side" [...] of herself that no one has ever seen before. The lawsuit makes Rachel's anxiety worse and Mathews opined that Rachel and Tony's relationship turned bad because [...] "they couldn't be further apart" [...] while she goes through post-natal depression. Mathews stated [...] "For Rachel to be cranky and sad for so long was really hard. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> for Rachel and for the viewers constantly seeing me wailing!" ...|$|E
