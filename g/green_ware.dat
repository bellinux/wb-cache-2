We shall have the minister back here with the lawyer and all the family to read the will before you have done toasting yourself. Go and wake that girl; and then light the stove in the shed: you can't have your breakfast here. And mind you wash yourself, and make yourself fit to receive the company. (She punctuates these orders by going to the cupboard; unlocking it; and producing a decanter of wine, which has no doubt stood there untouched since the last state occasion in the family, and some glasses, which she sets on the table. Also two <b>green</b> <b>ware</b> plates, on one of which she puts a barmbrack with a knife beside it. On the other she shakes some biscuits out of a tin, putting back one or two, and counting the rest.)

50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>ware</b> or celadons were popular, both in China and in export markets, {{which became}} {{increasingly}} important during the period. Yue ware was succeeded by Northern Celadon {{and then in}} the south Longquan celadon. White and black wares were also important, especially in Cizhou ware, and there were polychrome types, but the finer types of ceramics, for the court and the literati, remained monochrome, relying on glaze effects and shape. A wide variety of styles evolved in various areas, and those that were successful were imitated in other areas. Important kiln sites and stoneware styles included Ru, Jun, Southern Song Guan or official ware, Jian and Jizhou. Whitish porcelain continued to be improved, and included the continuation of Ding ware and the arrival of the qingbai which would replace it.|$|E
50|$|In the {{production}} of bucchero sottile, {{the shape of the}} pot held pride of place, with surface decoration playing a supporting role. When decoration was used, it was usually limited to enhancing the profile of a chalice, a kantharos, or a kyathos with a row of crisply defined hook notches at the point of carination. The bowl of an oinochoe (pitcher) might be emphasized by closely spaced vertical lines incised into the soft clay before firing. Further decoration could be added before the <b>green</b> <b>ware</b> was loaded into the kiln by using a toothed wheel or a comb-like instrument to create rows of dots arranged in fan patterns. On later examples a roller with recessed reliefs was used to transfer figures of deities or even narratives {{to the surface of the}} vessel.|$|E

The human spirit moves through transitions that are similar to the ceramic process. We shift and twist to accommodate our daily struggles. We have tenuous fragile moments much like the bone dry state of clay before firing. We have moments of unbreakable confidence similar to when clay turns to stoneware after a firing. I keep these various stages in mind as I approach my most current body of work. I draw connections between my own states of being in relation to my work with clay. The act of using different materials and tools to carve out layers of the clay on the vessel mirrors the revelation of the inner self. Using all the states of clay in my installations; wet, leather hard, <b>green</b> <b>ware,</b> and fired, I treat the surface of the vessel as if it where my skin.

50|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} at {{the western}} Hafun site have yielded ceramics from ancient kingdoms in the Nile Valley, Near East, Persia and Mesopotamia, {{as well as some}} sherds of possible derivation from the Indian subcontinent. Among this ware is a late Ptolemaic lamp fragment, Parthian glazed sherds, and Hellenistic lagynos wares. Smith and Wright have dated the finds to sometime between the 1st century BCE and the early first century CE. Additionally, some ceramics affiliated with <b>green</b> glazed <b>ware</b> from Sohar on the Omani littoral have also been found in the area.

25|$|While the <b>green</b> glazed <b>ware</b> {{continues}} to be Atzompa's staple product, {{there has been some}} innovation in the pottery tradition here. In the 1970s, a local potter by the name of Dolores Porras gained notoriety when she went against convention and pioneered the production of multicolored glazed pottery. Porras taught herself how to paint on clay pieces, starting with red and white washes. Later she added blues, greens, grays and oranges. When she began to produce these pieces, she was considered to be crazy. However, her pieces began to sell and other potters began to imitate her work. Later on, she introduced the use of lead-free glazes. Today, her pieces are part of Atzompa's pottery traditions even though she herself is outsold by younger potters who produce cheaper and better wares.|$|R
25|$|Atzompa {{has been}} making pottery for at least 500 years. It is widely known for its {{traditional}} green glazed cookware and ornamental pieces. The glaze for the green pieces was originally lead based but that was changed in the 1990s due to health concerns. The <b>green</b> glazed <b>ware</b> is mostly formed into utilitarian items such as pots, cazuelas, jars, bowls and more. More recently, artisans in the town have been experimenting with various other styles of pottery, mostly decorative times {{in a variety of}} styles. One of these is called “pastillaje” where very small and fine pieces of clay are formed and pressed onto the main surface of the piece to create decoration. The town also has an outlet for its ware called the Casa de las Artesanias.|$|R

The Sangkhalok ware set to last between 18th-19th centuries, the production of Sangkhalok ware from the Sukhothai period. But has been promoting the product and expanding mass production in the Ayutthaya kingdom period. Sangkhalok ware production declined since the 23th century. The key reason is that the marketplace is changing need of Sangkhalok ware, the Chinese returned to manufacture porcelain blue - white, which became a popular trade and Ayutthaya can’t produce as to the demands of Westerners who have a political role in the region.|$|R

2500|$|The town of Patambán in the {{southwest}} of the lake area makes a <b>green</b> glaze <b>ware,</b> which is distinguished {{by the quality of}} the glaze and the fine clay used. Even the bottoms of the pieces are glazed and have designs. Most of the forms are for common use such as little mugs, pitchers plates and platters. Designs vary from geometric or linear designs to free form animals such as rabbits. They are in white slip appearing as a sharp green. [...] One form that is found both here and neighboring San José de Gracia is a water jar {{in the shape of a}} pineapple. The body is entirely covered in small conical lumps placed by hand. These jars range from one cup to five gallons in size. The lid is decorated with a representation of the spikey crown of the fruit. Most of these are also covered in Patambán's green glaze but a brown glaze version also exists. One other vessel this town makes along with Huantzio is a large-bellied water container with a small neck. These are not glazed in green but rather covered with a red slip and burnished. They are then decorated with black and white horizontal bands interspersed with rabbits, birds and flowers. Huanzito often uses a blue and green color scheme as well.|$|R
5000|$|The town of Santa María Atzompa {{is known}} for its jade green-glazed pottery, which has been made the same way for generations. The color comes from the lead {{monoxide}} glaze that is applied to it. Atzompa's pottery tradition prior to the Conquest is similar to other settlements in the area, but after the Spanish introduced glazing techniques the green variation was adopted and has changed little since. Up until the mid 20th century, the ware was popular enough to be shipped to all parts of Mexico and even to the United States. However, restrictions against lead containing pottery has since deflated this market and it is mostly sold only locally. Despite the development and introduction of lead-free glazes, [...] Atzompa continues to have some of the highest lead content in Mexico, found both in the wares and in the potters and other people who live there.While the <b>green</b> glazed <b>ware</b> continues to be Atzompa's staple product, there has been some innovation in the pottery tradition here.

50|$|There are {{excavated}} tradeware ceramics identified {{to be from}} China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma. Chinese <b>green</b> lead glaze <b>ware</b> sherds {{that are}} known to have originated from the Tang Period were dated from 13th-14th century, which was significantly younger than the time period of the Tang Dynasty. Melendres points out that Addis believes that these are due to the continuation of the Tang tradition into later times. It was also pointed out that the effects of the Chinese trade ban during the Ming Dynasty {{can be seen from the}} few early Ming Dynasty blue-and-white ceramics and the presence of ceramics from Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma. Celadon dishes found were similar to those found in the Twante district in Burma, while other celadon plates were most likely associated with Kalong wares from Thailand (15th-16th Century). Ceramics from Central Vietnam were also recovered and are determined to be manufactured in Binh Dinh during the Viet’s conquest of Vijaya. Furthermore, there were also “Swatow” or Zhangzhou type porcelains recovered that are dated to 16th-17th century. Melendres concluded that the presence of the Zhanzhou porcelains tells us that the Babo Balukbuk site was still being used until the arrival of the Spanish forces.|$|R

5000|$|In 1906 Pite {{began his}} {{commission}} {{to build the}} headquarters of the London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Assurance Company at 30 Euston Square. It was a magnificent building of Portland stone, Grecian in style and spanning seven floors. The building took two years to build and was opened on 22 January 1908. The main entrance hall was decorated with yellow and sage <b>green</b> Doulton Parian <b>ware,</b> tiled arches and a curious ceiling of dentils. The mosaic floor features an astrological design. The director's boardrooms on the first floor are lined in oak with oak strip floors and stunning marble fireplaces as their focal point. The basement housed the records for the Assurance Company; the walls are three feet thick in places and further protected by steel [...] "bomb blast" [...] doors. The new office building was also fitted with a passenger lift, electric lighting and oil-fired central heating. Considerably modern for its time, Pite's detail was meticulous; each window arch was lined with white glazed brick, which can only be seen if you lean out of the window backwards! Five light wells, also lined in white glazed brick, flooded the lower floors with light. Further light was provided to the basement level by skylights. Pite was asked to add further extensions fronting Melton Street almost as soon as the Euston Square building was finished. He continued to enlarge the building for almost 20 years with the addition of the 9 Melton Street tower being his final work there. With the widening of Euston Road in the late 1920s the final expansion took place; the architect this time was not Pite but one of his contemporaries, Josiah Gunton. The London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Assurance Company had moved out in 1910, the new occupants were the National Amalgamated Approved Society. The building is Grade II* listed due to its significant architectural importance.|$|R
