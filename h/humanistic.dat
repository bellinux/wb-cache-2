5|$|In 1997 Skeptical Inquirer Magazine {{announced}} that CFI would begin offering an academic certificate {{for students in}} a three-year program. Students needed to complete 30 units in academic {{work as well as}} in workshops. The two certificates offered were <b>Humanistic</b> Studies and Science and the Paranormal, attending The Skeptic's Toolbox would satisfy one of the workshop requirements.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, {{he focused}} his {{research}} on the application of systems and design theories and methodologies in social, social service, educational, and human development systems.

5|$|After Pather Panchali, Ray {{went on to}} make 36 more films, {{including}} feature films, documentaries and shorts. He {{worked on}} scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, {{as was the case}} with Pather Panchali, on visual lyricism and strongly <b>humanistic</b> themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{sociologist}} {{and historian}} of ideas Jerzy Szacki writes that Znaniecki's major contributions include: {{the founding of}} sociology in Poland; his work in empirical sociology; and his work in sociological theory. Szacki notes that Znaniecki sought to bridge a number of gaps: between empirical sociology and more theoretical approaches; between objectivity and subjectivity; between <b>humanistic</b> and naturalistic methodologies and viewpoints; and between American and European intellectual traditions.|$|E
5|$|The Crucifix by Cimabue at Santa Croce (c. 1265) is {{a wooden}} crucifix, painted in distemper, {{attributed}} to the Florentine painter and mosaicist Cimabue, one of two large crucifixes attributed to him. The work was commissioned by the Franciscan friars of Santa Croce and is built from a complex arrangement of five main and eight ancillary timber boards. It {{is one of the}} first Italian artworks to break from the late medieval Byzantine style and is renowned for its technical innovations and <b>humanistic</b> iconography.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal and {{his brother}} {{attended}} high school at the <b>Humanistic</b> Gymnasium in Buchach, where classes were taught in Polish. There Simon met his future wife, Cyla Müller, who he would marry in 1936. Hillel fell and broke his back in 1923 and died the following year. Rosa remarried in 1926 and moved to Dolyna with her new husband, Isack Halperin, who owned a tile factory there. Wiesenthal remained in Buczacz, living with the Müller family, until he graduated from high school—on his second attempt—in 1928.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} primary education, Morales {{attended the}} Agrarian <b>Humanistic</b> Technical Institute of Orinoca (ITAHO), completing {{all but the}} final year. His parents then sent him to study for a degree in Oruro; although he did poorly academically, he finished all of his courses and exams by 1977, earning money on the side as a brick-maker, day labourer, baker and a trumpet player for the Royal Imperial Band. The latter position allowed him to travel across Bolivia. At {{the end of his}} higher education he failed to collect his degree certificate. Although interested in studying journalism, he did not pursue it as a profession.|$|E

Hsu also {{believes}} that Tainan should become a city of international tourism and culture, and he is working towards that purpose. In September 2007, {{he spoke to the}} 2007 Asia-Pacific Cities Summit participants and stated that Tainan is blessed with natural, historic, cultural and <b>humanistic</b> characteristics, and that Tainan also possesses great conditions for high-tech, trade and investment development.|$|E
5|$|Florian Witold Znaniecki (15 January 1882– 23 March 1958) was a Polish {{philosopher and}} {{sociologist}} who taught and wrote in Poland {{and in the}} United States. Over {{the course of his}} work he shifted his focus from philosophy to sociology. He remains a major figure in the history of Polish and American sociology; the founder of Polish academic sociology, and of an entire school of thought in sociology. He won international renown as co-author, with William I. Thomas, of the study, The Polish Peasant in Europe and America (1918–20), which is considered the foundation of modern empirical sociology. He also made major contributions to sociological theory, introducing terms such as <b>humanistic</b> coefficient and culturalism.|$|E
5|$|On January 18, 1977, the Dade County Commission {{approved}} {{a law that}} would outlaw {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public services. Commissioner Ruth Shack proposed the bill on December 7, 1976 at the request of a gay lobbying organization, named the Dade County Coalition for the <b>Humanistic</b> Rights of Gays, that was less than a year old. The group was headed by three gay activists: Jack Campbell, an owner of 40gay bathhouses across the United States, political and gay activist Bob Basker, and Bob Kunst, a local publicist and enthusiast of the Human Potential Movement.|$|E
5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of scientific knowledge, celebrating it for its <b>humanistic</b> achievements and discoveries, but also warning {{that it can}} do immense harm when {{in the hands of}} the unethical or overambitious. Given these themes, the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play evokes the three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, the choice is between positive ideals—love, goodness, happiness—and the unbounded scientific ambitions of the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E
5|$|A {{precocious}} student, Durkheim {{entered the}} École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year {{was one of}} the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaurès and Henri Bergson, would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin dissertation on Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found <b>humanistic</b> studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and eventually, sociology. He obtained his agrégation in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.|$|E
5|$|After Italy, Hungary was {{the first}} European country where the renaissance appeared. The Renaissance style came {{directly}} from Italy during the Quattrocento to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks {{to the development of}} early Hungarian-Italian relationships – not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, <b>humanistic</b> and commercial relations – growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata and Várpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim's {{period in}} Germany {{resulted}} in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed {{by the work of}} Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course. His official title was Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie and thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly <b>humanistic</b> faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system and introduced the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.|$|E
5|$|In the Kingdom of Mysore, the Veerashaiva {{literary}} {{school was}} {{challenged by the}} growing influence of the Srivaishnava intelligentsia in the Wodeyar court. The Srivaishnava writers (followers of a sect of Vaishnavism) of Kannada literature were also in competition with Telugu and Sanskrit writers, their predominance continuing into the English colonial rule over the princely state of Mysore. Meanwhile, the radical writings of 16th-century poet Ratnakaravarni had made way for {{a new kind of}} poetry heralded by those who were not poets in the traditional courtly sense, rather itinerant poets who travelled across the Kannada-speaking region, cutting across court and monastery, writing poems (in the tripadi metre) and influencing the lives of people with their <b>humanistic</b> values which overcame the social barriers of caste and religion. Sarvajna (often compared to Telugu poet Vemana), Sisunala Sherif, Mupina Sadakshari, Navalingayogi and Kadakolada Madivalappa are the best-known among them. These maverick poets heralded yet another epoch of unconventional literature in Kannada language, free of courtly conservatism and established literary tastes.|$|E
5|$|Kirill {{arrives at}} the {{workshop}} of Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), a prominent and well-recognized master painter, {{who is working on}} a new icon of Jesus Christ. Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character: an established artist, <b>humanistic</b> and God-fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical, regarding his art more as a craft and a chore in his disillusion with other people. His young apprentices have all run away to the town square, where a wrongly convicted criminal is about to be tortured and executed. Kirill talks to Theophanes, and the artist, impressed by the monk's understanding and erudition, invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow. Kirill refuses at first, but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in front of all the fraternity and Andrei Rublev, who according to Theophanes' comments has some fame as an icon painter in the outside world.|$|E
5|$|This decade also {{witnessed}} {{the emergence of}} a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, Transcendental Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. It was from Esalen and other similar personal growth centers which had developed links to <b>humanistic</b> psychology that the human potential movement emerged, which would also come to exert a strong influence on the New Age.|$|E
25|$|Its {{principal}} {{professional organizations}} in the US are the Association for <b>Humanistic</b> Psychology and the Society for <b>Humanistic</b> Psychology (Division 32 of the American Psychological Association). In Britain, there is the UK Association for <b>Humanistic</b> Psychology Practitioners.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{remained}} {{part of the}} <b>humanistic</b> psychology agenda, though with more of a holistic than reductionistic focus. Specific <b>humanistic</b> research methods evolved in the decades following {{the formation of the}} <b>humanistic</b> psychology movement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Humanistic</b> Judaism was {{developed}} as a possible {{solution to the problem}} of retaining Jewish identity and continuity among non-religious. Recognizing that congregational religious life was thriving, Wine believed that secular Jews who had rejected theism would be attracted to an organization that provided all the same forms and activities as, for example, Reform temples, but which expressed a purely Secular <b>Humanistic</b> viewpoint. The International Institute for Secular <b>Humanistic</b> Judaism, which is sponsored by the Society for <b>Humanistic</b> Judaism and the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations, trains rabbis and other leaders in the United States and in Israel. The Society for <b>Humanistic</b> Judaism was organized with the mission to mobilize people to celebrate Jewish identity and culture consistent with a <b>humanistic</b> philosophy of life.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its uses in thinking about social change, <b>humanistic</b> psychology {{is considered to be}} the main theoretical and methodological source of <b>humanistic</b> social work.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a strong}} {{connection}} between the transpersonal and the <b>humanistic</b> approaches to psychology, {{as indicated by the}} sourcebook of Donald Moss. Although transpersonal psychology is considered to have started off within, or developed from <b>humanistic</b> psychology, many of its interests, such as spirituality and modes of consciousness, extend beyond the areas of interest discussed by <b>humanistic</b> theory. According to writers in the field transpersonal psychology advocates for an expanded, spiritual, view of physical and mental health that is not necessarily addressed by <b>humanistic</b> psychology.|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{representation}} and {{approach of the}} client (as human being) and social issue (as human issue) in social work is made from the <b>humanistic</b> psychology position. According to Petru Stefaroi, the way <b>humanistic</b> representation and approach of the client and his personality is realized is, in fact, the theoretical-axiological and methodological foundation of <b>humanistic</b> social work.|$|E
25|$|While <b>humanistic</b> {{psychology}} {{is a specific}} division within the American Psychological Association , <b>humanistic</b> {{psychology is}} not so much a discipline within psychology as a perspective on the human condition that informs psychological research and practice.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, these congregations {{and others}} were united organizationally under the {{umbrella}} of the Society for <b>Humanistic</b> Judaism (SHJ). The Society for <b>Humanistic</b> Judaism has 10,000 members in 30 congregations spread throughout the United States and Canada.|$|E
25|$|<b>Humanistic</b> {{psychology}} {{developed in}} the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology, in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis. The <b>humanistic</b> approach sought to glimpse the whole person, not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions. Humanism focused on uniquely human issues, such as free will, personal growth, self-actualization, self-identity, death, aloneness, freedom, and meaning. It emphasized subjective meaning, rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some founders of the <b>humanistic</b> school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy. Later, positive psychology opened up <b>humanistic</b> themes to scientific modes of exploration.|$|E

25|$|Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued <b>humanistic,</b> {{rational}} and scientific discourses {{in their search}} for knowledge, meaning and values. A wide range of Islamic writings on love poetry, history and philosophical theology show that medieval Islamic thought was open to the <b>humanistic</b> ideas of individualism, occasional secularism, skepticism and liberalism.|$|E
25|$|The <b>humanistic</b> {{approach}} {{has its roots}} in phenomenological and existentialist thought (see Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and Sartre). Eastern philosophy and psychology also {{play a central role in}} <b>humanistic</b> psychology, as well as Judeo-Christian philosophies of personalism, as each shares similar concerns about the nature of human existence and consciousness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Humanistic</b> psychologists {{generally}} {{do not believe that}} we will understand human consciousness and behavior through Cartesian-Newtonian scientific research. The objection that <b>humanistic</b> psychologists have to traditional research methods is that they are derived from and suited for the physical sciences and not especially appropriate to studying the complexities and nuances of human meaning-making.|$|E
