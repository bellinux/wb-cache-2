5000|$|A typical {{sophisticated}} surface tree {{will have}} at least four or five valves, normally arranged in a crucifix type pattern (hence the endurance of the term [...] "Christmas tree"). The two lower valves are called the master valves (upper and lower respectively). Master valves are normally in the fully open position and are never opened or closed when the well is flowing (except in an emergency) to prevent erosion of the valve sealing surfaces. The lower master valve will normally be manually operated, while the upper master valve is often hydraulically actuated, allowing it {{to be used as}} a means of remotely shutting in the well in the event of emergency. An actuated wing valve is normally used to shut in the well when flowing, thus preserving the master valves for positive shut off for maintenance purposes. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>operated</b> wing valves are usually built to be fail safe closed, meaning they require active hydraulic pressure to stay open. This feature means that if control fluid fails the well will automatically shut itself in without operator action.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fifties}} was Moto Guzzi of the Italian Ministry of Defence's request to develop a special vehicle for the [...] "Alpini" [...] (mountain troops). Who transported at that time their {{material}} yet with donkeys [...] It was suggested General Garbari as project officer and formulated a number of requirements which the vehicle had to meet: it needed to move a load of 500 kg through all kinds of terrain, especially in mountainous areas and on very narrow paths. The development was first placed in the hands of Antonio Micucci and later worked on by Soldavini and Giulio Cesare Carcano [...] Carcano had just a new long mounted V-twin engine with forced air cooling developed, where the directors of Moto Guzzi bread saw. There was a 500 and a 650 cc version that was intended for the Fiat 500, but Fiat withdrew from the project. Carcano saw his chance to still find a use for his new engine. The [...] "Mulo Meccanico" [...] (Mechanical Donkey) was a very special machine with wheel drive and variable wheelbase and track width [...] The 754 cc engine produced just 20 hp, due to the low compression ratio that, taking into account fuel of low quality, was necessary. The couple, however, of 47 Nm was achieved at 2,400 rpm. There was only one 26mm Weber carburettor used and the machine had a waterproof coil - ignition [...] There was a chassis system which consisted of tubes and pressed steel box sections. The rear suspension consisted of two box girder arms that were cushioned by rubber suspension. At the front was a one-sided telescopic fork with coil springs [...] The control was done with a steering wheel through bevel gears. The driver sat on a motorcycle seat, but the operation was done through levers and pedals as in a car [...] The engine was sitting behind the driver. Behind it was a manual gearbox with six forward gears and one reverse. There was a central differential with a teruglooppal to prevent roll back. 20% of the drive went to the front wheel, 80% to the rear wheels. The rear-wheel drive was done with two drive shafts that went diagonally from the differential to the two wheels, the front-wheel drive through a propeller shaft leading from the differential between the cylinders through to the steering head went. Using three bevel gears, the drive was at the steering led to another drive shaft, which powered the front wheel. In one cabinet aluminum were located both the gearbox, the differential and the device to adjust the track width. That could happen driving: a distance of about 25 with the gauge could be changed from 1300 mm to 850 mm or vice versa, but in an emergency that could still happen.

As long as there was straight drove the machine could take the most improbable slopes, but sideways was always the danger of falling over, because there were only three wheels. On the mountain trails were very short turns or rocks enough to stop the mechanical donkey while a real donkey did not experience any problems here. Therefore, the Autoveicolo da Montagna was already taken out of production in 1963.|$|E

40|$|Intelligent well {{systems are}} {{installed}} in production or injection wells, to increase {{the total amount of}} produced hydrocarbons. An intelligent well system has the advantages of being able to set different choke openings, using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>operated</b> sleeves to regulate the flow of produced or injected fluids. The procedure of operating the choke from surface without the use of any intervention work, is both economical and less time consuming. Combining the efficiency of intelligent well systems and down hole monitoring systems, such as pressure and temperature gauges, allows for production optimisation. If the down hole monitoring system also is fitted with a multiphase flow meter, surface test separators could be unnecessary. Multilateral wells are used to reach several pay zones, either within the same reservoir or in different smaller reservoirs. A multilateral well is a single bore well, at the surface, with one or several branches going out from the main bore. This method of drilling is economical and less time consuming. The equipment costs are lower, due to the need for only one wellhead, less casing costs, lower rig charge etc. Seeing as one only have to drill one main bore, as opposed to drilling separate wells where all wells must be drilled from the seabed, the method is also time saving. Combining these two solutions, the well will produce from several zones in different reservoirs into one main bore. The production can be controlled and regulated for each zone continuously. This thesis will describe the equipment used in a combined intelligent well and multilateral solution...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} {{effects have}} been widely studied in short and long-term core flooding experiments through outcrop chalk cores. Three main changes are induced by this reactive brine: ion exchange, dissolution of calcite and precipitation of new magnesium bearing minerals. Can these combined mechanisms increase the water wetness of chalk reservoirs? This experimental work evaluates the potential of simplified brine MgCl 2 to modify the initial wetting state of outcrop Kansas chalk cores. Wettability measurements were based on Chromatographic Wettability Test develop by Strand et al. (2006) and carried out at room temperature. The flood of magnesium chloride was performed at Ekofisk reservoir temperature with a flooding rate of 1 PV/day. Wetting state was evaluated every 10 days flooding cycle. Reactive brine flooding was performed using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>operated</b> triaxial cell with testing conditions of 15 [Bars] confining pressure and 7 [Bars] pore pressure. The results show that magnesium chloride potential to modify the wetting state of mixed wet Kansas chalk cores is minimum, even though, the chromatographic wettability tests suggest the opposite. Chromatographic wettability test is able to quantify the initial wetting state but not to measure the changes in evolution of the wetting state by flooding a reactive brine through the calcite surface. Insight of aging and sulphate content are presented for outcrop Kansas chalk. The observed effluent concentration suggests a reduction in Mg 2 +, while the Ca 2 + concentration is increased. This, together with density measurements, indicate the precipitation of magnesium bearing minerals causing the dissolution of calcite surface, observing a general increase in the core density to a more magnesite state. Density {{was found to be}} higher in the core’s inlet. Furthermore, specific surface area measurements were carried out. An apparent link between specific surface area and the chromatographic wettability test area measured was implied. Magnesium chloride could potentially increase the specific surface area of the core, while sodium chloride could reduce it (Unpublished work by Wang et al. (2017). Same trends were found in the chromatographic separation test results...|$|E

40|$|Summary and Conclusion Emergency Shutdown (ESD) {{valves and}} High Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) valves are final {{elements}} in Safety Instrumented Systems. Proof or functional testing are performed at specific intervals {{in order to}} ensure the valves’ function. For these type of valves, such tests may require costly shutdowns. For a final element, like a valve, the interval between proof tests are by performance based standards like IEC 61505 / 61511, related to the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) for the element’s complete function. Partial Stroke Testing (PST) can reduce the time between such tests. PST is performed by allowing the valve to start closing, and to start reopening before the process is interrupted. By performing a partial test at a shorter interval, a fraction of the dangerous undetected failures, the PST coverage, are tested more often. This will reduce the PFD and imply that the proof test interval can be extended, still achieving the same Safety Integrity Level (SIL). Three systems for PST have been evaluated: The Emerson FieldVue DVC 6000 SIS, the Drallim Smart Valve Monitoring and the Crane ValveWatch II. ValveWatch and Smart Valve Monitoring provides leak testing in open and closed position, respectively. Leak testing on an open valve is treated as a partial test and is included in the PST coverage. FieldVue can not be used on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>operated</b> valves. Three ESD valves and one HIPPS valve on the Kollsnes gas processing plant have been analyzed. Two systems have been evaluated for each valve. A Failure Mode, E. ects and Diagnostic Analysis has been performed on the tested parts of each valve’s complete function. Based on this analysis, the PST coverage and increased test intervals are calculated. The PST coverage found for the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>operated</b> ESD gate valves are 66 % and 74 % for ValveWatch and Smart Valve Monitoring, respectively. For the pneumatic operated ESD ball valve, a PST coverage of 21 % has been found for FieldVue and 56 % for Smart Valve Monitoring. The calculated intervals between functional tests to achive a SIL 2 rating, are between 0, 54 and 0, 89 years for these ESD valves. SIL 2 corresponds to a PFD < 10 - 2. For the ESD valves, new control circuits with lower failure rates should be designed in order to improve the results. Today’s one year proof test interval on ESD valves seems not to be in accordance with the standard used in this project, i. e to achieve SIL 2 the proof test interval should be reduced. A PST coverage of 100 % and 0 % has been found on the HIPPS solenoid valve for Smart Valve Monitoring and FieldVue, respectively. The PST coverage for the valve and actuator is 53 % for both systems. Based on an inital annual test interval for the overall pressure protection system, is PST, by the system with best coverage, roughly estimated to increase the test interval by 76 %. The results are highly dependent on the choices and assumptions made in this project. A closer study of experience data could have increased the quality of the analysis. Such data is not found easily available. The results are assumed to be relatively conservative. Deeper involvement of professionals with operational experience from relevant areas would probably also have improved the quality. The Drallim Smart Valve Monitoring has achieved the best results in this analysis. ValveWatch and FieldVue would improve their PST coverage if ESD solenoids were tested. They are also able to monitor actual shutdowns and may contribute to document a shutdown as proof test. These systems also make more measurements and may be better suited for predictive maintenance purposes. ValveWatch has achieved the highest PST coverage for a valve separately, because of its leak test. All the evaluated systems will give increased knowledge about the valve’s condition, and thereby improve safety. The PFD will be substantially reduced. Future needs at Kollsnes should be analyzed further, and an eventual installation of such systems should be done according to these needs. </p...|$|E

The paper presents the analysis of results of the investigations concerning the influence of various constructive solutions of the air-water mixers on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>operating</b> {{conditions of}} the air lift pump. The scope of the investigations encompassed the determination of characteristics of delivery head and delivery rate for three types of air-water mixers applied in the constructed air lift pump. Using the obtained results, {{the efficiency of the}} three types of air-water mixers applied in this air lift pump was determined. The analysis was carried out and there was checked whether the improved analytical Stenning-Martin model can be used to design air lift pumps with the air-water mixers of these types. The highest capacity in the water transport was reached by the air lift pump with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest one – with the 3 rd type air-water mixer. The water flow in the air lift pump increases along with the rise in the air flow. The lower are the hydraulic losses generated during flow of the air flux by the air-water mixer, the higher is the air lift pump capacity. Along with the rise in the water delivery head, the capacity of the air lift pump decreases. The highest efficiency is reached by the air lift pump with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest – with the 3 st type air-water mixer.
