5|$|Although the IFC's {{shareholders}} initially {{only allowed}} it to make loans, the IFC was authorized in 1961 to make equity investments, {{the first of which}} was made in 1962 by taking a stake in FEMSA, a former manufacturer of auto parts in Spain that is now part of Bosch Spain. The IFC invests in businesses' equity either directly or via private equity funds, generally from five up to twenty percent of a company's total equity. IFC’s private <b>equity</b> <b>portfolio</b> currently stands at roughly $3.0 billion committed to about 180 funds. The portfolio is widely distributed across all regions including Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, and recently has invested in Small Enterprise Assistance Funds' (SEAF) Caucasus Growth Fund, Aureos Capital's Kula Fund II (Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Pacific Islands) and Leopard Capital’s Haiti Fund. Other equity investments made by the IFC include preferred equity, convertible loans, and participation loans. The IFC prefers to invest for the long-term, usually for a period of eight to fifteen years, before exiting through the sale of shares on a domestic stock exchange, usually as part of an initial public offering. When the IFC invests in a company, it does not assume an active role in management of the company.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary and Incomplete. Do not distribute. Recent {{models of}} {{international}} <b>equity</b> <b>portfolios</b> exhibit two potential weaknesses: 1) {{the structure of}} equilibrium <b>equity</b> <b>portfolios</b> {{is determined by the}} correlation of equity returns with real exchange rates; yet empirically equities don’t appear to be a good hedge against real exchange rate risk; 2) <b>Equity</b> <b>portfolios</b> are highly sensitive to preference parameters. This paper solves both problems. It first shows that in more general and realistic environments, the hedging of real exchange rate risks occurs through international bond holdings since relative bond returns are strongly correlated with real exchange rate fluctuations. Equilibrium equity positions are then optimally determined by the correlation of equity returns with the return on non-financial wealth, conditional on the bond returns. The model delivers equilibrium portfolios that are well-behaved {{as a function of the}} underlying preference parameters. We find reasonable empirical support for the theory for G- 7 countries. We are able to explain short positions in domestic currency bonds for all G- 7 countries, as well as significant levels of home equity bias for the US, Japan and Canada...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three new}} empirical {{findings on the}} role of currencies in global stock and bond portfolios. First, while currency risk hedging significantly reduces portfolio risk, both in-sample and out-of-sample, currency hedging only yields significant improvements in the risk-return tradeoff for fixed income <b>portfolios.</b> For global <b>equity</b> <b>portfolios</b> the Sharpe ratio often decreases when hedging currency risk. Second, speculative currency positions lead to economically large and statistically significant improvements in portfolio Sharpe ratios. This holds in-sample for all passive and active portfolio strategies and home currencies that we consider. The significance of the benefits of dynamic speculative currency positions in global <b>equity</b> <b>portfolios</b> survives the out-of sample tests for several home currencies. Our speculative currency portfolio differs from thesimplecarry,asitisamean-varianceoptimal portfolio, and hence takes the correlations between the different currencies into account. Third, we find that out-of-sample speculative and hedging benefits in global <b>equity</b> <b>portfolios</b> vary substantially over time and are strongly negatively correlated: when currency speculative positions deliver gains, hedging typically induces losses and vice versa.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} issue of market risk {{quantification}} for emerging and developed market <b>equity</b> <b>portfolios.</b> A very wide spectrum of popular and widely used in practice Value at Risk (VaR) models are evaluated and compared with Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and adaptive filtered models, during normal, crises, and post-crises periods. The results are interesting and indicate that despite the documented differences between emerging and developed markets, the most successful VaR models are common for both asset classes. Furthermore, {{in the case of}} the (fatter tailed) emerging market <b>equity</b> <b>portfolios,</b> most VaR models turn out to yield conservative risk forecasts, in contrast to developed market <b>equity</b> <b>portfolios,</b> where most models underestimate the realized VaR. VaR estimation during periods of financial turmoil seems to be a difficult task, particularly in the case of emerging markets and especially for the higher loss quantiles. VaR models seem to be affected less by crises periods in the case of developed markets. The performance of the parametric (non-parametric) VaR models improves (deteriorates) during post-crises periods due to the inclusion of extreme events in the estimation sample.
