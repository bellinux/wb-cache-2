5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known <b>from</b> <b>only</b> a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Despite these taxonomic changes, Indraloris {{remained}} known <b>from</b> <b>only</b> two specimens (the holotypes of Indraloris lulli and Sivanasua palaeindica) until 2005. Both {{of those}} specimens—an isolated first lower molar (m1) and a mandible (lower jaw) fragment with m1, respectively—come from Haritalyangar in the Nagri Formation. In 2005, however, American paleontologists Lawrence Flynn and Michèle Morgan described five teeth of Indraloris from fossil {{sites in the}} older Kamlial Formation as a second species in the genus, Indraloris kamlialensis. The species was named after the Kamlial Formation. In addition, they suggested that two lower jaw fragments from the Kamlial Formation represented a third, larger species of Indraloris.|$|E
5|$|Evolution of the {{adaptive}} immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of {{the adaptive}} immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced <b>from</b> <b>only</b> a small number (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens {{in a similar way}} to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known <b>from</b> <b>only</b> one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} debate about whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange of views.|$|E

This most likely happened during a glacial period because the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna, whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have consisted of tropical rain forest.|$|E

The rectum absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut.

Australia collapsed and lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused, before completing a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Poulton came in at 1/33 and hit 15 from 13 balls, including three fours.

Some bacteria, including the Spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia are a notable exception to this arrangement. Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease, contains a single linear chromosome and several linear and circular plasmids.|$|E
