500|$|Black Sabbath {{embarked}} on a world tour in July 1995 with openers Motörhead and Tiamat, but two months into the tour, drummer Cozy Powell left the band, citing health issues, {{and was replaced by}} former drummer Bobby Rondinelli. [...] "The members <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last lineup – Bobby Rondinelli, Neil Murray – they're great, great characters..." [...] Iommi told Sabbath fanzine Southern Cross. [...] "That, for me, was an ideal lineup. I wasn't sure vocally what we should do, but Neil Murray and Bobby Rondinelli I really got on well with." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} moment when Nico Rosberg let him past {{in the early stages}} of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his {{teammate}} for [...] "being a gentleman". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: [...] "It was more painful the feeling that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that's not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [...] was just a consequence of that." [...] Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. He pointed to the possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{released}} his fourth full-length solo album Shadows Collide with People on February 24, 2004. This featured guest appearances {{from some of}} his friends, including Klinghoffer, and Chili Peppers bandmates Smith and Flea. In June 2004, {{he announced that he}} would be releasing six records over six months: The Will to Death, Ataxia's Automatic Writing, DC EP, Inside of Emptiness, A Sphere in the Heart of Silence and Curtains. With the release of Curtains Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004, for the track [...] "The Past Recedes". He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape, avoiding modern studio and computer-assisted recording processes. Frusciante noted, [...] "These six records were recorded in a period of six months after coming home from touring with the Chili Peppers for one-and-a-half years. I made {{a list of all the}} songs I had and they totaled about seventy. My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> midst of doing that, I was writing some of my best songs, so some of these albums have as many new songs as old songs. It was definitely the most productive time of my life." ...|$|E

500|$|Acknowledging {{the failure}} of the ongoing Anarky series, Grant has conceeded that its themes, in {{particular}} his interest in exploring esoteric concepts such as philosophy of mind, likely resulted in [...] "plummeting" [...] sales. Breyfogle claimed the difficulty of combining escapist entertainment with social commentary as his explanation for the series' failure. Breyfogle wrote at the time: [...] "Anarky is a hybrid of the mainstream and the not-quite-so-mainstream. This title may have experienced exactly what every 'half-breed' suffers: rejection by both groups with which it claims identity." [...] Besides the themes, commentators have also found the escalation of Anarky's skills and special heroics as a source of criticism among readers. [...] "I liked the original concept behind Anarky: a teenage geek who reads The Will to Power one too many times and decides to go out and fix the world," [...] wrote a critic for Fanzing, an online newsletter produced by comic book fans and professionals. [...] "But the minute he wound up getting $100 million in a Swiss Bank account, owning a building, impressing Darksied, getting a Boom Tube and was shown as being able to outsmart Batman, outhack Oracle and generally be invincible, I lost all interest <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> character." ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{are skeptical}} about disjunctivism —a theory of perceptual experience which holds roughly that {{a situation in}} which I see a banana that is as it appears to me to be and one <b>in</b> which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a hallucination as of a banana are mentally completely different. Often this skepticism is rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suspicion that such a view cannot adequately account for the bad case—in particular, that such a view cannot explain why what it’s like to have a hallucination can be exactly like what it’s like to have a veridical experience, that it cannot explain why <b>the</b> hallucination <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bad case is subjectively indistinguishable from the kind of experience <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> good case, and that it cannot offer a viable account of the nature of hallucination. -/- In this paper, I argue that a proper formulation of disjunctivism can avoid these objections. Disjunctivism should be formulated as the weakest claim required to preserve its primary motivation, viz., Naïve Realism—the view that veridical experience fundamentally consists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subject perceiving entities in her environment. And the weakest claim required to preserve Naïve Realism allows for many sorts of commonalities across the good and hallucinatory cases, commonalities that can be marshaled <b>in</b> responding to <b>the</b> objections. Most importantly, disjunctivism properly formulated is compatible with “positive” accounts of the nature of hallucination...|$|R

While overall, there was a positive shift in responses, significant moves occurred in both directions.
