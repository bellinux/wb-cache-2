5|$|In April 2010, it was {{announced}} that the series would be adapted <b>for</b> <b>Russia.</b> On September 20, 2010, the Russian adaptation premiered on Channel One. This adaptation uses many of the features of the original series, with some scenes and dialogue copied completely, but also introduces new storylines and characters which reflects the Russian reality.|$|E
5|$|Anton Rubinstein was {{a famous}} Russian pianist who had lived, {{performed}} and composed in Western and Central Europe before he returned to Russia in 1858. He saw Russia as a musical desert compared to Paris, Berlin and Leipzig, whose music conservatories he had visited. Musical life flourished in those places; composers were held in high regard, and musicians were wholeheartedly devoted to their art. With a similar ideal in mind <b>for</b> <b>Russia,</b> he had conceived {{an idea for a}} conservatory in Russia years before his 1858 return, and had finally aroused the interest of influential people to help him realize the idea.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{socio-economic}} stagnation Brezhnev {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good <b>for</b> <b>Russia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Filatov played {{minor and}} junior hockey in the CSKA Red Army hockey {{system from the}} age of 13. At the age of 15 during the 2005–06 season, he made his debut for CSKA-2—the club's junior team—where he {{continued}} to play during the 2006–07 season, and averaged more than three points per game. In the same season, Filatov made his international debut <b>for</b> <b>Russia</b> at the World Under 18 Championship.|$|E

Avatars worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film. 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1million during the opening weekend.|$|E
5|$|Olga {{remained}} nostalgic <b>for</b> <b>Russia.</b> Her {{room was}} filled with icons from her homeland and, in the palace chapel, she sang Slavic hymns with her children. She often visited Russian ships that were docked at Piraeus and invited the Russian sailors to the royal palace. She {{was the only woman}} in history to bear the title of Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy, an honor given to her on marriage. She was honored in the Greek navy by having a ship named after her.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Russia {{early in the}} 2009–10 season, Filatov {{had the opportunity to}} compete in a third World Junior Championship at the 2010 tournament held in Saskatoon and Regina. As in 2009, he served as Russia's team captain. During preliminary round play, Filatov was named best player <b>for</b> <b>Russia</b> in their game against Finland. The tournament, however, was a disappointment for the Russians after they lost to Switzerland in the quarterfinals. Prior to the fifth place game against the Czech Republic, Filatov was stripped of his captaincy and replaced by teammate Kirill Petrov after criticizing the team personnel during a media scrum. After participating in three World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Filatov is tied with Evgeny Kuznetsov as Russia's all-time leading scorer at the event—both forwards finished their junior careers with 26 points.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Russian Provisional Government declared a general amnesty and offered to fund the return of those Russians who had been exiled as political opponents of the Empire; the entire staff of Golos Truda elected to leave New York City <b>for</b> <b>Russia</b> and to move the periodical to Petrograd. In Vancouver on May 26, 1917, the editors, along with Ferrer Center artist Manuel Komroff and thirteen others, boarded a ship bound for Japan. On board, the anarchists played music, gave lectures, staged plays and even published a revolutionary newspaper, The Float. From Japan, the band made their way to Siberia, and proceeded East to European Russia.|$|E
5|$|Austria {{is closely}} linked to the fate of {{prominent}} Russian diplomat and statesman Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov. He arrived in Vienna in 1833 as an adviser to the embassy, and, from 1854 to 1856, he led the Russian diplomatic mission. Gorchakov became Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian court at the most difficult period <b>for</b> <b>Russia</b> during the Crimean War, during which time he was able to preserve diplomatic relations with Austria and helped to overcome the international isolation of the Russian Empire and reinforced Russia's status as a great power. The Vienna Conference in 1855 was the first presence of Gorchakov in an international forum, and his performance in representing Russia at the Paris Conference of 1856 saw Alexander II appoint him as Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E

5|$|Filatov {{has played}} {{extensively}} for Russia's national teams in under-18 and under-20 tournaments. His first IIHF competition <b>for</b> <b>Russia</b> was the 2007 U18 Championship {{held in the}} Finnish cities of Rauma and Tampere. Russia {{won a gold medal}} in that tournament, and as an underaged player, Filatov contributed four goals and five assists in seven games. He led the Russian team in total points and was second to Alexei Cherepanov in goals scored. After this tournament, Russia's coaches named Filatov as one of the team's three best players. Filatov also played at the 2008 U18 Championship held in his native Russia, in Kazan. Filatov captained the team to a silver medal, scoring three goals and adding six assists. He was named to the Tournament All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, Colorado won the Pacific Division with a 39–26–17 record for 95 points. The Avalanche sent the largest delegation of the NHL to the 1998 Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament in Nagano, Japan: 10 players representing seven countries and coach Marc Crawford for Canada. Milan Hejduk {{won the gold}} medal for Czech Republic, Alexei Gusarov and Valeri Kamensky got the silver medal <b>for</b> <b>Russia</b> and Jari Kurri won the bronze medal for Finland. Colorado lost in the Western Conference Quarter-finals against the Edmonton Oilers in seven games, after having led the series 3–1. Peter Forsberg was the league's second highest scorer in the regular season with 91 points (25 goals and 66 assists) and was elected for the league's first all star team. After the end of the season, head coach Marc Crawford rejected the team's offer of a two-year deal. Bob Hartley was hired to the head coach position in June 1998.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Bure {{competed for}} the Soviet Union and Russia. As {{a member of}} the Soviet Union, he won two silver medals and a gold in three World Junior Championships, {{followed}} by a gold and a silver medal in the 1990 and 1991 World Championships, respectively. After the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, Bure competed <b>for</b> <b>Russia</b> in two Winter Olympics, claiming silver at the 1998 Games in Nagano as team captain, and bronze at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. Following Bure's retirement in 2005, he was named the general manager for Russia's national team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. Bure was later recognized for his international career as a 2012 inductee in the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|On 3 March, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed. It {{resulted}} in massive territorial losses <b>for</b> <b>Russia,</b> with 26% {{of the former}} Empire's population, 37% of its agricultural harvest area, 28% of its industry, 26% of its railway tracks, and three-quarters of its coal and iron deposits being transferred to German control. Accordingly, the Treaty was deeply unpopular across Russia's political spectrum, and several Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries resigned from Sovnarkom in protest. After the Treaty, Sovnarkom focused on trying to foment proletarian revolution in Germany, issuing an array of anti-war and anti-government publications in the country; the German government retaliated by expelling Russia's diplomats. The Treaty nevertheless failed to stop the Central Powers' defeat; in November 1918, the German Emperor Wilhelm II resigned and the country's new administration signed the Armistice with the Allies. As a result, Sovnarkom proclaimed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk void.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{entry to}} the Northwest Coast, beyond Prince William Sound, was slow because of a {{shortage}} of ships and sailors. Yakutat Bay was reached in 1794 and the settlement of Slavorossiya, originally intended to be the colonial capital, was built there in 1795. Reconnaissance of the coast {{as far as the}} Queen Charlotte Islands was carried out by James Shields, a British employee of the Golikov-Shelikhov Company. In 1795, Alexandr Baranov sailed into Sitka Sound, claiming it <b>for</b> <b>Russia.</b> Hunting parties arrived in the following years. By 1800, three-quarters of the Russian-American Company's sea otter skins came from the Sitka Sound area, amounting to several thousand per year. Sitka Sound was also where serious competition between the Russians, British, and Americans first arose.|$|E
5|$|The waters around Svalbard are of {{strategic}} significance <b>for</b> <b>Russia</b> as the Northern Fleet must {{pass through the}} area to reach the Atlantic Ocean. The concern of the Soviet Union and Russia was therefore to ensure that listening stations and anti-submarine warfare installations were not placed on the archipelago. Except during the Second World War, Norway has never stationed any military troops on Svalbard. However, the Norwegian Coast Guard carries out surveillance. There were many protests during the Cold War from the Soviet Union against Norwegian activity on the island, including purely civil arrangements. The Soviet Union issued many memorandums protesting such installations as satellite ground stations and airports, and even the filming of Orion's Belt, {{on the grounds that}} it could be a cover for or had the potential for being used for military activities.|$|E

5|$|When Russia {{invaded the}} Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian {{dominance}} in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat <b>for</b> <b>Russia.</b> The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Russian Entente. The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914 between Russia, France and Britain {{on one side and}} Germany, the Ottoman Empire and Austria on the other, Andranik left Bulgaria <b>for</b> <b>Russia.</b> He was appointed the commander of the first Armenian volunteer battalion by the Russian government. From November 1914 to August 1915, Andranik took part in the Caucasus Campaign as the head commander of the first Armenian battalion of about 1,200 volunteers within the Imperial Russian Army. Andranik's battalion particularly stood out at the Battle of Dilman in April 1915. By the victory at Dilman, the Russian and Armenian forces under the command of General Nazarbekian, effectively stopped the Turks from invading the Caucasus via Iranian Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|Animals have {{repeatedly}} been used through {{the history of}} biomedical research. The founders, in 1831, of the Dublin Zoo {{were members of the}} medical profession, interested in studying the animals both while they were alive and when they were dead. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur convincingly demonstrated the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep. In the 1880s, Robert Koch infected mice and guinea pigs with anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. In World War I, German agents infected sheep bound <b>for</b> <b>Russia</b> with anthrax, and inoculated mules and horses of the French cavalry with the equine glanders disease. Between 1917 and 1918, the Germans infected mules in Argentina bound for American forces, resulting in the death of 200 mules. Insulin was first isolated from dogs in 1922, and revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. On November 3, 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took a large step forwards in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch was able to produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from the SV40 virus into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.|$|E
