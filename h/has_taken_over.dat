5|$|In December 2007 Pacific National {{announced}} plans to sell or close its grain transport and Portlink rural container business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 {{for the purposes of}} asset stripping and eliminating competition in rail freight. In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne container service from Pacific National, and moved into broad gauge grain services, while Aurizon <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> the Melbourne - Horsham container service.|$|E

5|$|The Jim Henson Company and the Jim Henson Foundation {{continued}} {{after his}} death, producing new series and specials. Jim Henson's Creature Shop, founded by Henson, also continues to build creatures {{for a large}} number of other films and series (e.g. the science-fiction production Farscape, the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the movie MirrorMask) and {{is considered one of the}} most advanced and well respected creators of film creatures. As of 2017, his eldest son Brian and eldest daughter Lisa are the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company; his daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. Steve Whitmire, a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, assumed the roles of Kermit the Frog and Ernie, the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson. Whitmire also assumed the roles of Link Hogthrob, starting with the video game Muppet RaceMania, as well as The Muppet Newsman, starting in 2008, with Muppet.com viral online videos. However in 2017 Whitmire was fired from the Muppets Studio and as a result, Matt Vogel <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> the role of Kermit. Muppeteer veteran Bill Barretta <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> for Henson's fairly deeper voiced roles, such as the Swedish Chef, Mahna Mahna, Rowlf the Dog, and Dr. Teeth. Guy Smiley, in recent years, has been taken over by Eric Jacobson, and the role of Waldorf, in 1992, was assumed by Muppet performer veteran Dave Goelz. As of 2017, Ernie is now performed by puppeteer Peter Linz.|$|E

Gwen also learns that she is the only team member who's in a relationship, as the others are too busy working to find time. They later find where Carys lives and arrives there before she could harm a postman. When she tries to escape, Owen traps her using a portable prison cell, much to Jack's chagrin, as he forbids the removal of alien technology from Torchwood's base without his permission.|$|E
5|$|Waddington {{licensed}} other editions from 1936 to 1938, and {{the game}} was exported from the UK and resold or reprinted in Switzerland, Belgium, Australia, Chile, The Netherlands, and Sweden. In Italy, under the fascists, the game was changed dramatically {{so that it would}} have an Italian name, locations in Milan, and major changes in the rules. This was for compliance under Italian law of the period. Italian publishers Editrice Giochi produced the game in Italy until 2009, having held a unique licensing agreement from Parker Brothers and their own copyright dating back to 1935/1936.

Al•Ith, drawn by its allure, tries to enter Zone Two, but finds an unworldly and inhospitable place and is told by invisible people {{that it is not}} her time yet. At the frontier of Zone Five, Ben Ata reluctantly marries Vahshi, a tribal leader of a band of nomads who terrorise the inhabitants of her zone. But Ben Ata's marriage to Al•Ith has changed him, and he disbands most of his armies in Zone Four, sending the soldiers home to rebuild their towns and villages and uplift their communities. He also slowly wins over Vahshi's confidence and persuades her to stop plundering Zone Five.|$|E
5|$|There are sixteen {{prominent}} vegetation {{zones in}} the San Juan watershed, which include riparian vegetation, montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Riparian vegetation is found {{along the banks}} of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months out of the year. These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Trabuco Creek, Cañada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while chaparral is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as giant reed, castor bean, and tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. Giant reed <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> huge areas of wetlands, swamps and riparian zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken steps toward eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams.|$|E
5|$|US {{cast members}} Kevin Clash and Marty Robinson have cast and trained the {{international}} puppeteers. At first, Muppet builder Kermit Love constructed the puppets {{for the new}} shows in the US. According to Gikow in 2009, Jim Henson's Creature Shop, overseen by Connie Peterson, <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> puppet creation. The producers of Sisimpur, the Bangladesh co-production, created their own traditional puppets because their puppet-making craft is thousands of years old and {{an important part of}} their culture. The producers of each co-production developed and built their own sets, live-action videos, and animations in-country. After they developed, produced, and aired the new show, they conducted research to ascertain whether their curriculum goals were met, just as was done in the US after the first season of Sesame Street. According to producer Nadine Zylstra, they faced unusual challenges rarely experienced in the US. For example, riots and conflicts between Serbs and Albanians in 2004 delayed production of the Kosovo co-production for three months. In 2005, a nationwide strike in Bangladesh temporarily stalled production of their show.|$|E
