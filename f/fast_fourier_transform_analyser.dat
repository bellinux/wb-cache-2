40|$|For speedier {{and more}} precise Q-measurements, a new system, {{based on a}} <b>Fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>Transform</b> <b>analyser,</b> has been developed. The Q-value is {{calculated}} in 2. 8 ms from 5 12 beam position measurements from one pick-up, sampled at the revolution frequency (- 0. 5 MHz). Amplitude distortion due to rectangular windowing is corrected using amplitude-interpolation based on (sin X) /X fit. Frequency interpolation is then applied. For a pure sine-wave, a precision ti. 0001 is thus obtained over a 30 dB input range, whilst for an oscillation with a coherence time of 80 ps the precision is still rtO. 001 over a 35 dB input range. To follow rapid changes of machine parameters, e. g. at transition, interleaving of measurements yields a Q-value every 1. 8 ms. The Digital Signal Processor memory can store up to 106 ms worth of beam samples for subsequent sliding-FFT analysis. 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop {{techniques}} to reliably identify, characterise and size emboli to help understand the clinical significance of such potentially devastating phenomena. Firstly a dual gated Doppler technique was developed to differentiate emboli from artefacts that produced excellent results when Doppler signals were analysed in the time domain. Several curious observations were noted, firstly the Doppler derived velocity did not correlate with the time of flight derived velocity, secondly the embolic signal duration in each sample gate was different, and finally an embolic signal was not always visible in both gates.;Another finding was the rapid frequency modulation apparent in some gaseous embolic signals. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this observation. Secondly attempts to differentiate gaseous from particulate emboli were investigated. The Wigner distribution analyser is presneted {{as an alternative to}} the conventional <b>fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>analyser</b> and allows significant time resolution improvements. The sample volume length (SVL) of embolic signals was investigated as a new parameter for classifying emboli and when compared with previous parameter was found to produce the best sensitivity and specificity.;Finally the embolus to blood ratio (EBR) model is explored to assess its feasibility for sizing particulate emboli. Both dual and single frequency transducers were constructed and their beam characteristics were studied. Significant beam distortion and focusing occurred when skull bone was placed in front of the transducer which no longer produced uniform vessel insonation (a major assumption of the EBR model). In vitro experiments using the single frequency technique showed considerable EBR variability due to beam refraction and with the addition of intervening skull bone there were further errors introduced due to beam focusing effects. Statistical analysis showed that the experimental emboli could not be reliability separated, even into two size groups. Further work to improve the sizing of emboli is discussed...|$|E
