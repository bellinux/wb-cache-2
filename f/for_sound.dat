5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (<b>for</b> <b>sound).</b> This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E

The game {{is one of the few}} N64 titles to have noticeable load times, disguised by the request 'Please Wait'. Load times between levels in Wipeout 64 are approximately a few seconds long due to the need <b>for</b> <b>sound</b> decompression, according to Psygnosis in a later interview with IGN. Psygnosis used the Nintendo 64's analogue stick to their benefit; thus rendering the D-Pad obsolete so that ships could respond quickly and more precisely in improvement regarding to the older games.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, MGM hired Hilliard {{away from}} UA. His first {{assignment}} was to fix their problematic recording amplifiers whose overall phase shift measured {{out to a}} voice-distorting 1500 degrees. Hilliard's solution was to use higher linearity transformers obtained from Lansing Manufacturing Company, in consultation with founder Jim Lansing. Earlier, Hilliard had befriended a laboratory associate of his wife's, Dr. John Blackburn, and in 1934, he helped Blackburn get a position as design engineer at Lansing Manufacturing. The following year, Hilliard and his team at MGM solved the problem of recording Nelson Eddy's strong operatic baritone alongside Jeanette MacDonald's flat and weak soprano voice, picking up an Academy Award <b>for</b> <b>Sound</b> Recording on the duo's first film together: Naughty Marietta.|$|E

5|$|In October 1927, Warner Bros. {{released}} The Jazz Singer, {{the first}} feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted Hollywood {{to convert from}} silent to sound film production en masse. The Radio Corporation of America (RCA) controlled an advanced optical sound-on-film system, RCA Photophone, recently developed by General Electric. However, its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and Fox, Hollywood's other vanguard sound studios, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of AT's Western Electric division. The industry's two largest major studios, Paramount and Loew's/MGM, with two other studios Universal and First National, were poised to contract with ERPI <b>for</b> <b>sound</b> conversion as well.|$|E

At the Taurus World Stunt Awards, stuntwoman Janene Carleton's jump on a moving truck won Best Overall Stunt by a Stunt Woman, {{and the film}} was nominated for Best Stunt Coordinator and/or 2nd Unit Director.

5|$|Streisand {{employed}} Jackson's mixing talents on her 1995 TV special called Barbra: The Concert. Along with Ed Greene and Bob La Masney {{who worked}} on post-production mixing, he received an Emmy Award <b>for</b> <b>sound</b> design and the mixing of the live show. Jackson designed the sound for Streisand's 1999–2000 , and he mixed the New Year's Eve concert 31 December 1999 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Paradise, Nevada. He mixed Streisand's appearances in Sydney and Melbourne in March 2000, connecting the large backing choir's sound mix by optical fibre from a nearby polo field where the choir was stationed. The fibre connection was Jackson's real-world test of a similar setup planned {{to be used for}} the Summer Olympics six months later.|$|E

Four months later, {{as part of a}} strategy conceived with RCA head David Sarnoff, Kennedy acquired control of Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO), a vaudeville exhibition chain with approximately one hundred theaters across the United States, and with the Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation under its control.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the subject began with the {{development}} in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the Doppler effect. The effect is named after Christian Doppler, who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed <b>for</b> <b>sound</b> waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot in 1845. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves, and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars {{could be attributed to}} their motion with respect to the Earth. Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star's temperature, not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.|$|E
5|$|While still {{a partner}} at Apogee, Jackson began touring with Barbra Streisand, mixing concert sound and serving as sound {{designer}} from 1993 to 2007.

Jackson worked on sound design for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and served as audio director for the opening and closing ceremonies.

Across four participants, demand was often higher and less elastic for points/money than <b>for</b> <b>sounds.</b> During subsequent exposures at each response requirement, demand <b>for</b> <b>sounds</b> often decreased {{to a greater}} degree than demand for points/money. Thus, sound-clips seem less durable than points/money across prices and across repeated exposure to the same price.
