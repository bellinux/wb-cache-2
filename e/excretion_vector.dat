40|$|Manduca diuresin (MD), a 30 {{amino acid}} peptide {{isolated}} from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, was found {{to play an important}} role in the regulation of water and salt balance in the insect. To facilitate studies relating to the function and structure of MD, a synthetic gene encoding MD was assembled and expressed in Escherichia coli. Using an <b>excretion</b> <b>vector,</b> expression of the MD gene in an induced transformant was detected at the transcriptional and translational levels by Northern-blot and ELISA analyses, respectively. With the use of glutathione-S-transferase as the reporter protein, MD was confirmed to be expressed in E. coli. The recombinant product was resolved by reverse-phase HPLC into three peptide groups of different retention times, which were shown by mass spectrometry to be composed of MD deletants missing various lengths of the C-terminus. Despite the deletions and the absence of an amidated C-terminus, the deletants were shown to be biologically active, suggesting the importance of the N-terminus of MD for biological activity.

40|$|A 4. 7 -kb DNA insert {{encoding}} a secretory cellobiase (Cba) was cloned from Cellulomonas biazotea in Escherichia coli {{using an}} <b>excretion</b> <b>vector,</b> pM. Host cells transformed with the recombinant construct, designated pBZ 4. 7, {{were able to}} utilize cellobiose as the sole carbon source. Part of the Cba activity encoded by pBZ 4. 7 could be detected in the periplasm {{and even in the}} culture supernatant. The Cba protein was purified from the culture supernatant and analysed by SDS-PAGE to have an apparent M-r of 86 000. The insert consisted of two PstI fragments with lengths of 0. 75 and 3. 95 kb, both of which were found to be crucial for expressing the Cba activity. Sequencing of the first 3. 95 kb of the insert revealed that the coding sequence for Cba, designated the cba gene, was 2484 bp long. Comparison of the deduced Cba sequence with those of published beta-glucosidases revealed a potential active site located at the N-terminal portion of the former. The cba gene has a high G+C content of 76. 4 % and is flanked by a putative ribosome-binding site and potential transcriptional termination signals upstream and downstream from its coding sequence, respectively.

40|$|During {{secretory}} or excretory {{production of}} heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli, peptidase processing cleaves the signal peptide {{off from a}} premature protein, which is then secreted as a mature product. Many proteins have been successfully expressed as secreted/excreted products in E. coli. However, {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF), despite its suitability for secretory/excretory production in E. coli, has never been successfully expressed using such an approach. In this communication, we report the application of a revolutionary E. coli system to the efficient expression of not only bFGF, but also human epidermal growth factor (EGF) concurrently, as authentic products in the culture supernatant (SN). More interestingly, both polypeptides were also shown to be present at high levels as authentic products in the cell lysate (CL). The manifestation of this unusual phenomenon required a collaborative action between construct pWKW 2, an efficient <b>excretion</b> <b>vector</b> engineered by our group to facilitate extracellular production of EGF, and the Sce VMA intein, which enables self-cleavage of protein sequences fused to it. Both bFGF and EGF derived from SN and CL were characterized to be bioactive. Moreover, despite employing only shake-flask cultivation, the total yields of bFGF and EGF recovered from both SN and CL were impressive, amounting to 103 and 74 mg l(- 1) of culture, respectively. The novel expression approach introduced herein may prove to be practically useful for the production {{of a wide range of}} proteins in the future...|$|E
40|$|Induced {{expression}} of a gene fusion between the ompA leader sequence and the Cellulomonas fimi cex gene encoding a secretory exoglucanase, Exg, engineered in the Tac-cassette <b>excretion</b> <b>vector</b> was lethal to Escherichia coli. An exponentially growing culture harboring the recombinant construct suffered slow growth and 99. 9 %, of its cells died within 60 - 100 min after induction. This abnormality {{was found to have}} a close correlation with the rapid increase in the relative amount of the OmpA/Exg fusion precursor (Pre-Exg) compared to its processed product (Mat-Exg). Analysis of subcellular fractions revealed the presence of Pre-Exg in the inner membrane of cultures expressing high levels but not low levels of Pre-Exg. As only Pre-Exg but not Mat-Exg was detectable in the cytoplasm, and Exg was shown by cross-linking experiments to be physically associated with the See proteins, it was concluded that secretion and processing of Pre-Exg took place in the SecYEG translocation machinery. The results were in line with the previous speculation that accumulation of unprocessed precursor proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane was detrimental, and supported the idea that cell death was caused by some unusual tie-up of Pre-Exg with the SecYEG translocation machinery, thus imposing an inhibitory effect on the secretion of endogenous secretory proteins. A new model, designated "Saturated Translocation," was proposed to explain the interchangeable lethal and non-lethal properties of Pre-Exg, and to address the possible scenarios that might occur in the course of cell death triggered by secretion of Pre-Exg.

40|$|A 4. 7 -kb DNA insert {{encoding}} a cellobiase was cloned from Cellulomonas biazotea in Escherichia coli {{using an}} <b>excretion</b> <b>vector,</b> pM, {{to form a}} recombinant construct, pBZ 4. 7. It is the first demonstration of an external production of a recombinant cellobiase of which part of the activity was detected in the periplasm and some could even be in the culture supematant. The cellobiase (Cba) was shown {{to be able to}} act synergistically in the hydrolysis of a packing material with an endoglucanase and an exoglucanase of Cellulomonas fimi produced as recombinant enzymes in E. coli. The purification of the Cba from the supematant of the induced JM 101 (pBZ 4. 7) was achieved by simply two purification steps: a gel-filtration chromatography followed by an anion-exchange chromatography. A mature Cba as analyzed by SDS-PAGE had an apparent molecular weight of about 86 kDa. The information suggested that the coding sequence for Cba, designated the cba gene, had a size of about 2. 6 kb. The purified Cba are used to immunized a rabbit, and an anti-Cba antibody of a titre of 50, 000 K was obtained for future work on the analysis and purification of Cba. DNA sequencing of the cba insert revealed that the coding sequence for Cba contained a single open reading frame of 2, 484 bp. The cba gene has a high G+C content of 76. 4 % and is flanked by a putative ribosomal-binding site and potential transcriptional termination signals upstream and downstream from its coding sequence, respectively.

40|$|A 4. 7 -kb DNA PstI {{partially}} restricted insert encoding a secretory cellobiase (Cba) {{was isolated}} from Cellulomonas biazotea and cloned into Escherichia coli using an <b>excretion</b> <b>vector,</b> pM, forming a recombinant construct, pBZ 4. 7. Using an E. coli JMlO 1 (pBZ 4. 7) transformant, extracellular {{production of the}} recombinant Cba. of which part the activity was detected in periplasm and part even in supernatant was demonstrated. Previous results from the purification of the excreted Cba revealed that the Cba had a molecular mass of about 86 kDa, suggesting {{the size of the}} encoding gene, designated cba, would be about 2. 7 kb in length. DNA sequencing revealed that the cba gene contained an "ATG" start codon 327 nucleotides away from the first PstI site of the insert and an open-reading frame of 2, 484 bp, which was terminated by "TGA" stop codon identified at 2814 nucleotide. The gene has a high G + C content of 76. 4 %. A putative ribosomal-binding site is identified a few bases upstream of the start codon. Three pairs of potential transcriptional termination signals are situated downstream of the stop codon. Comparison of the deduced protein sequence with other β-glucosidases revealed that there was a consensus region which might be the potential active site. The Asp 228 is found to be conserved in all the β-glucosidases compared. The cba gene is fused precisely to the ompA leader sequence in the pM vector {{under the influence of the}} tat promoter and IPTG induction to see whether the excretion of Cba could be enhanced. As a result of the lethal effect probably caused by both IPTG induction and the large size of the protein, the findings showed that there was an increase in the levels of excreted Cba at or before 2 hours but not at the later time points after induction. The cba gene was cloned into Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the yeast expression vector, pMV 2 Adel to form a recombinant construct p 43. Results from the expression of the yeast transformant harbouring p 43 showed that the recombinant Cba was intracellularly borne. The finding could result from the presence of the homologous signal peptide of the Cba, which interfered the secretion of the Cba mediated by the signal peptide of the yeast α-galactosidase enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Secretory {{production}} of recombinant proteins by E. coli has many advantages over intracellular production. Induced {{expression of a}} secretory exoglucanase, Exg, engineered in the Tac-cassette <b>excretion</b> <b>vector</b> was lethal to E. coli. An exponentially growing culture harboring the recombinant construct suffered slow growth and 99. 9 % of its cells died within 60 - 100 min after induction. Analysis of subcellular fractions revealed the presence of Pre-Exg in the inner membrane of cultures expressing high levels but not low levels of Pre-Exg. As only Pre-Exg but not Mat-Exg was detectable in the cytoplasm, and Exg was shown by cross-linking experiments to be physically associated with the Sec proteins, {{it was concluded that}} secretion and processing of Pre-Exg took place in the SecYEG translocation machinery. The results supported the idea that cell death was caused by some unusual tie-up of Pre-Exg with the SecYEG translocation machinery, thus imposing an inhibitory effect on the secretion of endogenous secretory proteins. A new model, designated 'Saturated Translocation', was proposed to explain the interchangeable lethal and non-lethal properties of Pre-Exg, and to address the possible scenarios that might occur in the course of cell death triggered by secretion of Pre-Exg. Furthermore, we propose here that the cell lysate ratio (Pre/Mat RQ) of the unprocessed precursor Exg protein (Pre-Exg) and its processed mature product (Mat-Exg) reflects the capacity of E. coli to secrete Exg. A Pre/Mat RQ of 20 / 80, designated the 'Critical Value (CV) ', was an important threshold measurement. A rise in the Pre/Mat RQ triggered a mass killing effect. The use of various secretion signal peptides did not improve the viability of cells expressing high levels of Pre-Exg under strong tac promoter control. However, use of the weaker vegG promoter in conjunction with a change in start codon of the spa leader sequence from ATG to TTG in a pM 1 vegGcexL plasmid construct resulted in a high level (0. 9 u ml- 1) of excreted Exg in shake-flask cultures. This was 50 % higher than the best result obtained from plasmid construct lacUV 5 par 8 cex, using the lacUV 5 promoter and the ompA leader sequence. Variations in the excreted Exg activities were attributable to differences in the Pre/Mat RQ values of the induced cultures harboring pM 1 vegGcexL and lacUV 5 par 8 cex. These values were 18 / 82 and 10 / 90, respectively. Employing fed-batch cultivation in two-liter fermentors, an induced JM 101 (pM 1 vegGcexL) culture yielded 4. 5 u ml- 1 of excreted Exg, which was over sevenfold greater than previously reported. Our results illustrate the successful application of the Pre/Mat RQ ratio as a guide to the attainment of a maximum level of secreted/excreted Exg...|$|E
40|$|Activity assays were {{conducted}} on five Cellulomonas strains, including C. biazotae, C. cartea, C. fimi, C. flavigena, and C. uda, {{to search for a}} suitable candidate of which a cellobiase gene encoding a secretory enzyme might be cloned. All these five strains were found to express activities on both MUG and pNFG substrates. When they were assayed for secretory pNPG activities in time-course studies, C. biazotea and C. flavigena were shown to produce increasing levels of activity during the early and mid log phases of growth. Concentrated supernatants of these two strains were further shown to be active on cellobiose substrate. Based on the these findings, C. biazotea and C. flavigene were selected as the donor hosts for the cloning of the cellobiase gene. The chromosomal DNAs of the two Cellulomonas species were partially digested with Pst I, and the restricted fragments were shotgun cloned into the <b>excretion</b> <b>vector</b> pM that had been cut with Pst I. E. coli transformants of the two types of recombinant plasmids were screened for activity on the MUG substrate. Out of the 5, 000 screened clones, 25 of them gave a positive result. When these clones were tested for growth in liquid medium containing cellobiose as the sole carbon source and along with IFTG induction, only one of them carrying C. biazotea recombinant DNA showed positive growth. The construct of this transformant was designated pBZ 4. 7. E. coli JMlOl containing pBZ 4. 7 was tested for the production of secretory cellobiase. Fractionated samples of an IPTG induced culture of it were monitored for proteins and tested for pNPG and cellobiase activities, {{as well as those of}} glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and β-lactamase. The results pointed to the fact that the β-glucosidase was a cellobiase and it was secretory and excretory in E. coli. The cellobiase gene insert in pBZ 4. 7 was shown by restriction analysis to consist of two Pst I fragments which were 0. 75 kb and 3. 95 kb in length,. respectively. These two fragments were shown to be contiguous on the C. biazotea genome by Southern hybridization. A deletant derivative of pBZ 4. 7, designated pBZ 4. 7 δP, was constructed by deleting the 0. 75 -kb Pst I fragment from the insert. This deletant mutant, when compared with pBZ 4. 7, was found to express a very low level of cellobiase activity in E. coli. However, when pBZ 4. 7 was compared with a frameshifted mutant, pBZ 4. 7 KS, for cellobiase expression, both of them were shown to express the same level of activity. The above findings supported that the 0. 75 -kb fragment was important for cellobiase expression, and that the cellobiase enzyme might employ its own signal peptide for secretion in E. coli. DNA sequencing performed on a portion of the 0. 75 -kb fragment has revealed that it contains a high G+C content, which is typical of Cellulomonas DNA...|$|E
