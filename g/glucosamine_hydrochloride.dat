When the data from both groups were pooled and analyzed, there was no statistically significant difference between groups taking glucosamine HCl, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine/chondroitin; and those taking an inactive placebo or the positive control, the prescription analgesic celecoxib. The authors of the study analyzed the moderate-to-severe pain group and found that in this group, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin was more effective at providing pain relief than the positive control with 79% of the glucosamine group reporting at least a 20% reduction in pain compared to 70% for celecoxib and only 54% reporting a similar reduction in the placebo group. However, the researchers caution that given the small size of the sub-group, these findings should be confirmed with further studies.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA), {{the most}} common form of arthritis, is a public health problem {{throughout}} the world. Several entities have been carefully investigated for the symptomatic and structural management of OA. This review evaluates published studies of the effect of glucosamine salts and chondroitin sulfate preparations on the progression of knee or hip OA. Despite multiple double-blind, controlled clinical trials of the use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in OA, controversy regarding the efficacy of these agents with respect to symptomatic improvement remains. Several potential confounders, including placebo response, use of prescription medicines versus over-the-counter pills or food supplements, or use of glucosamine sulfate versus <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> may have relevance when attempting to interpret the seemingly contradictory results of different clinical trials. The National Institutes of Health-sponsored GAIT (Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial) compared placebo, <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> chondroitin sulfate, a combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate and celecoxib in a parallel, blinded 6 -month multicentre study of patients with knee OA. This trial showed that <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and chondroitin sulfate alone or in combination did not reduce pain effectively in the overall group of patients with OA of the knee. However, exploratory analyses suggest that the combination of <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and chondroitin sulfate may be effective in the subgroup of patients with moderate-to-severe knee pain.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{affects a}} large segment of the aging {{population}} and is a major cause of pain and disability. At present, there is no specific treatment available to prevent or retard the cartilage destruction that occurs in OA. Recently, glucosamine sulfate has received attention as a putative agent that may retard cartilage degradation in OA. The precise mechanism of action of glucosamine is not known. We investigated the effect of glucosamine in an in vitro model of cartilage collagen degradation in which collagen degradation induced by activated chondrocytes is mediated by lipid peroxidation reaction. Lipid peroxidation in chondrocytes was measured by conjugated diene formation. Protein oxidation and aldehydic adduct formation were studied by immunoblot assays. Antioxidant effect of glucosamine was also tested on malondialdehyde (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances [TBARS]) formation on purified lipoprotein oxidation for comparison. Glucosamine sulfate and <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in millimolar (0. 1 to 50) concentrations specifically and significantly inhibited collagen degradation induced by calcium ionophore-activated chondrocytes. <b>Glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> did not inhibit lipid peroxidation reaction in either activated chondrocytes or in copper-induced oxidation of purified lipoproteins as measured by conjugated diene formation. <b>Glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited malondialdehyde (TBARS) formation by oxidized lipoproteins. Moreover, we show that <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> prevents lipoprotein protein oxidation and inhibits malondialdehyde adduct formation in chondrocyte cell matrix, suggesting that it inhibits advanced lipoxidation reactions. Together, the data suggest that the mechanism of decreasing collagen degradation in this in vitro model system by glucosamine may be mediated by the inhibition of advanced lipoxidation reaction, preventing the oxidation and loss of collagen matrix from labeled chondrocyte matrix. Further studies are needed to relate these in vitro findings to the retardation of cartilage degradation reported in OA trials investigating glucosamine...|$|E

Medical management of OA involves acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other analgesics, all of which are of variable efficacy and are associated with significant side effects and toxicities. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the efficacy of glucosamine and chondroitin, both as single agents and in combination, for the treatment of knee OA. Also evaluated were the level of evidence and funding support of the included articles. Almost every included trial of glucosamine sulfate, <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> and chondroitin sulfate has found the safety of these compounds to be equal to that of placebo, though their therapeutic efficacy in decreasing knee OA pain and improving joint function is variable. Additionally, there are data to support a role of these agents in reducing radiographic progression of knee OA. Industry involvement, however, remains prominent. Further, more comprehensive study by independent researchers free of industry ties is necessary to identify a subset of patients in whom the use of glucosamine and/or chondroitin would be most beneficial. These agents may be safely tried as an initial therapy in select OA patients prior to initiating therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and other traditional medications.

40|$|Is chondroitin sulfate plus {{glucosamine}} {{superior to}} placebo {{in the treatment}} of knee osteoarthritis? We read with interest the article by Hochberg et al 1 related to the efficacy and safety of chondroitin sulfate plus <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (CS+GH) versus celecoxib in patients with knee osteoarthritis and severe pain. The study suggested that CS +GH has comparable efficacy to celecoxib in reducing pain, stiffness, functional limitation and joint swelling/effusion after 6 months with a good safety profile. These results were ‘promis-ing’. We really appreciate the work that was done by the authors. However, there are worthwhile issues that need to be explored. The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial without placebo arm. The authors explained that, ‘The use of a placeb...|$|E
40|$|Osteoarthrosis (OA) is {{the most}} common joint disease {{affecting}} both men and men. There is primary and secondary OA. Up to now, the causes of primary OA remain unclear. Secondary OA is associated with the presence of joint injury in the history, with congenital anomalies of the structure, metabolic diseases, endocrinopathies, etc. It is particularly difficult to interpret coxarthrosis if there are signs offemoroacetabular impingement. Periarticular pathology {{plays an important role in}} the origin of the hip pain syndrome that accompanies or mimics the symptoms of coxarthrosis. The main goals of OA therapy are to slow down the progression of cartilage degeneration and to maintain joint function as much as possible. Combination drugs containing chondroitin sulfate and <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> are widely used to treat OA today...|$|E
40|$|Osteo{{arthritis}} is {{the most}} common arthritis in the world. It affects millions of people with age being the greatest risk factor for developing the disease. The burden of disease will worsen with the aging of the world’s population. The disease causes pain and functional disability. The direct costs of osteoarthritis include hospital and physician visits, medications, and assistive services. The indirect costs include work absences and lost wages. Many studies have sought to find a therapy to relieve pain and reduce disability. <b>Glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (HCl) is one of these therapies. There are limited studies of glucosamine HCl in humans. Although some subjects do report statistically significant improvement in pain and function from products combining glucosamine HCl and other agents, glucosamine HCl by itself appears to offer little benefit to those suffering from osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|Osteoarthritis is a slowly {{progressive}} and debilitating disease that affects canines of all breeds. Pain and decreased mobility resulting from osteoarthritis {{often have a}} negative impact on the affected canine’s quality of life, level of comfort, daily functioning, activity, behaviour, and client-pet companionship. Despite limited and conflicting evidence, the natural products <b>glucosamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (HCl) and chondroitin sulfate are commonly recommended by veterinarians for treating osteoarthritis in dogs. There is a paucity of well-designed clinical veterinary studies investigating the true treatment effect of glucosamine and chondroitin. The purposes of this review article are to provide a brief background on glucosamine and chondroitin use in canine osteoarthritis and to critically review the available literature on the role of these products for improving clinical outcomes. Based on critical review, recommendations for practice are suggested and a future study design is proposed...|$|E

The {{behavior of}} the benzoxazinone towards a selected sulfur nucleophile, L-cysteine, has also been discussed. Formation of an amidine salt as a reaction intermediate has been assumed. The effect of solvent in some reactions has been elucidated. The structures of all the novel quinazoline and quinazolinone derivatives, obtained by heterocyclic ring opening and ring closure were inferred by the IR, MS as well as 1 H-NMR spectral analysis. Moreover, the antimicrobial potential {{of some of the}} new synthesized derivatives has been evaluated...|$|E
