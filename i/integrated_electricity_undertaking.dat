30|$|In this paper, {{a coordinated}} {{operation}} model of energy system which <b>integrates</b> <b>electricity</b> {{and natural gas}} infrastructures is formulated. The model includes constraints for both electricity and natural gas transmission networks. Then, a three-stage robust optimization algorithm is presented to solve the defender-attacker-defender problem of the integrated energy system when contingencies occur. The constraints and operational features of natural gas system and the coupling of electricity and natural gas networks make it more complicated to settle the plans for both attackers and defenders. In the first stage, as defender, the integrated energy system must make plans for network enhancement to minimize {{the damage caused by}} unpredictable attacks. In the second stage, attackers will attack vulnerable components of electricity and natural gas networks to cause maximum damage to the entire energy system. In the last stage, defender responds to the results of disruptions, which is formulated as optimal energy flow of <b>integrated</b> <b>electricity</b> and natural gas system. As some of the constraints of electricity and natural gas transmission networks are nonlinear, Taylor series expansion algorithm is applied to realize the linearization. Then, the proposed three-stage robust optimization problem is reformulated into a two-stage optimization problem by the application of duality theory. The two-stage problem can be solved as an MILP by decomposition algorithms.|$|R

30|$|Although {{these three}} {{regional}} energy interconnection {{have been constructed}} for some time, electricity trade among Middle East countries has remained modest due to different challenges and problems.

The physical challenges such as non-existent grid energy interconnection between the GCC and other Middle East countries make the trade between them currently limited. The structural and institutional challenges like the vertically <b>integrated</b> <b>electricity</b> markets in most countries in this region result in state-owned monopolies and make the international trade more complicated.

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} {{internal}} and external legal and policy challenges that the EU faces in creating a sustainable, competitive and secure internal energy market. It also examines the EU’s concrete efforts to <b>integrate</b> <b>electricity</b> from renewable energy sources into the energy system. The internal policy objectives of sustainable development, competitiveness and security of supply are interrelated. In order to take concrete action in the energy policy area, it is important that these objectives are consistently applied. This article also analyses the interrelationship between these three policy objectives, as well as their relationship to the objective of <b>integrating</b> <b>electricity</b> from renewable energy sources. Although there are ambiguities in the relationship between the achievement of an internal energy market based on the three internal policy objectives and the integration of electricity from renewable energy sources into the energy system, there is also a clear positive connection with the integration of electricity from renewable energy sources into the energy system. This is, for instance, displayed by: the potential to reduce the dependence on energy imports from primary conventional energy sources; a potential diversification of the energy mix; and new market entrants. The integration of electricity from renewable energy sources into the energy system has a potential role to play as a long‐term policy remedy in the EU’s external energy relations and should receive greater focus in the interface between {{the internal and}} the external policy challenges that the EU faces today in establishing a sustainable, competitive and secure internal energy market, since the latter is intended to be consistently applied both internally and externally. ...|$|R
