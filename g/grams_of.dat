40|$|Phyllanthus amarus {{is known}} as a healing herb which has {{traditionally}} been used in the treatment of various diseases such as hepatitis, diabetes and cancer. The extraction parameters have great effects on the extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds and pharmacological activity of the extracts. This study sought to optimise the microwave-assisted extraction parameters for phenolic compounds-enriched extracts and antioxidant capacity from P. amarus using response surface methodology (RSM). The results showed that the optimal microwave-assisted extraction parameters were an extraction time of 30 min, an irradiation time of 14 s min − 1 and a ratio of solvent to sample of 150 mL g − 1. The total phenolic content, phenolic extraction efficiency, saponin content, 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging capacity, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryl-hydrazil (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power of the P. amarus achieved under these optimal parameters were 87. 3 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> dried sample, 69. 7 %, 134. 9 mg of escin equivalents (EE) per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> dried sample, 997. 8, 604. 7 and 437. 3 all in mg of trolox equivalents (TE) per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> dried sample, respectively, which were not significantly different from the predicted values (86. 9 mg <b>of</b> GAE per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> dried sample, 67. 3 %, 123. 5 mg <b>of</b> EE per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> dried sample, 1013. 3 mg <b>of</b> TE per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> dried sample, 530. 6 mg <b>of</b> TE per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> dried sample and 423. 5 mg <b>of</b> TE per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> dried sample, respectively).

40|$|High {{levels of}} LDL {{cholesterol}} {{can lead to}} heart disease because of clogging and hardening of the arteries. One of the medicinal plants that can reduce levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood is a bay leaf. The content of flavonoids and tannins in the bay leaves serves to lower levels of fat and cholesterol in the blood.  This study aims {{to determine the effect}} of decoction of bay leaves (Eugenia polyantha Wight.) to the decrease LDL cholesterol level in mice (Rattus norvegicus) with hypercholesterolemia.  This study is purely experimental research with Pre and Post Test With Control Group Design, using 25 white rats as experimental animals were divided into five groups, which are the positive control group, three treatment groups and the comparison group. LDL cholesterol levels were measured by the method of Precipitation Reagent For In Vitro Determination of LDL cholesterol with the CHOD-PAP by photometric systems. Data were analyzed descriptively and statistically using One Way ANOVA test and t-test independent sample. Descriptive analysis found the percentage of the decrease of serum LDL cholesterol levels in mice of hypercholesterolemia at doses 0. 18 gram/ 200 <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> weight was 25. 96 %, at dosess 0. 27 gram/ 200 <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> weight was 23 : 45 %, and at doses 0. 36 gram/ 200 <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> weight was 35. 94 %. Results of One Way ANOVA test showed a significance of 0. 000 which means there is the effect of decoction of bay leaves to the decrease of LDL cholesterol levels in mice with hypercholesterolemia. T-test results found that the decoction of bay leaves at doses 0. 36 gram/ 200 <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> weight lowers LDL cholesterol levels were comparable with administration of simvastatin at doses 0. 18 mg/ 200 <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> weight (P > 0. 05).
