40|$|A {{versatile}} {{new instrument}} measures ac voltages with high accuracy from 20 c/s to 100 kc/s {{by comparing the}} unknown to a precision dc voltage. It also measures dc voltages to 0. 02 Oh and supplies high-resolution dc voltages. THE accuracy of ac voltage measurements has always been tempered {{by the lack of}} a primary standard of ac voltage. It is thus necessary to measure ac voltages in terms of related dc voltages that in turn can be referenced to a basic standard. Highest accuracy in ac voltage measurements is achieved by a substitution technique that uses vacuum thermocouples to relate the ac to an accuratelyknown clc. Highly refined versions of this technique achieve accuracies of 0. 01 % but painstaking, time-consuming, laboratory procedures are required for this level of accuracy. A new instrument now makes it possible to make ac voltage measurements to better than 0. 05 % accuracy in fewer steps and without the environmental restrictions or precautionary measures required of thermocouple measurements. The new instrument uses a precision rectifying circuit to convert the unknown ac directly to dc, and the resulting tlc is read to 5 -placc r~solz~tion by a <b>differential</b> <b>voltmeter</b> technique. The measurement is straightforward in Fig. 1. New-hp- Model 741 A AC/DC Differential VoltmeterlDC Standard makes highly accurate measurements of ac voltages as well as serving as dc <b>differential</b> <b>voltmeter</b> and as stable source of dc voltages. As shown here, ac dzfferential voltmeter function is useful for rallbrating oscillators and for making long term omplrtude stability measurements that the ac remains connected to the converter at all times and can be monitoretl continuously...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{instrument that}} generates precise, high-resolution dc voltages for calibration work {{is also a}} precision differential dc voltmeter with a constant and very high input impedance. As MEASURING accuracy improves, so grows the need for higher accuracy in calibration procedures. The ever-expanding usage of high resolution digital voltmeters, for instance, has accentuated the need for calibration instruments that have absolute accuracies of better than O. Ol%, along with commensurate stability, linearity, and repeatability. Performance at this level, formerly found only in laboratory grade instrumert. now is wanted in instruments that also have the sturdiness and ease of operation required for everyday workbench service. Most dc calibrations are performed with three basic instruments: (1) a stable dc voltage source, which can be referenced to a standard cell or some known voltage source for absolute accuracy; (2) a high resolution voltage divider, for reducing the stable source voltage with a linearity suffi-Fig. 1. DC StandardlDifferential Voltmeter serves either as a precision source of de voltages or as a <b>differential</b> <b>voltmeter</b> for making measurements with 6 -place resolution. Four most significant digits of reading are displayed on illuminated numerals and two least significant digits are on meter. Exceptionally high input impedance (>lo ' ohms on most ranges) in voltmeter mode is maintained regardless of null condition, enabling precision measurements on standard cells, voltage dividers, and other devices sensitive to loading. Both input and output are fully floating and guarded...|$|E
