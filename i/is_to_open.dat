25|$|One {{simple way}} to reduce the heat of {{decanting}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops are present in the pipe-work to reduce vibration.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can aspirate the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the free flow valve, preferably before vomiting, and to inhale as carefully as possible. If there is no free flow valve, as on a full face mask, the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting the bottom edge away from the face to let in some water, before purging again.|$|E

The plan called for first one, then ultimately four plants to be built at the site, but it was dropped after strong opposition from environmental groups, and Ireland has remained without nuclear power since. Despite opposing nuclear power (and nuclear fuel reprocessing at Sellafield), Ireland <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> an interconnector to the mainland UK to buy electricity, which is, in some part, the product of nuclear power.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch and Flemish {{call this}} day Driekoningen, while German {{speakers}} call it Dreikönigstag (Three Kings' Day). In the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and neighboring Germany, children {{in groups of}} three (symbolising the three kings) proceed in costume {{from house to house}} while singing songs typical for the occasion, and receiving a coin or some sweets at each door. They may each carry a paper lantern symbolizing the star. In some places, especially Holland, these troupes gather for competitions and present their skits/songs for an audience. As in Belgium, Koningentaart (Kings' tart), puff pastry with almond filling, is prepared with a black bean hidden inside. Whoever finds the bean in his or her piece is king or queen for the day. A more typically Dutch version is Koningenbrood, or Kings' bread. Another Low Countries tradition on Epiphany <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> up doors and windows to let good luck in for the coming year.|$|E

500|$|The 19S {{regulatory}} particle {{is responsible}} for stimulating the 20S to degrade proteins. A primary function of the 19S regulatory ATPases <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the gate in the 20S that blocks the entry of substrates into the degradation chamber. The mechanism by which the proteasomal ATPase open this gate has been recently elucidated. 20S gate opening, and thus substrate degradation, requires the C-termini of the proteasomal ATPases, which contains a specific motif (i.e., HbYX motif). The ATPases C-termini bind into pockets {{in the top of}} the 20S, and tether the ATPase complex to the 20S proteolytic complex, thus joining the substrate unfolding equipment with the 20S degradation machinery. Binding of these C-termini into these 20S pockets by themselves stimulates opening of the gate in the 20S in much the same way that a [...] "key-in-a-lock" [...] opens a door. The precise mechanism by which this [...] "key-in-a-lock" [...] mechanism functions has been structurally elucidated.|$|E

[...] Later in his life, during a visit to the Jewish Theological Seminary, he encountered the Talmud for the first time and remarked that it contained a medieval kind of reasoning and was a wonderful book.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} and Universal considered opening Changeling wide {{in its first}} weekend to capitalize on Jolie's perceived box office appeal, but they ultimately modeled the release plan after those of other Eastwood-directed films, Mystic River in particular. While the usual strategy <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> films by notable directors in every major city in the United States to ensure a large opening gross, in what the industry calls a [...] "platform release", Eastwood's films generally open in {{a small number of}} theaters before opening wide a week later. Changeling was released in 15 theaters in nine markets in the United States on October 24, 2008. The marketing strategy involved trailers that promoted Eastwood's involvement and the more commercial mystery thriller elements of the story. Universal hoped the limited release would capitalize on good word-of-mouth support from [...] "serious movie fans" [...] rather than those in the 1825-year-old demographic. The film was released across North America on October 31, 2008, playing at 1,850 theaters, expanding to 1,896 theaters by its fourth week. Changeling was released in the United Kingdom on November 26, 2008, in Ireland on November 28, 2008, and in Australia on February 5, 2009.|$|E
