Upon Garner's casting, {{after reading the}} script she expressed: [...] "I had heard about it, and I had seen pictures of Matthew losing weight.

500|$|For me, I {{was a new}} {{actor to}} Los Angeles, didn’t know the TV {{business}} very well so I was just excited to work and play a vampire. I had no clue what I {{was going to do}} or <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be scary. Until that is, they put the vampire makeup on me and I went into the trailer and smiled, which I thought was creepy. Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E
500|$|Hendrickson told TVSource {{magazine}} {{that she was}} [...] "petrified" [...] of filming the heavily emotional storyline. She stated, [...] "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone [...] I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what scared me the most – <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to find it within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I {{would love to see}} {{a little bit of the}} old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced. I think it would make a lot of sense." ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{instalment}} of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets {{appeared in the}} 10 January 1929 edition of , and ran weekly until 8 May 1930. Hergé did not plot out the storyline in advance; he improvised new situations on a weekly basis, leaving Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier to observe that both [...] "Story-wise and graphically, Hergé was learning his craft before our eyes." [...] Hergé admitted that the work was rushed, saying, [...] "The [...] came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get Tintin out of the predicament I had {{put him in the}} previous week." [...] Michael Farr considered this evident, remarking that many drawings were [...] "crude, rudimentary, [...] rushed", lacking the [...] "polish and refinement" [...] that Hergé would later develop. Contrastingly, he thought that certain plates were of the [...] "highest quality" [...] and exhibited Hergé's [...] "outstanding ability as a draughtsman".|$|E
500|$|Tintin in the Congo was serialised {{under the}} French title of Tintin au Congo in Le Petit Vingtième from 5 May 1930 to 11 June 1931; it was {{syndicated}} to the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants. Drawn {{in black and}} white, it followed the same formula employed in Land of the Soviets, remaining [...] "essentially plotless" [...] according to Michael Farr, and consisting of largely unrelated events that Hergé improvised each week. Hergé later commented {{on the process of}} writing these early adventures, stating, [...] "The [...] came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week." [...] The strip's visual style was similar to that of Land of the Soviets. In the first instalment of Tintin in the Congo, Hergé featured Quick and Flupke, two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another Le Petit Vingtième comic strip, in the crowd of people saying goodbye to Tintin.|$|E
500|$|Reba McEntire {{began work}} on her 24th studio album, , by {{creating}} a [...] "wish list" [...] of pop and country singers that {{she would like to}} duet with. After completing her residency show at the Las Vegas Hilton, McEntire began reaching out to the artists on her list, by phone and e-mail. She came into contact with Justin Timberlake through Joanna García, who portrayed McEntire's daughter on the sitcom Reba and was dating Timberlake's friend Trace Ayala. Timberlake and McEntire {{met for the first time}} at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony on February 11, 2007. She asked him to be a part of the project, to which he replied: [...] "Okay, great, I'll write something. Is that okay?". McEntire was skeptical at first, unsure of [...] "what he was going to bring back to [...] ". According to McEntire, she didn't know if the song was going to be [...] "SexyBack 2, 3 or 4". She revealed: [...] "I was really nervous. I didn't know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say no to a song I didn't like if Justin had written it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] said Mrs. Archibald to Clyde, [...] "exactly <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> {{to assert}} myself to-day, but I shall do {{it one way}} or the other; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> left out in the cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Instead of that," [...] said I, {{plucking}} up more {{grass and}} chewing a blade or two, [...] "see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and--what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody {{had told me}} so!" ...|$|R
500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Nick's mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott), {{his father}} Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) adored Sharon and {{maintained}} a paternal {{relationship with her}} over the years. Case described Victor as being Sharon's hero and a [...] "father figure". However, their dynamic changes in January 2012 when Victor marries Sharon {{so that she can}} protect his assets while he is in jail; the non-romantic marriage is annulled days later. Several months later, they become romantically involved. Joshua Morrow told Soaps In Depth that he was puzzled as to why Nick had no [...] "legitimate anger" [...] about the relationship, while Braeden was also unhappy with the storyline, stating: [...] "We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, but you do it." [...] Case described the relationship as incestuous: [...] "Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things", calling it [...] "upsetting to the audience". The actress was also unfavorable of Sharon marrying Victor in August 2012, believing the writers could have handled the storyline other ways. The short-lived marriage between Victor and Sharon was considered an [...] "inside joke" [...] for the actors. Reflecting on the storyline, Case revealed: [...] "I didn’t understand <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to sell a love story between Sharon and Victor for obvious reasons. What motivated Sharon {{to fall in love with}} Victor when she’s in love with Adam and Nick?" ...|$|E
500|$|The third ODI saw {{a change}} of venue; the teams moving from Dhaka to the coastal town of Chittagong. England again made two bowling changes, seamers Shahzad and Liam Plunkett coming into {{the team with the}} injured Broad and spinner Tredwell making way. Bangladesh {{remained}} unchanged from the second ODI. The hosts won their first toss of the series, and put England into bat. Kieswetter bucked his natural game and played cautiously: when partner Cook was dismissed for 32 in the 13th over, he had scored 20 off 33 balls. The opener continued to accumulate runs carefully until he reached his half-century in the 33rd over. After passing the milestone, he began to score quicker, cutting and driving as he shared a 74-run partnership with Collingwood. He reached his century with a scampered run off Rubel Hossain, his first in international cricket, in his third ODI appearance. At 22 years and 97 days old, he became the second youngest England batsman to score an ODI century after David Gower. In contrast to the [...] "all-action" [...] style that had been expected from him, Kieswetter accrued his century with resolve, saying after the match that: [...] "In the first two games I wasn't quite aware tactically of <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to pace my innings, [...] helping the team win the game. Today I tried to pace myself a bit more, and try to get myself in more before playing big shots." [...] His dismissal soon after his century brought Wright to the crease with the freedom to make an aggressive cameo, notching 32 runs off just 13 balls to help England towards a total of 284.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> {{to take it}} easy, if I can't get work," [...] {{answered}} Andy, soberly. [...] "A fellow can't live on air. Of course, I can go out {{hunting and}} fishing and all that, but that isn't earning a regular living." ...|$|R

2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E
2500|$|... "My left hook was a heat-seeking missile, {{careening}} off {{his face}} and body time and again. Twice {{in the second round}} I knocked him to the canvas. But as I pounded away, I felt a jolt of pain shoot through my left arm. Oh damn, the thumb." [...] Joe would say. Joe knew immediately the thumb of his left hand was damaged, though he wasn't sure as to the extent. [...] "In the midst of the fight, with your adrenaline pumping, it's hard to gauge such things. My mind was on more important matters. Like <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to deal with Yemelyanov {{for the rest of the}} fight." [...] The match ended when the Soviet's handlers threw in the towel at 1:49 in the second round, and the referee raised Joe's injured hand in victory.|$|E
2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{that reminds}} me," [...] said Eustace; [...] "about money, you know. I don't quite see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> {{to pay for}} all this game.

This {{is true to}} an extent; the book is an academic behemoth of research and data, but Dudchenko guides the reader through it with engaging anecdotes that inject a personal flair into the hard science.
