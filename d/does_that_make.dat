I asked for clarification– after all, Run DMC and LL Cool J are {{considered}} old-school, but technically, they invented the new school. The response: 'I don't know, some Tribe Called Quest or something.' After gently picking my jaw from off the floor, I turned back to my crates and wondered to myself, 'If Tribe is old-school, what <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> Kurtis Blow?

500|$|Discussing Izzie's {{relationship}} with Alex in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that [...] "Even when Alex {{was a complete}} dirtbag to her , she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over. [...] To go for {{a guy like that}} is to say I want to be damaged.'" [...] Writer Stacy McKee deemed Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with [...] "the undeniably handsome - and totally charming" [...] Denny. Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she's around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny." [...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? [...] She cut the LVAD wire for love so <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> her action understandable?" ...|$|E
500|$|In the release, Steven Grover, BK Vice President of Global Food Safety, Quality Assurance, and Regulatory Compliance, {{confirmed}} the factuality of the QSR report {{and that if}} the dispute between the growers and the CIW continues, the company would go forward with its plans to stop purchasing tomatoes from farms in the Immokalee region. The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference. Speaking on the dispute, Grover stated, [...] "We’re {{being asked to do}} something that we have legal questions about. We want {{to find a way to}} make sure that workers are protected and receive a decent wage." [...] CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move, stating, [...] "...farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region, but many do not have a human rights organization, such as the CIW, to stand up for their interests. Running away from the scene of the crime, <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> you any more innocent? Are they really willing to pay an exorbitantly higher transportation cost to bring in tomatoes from overseas or Mexico and pass that on to their customers rather than pay a penny more per pound?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} {{primarily}} filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, {{which is the}} headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are genuine medical supplies, including the MRI machine. Prior to being cast, Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives, in her Broadway performance of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, which ultimately led in her choosing Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", a statement she deemed rare. Ramirez's character was given recurring status in the second season, having been conceived as a love interest for George O'Malley. At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Grey's relationship. When asked of this, Torres said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] Discussing Izzie Stevens' relationship with Alex Karev, Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him, assessing that: [...] "Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her, she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over." [...] Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny, regarded by her as [...] "undeniably handsome and totally charming". Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she’s around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny."

Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the wire for love so <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> her action understandable?" [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn't know this was coming." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} archetypes for Bond girls: those who assist him, femme fatales (who invariably make an attempt on Bond's life), sacrificial lambs (female associates of Bond who wind up dead) and romantic interests. Since it is debatable whether certain girls fulfill certain tropes (i.e. If Bond kisses a girl <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> her a romantic interest? Is Pussy Galore a [...] "femme fatale" [...] {{due to her}} being in league with Goldfinger?) the following criteria are used for determining inclusion: women with whom sexual encounters are implied; the woman who principally assists Bond; femme fatales are taken to be women who attempt to kill Bond; sacrificial lambs are taken to be women with an allegiance to Bond whose death is instigated by the main villain or his henchmen.|$|E

2500|$|John Koster, a Republican congressional {{candidate}} in Washington's 1st District, was asked after a campaign fundraiser on October 28, 2012, about exceptions from abortion prohibition for rape and incest victims. He said, [...] "Incest is so rare, I mean, it's so rare...But the rape thingyou know, I know {{a woman who}} was raped and kept the child, gave it up for adoption, and she doesn't regret it." [...] He added, [...] "On the rape thing, it's like, how does putting more violence onto a woman's body and taking the life of an innocent child that's a consequence of this crimehow <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> it better?

Koster acknowledged that his comments may have caused him to lose the election in Washington's most competitive district.|$|E
2500|$|For scenes where Peyton {{is drawing}} or painting, Ward stated, [...] "...there {{would likely be}} very light lines for her to follow. Often I would give a {{finished}} version and an unfinished for this purpose. If I remember correctly, it was usually the words that I left undone." [...] Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, [...] "I {{look back at the}} first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but I think her style also evolved to fit mine. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> sense?" [...] Ward clarified, [...] "Initially I was trying to do something that just didn’t flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all the way I liked to work." [...] Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2016, the Investigative Project on Terrorism {{published}} a 2010 {{speech in which}} Ellison asked why the United States {{foreign policy in the}} Middle East [...] "is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people. A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> sense? Is that logic?" [...] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) effectively announced its opposition to Ellison's candidacy, issuing a press release saying that his statement [...] "raises serious concerns about whether Ellison faithfully could represent the Democratic Party's traditional support for a strong and secure Israel." [...] CNN also reported on his past support for anti-Semitic and radical organizations and individuals, particularly the Nation of Islam and Louis Farrakhan, but noted they found no anti-Semitic writings or public statements by Ellison, and cited his public rejection of the group [...] "due to its propagation of bigoted and anti-Semitic ideas and statements". The New York Times reported that one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, Haim Saban, said in his 2016 foreign policy forum that Ellison is [...] "clearly an anti-Semitic and anti-Israel person.” Reporters from the Washington Post, Slate and the Huffington Post have described this as part of a smear campaign against Ellison, and note that Ellison's rivals agreed that Saban should apologize for the comments. Schumer replied to critics, saying that Ellison has supported pro-Israeli policies within the Democratic Party, telling The Atlantic that [...] "while I disagree with some of [...] past positions, I saw him orchestrate one of the most pro-Israel platforms in decades by successfully persuading other skeptical committee members to adopt such a strong platform." ...|$|E
