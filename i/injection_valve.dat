The final device uses the peristaltic pumps to continuously direct sample from a reservoir containing a mixture of analytes to <b>injection</b> <b>valves</b> that are coupled with microchip electrophoresis and amperometric detection.

Typically the valve has three positions for loading the sample loop, for injecting the sample from the loop into the column, and for connecting the pumps {{directly to the}} waste line to wash them or change buffer solutions. The <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> has a sample loading port through which the sample can be loaded into the injection loop, usually from a hypodermic syringe using a Luer-lock connection.|$|E
50|$|The {{cataract}} {{first appeared}} on Newcomen engines in Cornwall, although their inventor is unknown. They were known in Smeaton's time, {{and they may be}} another of the developments to Newcomen's engine for which he was responsible. James Watt encountered these on his trip to Cornwall in 1777. They were of a simpler type, these early cataracts or 'jack in the box' were a simple tumbling box: a wooden box on a pivot was filled with water through an adjustable cock. When the box was filled sufficiently to overbalance, the engine's <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> would be triggered.|$|E

50|$|If {{the control}} circuit for oxygen {{injection}} fails, the usual mode {{is that the}} injection of oxygen into the loop to compensate for metabolic consumption by the diver will cease, and unless action is taken, the breathing gas will become hypoxic, with potentially fatal consequences.An alternative mode of failure is that the <b>injection</b> <b>valves</b> are kept open, which {{will result in a}} hyperoxic gas mix in the loop.|$|R
5000|$|To {{start the}} engine, the {{regulator}} valve V was opened and steam admitted into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston. The regulator valve was then {{closed and the}} water <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> V briefly snapped open and shut, sending a spray of cold water into the cylinder. This condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum under the piston. Pressure differential between the atmosphere above the piston and the partial vacuum below then drove the piston down making the power stroke, bringing the beam [...] "into the house" [...] and raising the pump gear.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} of these was the 'pickle pot' condenser, a device with the advantages of the separate condenser yet avoiding, barely, the Watt patent. As Watt's patent for the separate condenser ran from 1769 to 1800, these patent-avoiding devices can often be dated to this period: after their invention by Watt, but before the Watt device could simply be copied directly. The Engine also shows evidence of a patched hole {{in the side of the}} cylinder, where the original Newcomen <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> was removed. The pickle-pot condenser is an extension below the cylinder connected by a large diameter pipe. A jet condenser within this works in the same way as the separate Watt condenser. The Watt condenser is attached by a longer, narrow pipe to the cylinder. By claiming that the pickle pot was an 'extension' of the main cylinder, rather than a separate component, it avoided infringing the Watt patent. A requirement for this was also that the haystack boiler was moved away from its traditional Newcomen position, directly beneath the cylinder. This was an innovation described by John Curr in his The Coal Viewer & Engine Builder's Companion of 1797.|$|E

It was found that the moving air had little effect on the spray penetration except with the 0. 006 inch orifice. The moving air did, however, affect the oil particles on the outside of the spray cone. After spray cut-off, the air flow rapidly distributed the atomized fuel throughout the spray chamber...|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes Benz Actros is {{equipped}} with two types of engines. The OM 501 LA-541 and the OM 502 LA-542. The OM 501 is a 12-litre V6, and has outputs ranging from 310 HP to 480 HP. The engine management system employed by this engine is the PLD (Pumpe Leitung Duese-German abbr) which incorporates single plug-in pumps for each cylinder supplying fuel under pressure (up to 1,600 bar) to the <b>injection</b> <b>valves.</b> A control unit MR monitors all engine operating conditions via several sensors and varies the injection pressure to suit each operating condition.|$|R
5000|$|In early versions, {{the valves}} or plugs {{as they were}} then called, were {{operated}} manually by the plug man but the repetitive action demanded precise timing, making automatic action desirable. This was obtained {{by means of a}} plug tree which was a beam suspended vertically alongside the cylinder from a small arch head by crossed chains, its function being to open and close the valves automatically when the beam reached certain positions, by means of tappets and escapement mechanisms using weights. On the 1712 engine, the water feed pump was attached {{to the bottom of the}} plug tree, but later engines had the pump outside suspended from a separate small arch-head. There is a common legend that in 1713 a cock boy named Humphrey Potter, whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended, made the engine self-acting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches (known as the [...] "potter cord"); however the plug tree device (the first form of valve gear) was very likely established practice before 1715, and is clearly depicted in the earliest known images of Newcomen engines by Henry Beighton (1717) (believed by Hulse to depict the 1714 Griff colliery engine) and by Thomas Barney (1719) (depicting the 1712 Dudley Castle engine). Because of the very heavy steam demands, the engine had to be periodically stopped and restarted, but even this process was automated by means of a buoy rising and falling in a vertical stand pipe fixed to the boiler (the first pressure gauge?). The buoy was attached to the scoggen, a weighted lever that worked a stop blocking the water <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> shut until more steam had been raised.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation to determine the coefficients of discharge of nozzles with small, round orifices of the size used with high-speed compression-ignition engines. The injection pressures and chamber back pressures employed were comparable to those existing in compression-ignition engines during injection. The construction of the nozzles was varied to determine the effect of the nozzle design on the coefficient. Tests were also made with nozzles assembled in an automatic <b>injection</b> <b>valve,</b> both with a plain and with a helically grooved stem. It was found that a smooth passage before the orifice is requisite for high flow efficiency. A beveled leading edge before the orifice gave a higher coefficient of discharge than a rounded edge. The results with the nozzles assembled in an automatic <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> having a plain stem duplicated those with the nozzles assembled {{at the end of a}} straight tube of constant diameter. Lower coefficients were obtained with the nozzles assembled in an <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> having a helically grooved stem.
