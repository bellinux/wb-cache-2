40|$|Targeting neurotensin as a {{potential}} novel approach {{for the treatment of}} autism Ahmad Ghanizadeh 1, 2 The pathophysiology of autism remains obscure.

Neurotensin is known to intensify neuronal NMDA-mediated glutamate signaling, which may cause apoptosis in autism. Further, an imbalance of glutamate/ GABAergic system in autism has been described.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} evidence {{has shown that}} application of certain neurotrophic factors (NTs) to the developing primary visual cortex prevents the development of ocular dominance (OD) columns. One interpretation of this result is that afferents from the lateral geniculate nucleus compete for postsynaptic trophic factor in an activity-dependent manner. Application of excess trophic factor eliminates this competition, thereby preventing OD column formation. We present a model of OD column development, incorporating Hebbian synaptic modification and activity-driven competition for NT, which accounts for both normal OD column development {{as well as the}} prevention of that development when competition is removed. In the “control” situation, when available <b>NT</b> <b>is</b> below a critical amount, OD columns form normally.

The neuropeptide neurotensin (<b>NT)</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown to regulate certain functions of the endocrine pancreas including insulin and glucagon release. However, the mechanism of action of NT {{as well as the}} identification of receptors involved in the pancreatic functions of the peptide remained to be studied. We demonstrate here that <b>NT</b> <b>is</b> an efficient protective agent of pancreatic beta cells against cytotoxic agents. Both beta-TC 3 and INS- 1 E cell lines and the mouse pancreatic islet cells express the three known NT receptors. The incubation of beta cells with NT protects cells from apoptosis induced either by staurosporine or by IL- 1 beta. In beta-TC 3 cells, NT activates both MAP and PI- 3 kinases pathways and strongly reduces the staurosporine or the Il- 1 beta-induced caspase- 3 activity by a mechanism involving Akt activation. The NTSR 2 agonist levocabastine displays the same protective effect than NT whereas the NTSR 1 antagonist is unable to block the effect of NT suggesting the predominant involvement of the NTSR 2 in the action of NT on beta cells.
