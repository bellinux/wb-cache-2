25|$|As {{only a few}} of the Confederate units {{submitted}} {{reports on}} the battle, Confederate casualties are difficult to determine. Thomas reported capturing 4,561 prisoners in the battle itself, with an unknown number captured during the retreat.

25|$|With any {{computational}} method, it {{is typically}} necessary to constrain the investigated parameter ranges. The parameter ranges should if possible be defined based on known {{properties of the}} studied system, but may for practical applications necessitate an <b>educated</b> <b>guess.</b> However, theoretical results regarding objective priors are available, which may for example {{be based on the}} principle of indifference or the principle of maximum entropy. On the other hand, automated or semi-automated methods for choosing a prior distribution often yield improper densities. As most ABC procedures require generating samples from the prior, improper priors are not directly applicable to ABC.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after this}} sighting, Yamamoto ordered the cruisers to turn north, {{away from their}} {{original}} course for Midway. [...] Tambor soon sighted them again, at 0238.

[...] At 0258, Murphy turned due west, hoping to put them between him and the moon so their silhouettes would make them easier to identify. [...] After losing and regaining sight of the cruisers in the dark, Murphy made an <b>educated</b> <b>guess,</b> turning left again, and re-sighted the ships.|$|E
2500|$|Ani cites her anti-corporate ethos for {{the main}} reason she decided to start her own label. This has allowed her a {{considerable}} degree of creative freedom over the years, including, for example, providing all instrumentals and vocals and recording the album herself at her home on an analog 8-track reel to reel, and handling much of the artwork and packaging design for her 2004 album <b>Educated</b> <b>Guess.</b> She has referenced this independence from major labels in song more than once, including [...] "The Million You Never Made" [...] (Not a Pretty Girl), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, [...] "The Next Big Thing" [...] (Not So Soft), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and [...] "Napoleon" [...] (Dilate), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.|$|E

2500|$|Damage is Jimmy Eat World's first studio {{album to}} be {{released}} on RCA Records. Regarding this, vocalist and guitarist Jim Adkins noted: [...] "There's {{a lot of people}} there we've just crossed paths with over the years and who have been really supportive of us even if they didn't have a stake in how our records did. It's an interesting time. It's our best <b>educated</b> <b>guess</b> on where we feel comfortable being." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton stated: [...] " [...] we just toured, saved up all of our money and were able to save up enough money to record by ourselves, and then we shopped the record around. That's what we did for Bleed American too. We ended up signing to DreamWorks and eventually got bought out by Interscope and we were on Interscope for awhile [...] The fans basically made Damage for us by showing up to concerts and supporting us." [...] "I Will Steal You Back" [...] was released on April 16, 2013, and impacted radio the same day. Damage was released on June 11. [...] "Damage" [...] impacted radio on August 6, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Asbury Park's nightlife {{includes}} The Stone Pony. On Main Street is The Saint, (formerly the Clover Club), a {{club that}} showcases local and emerging acts, {{as well as}} established performers. Across town, on Fourth Avenue, is Asbury Lanes, a no longer functioning vintage bowling alley and bar with live performances ranging from musical acts, neo-Burlesque, hot rod, and art shows. Though it has been closed for now, it is currently being restored to its former glory. Bought by the newly opened Asbury Hotel sitting adjacent on Fifth Avenue, it will be connected with the hotel. An above ground passageway has already been built to connect the two buildings. An <b>educated</b> <b>guess</b> to its reopening would be Spring 2017. The Baronet, a vintage movie theater which dates back to Buster Keaton's era, was near Asbury Lanes, but its roof recently caved in and the building was demolished. The Asbury Hotel pays homage to this once great theater with its 5th floor rooftop movie theater called [...] "The Baronet". The Asbury Hotel also has an 8th floor rooftop bar, paying homage to the former building inhabitants and calling it [...] "Salvation". In a town that was once nearly abandoned, there are now over 60 restaurants, bars, coffee houses, two breweries, a coffee roastery, and live music venues situated in Asbury Park's boardwalk and downtown districts.|$|E
5000|$|By contrast, a guess {{made using}} prior {{knowledge}} to eliminate clearly wrong possibilities {{may be called}} an informed guess or an <b>educated</b> <b>guess.</b> Uninformed guesses can be distinguished {{from the kind of}} informed guesses that lead {{to the development of a}} scientific hypothesis. Tschaepe notes that [...] "this process of guessing is distinct from that of a coin toss or picking a number".

5000|$|The game {{featured}} eight players, {{but in this}} version, {{they were}} divided into two sets of four.

The one closest to the answer (in this case, 30) gets the first choice of answers from four picks (three in the second round), and the others in ascending order.

50|$|Psychic {{archaeology}} is a loose {{collection of}} practices involving {{the application of}} paranormal phenomena to problems in archaeology.

40|$|Abstract. This article explores a {{systematic}} review heuristic to develop literature review {{that is to}} be used in scientific publications. A heuristic is a method to solve a problem, and is usually informal including intuitive judgments and <b>educated</b> <b>guesses.</b> A heuristic is intended to lead to the best possible answer, implying that there is no single answer. Literature reviews must be written with an aim in mind. A literature review for scientific publications is intended to position the author’s contribution to a field of science. We explain that a heuristic to create a literature review would differ from one used to solve a number-based logic placement puzzle, like Sudoku. In comparison, both require intuitive judgments and <b>educated</b> <b>guesses.</b> But a literature review does not have one outcome, but is the foundation of a research process and is constructed of sources of various quality and relevance...|$|R
