[...] He landed {{at the port of}} Soto la Marina on the coast of Nuevo Santander (the modern-day state of Tamaulipas). [...] They were initially greeted enthusiastically, but soon they were arrested by General Felipe de la Garza, the local military commander. Felipe de la Garza was notorious in that he had been the head of a short-lived and unpopular revolt during Iturbide's reign. De la Garza gave up without a fight and was presented to Iturbide, who chose to pardon the general and reinstate him in his old post. The roles, as it happened, had not been reversed. Perhaps it was because of this debt that de la Garza wavered in his resolve to detain Iturbide, at first receiving him warmly, then arresting him and, on the way to his trial, de la Garza gave Iturbide command over the military escort that accompanied them, requesting that Iturbide presented himself to the nearby village of Padilla. Iturbide gave his word of honor and did as was bid, surrendering himself to authorities. The local legislature held a trial and sentenced Iturbide to death. [...] When a local priest administered last rites, Iturbide said, [...] "Mexicans! In the very act of my death, I recommend to you the love to the fatherland, and the observance to our religion, for it shall lead you to glory. I die having come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you,</b> and I die merrily, for I die amongst you. I die with honor, not as a traitor; I do not leave this stain on my children and my legacy. [...] I am not a traitor, no." [...] He was executed by firing squad on 19 July 1824. [...] Three bullets hit him, one of which delivered the fatal blow.|$|E

40|$|My purpose <b>here</b> is <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> {{develop an}} {{understanding}} of the institutional foundations of an economy. Much of advanced work in economics concerns the study of economizing and economizing behavior, while little of it concerns the extent to which an economy is socially constructed. The economy is not some magical and spontaneous entity created by divine inspiration with the goal of producing efficient allocations and happy people. Rather, the economy is built up from the convergence of three imperatives: (1) the need for collective rules of conduct arising from conflicts of interest, driven by scarcity, and enforced by the moral sanctions of collective opinion; (2) the need for rules of conduct arising from conflicts of interest, driven by scarcity, and enforced by the organized sanctions of state-sponsored coercion; and (3) the need for rules of conduct arising from conflicts of interest, driven by scarcity, and enforced by the accounting logic of profit and loss. In other words, the economy is the social realm in which ethics, jurisprudence, and economizing meet. The economy is always in the process of becoming. Here we learn about how that process works. One understands the economy by understanding its ethical, legal, and economizing components. Institutional economics starts from the view that economizing behavior b...|$|R

5000|$|In June 2011, Mark Ruffalo made an {{appearance}} in Santa Monica {{to receive the}} 15th Annual Millennial award from the organization Global Green USA to honor his environmental activism — an honor he later admitted {{he did not believe}} he deserved. During the event, Ruffalo made mention of the Marcellus shale in the northeastern United States, which contains large deposits of shale gas that various energy developers in the region are either currently releasing or planning to release through the process of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking. (Ruffalo strongly opposes this practice).

40|$|The {{global economy}} holds {{important}} implications for the global environment and for domestic economic conditions. Indeed, the events of September 11, 2001 remind us that global politics is very much influenced by the global economy. Great dependence of the industrialized world on oil⎯much of which comes from the Middle East, where economic and political conditions are hardly encouraging for human progress⎯illustrates that the global economy is seen by many individuals {{as a source of}} economic and political repression. When governments fail to create the conditions of economic and democratic progress then despair and frustration are the expected results. Despair can be played out in unpleasant ways. In this course we will explore topics concerning how humans impact nature, how we think of (and "construct") nature and the environment, how ethics and economics inform environmental policy, and how population growth affects levels of human consumption and therefore environmental quality. In addition, we will explore how a modest level of economic knowledge can be useful for understanding issues of biodiversity and sustainability, the global economy, international trade in timber and oil, air pollution (greenhouse gasses that cause global climate change), and pollution of international rivers. We will explore these topics from the economic way of thinking. The intent <b>here</b> is <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> understand how an economic perspective can provide important insights into the causes and solutions of various global environmental problems...|$|R
