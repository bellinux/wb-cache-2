40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the pharmacological property of <b>erythrodiol,</b> a natural triterpenoid contained in propolis, as vasodilatory agent, {{and to determine}} its mechanism of action. Methods: Rats aortic rings were isolated and suspended in organ baths, {{and the effects of}} <b>erythrodiol</b> were studied by means of isometric tension recording experiments. Nitric oxide (NO) was detected by ozone-induced chemiluminescence. The technique used to evaluate changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in intact endothelium was opened aortic ring and loaded with 16 µmol Fura- 2 /AM for 60 min at room temperature, washed and fixed by small pins with the luminal face up. In situ, ECs were visualized by an upright epifluorescence Axiolab microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Zeiss× 63 Achroplan objective (water immersion, 2. 0 mm working distance, 0. 9 numerical apertures). ECs were excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm, and the emitted light was detected at 510 nm. Results: In aortic rings with intact endothelium pre-contracted with norepinephrine (10 - 4 mol/L), the addition of <b>erythrodiol</b> (10 - 8 - 10 - 4 mol/L) induced vasorelaxation in a concentration-dependent manner; in endothelium-denuded rings, the relaxant response induced by <b>erythrodiol</b> was almost completely abolished suggesting that vasorelaxation was endothelium-dependent. They had almost no relaxant effect on depolarised or endothelium-denuded aortic segments. The relaxation was significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor Nvnitro-L-arginine-methylester. <b>Erythrodiol</b> (10 - 4 mol/L) was able to significantly increase NOx levels. This effect was completely abolished after removal of the vascular endothelium. <b>Erythrodiol</b> (100 µmol/L) caused a slow, long-lasting increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. These results further supported the hypothesis that <b>erythrodiol</b> can induce activation of the NO/soluble guanylate cyclase/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, as suggested by functional studies. Conclusions: The present results suggest that the mechanism of relaxation seems to be mainly mediated by the endothelial production of NO. Such a vasorelaxation was an endotheliumdependent effect, via the NO/soluble guanylate cyclase/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway. This result also suggests that <b>erythrodiol</b> causes a slow influx of extracellular Ca 2 + release from the intracellular Ca 2 + stores and an inhibition of Ca 2 + extruding mechanism. It can be concluded that <b>erythrodiol</b> may have interesting therapeutic potential as a new vasodilator drug, for protecting the cardiovascular system...|$|E
40|$|Cholesterol efflux (ChE) from macrophages is {{an initial}} step of reverse {{cholesterol}} transport (RCT). The ATP-binding cassette transporter A 1 (ABCA 1) {{is a key}} transporter for ChE and its increased expression is regarded to attenuate atherosclerosis. Thus, the identification and characterization of molecules raising ABCA 1 and thereby stimulating ChE is of pharmacological relevance. In this study, we tested dietary compounds from olive oil for their capacity of enhancing cellular ABCA 1 protein level. We identified <b>erythrodiol</b> (Olean- 12 -ene- 3 β, 28 -diol) as an ABCA 1 stabilizer and revealed its positive influence on ChE in THP- 1 -derived human macrophages. Among the nine tested compounds from olive oil, <b>erythrodiol</b> was the sole compound raising ABCA 1 protein level (at 10 μM). None of the tested compounds impaired viability of THP- 1 macrophages from 5 to 20 μM as determined by resazurin conversion. Western blot analyses of key membrane transporters contributing to ChE showed that the protein level of ABCG 1 and scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B 1) remain unaffected by <b>erythrodiol.</b> Besides, <b>erythrodiol</b> (10 μM) did not influence the mRNA level of ABCA 1, ABCG 1, and SR-B 1, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR, but significantly inhibited the degradation of ABCA 1 as evident by an increased half-life of the protein {{in the presence of}} cycloheximide, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. Therefore, <b>erythrodiol</b> promotes ChE from THP- 1 -derived human macrophages by stabilizing the ABCA 1 protein. This bioactivity makes <b>erythrodiol</b> a good candidate to be further explored for therapeutic or preventive application in the context of atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The natural triterpenes, <b>erythrodiol</b> and uvaol, exert anti-inflammatory, vasorelaxing and anti-proliferative effects. Angiotensin II is a {{well-known}} profibrotic and proliferative agent that participates in the cardiac remodeling associated with different pathological situations through the stimulation and proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} study was to investigate the preventive effects of the natural triterpenes <b>erythrodiol</b> and uvaol on the proliferation and collagen production induced by angiotensin II in cardiac myofibroblasts. Their actions on cardiac hypertrophy triggered by angiotensin II were also studied. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The effect of <b>erythrodiol</b> and uvaol on angiotensin II-induced proliferation was evaluated in cardiac myofibroblasts from adult rats in the presence or the absence of the inhibitors of PPAR-γ, GW 9662 or JNK, SP 600125. The effect on collagen levels induced by angiotensin II was evaluated in cardiac myofibroblasts and mouse heart. The presence of low doses of both triterpenes reduced the proliferation of cardiac myofibroblasts induced by angiotensin II. Pretreatment with GW 9662 reversed the effect elicited by both triterpenes while SP 600125 did not modify it. Both triterpenes at high doses produced an increase in annexing-V binding in the presence or absence of angiotensin II, which was reduced by either SP 600125 or GW 9662. <b>Erythrodiol</b> and uvaol decreased collagen I and galectin 3 levels induced by angiotensin II in cardiac myofribroblasts. Finally, cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular remodeling, fibrosis, and increases in myocyte area and brain natriuretic peptide levels observed in angiotensin II-infused mice were reduced in triterpene-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: <b>Erythrodiol</b> and uvaol reduce cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricle remodeling induced by angiotensin II in mice by diminishing fibrosis and myocyte area. They also modulate growth and survival of cardiac myofibroblasts. They inhibit the angiotensin II-induced proliferation in a PPAR-γ-dependent manner, while at high doses they activate pathways of programmed cell death that are dependent on JNK and PPAR-γ...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to other metabolic functions, {{the role of}} dietary antioxidants and oil on microsomal lipid oxidation has been less extensively studied. This study examines ascorbate−Fe 2 + and NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation of hepatic microsomes of rats that were fed for three weeks high-oleic-acid oils (high-oleic sunflower oil, HOSO; olive oil, OO; or olive pomace oil, OPO) containing different concentrations of the antioxidants α-tocopherol, <b>erythrodiol,</b> and oleanolic acid. The fatty acid composition of hepatic microsomes of Wistar rats that were fed for three weeks with the above-mentioned oils had lower proportions of C 16 : 0, C 18 : 2 n 6, and C 22 : 6 n 3 and higher proportions of C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1 n 9 than rats fed the control diet. Light emission by hepatic microsomes increased, in the first 180 min, 2 -fold after ascorbate-Fe 2 + addition compared with NADPH addition. Both increases were less pronounced in microsomes of OPO-fed rats and to a smaller extent in microsomes of OO-fed rats. Smaller increases in light emission were associated positively with higher concentrations of dietary α-tocopherol, <b>erythrodiol,</b> and oleanolic acid but were not associated with changes in fatty acid composition of hepatic microsomes. Addition of α-tocopherol, <b>erythrodiol,</b> or oleanolic acid decreased light emission of hepatic microsomes with a greater inhibition in microsomes of rats fed the control diet. Our data suggest that <b>erythrodiol</b> and oleanolic acids partly explain the protective effect of dietary OPO on microsomal lipid peroxidation in rats.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate a new pharmacological property of two natural triterpenoids contained in olive oil, as vasodilatory agents, and to determine their mechanism of action. The two compounds studied were oleanolic acid and <b>erythrodiol.</b> The vasorelaxant effect induced by these pentacyclic triterpenoids was studied in isolated thoracic rat aorta. Oleanolic acid and <b>erythrodiol,</b> accumulatively added, showed vasorelaxant activities in aortic rings with endothelium pre-contracted by 10 - 6 M-phenylephrine (maximum percentage of relaxation 86. 38 (SEM 2. 89) and 73. 53 (SEM 6. 01), respectively). They had almost no relaxant effect on depolarised or endothelium-denuded aortic segments. The relaxation was significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor Nω -nitro-L-argi-nine-methylester (L-NAME; 3 × 10 - 4 M). To characterise the involvement of endothelial factors, in addifion to NO, arteries with endothelium were exposed to 10 - 5 M-indomethacin (INDO), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, or INDO plus L-NAME. INDO did not have any significant effect on the relaxant response of both compounds. The combination of L-NAME plus INDO only abolished the oleanolic acid-induced relaxation. The present results suggest that the mechanism of relaxation seems to be mainly mediated by the endothelial production of NO; however, other mechanisms cannot be excluded. It can be concluded that oleanolic acid and <b>erythrodiol</b> may have interesting therapeutic potential as new vasodilator drugs, thus protecting the cardiovascular system. Therefore, the intake of 'orujo' olive oil, as a source of these compounds, might be beneficial in this regard. © The Authors 2004.

Pharmacological properties of oleanolic acid have been demonstrated: anti-inflammatory, antitumoral, hepatoprotective, cytotoxic, anti-diabetogenic, antibacterial and anti-HIV activities. There is scarce evidence about the pharmacological effects of these triterpenoid on vascular events; the chronic treatment of Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats with these natural compounds (oleanolic and ursolic acids) prevent the development of hypertension with significant bradycardia and potent diuretic activity. In relation to <b>erythrodiol</b> and uvaol, only their therapeutic efficiency on different experimental models of inflammation has been reported. Moreover, uvaol plays a protective role on the oxidation of lipoproteins of low density in vitro, {{as well as a}} protective effect on induced hepatic injuries.

40|$|Olive pomace oil, {{also known}} as "orujo" olive oil, {{is a blend of}} refined-pomace oil and virgin olive oil, fit for human consumption. Maslinic acid, oleanolic acid, <b>erythrodiol,</b> and uvaol are pentacyclic triterpenes, found in the non-glyceride {{fraction}} of orujo oil, which have previously been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. In the present work, we investigated the effect of these minor components on pro-inflammatory cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in six different samples. Uvaol, <b>erythrodiol,</b> and oleanolic acid significantly decreased IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 production in a dose-dependent manner. All three compounds significantly reduced TNF-alpha production at 100 mu M; however, at 10 mu M, uvaol and oleanolic acid enhanced the generation of TNF-alpha. In contrast, maslinic acid did not significantly alter the concentration of those cytokines, {{with the exception of a}} slight inhibitory effect at 100 mu M. All four triterpenes inhibited production of I- 309, at 50 mu M and 100 mu M. However, uvaol enhanced I- 309 production at 10 mu M. The triterpenic dialcohols had a similar effect on MIG production. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that pentacyclic triterpenes in orujo oil exhibit pro- and anti-inflammatory properties depending on chemical structure and dose, and may be useful in modulating the immune response.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are inflammatory demyelinating {{diseases that}} develop {{as a result}} of deregulated immune responses causing glial activation and destruction of CNS tissues. Oleanolic acid and <b>erythrodiol</b> are natural triterpenes that display strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Oleanolic acid beneficially influences the course of established EAE. We now extend our previous observations to <b>erythrodiol</b> and address the efficacy of both compounds to protect against EAE, given under different regimens. The utility of both triterpenes in disease prevention was evaluated at a clinical and molecular level: in vivo through their prophylactic administration to myelin oligodendrocyte protein-immunized C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and in vitro through their addition to stimulated-BV 2 microglial cells. These triterpenes protected against EAE by restricting infiltration of inflammatory cells into the CNS and by preventing blood–brain barrier disruption. Triterpene-pretreated EAE-mice exhibited less leptin secretion, and switched cytokine production towards a Th 2 /regulatory profile, with lower levels of Th 1 and Th 17 cytokines and higher expression of Th 2 cytokines in both serum and spinal cord. Triterpenes also affected the humoral response causing auto-antibody production inhibition. In vitro, triterpenes inhibited ERK and rS 6 phosphorylation and reduced the proliferative response, phagocytic properties and synthesis of proinflammatory mediators induced by the addition of inflammatory stimuli to microglia. Both triterpenes restricted the development of the characteristic features of EAE. We envision these natural products as novel helpful tools for intervention in autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases including MS.

40|$|Interest in the health-promoting {{effects of}} virgin olive oil, an {{important}} part of the "Mediterranean diet", prompted us to determine the antiinflammatory effects of <b>erythrodiol,</b> beta-sitosterol and squalene, identified as major components of the so-called "unsaponifiable fraction" of virgin olive oil, as well as of the phenolic compounds from the "polar fraction": oleuropein, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol and caffeic acid. Their activities were compared to those of both, total unsaponifiable and polar fractions. This study was designed to analyse the antiinflammatory effect of these specific compounds from virgin olive oil on edema in mice induced by either arachidonic acid (AA) or 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA). The inhibition of the myeloperoxidase (MPO), marker enzyme of the accumulation of neutrophils in the inflamed tissue, was also investigated by the TPA model. The topical application of the olive oil compounds (0. 5 mg/ear) produced a variable degree of antiinflammatory effect with both assays. In the auricular edema induced by TPA, beta-sitosterol and <b>erythrodiol</b> from the unsaponifiable fraction of the oil showed a potent antiedematous effect with a 61. 4 % and 82. 1 % of inhibition respectively, values not very different to that of the reference indomethacin (85. 6 %) at 0. 5 mg/ear. The four phenolics exerted a similar range of inhibition (33 - 45 %). All compounds strongly inhibited the enzyme myeloperoxidase, indicating a reduction of the neutrophil influx in the inflamed tissues. The strongest inhibitor of AA edema was the total unsaponifiable fraction which inhibition was 34 %, similar to that obtained by the reference drug dexamethasone at 0. 05 mg/ear. Among the phenolics, oleuropein also produced an inhibition of about 30 % with the same dose, but all the other components were found less active in this assay. The anti-inflammatory effects exerted by both unsaponifiable and polar compounds might contribute to the potential biological properties reported for virgin olive oil against different pathological processes.

40|$|Oleanolic acid is a triterpenoid {{that may}} {{contribute}} to the cardio-protective effects of olive oil. Our goal was to assess whether oleanolic acid could modulate eicosanoid biosynthesis and to determine the mechanism involved in this effect. Human coronary smooth muscle cells (SMC) were treated with oleanolic acid, <b>erythrodiol,</b> or hydroxytyrosol and eicosanoid release was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Cyclooxygenase (Cox) - 1 and Cox- 2 protein and messenger sRNA levels were analyzed by Western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were assessed using specific antibodies. Oleanolic acid induced prostaglandin I 2 (PGI 2) release by human coronary SMC, an effect that was prevented by celecoxib (a specific inhibitor of Cox- 2). The increased PGI 2 was time-and dose-dependent and was associated to the u-regulation of Cox- 2. No effects were observed on thromboxane A 2. <b>Erythrodiol</b> but not hydroxytyrosol upregulated Cox- 2 expression and induced PGI 2 synthesis. Oleanolic acid induced an early phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK and p 42 / 44 MAPK but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase- 1 (JNK- 1). SB 203580 (p 38 MAPK inhibitor) and U 0126 (MAPK kinase 1 / 2 inhibitor) abrogated the upregulation of Cox- 2 and PGI 2 release induced by oleanolic acid. A peptide inhibitor of JNK- 1 (L-JNKI 1) did not produce any effect. The induction of Cox- 2 was preceded by an early activation of cAMP regulatory element-binding protein, a key transcription factor involved in Cox- 2 transcriptional upregulation. Therefore, oleanolic acid contributes to vascular homeostasis by inducing PGI 2 release in a Cox- 2 -dependent manner. Oleanolic acid could be regarded as a bioactive molecule that {{may contribute to}} the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{total of}} four {{compounds}} namely betulin (1), <b>erythrodiol</b> (2), lupeol (3), and stigmasterol were isolated from the leaf extract of Ixora arborea for the first time. The structures of the isolated compounds were established by extensive spectroscopic studies. In our preliminary screening, the petroleum ether, carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane and aqueous soluble fractions of the methanol extract were subjected to antioxidant, antimicrobial and brine shrimp lethality bioassays. All of the fractions showed significant antioxidant activity along with the total phenolic content, of which the methanolic extract of leaves (MEL) showed the highest free radical scavenging activity with IC 50 value 33. 0 µg/ml. In the brine shrimp lethality bioassay, among all the extractives the petroleum ether soluble fraction (PESF) demonstrated significant cytotoxicity with LC 50 value of 0. 622 µg/ml.

40|$|This work {{establishes}} a new procedure for the extraction {{and analysis of}} pentacyclic triterpenes, with which fruits and leaves from three Spanish olive cultivars (“Picual”, “Hojiblanca”, and “Arbequina”) has been studied. The leaf contains important amounts of oleanolic acid (3. 0 − 3. 5 % DW), followed by significant concentrations of maslinic acid and minor levels of ursolic acid, <b>erythrodiol,</b> and uvaol. The abundance and profile of triterpenoids change during the leaf ontogeny. In the fruit, triterpenes are exclusively located in the epicarp at concentrations 30 -fold lower than that in the leaf. Maslinic acid is the main triterpenoid, only accompanied of oleanolic acid. Along the ripening the levels of these triterpenes decreased. All the analyzed leaves and fruits {{come from the same}} agricultural estate, with identical climate and culturing conditions. For this reason, the found differences could majorly be attributable to the genetic factors of the olive cultivars. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|At the {{commercial}} ripeness stage, healthy grapes and those affected by sour rot were sampled from cv. Fortana, and whole grapes and the separated pips and pulp + skin were analysed for total lipids, triglyceride composition, fatty acid {{composition of the}} triglycerides, sterol composition, terpenic acid composition and hydrocarbon composition. Results are tabulated. Total lipid contents decreased in diseased pips and increased in diseased pulp + skin. Grape pip triglyceride composition was similar in both samples, but pulp + skin from diseased grapes had higher levels of C 42 -C 50, {{and lower levels of}} C 52 and C 54 triglycerides than that from healthy grapes. These results are reflected in fatty acid composition, except that in addition pips from sour rot grapes had decreased C 18 : 2 and increased C 18 : 1 contents vs. healthy grapes. beta-Sitosterol content was slightly lower in pips, and notably lower in pulp + skin, from diseased grapes, but other sterols did not differ significantly.

40|$|There is {{currently}} {{a considerable amount of}} interest in the benefits of certain dietary elements, and in particular of olive oil, in endothelial function and thus in hypertension. “Orujo” or pomace olive oil is obtained from the residues of the olive by a novel centrifugation process, and it is a good dietary source of triterpenic compounds such as oleanolic and maslinic acid, <b>erythrodiol,</b> and uvaol. Until now, there was no information available regarding the properties of these triterpenoids on the vasculature of hypertensive animals. However, in this in vitro study, we have analyzed the vasorelaxation induced by these triterpenoids in isolated aorta from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The triterpenoids tested induced concentration-dependent vasorelaxation, mostly involving nitric oxide (NO). Indeed, the responses were attenuated by removal of the endothelium or following pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME. Furthermore, the differences that were observed in the potency of relaxation, the selectivity, and the dependence on the endothelium were attributed to structural features of the triterpenoids. In conclusion, triterpenic components in pomace olive oil induce vasorelaxation of the aorta from SHR, and this effect generally involves endothelial NO. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The aerial parts of B. conferta were investigated phytochemically and pharmacologically using the guinea pig ileum assay as a model (histamine, KCl and electric stimulation). The crude ethanolic extract showed a dose-dependent antispasmodic effect that was particularly strong in flavonoid-rich fractions (e. g. IC 50 value for fraction E. 3. 1 from the ethyl acetate fraction, in histamine-induced contraction, 10 Î¼g mL- 1).

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} {{process is}} involved in the genesis and evolution of different diseases like obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Macrophages {{play a central role in}} inflammation. In addition, they can regulate some stages of cancer development. Macrophages can polarize into M 1 or M 2 functional phenotype depending on the cytokines present in the tissue microenvironment. On the other hand, triterpenes found in virgin olive oil are described to present different properties, such as antitumoral and anti-inflammatory activity. The present study was designed to elucidate if the four major triterpenes found in virgin olive oil (oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, uvaol, and <b>erythrodiol)</b> are able to enhance M 1 macrophage response which represents an important defense mechanism against cancer. Our results indicated that maslinic acid modulated the inflammatory response by enhancing the production of IL- 8, IL- 1 α, and IL- 1 β; it promoted M 1 response through the synthesis of IFN-γ; and finally it did not modify significantly the levels of NFκβ or NO. Overall, our results showed that maslinic acid could prevent chronic inflammation, which represents a crucial step in the development of some cancers...|$|E
