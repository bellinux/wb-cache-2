While existing PES programs can observe who participates and who does not, the reasons for nonparticipation can be opaque. Taking advantage of a unique stated preference data set that includes a follow-up question on conditions for participation, this study differentiates two types of non-participants, those deterred by <b>insufficient</b> <b>payments,</b> and those deterred by fundamental incompatibility with the farm operation. Survey weighted and spatially weighted probit models are applied to examine the determinants of farmers’ willingness to enroll in PES programs and their willingness to consider enrollment at the same or a high payment. Results suggest the decision to enroll relies more on farm benefit-cost factors, such as program payment, total land area and current farming practice, while the decision to consider enrolling depends more on farm and operator characteristics, such as environmental attitudes, soil traits, current government program enrollment or commitment to organic farming. Both decisions also show evidence of spatial dependence that suggest spill-over effects due to natural resources, interpersonal communication, or other socio-economic factors. These findings elucidate reasons for non-participation in PES programs and provide insights for future program design and targeting.

Despite larger employer contributions, the debt has {{increased over the}} past decade. For example, contributions to PERA's School Division {{have more than doubled}} since 2005; yet, the payments still do not cover the plan's full cost. Eighty-one percent of the increase in the state's unfunded pension liabilities is due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>payments.</b> Colorado is relying on a risky investment strategy to close the gap between pension assets and liabilities. Two-thirds of its investments are allocated to volatile assets such as equities, real estate, and alternatives. Recent legislative reforms will have a marginal impact on protecting PERA from economic booms and busts. The state's funding plan, which includes a costly period of negative amortization, will cause PERA to remain in a precarious financial position for decades. The period of negative amortization will cause the debt to cost much more in the long term. Colorado should take action to avoid dire financial consequences, and it should take immediate steps to improve the financial stability of its pension system. Such measures include developing a credible plan to pay down PERA's current unfunded liability, managing future cost uncertainty, and adopting a flexible funding policy. These reforms would allow Colorado to create a lasting, secure retirement plan and would help to ensure that the state is able to deliver on its promises to citizens and public employees...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Ethics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. On {{the basis}} of {{descriptive}} and prescriptive ethics and by means of literature study and exegesis of the Scriptures, this study poses {{an answer to the}} question: "How should factors that define labour compensation in South Africa since 1994 be judged according to theological ethics?" Since the subsistence farming of the seventeenth century in South Africa labour compensation has changed to a mainly capitalistic system with money as the most important compensation to labourers for services rendered. Since the seventeenth century a period of unfolding and development of careers has taken place mainly {{as a result of the}} influence of colonists from Europe. Gradual development taking place in the economic field has made subsequent factors in lieu of labour compensation more relevant for labourers. Various factors with regard to compensation of labour after 1994 - when the first fully-fledged democratic voting took place in South Africa - defines that it must be seen against the developmental background before 1994. In this study thirteen factors that have an influence on compensation since 1994, will be identified. Some factors tend to lean towards underpayment and others to overpayment. Interior factors relating to <b>insufficient</b> <b>payment</b> are unemployment, child labour, HIV/Aids and gambling. Foreign factors relative to <b>insufficient</b> <b>payment</b> are illegal immigration and cheap imports. Relevant to this, there are also factors resulting in higher remuneration of labourers. Labour laws with regard to affirmative action and minimum wages have a positive influence on payment for labourers. Illegal conduct of labourers gives rise to theft, robbery and corruption. Positive reactions are also in place with regard to remuneration of labourers. In view of this, over-pay, strikes and emigration play an important role. The factors that influence payment since 1994 are being judged according to the Scriptures, pertaining labour and remuneration. God created mankind serving as inhabitants and workers of the earth. He also decreed that mankind will live from the fruit of his labour. This decree forms the basis by which labourers receive remuneration for their efforts. Through fellowship man shows that he is sewing God and fellow-country men and does not labour only for his own advantage. The fall of man has far-reaching influences on mankind, his labours, place of labour and the consequent remuneration be receives for services rendered. One cannot fatalistically accept the influence of the fall of mankind. The recreation of mankind, started by Jesus Christ also affects the area of labour. This study demonstrates how remuneration for labour does not comply to Bible principles. Guidance will be given to how, especially believers, be they employers or employees, portray God's image through their conduct. Believers should execute their labours in such a way, that they are worthy of decent remuneration. Christian employers ought to be reasonable when paying employees, create and protect job opportunities and where possible, employ more labourers. Maximum opportunity should be granted by the ruling authority in order that as many people possible have the opportunity to labour without being exploited. Doctora...|$|E

The tasks of the research: to analyze the means and modes of motivation; to identify the motives of medical institutions` employees in Panevezys county; to define the motivation modes of employees; to generalize de-motivation reasons of medical institutions` employees in Panevezys county. The research methodic: the research of employees` motivation {{was carried out in}} 2005 - 2006 in these public institutions: Rokiskis mental hospital, Rokiskis mental health center, Kupiskis hospital and the clinic of Birzai district municipality. There was used questionnaire. The design of questionnaire was based on the different practical research characteristics in motivation field literature. There were questioned 143 respondents. The cases of the application of statistical methods: security of the methodological quality characteristics of the research (reliability measurement of the questionnaire), measurement of the inner compatibility of the questions (Cendal concordance coefficient), measurement of the relation of the answers to the questions (modified coefficient of Cendal concordance). Results: there were identified motives of the medical institutions` employees in Panevezys county: sufficient payment (40 per cent), the usage of professional skills (25 per cent), the diversity and creativity of labor (20 per cent), possibility to build professional career (10 per cent). The employees put the premium on the material and similarly psychological motivation means (50 per cent). They are eager to get not only price bounty but also the sincere thanks from the manager. Conclusions: 75 per cent of respondents stated that practically the material and psychological encouragements aren’t applied in the medical institutions in Panevezys county excepting premiums which are paid once per year before Christmas. 10 per cent of respondents named the transference in the more interesting job.

40|$|Background: Medicines {{are only}} {{authorized}} to circulate {{in the market}} after being registered. The Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA) has been mandated by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) to ensure quality, safety and efficacy of medicines. Since about 70 % of medicines are imported from abroad, registration process contribute to the availability of quality, safe and efficacious medicinal products in the country. In this regard the registration process needs to be effective and should avoid unnecessary delays {{in order to increase}} the variety of medicines registered in the country. Study objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} identify challenges of medicines registration process in Tanzania. Methodology: A descriptive cross sectional study design was used to survey the regulatory authority and pharmacies in Dar es Salaam region. Forty one pharmacies were involved in the study. A total of 42 medicines evaluators, 41 pharmacists’ in-charge and 41 representatives of manufacturers were interviewed using structured questionnaires. An in-depth interview was conducted to two key informants at the regulatory authority using interview schedule. A designed medicines status form was used to assess dossier applications received in the past two years; 2010 and 2011. A total of 743 dossiers of applications submitted at TFDA during this period were assessed. Results: Among forty two (42) medicines evaluators; 33 pharmacists, 4 medical doctors and 5 veterinary doctors were included in this study. Among them 27 had high knowledge regarding medicines registration concept with a statistically significant association between training and knowledge of medicines evaluation (P = 0. 001). Out of 41 manufacturers’ representatives; 11 pharmacists, 25 businessmen, 3 marketing managers, one IT specialist and one economist were interviewed. Among 41 pharmacists in-charge, more than half (61. 0 %) had low knowledge on medicines registration process with a significant association between training and knowledge of medicines evaluation (P = 0. 007). The average evaluation time per dossier was found to be 2. 98 ± 0. 811 days, with 95 % CI for the mean value ranging from 2. 169 to 3. 791. Majority of evaluators (72. 93 %) are supported by TFDA management with significant association between management support and payment satisfaction (P = 0. 002). Out of 743 applications received in two years, 478 applications were evaluated. Among those, only 170 were registered, 220 rejected, 62 queried and 26 had their status not determined as on April 2013. This indicated that more than half (58. 60 %) of the applications were either rejected or queried due to poor quality of dossiers submitted. The challenges identified include inadequate evaluators, <b>insufficient</b> <b>payment,</b> lack of regular training of expertise, instability of management information system, insufficient evaluation time, poor submitted dossiers, long registration time and communication gap between applicants and TFDA. Conclusion and recommendations: Medicines registration in Tanzania is faced with challenges multifaceted from TFDA management, manufacturers and their representatives. Due to inadequate number of evaluators the process of medicines registration has been observed to take longer time than the time of 12 months as suggested in the Client Service Charter. Furthermore, the pharmacist in-charge had limited knowledge on medicines registration concept. Based on these findings, it is proposed that TFDA management should deploy sufficient number of qualified personnel to undertake evaluation activities. The Government through MOHSW and Schools of Pharmacy in Tanzania should review their training curricula in order to impart pharmacist in-charge with knowledge on how to review and prepare dossiers for medicines registration. TFDA in collaboration with Pharmacy Council should provide regular on-job training and continuing professional development to improve pharmacist’s knowledge and skills in order to enable them to cope with developments in pharmaceutical science and technology...|$|E

The objective of this article is to evaluate the process and preliminary outcomes of healthcare reform in the new EU and candidate countries by analysing trends in aggregate financing, supply and utilisation indicators using data drawn from the WHO Health for All database. The analysis is done in the context of an analytical framework built around common healthcare reform themes. The key reform measures examined include implementing social insurance systems, implementing payment systems that promote efficiency, and removal of excess capacity. The trend analysis highlights the importance of the economic, political and social context in driving the direction and pace of healthcare reform. For example, the transition to social insurance systems was smoother in countries with stronger economies and political commitment to reform. Policies aimed at improving the efficiency of the healthcare system, reducing utilisation and reducing excess capacity were met with some success in all of the countries. However, the reform effort continues as the countries are still addressing the initial challenges of <b>insufficient</b> funding, informal <b>payments,</b> excess capacity and inefficiencies in the provision of healthcare.

40|$|Effectiveness of {{insurance}} protection is widely discussed in professional publications in Poland and abroad, {{but the question}} has not been definitively settled yet. It seems that insurance indemnification may be treated as natural consequence resulting from the character of services rendered by an insurance company. In this situation effectiveness comes into prominence, but the effectiveness should be measured {{from the point of}} the insurant and not the Insurer, because it is the insurant who learns, in the hard way, of the effectiveness {{of insurance}} protection when there is an insurance case. Both the insurer and the insurant are interested in the accomplishment of insurance protection as the chief objective, but that unanimity becomes problematic when partial goals are to be achieved. Therefore effectiveness of insurance protection should be evaluated by the insurant; measurement of effectiveness done by the insurer is of no use. All attempts of that kind are only a formalized approximation to realities. It seems that effectiveness of insurance protection can be defined as relation between indemnification and the loss provided several conditions that depend upon the insurer and, first of all, upon the insurant have been fulfilled. An indispensable but <b>insufficient</b> condition is <b>payment</b> of damages by the insurer in the right amount and in due time. If these conditions are fulfilled, only potential effectiveness of insurance protection is secured and {{it is up to the}} insurant to make the protection real. Much depends on how and to what extent he will use the indemnification to repair the damage, which is dependent upon his initiative, enterprise and professional qualifications as well as on the availability of the necessary materials and products in the market and the amount of an additional subvention and loan.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three interconnected essays which, {{building on the}} work by Hart and Zingales (2011), lay down the foundations for a new theory of financial intermediation. The first essay explains the Hart and Zingales (HZ) framework and shows that their results are not general. In the HZ model, {{there is a lack}} of simultaneous double coincidence of wants, and future income is not pledgeable. This implies that agents need money to trade. However, holding money entails an opportunity cost that leads to a waste of resources. Because of this inefficiency, pecuniary externalities have welfare consequences that private price-taking agents fail to internalize. I find that HZ's result, whereby the market produces inefficiently high levels of liquidity, cannot be generalized, because the conflict between private and social incentives to create money depends on agents' preferences. In the second essay I construct a framework that explains the transactions, precautionary and speculative demand for money. Again, the welfare analysis indicates that, depending on individuals' preferences, the market may produce inefficiently high or low levels of liquidity. The results also evidence that the speculative demand for money exists only when households are risk averse in their wealth. In that case, private and social incentives to hold money are stronger, but the market produces <b>insufficient</b> means of <b>payment</b> relative to the social optimum. The third essay introduces active financial institutions, and examines the role played by moral hazard in the provision of and demand for liquidity. Limited liability and the non-contractibility of bank investment policy induce highly levered financial institutions to invest in an inefficient gambling asset. I find that, when the probability that banks gamble is non-zero, the primary goal of public intervention is to address the moral hazard problem by restricting the creation of liquidity. Several policies to address this inefficiency are discussed and analyzed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
