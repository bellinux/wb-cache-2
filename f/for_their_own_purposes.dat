5|$|In 1871, Widney wanted Los Angeles {{to have a}} harbor, {{and with}} Phineas Banning {{successfully}} lobbied the United States Congress for funding for the harbor at San Pedro, California (the Port of Los Angeles). He {{was chairman of the}} Los Angeles Citizens' Committee on the Wilmington Harbor. He successfully opposed the attempt of the railroad interests of Collis Potter Huntington and his partners from claiming the state tidelands of the harbor <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>purposes,</b> ensuring these lands remained in public hands.|$|E
5|$|Al-Muwaffaq, {{suffering}} from gout, was already visibly nearing his end; the vizier Isma'il ibn Bulbul {{and the city}} commander of Baghdad, Abu'l-Saqr, called al-Mu'tamid and his sons, including the heir-apparent al-Mufawwad, into the city, hoping to exploit al-Muwaffaq's imminent death <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>purposes.</b> Nevertheless the attempt to sideline Abu'l-Abbas failed due to his popularity with the soldiers and the common people. He was set free to visit his father's deathbed, {{and was able to}} immediately assume power when al-Muwaffaq died on 2 June. The Baghdad mob ransacked his opponents' houses, and Ibn Bulbul was dismissed and thrown in prison, where he died from maltreatment after a few months. Similar fates awaited any of his supporters that Abu'l-Abbas could lay his hands on.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, the then megas doux, Michael Stryphnos, was accused by Niketas Choniates of {{enriching}} himself by selling off the equipment {{of the imperial}} fleet, while by the early 13th century {{the authority of the}} central government had weakened {{to such an extent that}} various local potentates began seizing power in the provinces. The general atmosphere was one of lawlessness, which enabled men like Leo Sgouros in southern Greece and the imperial governor of Samos, Pegonites, to use their ships <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>purposes,</b> launching raids of their own. Even Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195–1203) is said to have licensed one of his commanders, Constantine Phrangopoulos, to launch pirate raids against commerce in the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} chess (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>purposes.</b> There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Diệm and the {{execution}} of Cẩn in May 1964, the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam. Nevertheless, there was no coherent national leadership and groups at district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously. By 1965, their members had managed to infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams (PATs), irregular paramilitary counter-insurgency forces organised by Australian Army advisers to fight the communists, and used them <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>purposes.</b> In December, one VNQDD member had managed to turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist agenda, and the local party leadership in Quảng Nam approached the Australians {{in an attempt to}} have the 1000-man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD. The overture was rejected. The politicisation of paramilitary units worked both ways; some province chiefs used the anti-communist forces to assassinate political opponents, including VNQDD members.|$|E

5|$|The NAACP later {{blamed the}} PTC {{management}} for intentionally dragging its {{feet on the}} contract that the TWU approved in late June. The NAACP claimed that the PTC management had hoped to undermine the TWU's position with the workers and to possibly oust TWU {{in favor of the}} more pliable PRTEU. The PTC was aware that the SmithConnally Act forbade strikes harming war production and that if, with a contract impasse, TWU itself had initiated a contract strike, the union might have been tossed out. This analysis of the situation was shared later by several historians, particularly by James Wolfinger. Another historian, Alan M. Winkler, also had a largely negative view of the company's role in the conflict and concluded that PTC management, while not overtly conspiring with the strikers, reacted feebly to the strike and tried to opportunistically exploit the situation and the racist attitudes of many white workers <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
5|$|When he recovers, {{he learns}} that, {{at the end}} of the bugger war, Earth's powers fought among themselves. He stays on Eros as his friends return home and colonists venture to other worlds, using Eros as a way station. Among the first colonists is Valentine, who apologizes that Ender can never return to Earth, where he would become {{dangerous}} as Peter and other politicians sought to exploit him <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>purposes.</b> Instead, Ender joins the colony program to populate one of the buggers' former worlds. There, he discovers the dormant egg of a bugger queen, who reveals that the buggers had initially assumed humans were a non-sentient race, for want of collective consciousness, but realized their mistake too late, and requests that Ender take the egg to a new planet to colonize.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had long}} been an {{acquaintance}} of John Fitch, the first to build a steamboat in the United States, and the two had worked together on steam projects. The Oruktor Amphibolos was Evans's lone attempt at building his own steamboat powered by a high-pressure engine and Evans himself was often vague in appraising its capabilities. Yet Robert Fulton had found success with the North River Steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807, and thereafter steamboats became a reality. Although he used low-pressure engines, Fulton had in 1812 contacted Evans {{about the possibility of}} using Evans's engines, though that correspondence did not lead to the implementation of any of Evans's designs for Fulton's steamships. The Mississippi and tributaries experienced far stronger currents than eastern counterparts, and low-pressure steamboats lacked the power to counteract these. The Enterprise was the first viable steamboat to run on these rivers, and its designer Daniel French employed an adapted Evans' engine for the purpose. High-pressure engines became the standard on the Mississippi, though relatively few of those were actually built by the Pittsburgh works as Evans' patent on high-pressure engines was not widely enforced, and many other engine shops opened on the Mississippi that freely adapted Evans' designs <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
