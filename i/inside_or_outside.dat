These were razed to the ground, and plundered for their decorations and goods.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction can occur either <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence {{is controlled by the}} lux operon.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{gathering}} CCTV – Some ambulances are {{now being}} fitted with video cameras used to record activity either <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the vehicle. They may also be fitted with sound recording facilities. This {{can be used as}} a form of protection from violence against ambulance crews, or in some cases (dependent on local laws) to prove or disprove cases where a member of crew stands accused of malpractice.|$|E
5|$|In another drawing style, the {{circular}} layout, the vertices of a graph {{are placed on}} a circle and the edges are drawn either <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the circle. Again, a placement of the edges within the circle (for instance as straight line segments) corresponds to a one-page book drawing, while a placement {{both inside and outside}} the circle corresponds to a two-page book drawing.|$|E
5|$|The mythology {{surrounding}} Rommel {{has been}} the subject of analysis by both English- and German-speaking historians in recent decades. The reevaluation has produced new interpretations of Rommel, including his relationship with National Socialism, his abilities as operational and strategic level commander, and his role (if any) in the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler. Historians and commentators conclude that Rommel remains an ambiguous figure, not easily definable either <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the myth.|$|E

5|$|A person <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> a {{security}} area who knows or has reasonable cause {{to believe that}} another person has committed an offence under Part III of the ISA, or has information about the present or intended movements or whereabouts of another person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be a terrorist, but who fails to report the matter to a police officer, commits an offence punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years. However, if the person voluntarily gives full information to a police officer before being accused of or charged with an offence, {{he or she will}} not be convicted.|$|E
5|$|It {{is also an}} offence, <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> a {{security}} area, {{to be found in}} possession of supplies which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for, or to directly or indirectly provide supplies to another person, in circumstances which raise the reasonable presumption referred to above. The penalty for all these offences is life imprisonment. However, in the latter situation, a person will not be convicted if he or she voluntarily provides full information of the offence to a police officer before being accused of or charged with the offence.|$|E
5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|Malawi is a democratic, multi-party government, {{currently}} {{under the leadership}} of Arthur Peter Mutharika, who defeated former president Joyce Banda in the 2014 elections, despite alleged poll rigging. The current constitution was put into place on 18 May 1995. The branches of the government consist of executive, legislative and judicial. The executive includes a president who is both chief of state and head of government, first and second vice presidents and a cabinet. The president is elected every five years, and the vice president is chosen by the president. A second vice president may be appointed by the president if so chosen, although they must be from a different party. The members of the cabinet are appointed by the president and can be from either <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> of the legislature.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E

50|$|Missile defense {{can take}} place either <b>inside</b> (endoatmospheric) <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> (exoatmospheric) the Earth's atmosphere. The {{trajectory}} of most ballistic missiles takes them {{inside and outside the}} Earth's atmosphere, and they can be intercepted in either place. There are advantages and disadvantages to either intercept technique.|$|R
5|$|Agile, quick, creative, and powerful, Balotelli is {{credited}} with pace, flair, physical strength, technical ability, and an eye for goal; his height, elevation and physique allow him to excel in the air, and {{he is capable of}} scoring with his head or with either foot, from both <b>inside</b> <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the area. Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, teammates, and the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, as well as his for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile temperament and arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by teammates and the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E
