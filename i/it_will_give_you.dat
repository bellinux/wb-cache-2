500|$|Pool of Radiance was {{the first}} in a four-part series of {{computer}} D adventures set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The others were released by SSI one year apart: Curse of the Azure Bonds (1989), Secret of the Silver Blades (1990), and Pools of Darkness (1991). The 1989 game Hillsfar was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to Pool of Radiance. Hillsfar is described instead, by the reviewers of Dragon, as [...] "a value-added adventure for those who would like to take a side trip while awaiting the sequel". A player can import characters from Pool of Radiance into Hillsfar, although the characters are reduced to their basic levels and do not retain weapons or magical items. Original Hillsfar characters cannot be exported to Pool of Radiance, but they can be exported to Curse of the Azure Bonds. A review for Curse of the Azure Bonds in Computer Gaming World noted that [...] "you can transfer your characters from Pool of Radiance and it's a good idea to do so. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a headstart in the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|If I {{send someone}} {{out of the}} room - for example, the mother and child - I {{carefully}} move father from his chair and put him into mother's chair. Or if I send the child out, I might put mother in the child's chair, at least temporarily. Sometimes I comment on this by saying, 'As you sit where your son was sitting, you can think more clearly about him.' Or, 'If you sit where your husband sat, maybe <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> somewhat of his view about me'. Over a series of interviews with an entire family, I shuffle them about, so that what was originally mother's chair is now where father is sitting. The family grouping remains, and yet that family grouping is being rearranged, which is what you are after when changing a family." ...|$|E

"Methinks I {{have some}} remembrance of the lilt," [...] remarked the gleeman, running {{his fingers over}} the strings, [...] "Hoping that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee</b> no offence, most holy sir"--with a vicious snap at Alleyne--"and with the kind permit of the company, I will even venture upon it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I suppose so, and there's {{an end of}} it. I, for one, am not in {{the least}} disappointed,--if <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> any comfort to know that." ...|$|E

The sight of this will make thee base in thine own eyes. 2. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee</b> occasion to see the need and excellency of repentance. 3. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> put thee upon prayer to God for help and pardon. 4. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> make thee weary of this world. 5. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> make grace to persevere the more desirable in thine eyes.|$|R
