5|$|During {{the third}} season, Coulson begins a secret mission to {{assemble}} the Secret Warriors, a team of Inhumans, as Hydra restores its ancient Inhuman leader Hive to power. After the defeat of Hive and with Hydra destroyed, S.H.I.E.L.D. is made a legitimate organization once again for the fourth season, with {{the signing of the}} Sokovia Accords. Coulson returns to being a field agent, due to the world believing he is dead, and is tasked with tracking down more enhanced people including Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider. In addition, Agent Leo Fitz and Holden Radcliffe complete their work on the Life Model Decoy project as well as the development of the Framework.

Frustrated by his {{continued}} failures to excel, he retreats to London to spare his own life, but discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Eventually receiving {{a vision of a}} dam in Germany, indicating that the Omega is hiding there, Cage and Vrataski spend many loops <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski, who lost a loved one to the Mimics, is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic struggling to bleed him out and strip off his ability to reset time. Before they can slowly bleed him to death, Cage deliberately drowns himself to avoid the process.|$|E

5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. <b>Figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E

25|$|Although {{research}} is limited, {{research has shown}} that climate change may alter the developmental stages of pathogens that can affect crops. The biggest consequence of climate change on the dispersal of pathogens is that the geographical distribution of hosts and pathogens could shift, which would result in more crop losses.

The success of the first-generation iPod was almost overnight. By 2004 the business became so important to Apple that the iPod was spun off into its own division, which Rubinstein took over.|$|E
25|$|A fill-in crossword (also {{known as}} crusadex or cruzadex) {{features}} a grid {{and the full}} list of words to be entered in that grid, but does not give explicit clues for where each word goes. The challenge is <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> integrate the list of words together within the grid so that all intersections of words are valid. Fill-in crosswords may often have longer word length than regular crosswords to make the crossword easier to solve, and symmetry is often disregarded. Fitting together several long words is easier than fitting together several short words because there are fewer possibilities for how the long words intersect together. These types of crosswords are also used to demonstrate artificial intelligence abilities, such as finding solutions to the puzzle based {{on a set of}} determined constraints.|$|E

500|$|Director Noriaki Akitaya {{had faced}} a similar dilemma for his {{animated}} film version.

[...] This led Akitaya to be extremely careful about how he went about constructing the character in terms of his speech, gestures and behavior all the while staying true to what was already established in the game. Akitaya admitted that he {{would not have been able}} to meet the expectations of the individual fans of the game since they were able to choose their own unique name and personality for the protagonist. Instead Akitaya took the route of incorporating the most general traits of fan reactions to the protagonist to form Yuki's character.|$|E
500|$|Another {{possibility}} {{to eradicate the}} HSV-1 variant is being pursued by a team at Duke University. By <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> switch all copies of the virus in the host from latency to their active stage at the same time, rather than the way the virus copies normally stagger their activity stage, leaving some dormant somewhere at all times, [...] conventional antiviral drugs might kill the entire virus population, since {{they can no longer}} hide in the nerve cells. One class of drugs called antagomir could serve this purpose. These are chemically engineered oligonucleotides or short segments of RNA that can be made to mirror their target genetic material, namely herpes microRNAs. They could be engineered to attach and thus 'silence' the microRNA, thus rendering the virus incapable of remaining latent in its host. Professor Cullen believes a drug could be developed to block the microRNA {{whose job it is to}} suppress HSV-1 into latency.|$|E
