Stalin retained this name for the rest of his life, possibly because it had been used on the article which established his reputation among the Bolsheviks.|$|E

2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the <b>finished</b> <b>article</b> a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|E

The agricultural labourers, in our example, were paid in corn, and if we had called them weavers, we should have supposed them to be paid in cloth. This supposition is allowable, for it is obviously of no consequence, in a question of value, or cost of production, what precise article we assume as the medium of exchange. The supposition has, besides, the recommendation of being conformable to the most ordinary state of the facts; for it is by the sale of his own <b>finished</b> <b>article</b> that each capitalist obtains the means of hiring labourers to renew the production; which is virtually {{the same thing as}} if, instead of selling the article for money and giving the money to his labourers, he gave the article itself to the labourers, and they sold it for their daily bread.|$|E
50|$|The term {{hardened}} steel {{is often used}} for a medium or high carbon steel that has been given heat treatment and then quenching followed by tempering.
