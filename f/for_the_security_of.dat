5|$|In 1953 the State Department's {{physical}} security was split between {{foreign and domestic}} branches. Uanna reorganized these into one group called the Division of Physical Security, consisting of four branches, and took over as its new chief. He then published the Protection of Dignitaries Manual and developed the handbook used at the training school for Marine Security Guards assigned to U. S. embassies, legations and consulates overseas. As Chief of the Division, Uanna was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> all State's personnel and facilities in the United States and abroad. He {{was responsible for the}} security for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip's visit to the United States in 1957.|$|E

These companies and the harbour defence boats used to patrol the river were {{under the command of}} Harbour Commander Korvettenkapitän Kellerman. The 333rd Infantry Division was the German Army unit responsible for the defence of the coast between St Nazaire and Lorient. The division had no troops based in the town, but some were located in villages nearby and would be able to respond to any attack on the port.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{their arrival}} in the north, the 1st Parachute Brigade assumed {{responsibility}} for the District of Galilee, and the 3rd Parachute Brigade for the District of Haifa, with division headquarters located in the Stella Maris Monastery. The 1st Parachute Brigade also took under its command the Transjordan Frontier Force and a battalion of the Arab Legion to cover their large area. In the north the division was mainly responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the port of Haifa, {{the largest in the}} country, where they protected oil installations, the Mosul-Haifa oil pipeline and prevented illegal immigrants from landing on the coastline. On 31January it was announced that all non-essential British civilians were to be evacuated, due to the worsening situation. The evacuation took place from Haifa between 5and8February, {{under the control of the}} 8th Parachute Battalion and the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|When Colonel James C. Marshal {{established}} the Manhattan District in June 1942, {{he created a}} Protective Security Section {{as part of its}} staff, responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> its people, installations and information. He also arranged with the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Major General George V. Strong, for support from the Military Intelligence Service. Strong gave Lansdale special responsibility for the Manhattan District, and Lansdale, in turn, arranged with the G-2s of each of the service commands for officers to be assigned to report directly to him, thus bypassing both the service command G-2s and their commanders. He also organised a special counterintelligence group in Washington, D.C., headed by himself, that reported directly to both Strong and Brigadier General Leslie Groves, who became director of the Manhattan Project in September 1942.|$|E
5|$|Discontent {{crystallised}} into {{a wave of}} uprisings and rioting {{known as}} the Small Revolution (Kleine Revolutie) of 1787. The revolution was suppressed by levying the civil militias but it alarmed the Governors-General and opposition grew. The Small Revolution proved that the Austrian army was insufficient on its own to keep order without some popular support. The allegiance of the civil militias, who were already beginning to call themselves Patriots (Patriotten), was uncertain. Fearing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the regime, the Governors-General temporarily suspended the reforms without the Emperor's permission on 20 May 1787. They invited all aggrieved parties to express their opposition and grievances in petitions but this merely inflamed the regime's critics. The Emperor himself was furious and recalled his minister, Ludovico, Count di Belgiojoso. Alarmed by the level of unrest, Joseph eventually agreed to repeal his reforms to the judicial system and governance but left his clerical reforms in place. He hoped that, by removing the grievances of the states and middle classes, the opposition would become divided and would be easily suppressed. He also appointed a new Minister Plenipotentiary to oversee the province. The concession did not stop the opposition growing, inspired and funded by the Catholic clergy, which became especially notable at the University of Leuven.|$|E

5|$|During the Duke's {{march to}} the Danube Emperor LeopoldI offered to make Marlborough a prince of the Holy Roman Empire in the small principality of Mindelheim. The Queen enthusiastically agreed to this elevation, but after the successes of 1704, the {{campaign}} of 1705 brought little reason for satisfaction on the Continent. The planned invasion of France via the Moselle valley was frustrated by friend and foe alike, forcing the Duke to withdraw back towards the Low Countries. Although Marlborough penetrated the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim in July, Allied indecision and considerable Dutch hesitancy (concerned as they were <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> their homeland), prevented the Duke from pressing his advantage. The French and the Tories in England dismissed arguments that only Dutch obstructionism had robbed Marlborough of a great victory in 1705, confirmed in their belief that Blenheim had been a lucky strike and that Marlborough was a general not to be feared.|$|E
5|$|Following the mutiny of the French Guards a {{few hours}} before the {{storming}} of the Bastille, the only troops immediately available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the palace at Versailles were the aristocratic Garde du Corps (Body Guard) and the Cent-Suisses (Hundred Swiss). Both were primarily ceremonial units and lacked the numbers and training to provide effective protection for the royal family and the government. Accordingly, the Flanders Regiment (a regular infantry regiment of the Royal Army) was ordered to Versailles in late September 1789 by the king's minister of war, the Comte de Saint-Priest, as a precautionary measure. On 1 October, the officers at Versailles held a welcoming banquet for the officers of the new troops, a customary practice when a unit changed its garrison. The royal family briefly attended the affair, walking amongst the tables set up in the opera house of the palace. Outside, in the cour de marbre (central courtyard), the soldiers' toasts and oaths of fealty to the king grew more demonstrative as the night wore on.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, barring {{intermittent}} passes and valleys (the major one being the corridor through Zhangjiakou and the Juyong Pass), the North China Plain remained shielded from the Mongolian steppe by the Yin Mountains. However, if this defence were breached, China's flat terrain offered no protection {{to the cities}} on the plain, including the imperial capitals of Beijing, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. Heading west along the Yin Mountains, the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards upstream in the area known as the Ordos Looptechnically part of the steppe, but capable of irrigated agriculture. Although the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the north, such a border so far into the steppe was difficult to maintain. The lands south of the Yellow River—the Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the Loess Plateau—provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence over the steppe, but also <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> China proper. The region's strategic importance combined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls here.|$|E

5|$|In March 1945, No. 4 Commando was {{relieved}} by No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando {{and moved to}} Middelburg and stayed at Bergen-Op-Zoom by April. While responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the immediate area, they conducted small raids from the sea against Zuid Holland. Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945. On the No.4 Commando front the two French troops crossed the channel to Schouwen and Lieutenant Colonel Dawson accepted the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the region. Within days of the surrender No.4 Commando moved to Recklinghausen in Germany {{as part of the}} occupation forces. In Recklinghausen part of their duties were to provide the guard force for a civilian internment camp. The camp housed several thousand German civilians who were not prisoners of war. Inmates included those with no identification and those known to have served in concentration camps. The two French troops returned to French control and were demobilised. Other men were posted to No.s 3 and 6 Commandos in Britain, who were preparing for a move to the Far East to continue the fight in the Burma campaign. By June 1945 the strength of No. 4 Commando had been reduced to 188 all ranks. During a visit in October 1945, Lieutenant General Robert Sturges informed them that the War Office had decided to disband all army commandos. Those not due to be demobilised would be returned to their parent regiment or corps. No.4 Commando was formally disbanded in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus' {{predecessor}} Caracalla {{was murdered}} on April 8, 217, {{during a period}} of war with the Parthians, near Carrhae while traveling en-route to visit a temple. His murderer was Justin Martialus, a soldier who was incensed after being declined the rank of centurion. Martialus was himself cut down by Caracalla's German Guards immediately afterwards, a convenient fact for Macrinus, at the time a Praetorian prefect, who was involved in the assassination. One reason for Macrinus to have intrigued against Caracalla was out of fear <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> his own life. A story documented by Roman writer Herodian and supported by some later historians details the events leading to Caracalla's death. The story goes that Macrinus, {{in the course of his}} employment, was often tasked with reading dispatches sent to Caracalla for him. One such dispatch detailed a prophecy, perhaps fabricated, from the oracle at Delphi suggesting that Macrinus was destined to kill Caracalla and succeed him as the next emperor.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July B Company, 2 RAR was {{relieved}} on The Hook by D Company, and subsequently moved into reserve. The following day, with the ceasefire {{believed to be}} imminent, Wilton limited patrols to only those considered essential <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> his forward positions. Rumours spread quickly among the troops that the truce {{was expected to be}} signed on 26 July. However, by 24 July the Chinese shelling had once again grown in intensity, while large bodies of Chinese infantry were increasingly seen on the forward slopes by the Australians. Meanwhile, similar concentrations of Chinese were also reported by the US Marines. With the Chinese eager to gain a last-minute victory over the UN forces and the tactical advantage offered to the side that held The Hook after the truce, simultaneous attacks were soon launched against 2 RAR and the US 7th Marine Regiment on the left flank, in two major actions on the nights of 24/25 and 25/26 July.|$|E

5|$|The English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642 between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Harlech apparently had not been repaired following the 1468 siege, and had become completely dilapidated, {{with the exception of}} the gatehouse, which was used for the local assizes. In 1644 Prince Rupert appointed a local Royalist, Colonel William Owen, as the castle's constable, and Owen was entrusted with repairing the fortifications. A long siege ensued from June 1646 until 15 March 1647, when the garrison of 44 men surrendered to Major-General Thomas Mytton. The castle was the last mainland royal fortress to surrender in the war, and the date marked the end of the first phase of the war. The castle was no longer required <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> North Wales and, to prevent any further use by the Royalists, Parliament ordered its slighting, or destruction. The orders were only partially carried out, however, and the gatehouse staircases were destroyed and the castle rendered generally unusable, but it was not totally demolished. Stone from the castle was reused to build houses in the local town.|$|E

40|$|The article investigates <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> {{economic}} <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city in {{the strategic}} management system. The article describes the process <b>of</b> ensuring <b>the</b> economic <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. The organizational approach was approved using the example of Kharkiv city. The list of threats to <b>the</b> economic <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and their urgency is justified by combining such methods as expert surveys, SWOT-analysis and the hierarchy analysis method. There proposed a methodical approach to assessing <b>the</b> economic <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city based on a hierarchically built system of indices (integral, complex and partial), which allowed determining <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> economic <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and imbalances {{in the development of}} its functional components. It is proposed to work out scenarios <b>for</b> ensuring <b>the</b> economic <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city by combining the cognitive modeling and the scenario approach, which makes it possible to determine directions of the implementation of <b>the</b> strategy <b>for</b> ensuring <b>the</b> economic <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and choose leverages of state regulation.
