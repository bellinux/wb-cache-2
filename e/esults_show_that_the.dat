40|$|Robotic {{end-effectors}} {{provide the}} link between machines and the environment. The evolution of end-effector design has traded off between simplistic single-taskers and highly complex multi-function grippers. For future space operations, launch payload weight and {{the wide range of}} desired tasks necessitate a highly dexterous design with strength and manipulation capabilities matching those of the suited astronaut using EVA tools. The human hand provides the ideal parallel for a dexterous end-effector design. This thesis discusses efforts to design an anthropomorphic robotic hand, focusing on the detailed design, fabrication, and testing of an individual modular finger with considerations into overall hand configuration. The research first aims to define requirements for anthropomorphism and compare the geometry and motion of the design to that of the human hand. Active and passive ranges of motion are studied along with coupled joint behavior and grasp types. The second objective is to study the benefits and drawbacks of an active versus passive actuation systems. Tradeoffs between controllability and packaging of actuator assemblies are considered. Finally, a kinematic model is developed to predict tendon tensions and tip forces in different configurations. The <b>esults</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> measured forces are consistent with the predictive model. In addition, the coupled joint motion shows similar behavior to that of the human hand...|$|E

40|$|Pictor A is {{a nearby}} Fanaroff-Riley class II (FR II) radio galaxy {{with a bright}} hot spot, the western hot spot. Observation of high {{polarization}} in the optical emission of the hot spot indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> optical emission could be synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons in the hot spot. These electrons {{may be able to}} produce high energy gamma-ray photons through inverse Compton (IC) scattering. We use single-zone and multi-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) models to fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) from the radio to the X-ray band of the hot spot. Our <b>esults</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> case of a much weaker magnetic field strength than the equipartition magnetic field, both the single-zone and multi-zone models can fit the SED, but the multi-zone model significantly improves the fit. The two models predict the hot spot as a GeV-TeV source, which might be marginally detectable with Fermi/LAT and HESS. The inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (IC/CMB) is also considered, but its contribution to GeV-TeV emission is negligible.

40|$|Sequential data (a. k. a. time-series) {{a rise in}} a {{multitude}} of {{different fields such as}} bi oinformatics, automatic speech recognition, roboti cs, computer vision, and computational finance. Wh ile the nature of the data generated in these appl ications is highly heterogeneous, the problems ari sing from such a wide range of fields reveal a str iking similarity when seen through the lens of pro babilistic time-series models. Most of the applica tion-specific problems fit in fact into one of the two main categories of algorithms developed for probabilistic time- series models: in ference (e. g. predict future values, estimate hidden variables from observab le ones, or partition a complex time-series in a s et of elementary segments) and learning (e. g. estimate time-series model para meters from observations, or discover pattern s or anomalies in time-series). In this thesis, a Bayesian treatment o f the uncertainties involved in time-ser ies models is adopted, and a set of probabili stic time-series models (<b>that</b> fall in <b>the</b> cat egory of switching models) is applied to four seemingly distant problems, namely¨ automatic segmentation of human gait time -series, classification of pathological g ait patterns, fault detection and recogni tion in robotic assembly tasks, and gas concentration estimation in unstructured envir onments using metal-oxide sensors. All these problems can be solved as inference or learning in a Bayesian time-series model, and have in common <b>the</b> crucial role <b>that</b> dom ain-specific expert knowledge plays in their¨ solution. The most attractive feat ure offered by the Bayesian framework is perh aps its potential to incorporate domain-s pecific expert knowledge either in the f orm of informative priors on the mod el parameters (to regularize the learning process), or in terms of tailored conditional independ ence assumptions between model variables (to simplify inference). The main goal of this thesis is to investigate to whic h extent this potential can be fulfilled, and to h ighlight the scientific and pragmatic challenges i dentified and/or solved during this quest. In ¨particular, two Bayesian time-series models¨ are used in this thesis: the sticky-Hiera rchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model ¨(sticky-HDP-HMM) and the Augmented¨ Switching Linear Dynamical System model (aSLD S). The sticky-HDP-HMM is used in the gait segmentation and gait pattern cl assification applications. In both applications, r <b>esults</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> combining <b>the</b> HDP-HMM to an ad-hoc pre-processing step of the ga it time-series allows to transfer clinical kn owledge about human gait into the time-series model. This combined approach improves the p erformances in both applications, with respec t {{to the use of the}} HDP-HMM in isol ation. Motivated by these results, an extensi on of the HDP-HMM, named POLY-HDP-HMM is prop osed in this thesis. The sticky-HDP -HMM is also used for fault detection and recognit ion in robotic assembly tasks to learn force/torqu e sensor signature models. These mod els are used to classify faulty and succ essful task executions, allowing the robot to react on-line to errors and undertake er ror-specific recovery strategies. Finally, t he problem of estimating gas concentration in ¨unstructured envi- ronments using MOX sensor s is formulated as inference in an aSLDS model. In this application, domain-specific¨ expert knowledge is directly used in the construct ion of the model itself, rather than in estimating ¨its parameters. The proposed aSLDS model is¨ effective in overcoming the slow dynamical re sponse of MOX sensors, therefore extending their r ange of applicability in field robotics scenarios. In this thesis, we <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> adopted Bayesian time-series models can take advan tage of some of the available domain-specific expert knowledge to improve inferen ce and learning results. However, it appears¨ clear that, especially in clinical appli cations, further improvement can be achieved¨ increasing the transfer of clinical know ledge to the models. For this reason, we prop ose and discuss extensions to the time-series mode ls used in this thesis, and introduce new ones. status: publishe...|$|R

This was done with a diagnostic instrument for AoS that was developed in the Netherlands in 2012, the Diagnostic Instrument for Apraxia of Speech (DIAS; Feiken & Jonkers, 2012). There were 8 signs identified as specific to AoS, namely: inconsistency of errors, number of errors with consonants versus vowels, difference between sequencing and alternating diadochokinesis, groping, initiation problems, syllable segmentation, cluster segmentation, and articulatory complexity.

For example, when targeting shared-memory multiprocessors, parallel programs are compiled to minimize sharing, in or der to decr ease high-cost, inter-processor communication. This paper reexamines several compiler optimizations in the context of simultaneous multithr eading (SMT), a processor architecture that issues instructions from multiple threads to the functional units each cycle. Unlike shared-memory multiprocessors, SMT provides and benefits from fine-grained sharing of pr ocessor and memory system resources; unlike curr ent uniprocessors, SMT exposes and benefits fr om inter-thread instruction-level parallelism when hiding latencies. Therefore, optimizations that are appropriate for these conventional machines may be inappropriate for SMT.

Drawing on some logic from non-cooperative game theory, we propose axioms which relate the outcomes of the procedures. We also promote aweak monotonicity axiom on solutions, called issue-by-issue monotonicity, which is geared toward multiple-issue bargaining. Our main result concerns {{the relationship between a}} sequential bargaining procedure-with <b>the</b> rule <b>that</b> agreements are implemented only after all issues are resolved-and global bargaining (in which all issues are negotiated simultaneously). If a bargaining solution predicts the same outcome with these two procedures, then we say that it satisfies ~enda independence.
