40|$|In today’s {{information}} technology <b>infrastructures</b> <b>Service</b> Level Management (SLM) {{is considered a}} vital discipline of IT Service Management. Only by having a framework for establishing a common understanding of services {{and the manner in}} which they are used and provided, can next generation IT infrastructures (e-Infrastuctures) maintain a sufficient “customer satisfaction” on a sustainable level. However, SLM has not been successfully implemented and deployed in any of today’s e-Infrastuctures. To remedy this situation, Grid environments are seen as a very promising starting point. In this paper we outline the challenges when adapting SLM from traditional infrastructures for the use in Grid environments and how the gSLM project will help in adopting SLM to Grids. ...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{more and}} more cloud <b>infrastructure</b> <b>service</b> {{providers}} are providing large numbers of service instances which are a combination of diversified resources, such as computing, storage, and network. However, for cloud <b>infrastructure</b> <b>services,</b> {{the lack of a}} description standard and the inadequate research of systematic discovery and selection methods have exposed difficulties in discovering and choosing services for users. First, considering the highly configurable properties of a cloud <b>infrastructure</b> <b>service,</b> the feature model method is used to describe such a service. Second, based on the description of the cloud <b>infrastructure</b> <b>service,</b> a systematic discovery and selection method for cloud <b>infrastructure</b> <b>services</b> are proposed. The automatic analysis techniques of the feature model are introduced to verify the model’s validity and to perform the matching of the service and demand models. Finally, we determine the critical decision metrics and their corresponding measurement methods for cloud <b>infrastructure</b> <b>services,</b> where the subjective and objective weighting results are combined to determine the weights of the decision metrics. The best matching instances from various providers are then ranked by their comprehensive evaluations.

40|$|Abstract—It is {{expected}} that future shop-floors will be populated by thousands of networked embedded devices. Those will not only communicate using IP (as in TCP/IP), but also feature some autonomy, allowing them to collaborate among themselves and with enterprise systems. As they can offer both their mechatronic and higher-level functions as a service and support dynamic deployment of new code, they can execute business logic locally, allowing for new classes of business processes that are executed collaboratively by back-end and embedded systems. While some parts of a process will still be executed in the data centre, the rest will execute directly on embedded devices on the shop-floor. Business Process execution will therefore be more dynamic and context-based. We introduce an approach to manage efficient business process execution over such highly dynamic <b>infrastructures.</b> <b>Service</b> Type able to execute T 1 Process step S 1 s 1,...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—With the {{commoditization}} {{of cloud}} computing, {{more and more}} companies prefer to outsource IT resources into virtual <b>infrastructures.</b> <b>Service</b> Level Agreements (SLAs) can be helpful {{to make the right}} investment decision. A SLA template represents the pre-agreed SLA state. A service provider proposes the SLA content and submits the template to a marketplace for customer consideration. Customers use SLA template views as ”What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWIG) snapshots prior to service selection and before agreement initialization. The paper proposes a filtering frame-work that is based on a faceted approach and that uses SLA templates to guide marketplace customers through available services. The framework design is presented along with the data-model of SLA templates. We report the results from testing the faceted filtering with two different SLA storage approaches and evaluate their appropriateness for the web application layer.

40|$|While {{new forms}} of attacks are {{developed}} every day to compromise essential <b>infrastructures,</b> <b>service</b> providers are also expected to develop strategies to mitigate the risk of extreme failures. In this context, tools of Network Science {{have been used to}} evaluate network robustness and propose resilient topologies against attacks. We present here a new rewiring method to modify the network topology improving its robustness, based on the evolution of the network largest component during a sequence of targeted attacks. In comparison to previous strategies, our method lowers by several orders of magnitude the computational effort necessary to improve robustness. Our rewiring also drives the formation of layers of nodes with similar degree while keeping a highly modular structure. This "modular onion-like structure" is a particular class of the onion-like structure previously described in the literature. We apply our rewiring strategy to an unweighted representation of the World Air Transportation network and show that an improvement of 30 % in its overall robustness can be achieved through smart swaps of around 9 % of its links.

30|$|In Italy, {{as already}} mentioned, the first {{national}} landslide database was created with the AVI project (Guzzetti et al. 1994). AVI originally covered the period 1918 – 1990; successive revisions of the project put the final number of recorded landslides to 22, 346 in the period 1009 – 2001 (National Research Council, 1990). Since the early 2000 s, following a major landslide disaster that occurred in 1998 and the subsequent new legislation (e.g. Cascini 2005), landslide inventory maps at regional scale have been produced by the River Basin Authorities adopting different methodological approaches (Ferlisi and De Chiara 2016). An integration at national scale of available information coming from different sources, including the AVI Project and the River Basin Authority inventory maps, {{is provided by the}} IFFI Project (Trigila et al., 2010). As of today, the IFFI database holds 614, 799 landslide phenomena, covering an area of approximately 23, 000  km 2, which is equivalent to 7.5 % of the Italian territory (ISPRA, 2014). Since 2010, yearly reports on landslide events that caused victims, injuries, evacuees or damage to buildings, <b>infrastructures,</b> <b>service</b> networks and environmental and cultural heritage sites are published by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, ISPRA (ISPRA, 2009). From 2010 to 2016 (year of latest available report), 1033 landslide events have been recorded. Since 2011, the National Research Council (CNR) also compiles an inventory of landslides that caused direct consequences to people, i.e. deaths, missing persons, evacuations or injuries (National Research Council, 2011). The total number of landslide events recorded from 2011 to 2017 is 138. These events caused 43 deaths and 151 injuries. Published yearly reports also include maps and figures of the consequences to people in the previous 50  years. In the latest report, considering data from 1967 to 2016, the consequences are distributed as follows: 1205 deaths, 12 missing persons, 1509 injures and almost 150, 000 evacuated people.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined how}} web-based services influence {{the relationship between}} service quality and customer loyalty. There have been numerous studies that have examined service quality based on SERVQUAL in traditional service industries. Some studies investigated customer loyalty based on Zeithmal, Parasuraman, and Malhotra 2 ̆ 7 s (2000) behavioral intentions (e. g. Mattila, 2004; Mattila 2 ̆ 6 Patterson, 2004). Constrained by changing market conditions and Internet <b>infrastructures,</b> <b>service</b> quality has become more complicated. Customer loyalty management for web-based services may {{be different from the}} traditional practice. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to test the SERVQUAL (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, 2 ̆ 6 Berry, 1988) and Zeithmal, Berry, and Parasuraman 2 ̆ 7 s (1996) theoretical framework of behavioral intentions on the web-based services using the e-Servqual instrument. The results indicate that there was a statistical difference between the perceptions of service quality between the organizational employees and customers surveyed on all four dimensions of service quality as measured by the e-SERVQUAL instrument. The perception scores of service quality according to employees were higher than the perception scores according to the customers. The results also indicate that there is a relationship between service quality and consumer loyalty. However, the results indicate that there is no relationship between quality perception and consumer satisfaction. In addition, the research found gender plays a role in the privacy and fulfillment aspects of service quality, with men placing particular emphasis on these two components. Moreover, the research found that there is support for the four factors of service quality, efficiency, service availability, fulfillment and privacy based on all of the groups surveyed. However, the factor analysis results suggest that the factors as measured by the e-SERVQUAL instrument may not be as clearly defined when used in a Chinese population. The results of this study should help organizations in making decisions on marketing activities based on service quality perception, customer loyalty and customer satisfaction in Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s online service industry. Future studies on service quality and the value of the e-SERVQUAL instrument in non-American cultures should be considered in order to expand on the research findings from this study...|$|E
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSN) are a foreseeable {{source of}} innovation in many {{fields and the}} number of WSN deployments is expected to grow rapidly in the near future. One of the key challenges in designing, implementing, deploying and maintaining complex systems that use WSNs is provisioning and integration of sensor data with existing communication <b>infrastructures.</b> <b>Service</b> Oriented Architecture (SOA) is considered a promising distributed computing approach for providing a common communication platform that supports interoperability and scalability on the application layer. The work in this thesis investigates the application of SOA in WSNs in terms of different technological solutions, performance requirements and scalability. The focus is on efficient implementation and data representation techniques that are capable of meeting the requirements of resource constrained sensor nodes. To date, research efforts in embedded SOA solutions have been focused mainly on middleware software systems in gateway devices for interacting with the sensor network. The work presented here is directed towards deploying interoperable standard-based web services directly on the sensor nodes instead of using gateways and proprietary protocols. This strategy provides for manageable WSN provisioning and interoperability between heterogeneous sensor nodes. The biggest drawback in this approach is the overhead in network throughput, latency, memory, CPU and power consumption connected to the use of verbose data encoding formats such as extensible markup language (XML). In order to mitigate this overhead, in Paper A we investigate various resource aware implementation techniques deployed on a sensor node. The techniques include the use of application specific XML parser, lightweight TCP/IP stack with split-phase interface, parsing on-the-fly and sleep schedules. The results show {{that it is possible to}} use standard SOA implementations for resource constrained wireless sensors. Nevertheless, the use of this approach is limited to applications with low real-time requirements due to increased latency in the message exchange. In order to further lower the SOA overhead, the work in this thesis investigates the use of binary representation of the XML data. Based on an initial investigation, the newly emerged W 3 C standard - Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), provides the best compression and processing efficiency when it comes to XML structured information. For that reason, in Paper C we study how EXI can be applied to the state of the art SOA middlewares for factory automation in order to verify and analyze the benefits of using EXI in industrial environment. Based on this analysis and the experiments that are carried out, we conclude that EXI is a very beneficial technology for factory automation software that is capable of extending the reach of industrial SOA solutions to wireless sensor nodes. The work presented in this thesis also analyzes the current EXI implementations and shows that they are not designed to meet the high requirements of resource utilization in WSN deployments. In Paper B we also perform an analysis of the EXI specification and how it maps to the industrial requirements for wireless sensor nodes. The result of this work is an innovative software design of a new EXI processor targeted at highly resource constrained devices. Among other things, as a part of this EXI processor design is a proposal for a new Application Programming Interface (API) for working with XML Information Set items. Moreover, this work has developed an open source implementation of the new EXI processor design in order to verify the proposed architectural models. The benefits of the new API when it comes to efficiency are experimentally verified for a small embedded platform. The key aim in this work is the vertical integration between WSN and enterprise level systems. The achieved results show that the use of special implementation design as well as the EXI protocol for XML data representation provide large gains in efficiency in WSN deployments. The next step in this work is to investigate and compare these results with the new RESTful constrained protocols under development by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This analysis would pave the way towards reaching the final aim of creating a common, SOA-based communication architecture for cost-effective, flexible and reliable development of complex systems that use WSN technology.
