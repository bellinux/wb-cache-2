40|$|We {{present a}} {{general theory of}} serializability, unifying {{a wide range of}} {{transactional}} algorithms, including some that are yet to come. To this end, we provide a compact semantics in which concurrent transactions push their effects into the shared view (or unpush to recall effects) and pull the effects of potentially uncommitted concurrent transactions into their local view (or unpull to <b>detangle).</b> Each operation comes with simple side-conditions given in terms of commutativity (Lipton’s left-movers and right-movers [24]). The benefit of this model {{is that most of the}} elaborate reasoning (coinduction, simulation, subtle invariants, etc.) necessary for proving the serializability of a transactional algorithm is already proved within the semantic model. Thus, proving serializability (or opacity) amounts simply to mapping the algorithm on to our rules, and showing that it satisfies the rules ’ side-conditions. ...|$|E

The second posits that they lack policy offers for which to vote. This paper seeks to <b>detangle</b> these two explanations. Based on a dataset containing the positions of Belgian voters and parties on 23 policy statements, we find that inequality in opinion congruence is primarily the result of incorrect voting by lower educated voters. However, given Belgium’s political system—which increase the likelihood of policy offers attuned to lower educated voters, the education bias in parties’ policy offers is surprisingly high...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{accumulation}} of systems-level biological data, understanding the dynamic nature of cellular activity remains a difficult task. The {{reason is that}} most biological data are static, or only correspond to snapshots of cellular activity. In this study, we explicitly attempt to <b>detangle</b> the temporal complexity of biological networks by using compilations of time-series gene expression profiling data. We define a dynamic network module to be a set of proteins satisfying two conditions: (1) they form a connected component in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network; and (2) their expression profiles form certain structures in the temporal domain. We develop an efficient mining algorithm to discover dynamic modules in a temporal network. Using yeast as a model system, we demonstrate {{that the majority of}} the identified dynamic modules are functionally homogeneous. Additionally, many of them provide insight into the sequential ordering of molecular events in cellular systems. Finally, we note that the applicability of our algorithm is not limited to the study of PPI networks, instead it is generally applicable to the combination of any type of network and time-series data. 1...|$|E

40|$|When {{a person}} in a {{pedigree}} is discovered to be their own ancestor (and consequently their own descendent), an obvious error has been made. In turn, each person in the parental route, to relate that person to itself, can also trace themselves as their own ancestor, thus forming a cycling pedigree or “loop”. Within the FamilySearch pedigree, over 750, 000 persons are part of loops. Accordingly, in an accurate pedigree, loops would not exist. Though {{a large portion of the}} loops are of a size fewer than ten (approximately 10, 000), and could be un-tangled by hand, the majority of the nodes are part of loops larger than ten and are difficult to <b>detangle</b> by hand.

The objective of this research (in progress) is to find a solution to detangling loops or help expedite detangling loops by hand while preserving as much viable information within the FamilySearch pedigree, giving patrons a more accurate, less confusing pedigree to work with.

40|$|Values' {{have become}} a topic of {{discussion}} at the European level. This article tries to briefly track {{the reasons for this}} phenomenon as well as to <b>detangle</b> the foggy notion of 'values' in this context. The author differentiates between founding values, European ideas and common legal principles. All these different forms of European values differ in their respective legal and political character. Most importantly, they require a different level of European conformity. Special emphasis is given to the value of cultural diversity which can be considered, at most, a 'self-restrictive' value since it can be perceived from an inclusive perspective (including diversity within the states) or from an exclusive perspective (diversity amongst the states). Placing too much emphasis on the inclusive reading endangers the exclusive reading, and vice versa. In this context, the author refers to the new constitutional motto of the European Union as proposed by the constitutional treaty. Unlike the situation in Indonesia and South Africa (which both use the same motto) {{it does not seem to}} address subnational diversity. Instead, “United in diversity” aims at protecting national identities against excessive integration,and thus seems the very opposite of the US constitutional motto of “E pluribus unum”...|$|E

40|$|A {{transition}} in source-drain current vs back gate voltage ID - VBG characteristics from extrinsic polar molecule dominant hysteresis to anti-hysteresis induced by an oxygen deficient surface layer that is intrinsic to the ferroelectric thin films {{has been observed}} on graphene field-effect transistors on Pb 0. 92 La 0. 08 Zr 0. 52 Ti 0. 48 O 3 gates GFET/PLZT-Gate during a vacuum annealing process developed to systematically remove the polar molecules adsorbed on the GFET channel surface. This allows <b>detangle</b> of the extrinsic and intrinsic hysteresis on GFET/PLZT-gate devices and detection of the dynamic switch of electric dipoles using GFETs, taking advantage of their high gating efficiency on ferroelectric gate. A model of the charge trapping and pinning mechanism is proposed to successfully explain the transition. In response to pulsed VBG trains of positive, negative, as well as alternating polarities, respectively, the source-drain current ID variation is instantaneous with the response amplitude following the ID - VBG loops measured by DC VBG with consideration of the remnant polarization after a given VBG pulse when the gate electric field exceeds the coercive field of the PLZT. A detection sensitivity of around 212 dipole/um 2 has been demonstrated at room temperature, suggesting the GFET/ferroelectric-gate devices provide a promising high-sensitivity scheme for uncooled detection of electrical dipole dynamic switch...|$|E
40|$|Joint {{modeling}} of {{the intensity of}} facial action units (AUs) from face images is challenging due to {{the large number of}} AUs (30 +) and their intensity levels (6). This is in part {{due to the lack of}} suitable models that can efficiently handle such a large number of outputs/classes simultaneously, but also due to the lack of labelled target data. For this reason, majority of the methods proposed so far resort to independent classifiers for the AU intensity. This is suboptimal for at least two reasons: the facial appearance of some AUs changes depending on the intensity of other AUs, and some AUs co-occur more often than others. Encoding this is expected to improve the estimation of target AU intensities, especially in the case of noisy image features, head-pose variations and imbalanced training data. To this end, we introduce a novel modeling framework, Copula Ordinal Regression (COR), that leverages the power of copula functions and CRFs, to <b>detangle</b> the probabilistic {{modeling of}} AU dependencies from the marginal modeling of the AU intensity. Consequently, the COR model achieves the joint learning and inference of intensities of multiple AUs, while being computationally tractable. We show on two challenging datasets of naturalistic facial expressions that the proposed approach consistently outperforms (i) independent modeling of AU intensities, and (ii) the state-ofthe-art approach for the target task...|$|E

The findings reveals that in social organization of textile trading, several unique methods were adopted such as; placing of exclusive rights on some textile materials, innovation and imitation of textile materials for continuous trading of textile materials. In promotion of textile materials, the finding reveals that economic and non-economic activities were utilized to promote sales. While some classical tenets of entrepreneurship, were adopted by the women in recording the transactions.

40|$|Today's person {{detection}} methods work best {{when people are}} in common upright poses and appear reasonably well spaced out in the image. However, in many real images, that's not what people do. People often appear quite close to each other, e. g., with limbs linked or heads touching, and their poses are often not pedestrian-like. We propose an approach to <b>detangle</b> people in multi-person images. We formulate the task as a region assembly problem. Starting from a large set of overlapping regions from body part semantic segmentation and generic object proposals, our optimization approach reassembles those pieces together into multiple person instances. It enforces that the composed body part regions of each person instance obey constraints on relative sizes, mutual spatial relationships, foreground coverage, and exclusive label assignments when overlapping. Since optimal region assembly is a challenging combinatorial problem, we present a Lagrangian relaxation method to accelerate the lower bound estimation, thereby enabling a fast branch and bound solution for the global optimum. As output, our method produces a pixel-level map indicating both 1) the body part labels (arm, leg, torso, and head), and 2) which parts belong to which individual person. Our results on three challenging datasets show our method is robust to clutter, occlusion, and complex poses. It outperforms a variety of competing methods, including existing detector CRF methods and region CNN approaches. In addition, we demonstrate its impact on a proxemics recognition task, which demands a precise representation of "whose body part is where" in crowded images...|$|E
