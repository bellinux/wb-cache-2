In 1960, two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans to collapse into the river.

5|$|Aviation in Oslo {{started in}} 1909, when Carl Cederström of Sweden made {{exhibition}} flights from fields at Etterstad.

When they left, the gods <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should not be poured out, but rather kept {{as a symbol of}} their peace, and so from the contents made a man, Kvasir. Kvasir is later murdered, and from his blood is made the Mead of Poetry.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, other European powers had <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not {{in their}} {{interest}} that any one power should dominate the Baltic Sea.

The castle was virtually razed {{to the ground in}} the operation, although a brick building continued {{to be used as a}} prison into the 18th century. A large house was built in the bailey in 1700, followed by a gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837.|$|E
