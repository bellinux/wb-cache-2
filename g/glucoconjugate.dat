40|$|Toxicity and {{metabolism}} of para-chlorophenol (p-CP) in {{the marine}} microalga Tetraselmis marina have been studied. The inhibition constant EC 50 for p-CP was 272 +/- 17 mu M (34. 8 +/- 2. 2 mg L- 1) under the experimental conditions. Two metabolites were detected in the growth medium {{in the presence of}} p-CP by reverse phase HPLC and their concentrations increased at the expense of p-CP. The two metabolites, which were found to be more polar than p-CP, were isolated by a C 18 column. They were identified as p-chlorophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (p-CPG) and p-chlorophenyl-beta-D-(6 -O-malonyl) -glucopyranoside (p-CPGM) by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric analysis in a negative ion mode. The molecular structures of p-CPG and p-CPGM were further confirmed by enzymatic and alkaline hydrolyses. Treatment with beta-glucosidase released free p-CP and glucose from p-CPG, whereas p-CPGM was completely resistant. Alkaline hydrolysis completely cleaved the esteric bond of the malonylated <b>glucoconjugate</b> and yielded p-CPG and malonic acid. It was concluded that the pathway of p-CP metabolism in T. marina involves an initial conjugation of p-CP to glucose to form p-chlorophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, followed by acylation of the <b>glucoconjugate</b> to form p-chlorophenyl-beta-D-(6 -O-malonyl) -glucopyranoside. The metabolism of p-CP in T. marina was mainly driven by photosynthesis, {{and to a lesser extent}} by anabolic metabolism in the dark. Accordingly, the detoxification rate under light was about seven times higher than in the darkness. This work provides the first evidence that microalgae can adopt a combined glucosyl transfer and malonyl transfer process as a survival strategy for detoxification of such xenobiotics as p-CP.

40|$|Fermentation {{of grapes}} {{that had been}} exposed to bushfire smoke can {{potentially}} yield unpalatable, smoke-affected wine. Guaiacol and its <b>glucoconjugate</b> were previously found in smoke-affected grapes at an elevated concentration. To find and identify further guaiacol conjugates in smoke-affected grapes, a stable isotope feeding experiment combined with extensive HPLC-MS and MS/MS investigations was carried out. Leaves and berries of a potted grapevine were placed in contact with an aqueous mixture of d(0) - and d(3) -guaiacol for 1 - 2 days and collected 5 weeks later. Screening for potential guaiacol conjugates in the leaves and berries was facilitated by monitoring the unique mass spectrometric signature of an isotopic doublet separated by 3 Da. Seven different conjugates were detected in leaves and berries and were tentatively identified as mono- and diglycosides of guaiacol. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the guaiacol conjugates were translocated between leaves and berries to a very limited extent and were also present as low-level natural compounds of untreated leaves and berries. The same guaiacol conjugates were also found at a considerably elevated concentration in leaves and berries obtained from grapevines exposed to bushfire smoke. Yoji Hayasaka, Gayle A.

40|$|Xenobiotic {{chlorinated}} phenols {{have been}} found in fresh and marine waters and are toxic to many aquatic organisms. Metabolism of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (2, 4 -DCP) in the marine microalga Tetraselmis marina was studied. The microalga, removed more than 1 mM of 2, 4 -DCP in a 21 photobioreactor over a 6 day period. Two metabolites, more polar than 2, 4 -DCP, were detected in the growth medium by reverse phase HPLC and their concentrations increased at the expense of 2, 4 -DCP. The metabolites were isolated by a C 8 HPLC column and identified as 2, 4 -dichlorophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (DCPG) and 2, 4 -dichlorophenyl-beta-D-(6 -O-malonyl) -glucopyranoside (DCPGM) by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric analysis in a negative ion mode. The molecular structures of 2, 4 -DCPG and 2, 4 -CPGM were further confirmed by enzymatic and alkaline hydrolyses. Thus, it was concluded that the major pathway of 2, 4 -DCP metabolism in T. marina involves an initial conjugation of 2, 4 -DCP to glucose to form 2, 4 -dichlorophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, followed by acylation of the <b>glucoconjugate</b> to form 2, 4 -dichlorophenyl-beta-D-(6 -O-malonyl) -glucopyranoside. The microalga, ability to detoxify dichlorophenol congeners other than 2, 4 -DCP was also investigated. This work provides the first evidence that microalgae can use a combined glucosyl and malonyl transfer to detoxify xenobiotics such as dichlorophenols. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A Gel {{exclusion}} chromatographic {{method was}} used to determine the molecular weight distribution, and therefore, the origin, of non-dialysable urinary <b>glucoconjugates</b> in normal men. The results showed a mixture of <b>glucoconjugates</b> with molecular weight ranges of 1605 to 141, 000. It is suggested that the high molecular weight forms originally constitute the <b>glucoconjugates,</b> and that they are probably post-glomerular in origin. These may be degraded in vivo by glucosylhydrolases to produce the low molecular weight forms. The activities of the urinary enzymes may be reduced in male type 1 diabetic patients, and this may be responsible for the reported increase in their excretion of non-dialysable urinary <b>glucoconjugates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Synthetic leucine-enkephalin <b>glucoconjugates</b> (1 - 3) {{were studied}} by several one- and {{two-dimensional}} 2 ̆ 7 H and 13 C {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) methods. Although all {{the values of the}} temperature coefficients of amide protons were larger than expected for protons involved in hydrogen bonds, using ROESY spectra, it was possible to detect several inter- and intraresidual nuclear Overhauser effects. The results do not support the existence of a single folded conformation, indicating that the structures of <b>glucoconjugates</b> 1 - 3 in DMSO-đe solution are not completely random. The interresidual ROESY cross-peaks 1 point to the existence of at least one con- former with two turns in 1, involving the Tyr 1 and Gly 2, and the Leu 5 and glucose residues, while, in the <b>glucoconjugates</b> 2 and 3, inter-residual ROESY cross-peaks indicate the presence of a conformer with a different compact structure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Glucoconjugated</b> analogues of the meta-hydroxyphenyl {{porphyrin}} (m-THPP) and meta-hydroxyphenyl chlorin (m-THPC) {{has been}} recently synthesized. The characteristics of their triplet {{states have been}} determined {{with regard to their}} involvement in the photodynamic (PDT) efficiency. In the case of porphyrin derivatives, triplet quantum yields (UT) were ranging from 0. 42 to 0. 55 and triplet life times (sT) from 1 to 5 ls. High reaction rate constants (kq) with molecular oxygen (kq: 1. 2 – 1. 6 · 109 s 1) have been found. The triplet lifetimes of chlorin derivatives were about four times higher than those of porphyrins whereas the UT and kq values remained quite similar. Singlet oxygen yields of glucosylated and non-glucosylated porphyrins and chlorins were not significantly different within experimental errors (UD(1 O 2) : 0. 41 – 0. 58). Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} <b>glucoconjugated</b> photosensitizers could undergo associations with the methyl-b-cyclodextrin (Me-b-CD) which exhibit high triplet lifetimes and singlet oxygen yields ranging from 0. 27 to 0. 48...|$|R
40|$|There are report two human envenenomations {{for species}} from Clelia Fitzinger, 1826 (opisthoglyph snake). The {{patients}} exhibited symptoms similar from bothropic accident. Then this work have with objective, the hystological and histochemical study of Duvernoy's gland from Clelia plumbea. For the hystological {{observation of the}} Duvernoy's gland were using, with paraffin's cutting edge, two methods: Hematoxylin + Eosin and Toluidine's Blue. With historesine's cutting edge were using three methods: Metilen's Blue, Toluidine's Blue + Floxine and Toluidine's Blue. For the histochemical detection were using six techniques, with paraffin's cutting edge: PAS, PAS + Alcian Blue pH 2, 5, Alcian Blue pH 2, 5, PAS + Salivar Amilase, Method of Lars Grimelius and Method of Lillie. It was evidenced the predominance of serous cells on Duvernoy's gland. In relation to the histochemical constituion of the duvernoy's gland, was verified the presence of <b>glucoconjugates</b> neuters, enzymes and cells with reduetive activity. By fact from this species to kill his preys by constriction, the predominance of serous cells in the duvernoy's gland, don' t must be direct related with the subjugation of his preys, but with the digestive processes.

40|$|Many healthy phytochemicals {{occur in}} {{food in the}} form of esters, glycoconjugates, or polymers, which are not {{directly}} bioavailable. Probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, which have evolved within the colonic ecosystem where indigestible oligo- and polysaccharides are their sole carbon sources, bear several glycosyl-hydrolases and can contribute to release the aglycones from glycoconjugated phytochemicals. Among the glycosyl-hydrolases, β-glucosidases are the most pertinent, because many phytochemicals are <b>glucoconjugates.</b> β-Glucosidase-positive probiotic bacteria were proved to release the aglycones of isoflavones and lignans in vitro, but studies in vivo are scarce. A positive correlation between probiotic consumption and urinary and/or plasma levels of isoflavone or lignan metabolites was not established. However, the strains used in the trials were not validated for the enzymatic properties or for the ability to hydrolyze lignans or isoflavones. Thus, activation of specific phytochemicals by probiotic bacteria still needs substantial efforts to be proved...|$|R
40|$|Cholera is toxin-mediated enteroinfection, with {{epidemic}} {{character and}} there are approximately 120000 death cases per year worldwide. Protection against cholera has not been accomplished due to deficiencies in the licensed vaccines. Serum vibriocidal activity mediated by LPS antibodies is the only immune segment correlated with the resistance of cholera. On the basis of literature data (Robbins JB, 1990; Ogawa Y, 1996) we synthesized <b>glucoconjugates,</b> composed of detoxified LPS from Vibrio cholerae and protein carriers. Conjugate vaccines were prepared by binding acetic acid and hydrazine-treated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Vibrio cholerae O 1, serotype Inaba, to cholera toxin B-subunit (CT-B) and bovine serum albumin (cBSA). Adipic acid dihydrazide was used for derivatization of oligosaccharides and 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) as conjugating agent. SDS-PAGE, glycoprotein detection and TLC dot-blot were used for physical and chemical analysis of the prepared four types of conjugates. Safe level of endotoxins, measured by LAL assay was detected in all conjugates. The synthesized conjugates {{can be used for}} monitoring immunization schemes on experimental animals. It is to be expected that conjugated vaccines are safe and efficient and that will have high immunogenic and T-dependant characteristics with long immune protection against cholera...|$|R
40|$|Glycosylation is an {{important}} mechanism of controlling the reactivities and bioactivities of plant secondary metabolites and phytohormones. Rice (Oryza sativa) Os 9 BGlu 31 is a glycoside hydrolase family GH 1 transglycosidase that acts to transfer glucose between phenolic acids, phytohormones, and flavonoids. The highest activity was observed with the donors feruloyl-glucose, 4 -coumaroyl-glucose, and sinapoyl-glucose, which are known to serve as donors in acyl and glucosyl transfer reactions in the vacuole, where Os 9 BGlu 31 is localized. The free acids of these compounds also served as the best acceptors, suggesting that Os 9 BGlu 31 may equilibrate the levels of phenolic acids and carboxylated phytohormones and their <b>glucoconjugates.</b> The Os 9 BGlu 31 gene is most highly expressed in senescing flag leaf and developing seed and is induced in rice seedlings in response to drought stress and treatment with phytohormones, including abscisic acid, ethephon, methyljasmonate, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and kinetin. Although site-directed mutagenesis of Os 9 BGlu 31 indicated a function for the putative catalytic acid/base (Glu¹⁶⁹), catalytic nucleophile residues (Glu³⁸⁷), and His³⁸⁶, the wild type enzyme displays an unusual lack of inhibition by mechanism-based inhibitors of GH 1 β-glucosidases that utilize a double displacement retaining mechanism.

40|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{biopolymer}} derived primarily from the condensation of three monomeric precursors, the monolignols. The synthesis of monolignols occurs in the cytoplasm. To reach the cell wall where they are oxidized and polymerized, they must be transported across the cell membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transport process are unclear. There are conflicting views about whether the transport of these precursors occurs by passive diffusion or is an energized active process; further, we know little about what chemical forms are required. Using isolated plasma and vacuolar membrane vesicles prepared from Arabidopsis, together with applying different transporter inhibitors in the assays, we examined the uptake of monolignols and their derivatives by these native membrane vesicles. We demonstrate that the transport of lignin precursors across plasmalemma and their sequestration into vacuoles are ATP-dependent primary-transport processes, involving ATP-binding cassette-like transporters. Moreover, we show that both plasma and vacuolar membrane vesicles selectively transport different forms of lignin precursors. In the presence of ATP, the inverted plasma membrane vesicles preferentially take up monolignol aglycones, whereas the vacuolar vesicles are more specific for <b>glucoconjugates,</b> suggesting that the different ATP-binding cassette-like transporters recognize different chemical forms in conveying them to distinct sites, and that glucosylation of monolignols is necessary for their vacuolar storage but not required for direct transport into the cell wall in Arabidopsis...|$|R
40|$|Golgi-localized {{nucleotide}} sugar transporters (NSTs) {{are considered}} {{essential for the}} biosynthesis of wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins based on their characteristic transport {{of a large number}} of nucleotide sugars to the Golgi lumen. The lack of NST mutants in plants has prevented evaluation of this hypothesis in plants. A previously undescribed Golgi NST mutant, brittle culm 14 (bc 14), displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered wall structure, and exhibits abnormalities in plant development. Map-based cloning revealed that all of the observed mutant phenotypes result from a missense mutation in a putative NST gene, Oryza sativa Nucleotide Sugar Transporter 1 (OsNST 1). OsNST 1 was identified as a Golgi-localized transporter by analysis of a fluorescence-tagged OsNST 1 expressed in rice protoplast cells and demonstration of UDP-glucose transport activity via uptake assays in yeast. Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc 14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of <b>glucoconjugated</b> polysaccharides in bc 14, indicating that OsNST 1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis. OsNST 1 is ubiquitously expressed, with high expression in mechanical tissues. The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc 14 plants suggest that OsNST 1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth. Identification of OsNST 1 has improved our understanding of how cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is regulated by Golgi NSTs in plants...|$|R
40|$|High {{intensity}} {{strength training}} causes changes in steroid hormone concentra- tions. This could be altered by the muscular contraction type: eccentric or concen- tric. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the effect of the completion of a short con- centric (CON) and concentric/eccentric (CON/ECC) trial on the urinary steroid profile, both with the same total work. 18 males performed the trials on an isokinet- ic dynamometer (BIODEX III) exercising quadriceps muscles, right and left, on dif- ferent days. Trial 1 (CON) : 4 x 10 Concentric knee extension + relax knee flexion, speed 60 o/second; rest 90 seconds between each series and 4 minutes between each leg exercise. Trial 2 (CON/ECC) : 4 x 5 concentric knee extension + Eccentric knee flex- ion under similar conditions. Urine samples were taken before the exercise and one hour after finishing it. Androsterone, Etiocholanolone, DHEA, Androstenedione, Testosterone, Epitestosterone, Dehydrotestosterone, Estrone, B-Estradiol, Tetrahy- drocortisone, Tetrahydrocortisol, Cortisone and Cortisol (free, <b>glucoconjugated</b> and sulfoconjugated) urinary values were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques. No significant differences were noted in Total Work and Average Peak Torque, although Maximum Peak Torque in the CON/ECC trial was higher than in the CON trial. These results demonstrate no changes in the steroid profile before and after trials, or when comparing CON to CON/ECC trials. The data suggest that eccentric contractions do not cause hormonal changes different to the ones produced by concentric contractions, when they are performed in strength short trials with the same total workload...|$|R
