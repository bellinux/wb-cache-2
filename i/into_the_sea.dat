5|$|Early in the Acadian orogeny, as the Acadian Mountains {{were rising}} up, {{the black and}} gray shales of the Hamilton Group began accumulating as erosion of the {{mountains}} deposited terrigenous sediments from the land <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal {{that some of the}} slaves should be thrown overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children were thrown through cabin windows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> On 1December, 42male slaves were thrown overboard, and 36more followed in the next few days. Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.|$|E

5|$|Although double-hull {{design is}} {{superior}} in low energy casualties and prevents spillage in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and spills from a double-hull tanker can be {{significantly higher than}} designs like the mid-deck tanker, the Coulombi egg tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last one has a lower oil column and reaches hydrostatic balance sooner.|$|E

50|$|When the ice dam failed, floodwaters coursed {{down the}} Chuya River to the {{confluence}} with the Katun River, followed <b>the</b> Katun <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ob River, {{and then into}} Lake Mansi, a large proglacial Pleistocene lake, ~600,000 km2 in area.

5|$|Four Skyhawks were {{destroyed}} in accidents during the mid-1970s. The first A-4G {{to be lost}} was 873, which crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> off Williamtown, New South Wales, on 5 June 1973 due to an engine failure; its pilot ejected and was rescued by a RAAF helicopter. On 8 November that year Melbourne suffered a catapult failure while launching 889 near Singapore, and the aircraft landed in the sea {{in front of the}} carrier. While Melbourne sailed directly over the downed Skyhawk, its pilot managed to free himself and was picked up by a helicopter. The next loss took place on 16 May 1974 when TA-4G 879 crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> while conducting a practice attack on Melbourne off the south coast of New South Wales, killing the pilot. On 16 May the next year A-4Gs 870 and 872 collided while flying near Jervis Bay; 872 crashed, resulting in the death of its pilot, but 870 managed to return to Albatross.|$|E
