40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{understanding of}} invasion success {{is linked to}} a variety of drivers including enemy release, facilitation, and competitive ability. Within the marine environment, any bare solid substrate is quickly colonised making “free” space for settlement a limited resource. Consequently, the living surfaces of many species are subjected to the constant threat from overgrowth and/or <b>epibiosis.</b> <b>Epibiosis</b> presents a mechanism that eliminates the need to find bare space while increasing overgrowth success by settling on competitors. The ability of non-indigenous species (NIS) to see and use more types of space as “free” space may confer a competitive advantage to these species and requires greater investigation. As such the basis of this thesis is to explore <b>epibiosis</b> in NIS and native marine community assemblages. Theoretically, native species have co-evolved defence mechanisms against <b>epibiosis,</b> whereas they are naïve against <b>epibiosis</b> by NIS (and vice versa). <b>Epibiosis</b> is common, however a systematic review revealed a lack of information comparing native and NIS interactions, especially where the outcome of <b>epibiosis</b> was mortality. The pattern of <b>epibiosis</b> was examined within naturally assembled communities to understand native:NIS epibiotic interactions. Recruitment phenology was contrasted with settlement preferences and epibiotic pressures of both native and introduced species in communities of varying ages in northern Tasmania. Native species were found to have more interactions than expected with natives than with NIS. In contrast, NIS demonstrated no significant preferences between NIS, native and bare substrates: Thus, they see all space as available, compared to native species that show a preference for type of space to settle upon. Building on this, ex situ manipulative experiments were used to examine pairwise interactions controlling for propagule pressure, propagule arrival time and environmental factors hypothesised in the literature to influence recruitment and subsequent settlement success. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that native species experience greater epibiotic settlement by both native and NIS, whereas NIS were relatively free of epibiotic load. The multiple lines of evidence used in this dissertation have illustrated fundamental differences between marine native species and marine NIS, reinforcing the view that NIS are opportunistic settlers using a greater suite of substrates as available space than native species. Moreover, given that <b>epibiosis</b> generally comes at a cost to basibionts, a reduced epibiotic load on NIS compared to native competitors, infers a competitive advantage to NIS...|$|E

This phenomenon, termed <b>epibiosis,</b> results in spatially close associations between two or more living organisms. Pelamis platurus, the yellow-bellied sea snake, is the only exclusively pelagic marine snake and its propensity for foraging along ocean slicks facilitates its colonization by pelagic epibionts.

Shells of B. zonalis (basibiont) are often fouled with the rock oyster Saccostrea cucullata and the {{barnacle}} Balanus reticulatus (epibiont). This epibiotic interaction has {{a negative impact on}} the fitness of B. zonalis in terms of impairing fecundity, mobility and metabolism of fouled individuals. During the reproductive season, fouled snails had lower Gonadosomatic Index and fewer egg-bearing individuals than non-fouled snails. Fouled snails crawled in a more tortuous pathway and with lower speed when compared with non-fouled snails. Reduction in oxygen consumption and metabolic rate in fouled snails further suggested the restriction in mobility of B. zonalis by the epibionts. Glycogen content in the foot muscle tissues and hepatopancreas of fouled and non-fouled snails was, however, similar, revealing <b>epibiosis</b> does not influence the energy storage of B. zonalis. Mortality of fouled and non-fouled snails was similar under laboratory conditions, suggesting <b>epibiosis</b> does not influence the survivorship of B. zonalis in Hong Kong.

40|$|In situ {{experiments}} were {{run with the}} seastar Asterias rubens to investigate the influence of <b>epibiosis</b> on predation preferences. Mussels (Mytilus edulis) monospecifically fouled by different epibiont species (the barnacle Balanus improvisus, the red filamentous alga Ceramium strictum, the sponge Halichondria panicea and the hydrozoan Laomedea flexuosa) and macroscopically clean mussels were exposed and seastar predation was monitored by SCUBA. Asterias rubens preferred macroscopical unfouled mussels as prey. Fouling generally reduced predation pressure on the mussel hosts (associational resistance). Barnacles protected mussels less efficiently than hydrozoans or algae. We hypothesize that in top-down controlled communities this influence of <b>epibiosis</b> on predation pressure should affect mussel community patterns. A survey of natural mussel epibiont distribution in {{the presence or absence}} of A. rubens showed that the prevalence of differently fouled mussels differed between predation-exposed and predation-protected habitats. Natural mussel-epibiont associations reflected the preferential predation of the major local predators. Additionally, higher epibiotic diversity and evenness could be observed at locations accessible to benthic predators as compared with habitats protected from predation.

Using comparative 16 S rRNA sequence analysis and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), we examined the R. exoculata <b>epibiosis</b> from four vents sites along the known distribution range of the shrimp on the MAR. Our results show that R. exoculata lives in symbiosis with two types of filamentous epibionts. One belongs to the Epsilonproteobacteria, and was previously identified as the dominant symbiont of R. exoculata. The second is a novel gammaproteobacterial symbiont that belongs to a clade consisting exclusively of sequences from epibiotic bacteria of hydrothermal vent animals, with the filamentous sulfur oxidizer Leucothrix mucor as the closest free-living relative. Both the epsilon- and the gammaproteobacterial symbionts dominated the R. exoculata <b>epibiosis</b> at all four MAR vent sites despite striking differences between vent fluid chemistry and distances between sites of up to 8500 km, indicating that the symbiosis is highly stable and specific. Phylogenetic analyses of two mitochondrial host genes showed little to no differences between hosts from the four vent sites. In contrast, there was significant spatial structuring of both the gamma- and the epsilonproteobacterial symbiont populations based on their 16 S rRNA gene sequences that was correlated with geographic distance along the MAR.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{suggested}} that marine sponges have evolved defensive mechanisms to control <b>epibiosis</b> i. e. colonization of body surfaces by other organisms. The main goal of this thesis research {{was to investigate the}} potential controls of <b>epibiosis</b> in the sponge Mycale adhaerens, and the focuses of this study were on: 1) how larval settlement of the polychaete Hydroides elegans and colonization of indigenous benthic bacteria could be controlled in the sponge; 2) the importance of epibiotic bacteria in controlling <b>epibiosis</b> in this sponge; and 3) the stability of associations between epibiotic bacteria and the sponge. Waterborne metabolites of the sponge exerted either a toxic or anti-settlement effect on larvae, indicating a possible direct control of M. adhaerens on larval settlement. On the other hand, 75 % and 40 % of epibiotic bacteria of the sponge were non-inductive and inhibitive to larval settlement, respectively, suggesting an indirect control of M. adhaerens on larval settlement through nurturing specific bacteria on the body surface. Moreover, microbial films developed {{under the influence of the}} sponge extracts became either inhibitive to larval settlement or toxic to larvae. The inhibition on larval settlement was likely due to the modulation of surface bacterial community mediated by the sponge metabolites. An indirect control on larval settlement was demonstrated. Substantial differences in composition of bacterial communities on hydrogels incorporated with the sponge extracts were observed, indicating modulation of the bacterial community due to sponge extract components. The absence of several TRFs relative to the controls suggested an inhibition of colonization by specific bacteria. Using culture-dependent techniques, half of the indigenous bacterial species isolated from the reference surface were susceptible to the sponge extract and 61 % to the epibiotic bacterial extracts, suggesting possible direct and indirect controls of bacterial colonization by the sponge and epibiotic bacteria, respectively. The epibiotic bacterial communities of the sponges in different seasons and locations were largely indistinguishable and apparently distinctive from the reference bacterial communities on inanimate surfaces, suggesting a stable and distinctive bacteria-sponge association irrespective of the environmental conditions. The omnipresence of some unique bacterial types in the epibiotic bacterial communities over space and time suggested that the associations between certain bacteria and the sponge surface were highly consistent and specific.

40|$|In many benthic {{communities}} predators play {{a crucial}} role in the population dynamics of their prey. Surface characteristics of the prey are important for recognition and handling by the predator. Because the establishment of an epibiotic assemblage on the surface of a basibiont species creates a new interface between the epibiotized organism and its environment, we hypothesised that <b>epibiosis</b> should have an impact on consumer-prey interactions. In separate investigations, we assessed how epibionts on macroalgae affected the susceptibility of the latter to herbivory by the urchin Arbacia punctulata and how epibionts on the blue mussel Mytilus edulis affected its susceptibility to predation by the shore crab Carcinus maenas. Some epibionts strongly affected consumer feeding behavior. When epibionts were more attractive than their host, consumer pressure increased. When epibionts were less attractive than their host or when they were repellent, consumer pressure decreased. In systems that are controlled from the top-down, <b>epibiosis</b> can strongly influence community dynamics. For the Carcinus/Mytilus system that we studied, the insitu distribution of epibionts on mussels reflected the epibiosis-determined preferences of the predator.

40|$|<b>Epibiosis</b> is an {{ecological}} relationship {{that has been}} described as one of the closest possible associations in marine ecosystems. In the space limited rocky intertidal, mussel beds provide important secondary space for barnacles. The epibiotic relationship between mussels and barnacles on the south-east coast of South Africa was considered at different scales, from large-scale, natural patterns of <b>epibiosis</b> on the rocky shore, to fine-scale settlement choices of barnacles and the effects on the condition and growth rates of individual mussels. Mussel and barnacle assemblages were generally stable over a 12 -month period. The tracking of individual mussels with and without barnacle epibionts resulted in a significant increase in mortality rate of mussels with epibionts over 12 months (two-way ANOVA, p = 0. 028). Barnacles on rocks, as well as on mussels, were also tracked with no significant effect of substratum on mortality of barnacles (two-way ANOVA, p = 0. 119). Prevalence and intensity of barnacle infestations was also examined in relation to coastline topography on two co-occurring mussel species, the indigenous Perna perna and invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis. The results were complex, but bay status had significant effects on prevalence and intensity for both mussel species, depending on the time and zone. The effect of bay in relation to time was particularly relevant for M. galloprovincialis (four-way nested ANOVA, Season X Site(Bay) : p = 0. 0002), where summer prevalence was higher than that of winter in bays, regardless of zone, while in open coast sites, the effect of season was only significant in the mid zone. Patterns of intensity generally showed higher values in summer. Substratum preference by barnacles was investigated by recording settlement, survival and mortality of Chthamalus dentatus barnacles on various treatments. There was a strong preference for the rock-like plastic substratum by primary settlers (pair-wise tests of PERMANOVA: Dead < Rock mimic (p = 0. 0001); Replica < Rock mimic (p = 0. 019) and Live < Rock mimic (p = 0. 0001)). This indicates that barnacles settle on mussel shells only as a secondary choice and that micro-topography is an important variable in barnacle settlement. The effect of barnacle <b>epibiosis</b> on condition index and growth of P. perna and M. galloprovincialis was also examined as a direct indication of the health of mussels subjected to the biological stress of <b>epibiosis.</b> Although not significant (PERMANOVA: P. perna: p(perm) = 0. 890; M. galloprovincialis: p(perm) = 0. 395), growth for both mussel species was slower for barnacle-infested individuals in summer, which is the main growing season for mussels in the region. Results from condition index calculations, however, showed no negative impacts of epibiotic barnacles (three-way ANCOVA: P. perna: p = 0. 372; M. galloprovincialis: p = 0. 762). Barnacle epibionts create a new interface between the mussel and its environment and this interaction can affect other members of the community. The possibility of the barnacle epibiont causing increased drag also needs further investigation. Biological processes operating within a wide range of physical stressors drive the interactions on the rocky shore, such as <b>epibiosis.</b> Overall, {{the results of this study}} suggest that the epibiotic relationship between mussels and barnacles on the south-east coast of South Africa does not significantly affect the mussel species present and that barnacles only use mussel shells as a secondary choice of substratum...|$|E

Algal morphology varied {{as a function of the}} period of the year (weaker effect) and depth (stronger effect) but in different ways for each variable analysed. In general, fronds tended to be shorter, heavier, and more ramified in shallower areas. In relation to time, the morphological characters tended mostly to present higher values in January (summer) and/or April (autumn). Frequency of receptacles did not depend on algal morphology and depth at all but varied in time, although only in the deepest area. <b>Epibiosis</b> also did not depend on algal morphology but varied in relation to time (stronger effect) and, to a lesser extent, depth (weaker effect).

In benthic marine biofouling communities, space limitation leads to high rates of overgrowth competition. Some species can utilise other living organisms as substrate (<b>epibiosis),</b> proffering a competitive advantage for the epibiont. Additionally, some species can prevent or reduce epibiotic settlement on their surfaces and avoid being basibionts. To test whether epibiotic pressure differs between native and introduced species, we undertook ex situ experiments comparing bryozoan larval settlement to determine if introduced species demonstrate a greater propensity to settle as epibionts, and a reduced propensity to be basibionts, than native species. Here we report that introduced species opportunistically settle on any space (bare, native, or introduced), whereas native species exhibit a strong tendency to settle on and near other natives, but avoid settling on or near introduced basibionts. In addition, larvae of native species experience greater larval wastage (mortality) than introduced species, both in the presence and absence of living substrates.

Macroalgal floras of Hamelin Bay (HB), Marmion (M), Jurien Bay (JB) and Kalbarri (K), Western Australia, ranged from 20 to 40 species reef– 1 (JB = HB = M ≥ K). Epiflora on small T. torquatus (shell area 3 ̆c 1503 ̆ecm 2) did not differ among regions but epifloral richness increased with increasing basibiont size.

This index is intended to permit evaluating the relative antifouling defense potency to be expected in a given organism in a given epibiotic situation and to compare different cases of <b>epibiosis</b> and fouling...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of the body surface {{play a crucial role}} in most interactions of marine organisms. Critical ecological properties such as drag, morphology, uptake and release of radiation and organic matter are linked to the body surface of an aquatic organism. The properties and functions of this interface may be modified substantially by the presence and activities of epibiotic communities. This, in turn, may lead to substantial modulation of the interactions between the organism bearing epiphytes and its environment, with consequences for the relative fitness of the host organism (basibiont) and its interactors, and ultimately, the structure and functioning of the assemblage. <b>Epibiosis</b> may act as an ecological lever via these indirect effects, greatly amplifying or buffering biotic and abiotic stress...|$|E
40|$|<b>Epibiosis</b> on four marine benthic {{invertebrate}} {{species was}} found to be reduced relative to other nearby surfaces, suggesting the existence of an underlying protection against fouling. In all four cases, toxic chemical antifouling defenses were wanting or inconsistent. However, the lack of epibionts could be attributed to the existence of non-toxic protective properties in all instances, viz. periodic emergence and mutual grazing in the gastropod, Littorina littorea, cumulative filtration and an as yet unidentified fouling-reducing property of the periostracum of the bivalve Mytilus edulis, repellency and, possibly, mucus secretion in the colonial ascidian, Cystodytes lobatus, burrowing, periodic emergence (intertidal individuals) and moulting in the crustacean, Carcinus maenas. It seems that such protective systems are often multiple, consisting of several, more or less overlapping, adaptations to reduce fouling. Characteristics of these non-toxic, multiple protection systems and their significance for potential epibionts are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{occurrence}} of epizoic filter-feeding Protozoa (Vorticella and Zoothamnium) and parasitic Protozoa (Ellobiopsis) on Calanoida was {{noticed in the}} Gulf of Gdańsk in 1998, 1999 and 2006. The relatively high (4 – 16 % of all calanoids) level of infestation varied {{depending on the type}} of infestation (0. 1 – 13 % of the population of particular taxa). The dominant copepods – Acartia spp., Temora longicornis and Centropages hamatus – were attacked the most frequently (from 10. 5 % to 54 % of all infested calanoids). <b>Epibiosis</b> and parasitism were observed on all copepod developmental stages (adults, juveniles and nauplii). Epibionts and parasites were located on different parts of the body, but mainly on the prosome. Infestation by epibionts and parasites was not restricted to calanoid copepods: it was also detected in non-negligible numbers on other crustaceans, namely, Harpacticoida, Cladocera (Bosmina sp.) and Cirripedia larvae (nauplii) in the Gulf of Gdańsk...|$|E
40|$|Several {{microorganisms}} – epibionts – can {{adhere to}} living supports taking advantage for their survival, feeding and movement. <b>Epibiosis</b> occurs particularly in aquatic environments, on both benthic and planktonic organisms, among which copepods and cladocerans represent an important living support. The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus fulvus, {{living in the}} splashpools of rocky coasts, was studied to recognize the occurrence of epibionts on the exoskeleton surface using scanning electon microscopy techniques. The first evidence of ciliate Scyphidia sp. on Tigriopus fulvus has been described and the occurrence of algae Cocconeis sp. has been observed as well. Epibionts were found to adhere to antennae, a site linked to the exploitation of water currents carrying food particles to mouthparts and to swimming legs. The reason of the occurrence on swimming legs is less clear and needs further observations. Pertinent results are described and discussed {{and the influence of}} epibionts on life cycle and behavior of Tigriopus fulvus is considered...|$|E
40|$|Prevention of <b>epibiosis</b> is {{of vital}} {{importance}} for most aquatic organisms, which can have consequences {{for their ability}} to invade new areas. Surface microtopography of the shell periostracum has been shown to have antifouling properties for mytilid mussels, and the topography shows regional differences. This article examines whether an optimal shell design exists and evaluates the degree to which shell microstructure is matched with the properties of the local fouling community. Biomimics of four mytilid species from different regional provenances were exposed at eight different sites in both northern and southern hemispheres. Tendencies of the microtopography to both inhibit and facilitate fouling were detected after 3 and 6 weeks of immersion. However, on a global scale, all microtopographies failed to prevent fouling in a consistent manner when exposed to various fouling communities and when decoupled from other shell properties. It is therefore suggested that the recently discovered chemical anti-microfouling properties of the periostracum complement the anti-macrofouling defence offered by shell microtopography...|$|E
40|$|Epibiotic {{relationships}} are a widespread phenomenon in marine, estuarine and freshwater environments, and include diverse epibiont organisms such as bacteria, protists, rotifers, and barnacles. Despite its wide occurrence, <b>epibiosis</b> is still poorly known regarding its consequences, advantages, and disadvantages for host and epibiont. Most studies performed about epibiotic communities {{have focused on}} the epibionts ’ effects on host fitness, with few studies emphasizing on the epibiont itself. The present work investigates species composition, spatial and temporal fluctuations, and aspects of the life cycle and attachment preferences of Peritrich epibionts on calanoid copepods in Chesapeake Bay, USA. Two species of Peritrich ciliates (Zoothamnium intermedium Precht, 1935, and Epistylis sp.) were identified to live as epibionts on the two most abundant copepod species (Acartia tonsa and Eurytemora affinis) during spring and summer months in Chesapeake Bay. Infestation prevalence was not significantly correlated with environmental variables or phytoplankton abundance, but displayed a trend following host abundance. Investigation of the life cycle of Z. intermedium suggested that it is an obligat...|$|E
