5|$|As part of {{the various}} {{proposed}} extensions of the IND Second System, the IND Culver subway was planned to facilitate a spur line to Bay Ridge, with {{a connection to the}} incomplete Staten Island Tunnel intended for the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. A 1931 proposal had the line travel south from Smith–Ninth Streets station through Red Hook and Gowanus to Saint George Terminal. A 1933 plan would have branched off between Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue, then ran down Second Avenue in Bay Ridge to the tunnel. Like other IND lines, this route would have been in direct competition with the then-privately operated Fourth Avenue Subway. The final proposal from the 1939 Second System plan proposed an extension down Fort Hamilton Parkway and/or Tenth Avenue towards the tunnel, with continued service to 86th Street in Bay Ridge near the BMT Fourth Avenue Line station. This route would have diverged near the Fort Hamilton Parkway and Church Avenue stations. In 1940, proposals emerged to connect the IND with the BMT West End Line near its Fort Hamilton Parkway station; the 1946 Board of Transportation plans featured both the West <b>End</b> <b>connection</b> and the extension to 86th Street.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Steel {{wire rope}} is the {{accepted}} standard in logging. It is strong, durable, stiff, and dependable in the logger's arsenal. However, {{steel wire rope}} has several disadvantages: its strength to weight ratio is low; it is difficult and time-consuming to splice; and used wire ropes contain jaggers. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) braided rope has potential to replace steel wire rope. The offshore mooring and shipping industries have appreciated it for years. Characteristics such as a specific gravity less than one (it floats!), high flexibility, low stretch, and ease of splicing make the synthetic rope useful. At equivalent diameters, synthetic rope has an equal or greater breaking strength to that of steel wire rope, but at 1 / 7 the weight. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} end connectors for the unique physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of UHMW-PE 12 -strand braided rope that make this technology of interest in logging applications. This studied focused on three diameter classes of the synthetic rope that are common to logging operations: 3 / 8 ", 9 / 16 ", and 5 / 8 ". Within each diameter class there were five different spools representing separate production runs. A randomized complete block design was used with each diameter class and the corresponding five spools a separate population. Following the laboratory tests, the breaking strengths were compared to the buried eye splice. Three types of end connectors were evaluated during this pilot study. They are identified as spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced <b>end</b> <b>connections</b> provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. The <b>end</b> <b>connections</b> with adhesives had variable strength performance laboratory tests and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware <b>end</b> <b>connections,</b> the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strength relative to the buried eye splice. This project has accomplished its objectives. It was the first extensive study on <b>end</b> <b>connections</b> specifically designed for synthetic rope. New <b>end</b> <b>connections</b> were developed and steel wire rope connections were modified to meet the strength and usability criteria for timber harvesting operations. Suitable <b>end</b> <b>connections</b> for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, rope clamps, knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and Y-splice. These <b>end</b> <b>connections</b> suitable for use with forest operations were identified and recommended user guidelines were given.

40|$|This report {{summarize}} {{the analysis and}} cyclic testing of a laser welded steel sandwich panel <b>end</b> <b>connection.</b> Also included are monotonic tests of stake welded lap shear coupons with welds oriented both longitudinally and transverse. Steel sandwich panels consist of two face sheets connected by a relatively low-density core result in high strength and stiffness, which lead promising design advantages. Steel sandwich panels offer substantial resistance to static and dynamic loads due to their high stiffness and substantial energy absorbing capacity. Panels of this kind are interest of potential use in ships and are especially efficient in resisting extreme events such as impact or shock loading. This research is conducted to investigate the mechanical behavior of a tapered steel sandwich panel <b>end</b> <b>connection</b> using finite element analysis techniques and experimental test methods.

40|$|Self-clearing {{metalized}} film capacitors provide outstanding {{energy density}} by facilitating {{operation of the}} polymer dielectric with a relatively small margin to its breakdown strength. As a result, metalized film capacitor technology offers the highest energy density among high voltage capacitor technologies. The primary limitation of this technology under pulse discharge conditions is failure of the plasma sprayed metal end connections. This failure mechanism is investigated through transient nonlinear finite element analysis with coupled thermal and electric fields as well as analytic approximations. The analysis indicates that <b>end</b> <b>connection</b> degradation is an electro-thermal-mechanical phenomenon related to the inhomogeneous temperature distribution in the dielectric under transient conditions. Magnetic forces can also play a role.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a limit analysis, {{based on the}} yield line approach, for predicting the ultimate capacity of welded tee end connections for hollow tubes. Five failure mechanisms are identified. The failure mechanisms range from simple mechanisms such as yielding of the cleat plate or the tube, to the more complex mechanisms involving a combination of hinge formation in the cap plate and local yielding in the tube. It is shown that {{the dimensions of the}} connection components involving the tube, the cap, and the cleat plate sizes determine which is the controlling failure mechanism. Results presented are applicable to welded tee end connections for hollow tubes of both circular and rectangular sections.

40|$|The {{sandwich}} panels {{with the}} mineral wool core contain mineral wool lamellas. The end connections of lamellas {{have not been}} studied much and {{it is unclear how}} different <b>end</b> <b>connection</b> types affect to the total strength of the whole panel. European product standard EN 14509 : 2013 describes two different test methods for shear strength. With them, it is possible to examine the shear strength of sandwich panels and mineral wool lamellas. However, these test methods do not work well when the thickness of panel is over 100 mm. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the functional test method was developed to test the shear strength of the thicker lamellas. The previous tests and EN 14509 : 2013 part A. 3 were the basis for the development. The developed test method is usable with glass wool and also with the stronger stone wool. After the test method development, different end connections were studied in the sec-ond part of the thesis. Their strength was compared with the strength of full lamella. Both, mechanical end connections and glue end connections were examined. The me-chanical <b>end</b> <b>connection</b> types meant the shaped connections which were made by mill-ing and cutting. Other possible mechanical end connections are also included. All the test specimens were handmade. The results of tests show that the glue end con-nections are stronger than the mechanical end connections. The stiffness of the glue end connections was higher. The amount of glue and spreading pattern had effect on the strength of the connection and further inspections about this are recommended to be done...|$|E
