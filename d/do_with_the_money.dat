5|$|In 1988, Guy Caron {{left the}} company due to artistic {{differences}} over what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> generated by Cirque du Soleil's first financially successful tour. Laliberté wanted {{to use it to}} expand and start a second show while Caron wanted the money to be saved, with a portion going back to the National Circus School. An agreement was never met and Caron, along with a large number of artists loyal to him, departed. This stalled plans that year to start a new touring show.|$|E
5|$|The Remembrancer was {{appointed}} for life, and qualified {{to appoint a}} deputy, the first of whom, John West, {{was appointed}} by Sir Christopher Hatton in 1616. From 1565 until 1716, the office was kept in the Fanshawe family, starting with Henry Fanshawe and ending with Simon Fanshawe. After 1820, the Remembrancer's broad duties were split up by the Court of Exchequer (England) etc. Act 1820. To replace him, two masters were appointed, {{one of whom was}} to be the accountant general. These officials were to be appointed by the Chief Baron of the Exchequer from barristers of five years standing, holding offices during good behaviour and unable to appoint a deputy. The masters handled the taking of minutes previously undertaken by the Remembrancer, with the accountant general overseeing all money paid into the court, which was deposited in the Bank of England; previously the Remembrancer had held complete discretion as to what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

25|$|His name is Wilbur C. Henderson, {{and he is}} {{investigating}} Grandpa for his evasion of income tax. When Henderson asks Grandpa why he owed twenty-four years of back income tax, Grandpa states he never believed in it, {{and that the government}} wouldn't know what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> if he did pay it. Henderson becomes infuriated by Grandpa's answers to his questions. Henderson spots Grandpa's snakes, and runs out of the house in fear, but not before promising Grandpa that he will hear, one way or another, from the United States government.|$|E
25|$|Martin Vanderhof: Referred to {{mostly as}} Grandpa in the play. Father-in-law to Paul, father of Penny, {{grandfather}} of Alice and Essie. He is an eccentric happy {{old man who}} has never paid his income tax because he doesn't believe in it, as he feels that the government wouldn't know what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> if he paid it. Once a very successful businessman, he left his job 35 years prior for no reason other than to just relax. He lives his life by the philosophy 'don't do anything that you're not going to enjoy doing'. He goes to circuses, commencements, throws darts, and collects stamps.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Kassel, on his 66th birthday, Rundstedt {{received}} a cheque from Hitler for 250,000 Reichsmarks. This was part of Hitler's policy of buying the continuing loyalty of his senior commanders. Many found this offensive, but none turned down these gifts. Rundstedt {{tried to do the}} next best thing by failing to cash the cheque. By February this was attracting adverse comment in Berlin, and Rundstedt then cashed it. Some writers have sought to connect Rundstedt's acceptance of this money with his continuing refusal to support the resistance movement against Hitler's regime within the German Army. In fact Rundstedt refused to have anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> handing it over to his daughter-in-law, and it was still untouched at his death in 1953.|$|E

500|$|In 1823, {{a report}} {{published}} by the Charity Commission revealed that over the centuries, the income from the bequest vastly exceeded the expenses of the boys' education. In response to the report, the Corporation of London indicated that it had taken, [...] "great pains...by searching in {{the archives of the}} corporation and other places for the will of John Carpenter, without effect".

500|$|Wolters and {{longtime}} Speer secretary Annemarie Kempf, while not permitted direct communication with Speer in Spandau, {{did what they}} could to help his family and carry out the requests Speer put in letters to his wife—the only written communication officially allowed Speer. [...] Beginning in 1948, Speer had {{the services of a}} sympathetic Dutch orderly to smuggle mail. [...] In 1949, Wolters opened a special bank account for Speer, the Schulgeldkonto or [...] "School Fund Account", and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from Speer's activities during the war. [...] At first the funds were used only to support Speer's family, but as the amounts grew and Speer's family became increasingly able to support itself, the money was used for everything from vacations for Speer's Spandau conduit, Toni Proost, to bribes for those who might be able to secure Speer's release. [...] Once Speer became aware of the existence of the fund, he would often send detailed instructions about what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> [...] Wolters raised a total of DM158,000 for Speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Hauserman was a {{contestant}} on {{the first}} season of VH1's I Love Money, a reality show where 17 former contestants from Rock of Love, Flavor of Love, and I Love New York compete for a $250,000 cash prize. Megan appeared on all fourteen episodes of the first season and is featured {{at the center of}} the season one poster. On the first episode when she was asked what she would <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> if she won the competition, she stated that she wants to help [...] "mentally challenged" [...] dogs, and that she adopted a mentally challenged dog, a chihuahua named Lily. She quit the competition in the thirteenth episode (the finale) when it was revealed that she would have to face a jury of former contestants whom she had a part in eliminating. She finished the competition in third place. Hauserman stated in her exit interview that she was happy with her decision to quit not only because it stopped her contestants from getting the satisfaction of payback, but also that she was happy that she stopped everyone she didn't want to win the money and that she was satisfied with whoever won the money in the top three. Hauserman also stated that she never thought that she would win the money, and that she came simply to have fun and play the game to the best of her ability. On the I Love Money reunion special, Megan said that there were no rules opposing the way she played the game, so she used her brain to out-smart people, because it was her given talent.|$|E
