Furthermore, I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. <b>Instead,</b> <b>I</b> argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception.|$|E

Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television—and all these things made me forget the three dear old Kings of my old childhood.|$|E

The return followed the failure by RTÉ 2fm in its attempts to target teenagers. Fanning claimed: In fact I so never moved that <b>instead</b> <b>I</b> brought the four people who were working with me for Radio One and their desks into 2FM! I never went over to Radio One, I did all my programmes from 2FM, I never moved. I was also doing 2FM every Sunday so I never left at all so I'm just back to my spiritual home Monday to Friday.|$|E

500|$|After {{the major}} {{disappointment}} {{of losing the}} role in The Good Earth, Wong announced plans for a year-long tour of China, to visit her father and his family in Taishan. Wong's father had returned to his hometown in China with her younger brothers and sister in 1934. [...] Aside from Mei Lanfang's offer to teach her, she wanted {{to learn more about}} the Chinese theater and through English translations to better perform some Chinese plays before international audiences. She told the San Francisco Chronicle on her departure, [...] "...for a year, I shall study the land of my fathers. Perhaps upon my arrival, I shall feel like an outsider.

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were unhappy with the rock prop used in the episode. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Glenn Neufeld strapped Visitor's feet to the stage {{in order to ensure}} that the crystal didn't move. Different versions of the crystal were then applied for different scenes, with the larger versions incorporating a seat for the actress so that she could relax inside the prop between takes. The prop caused problems for Visitor due to her claustrophobia, which was the second time during season three that a Wolfe scripted episode had caused her these types of problems after [...] "". She also didn't like how it appeared on screen: [...] "I thought it was going to look like my body turning to stone. <b>Instead</b> <b>I</b> looked like a big old hot fudge sundae, and my head was the cherry on top." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren {{performed}} at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival at Camber Sands in April 2001. The festival was curated by the band Tortoise, with whom Herren toured as the opening act in May 2001. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was released on June 11, 2001 through Warp on vinyl, compact disc and download. It was Warp's second release by an American musician, following Richard Devine's Lipswitch which had been released in the previous January. The album did not chart in the United States or United Kingdom. Herren was not happy on how the album was promoted, saying: [...] "I couldn't understand why they were treating me like I was 10. They were ignoring all the cultural references that were to be found throughout that first record." [...] He felt the album [...] "would have been easier to package if I'd been from the Bronx. <b>Instead</b> <b>I</b> was from Miami, and lived in Decatur." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's flashforwards {{commence}} with Ben {{waking up}} alarmed in the Sahara with a wounded {{right arm and}} vapor rising from him. [...] The Dharma Initiative parka that he wears was codenamed [...] "Dharka" [...] by the writers. [...] A couple of Easter eggs are present in this scene: Ben's parka has a name tag that indicates that it was formerly owned by Edgar Halliwax (François Chau) and it displays the first appearance of the logo for a Dharma station called the [...] "Orchid" [...] {{that would not be}} seen until the episode titled [...] "There's No Place Like Home". [...] Another Easter egg is glimpsed in the next scene, when Ben reveals his forged Canadian passport previously seen in [...] "The Economist" [...] for his alias Dean Moriarty, which is also the name of the central character in Jack Kerouac's 1951 novel On the Road. [...] Among the most frequent questions that the writers are asked is whether they have planned out future storylines, so the writers try to allude to future plot points, such as with the Dharka scene, that they can later call on as proof that they do know where the story is headed. [...] Director Jack Bender described the scene, which was filmed in a Hawaiian rock quarry, as especially hard to shoot because the actors had to ride horses and use guns, the crew had to relocate due to rocks present that were unsuitable for the scene, and Bender walked head-first into a crane. [...] Emerson stated that the set is [...] "definitely a no-glamour zone... I thought we would ease into things. [...] <b>Instead,</b> <b>I</b> get this all-Ben extravaganza: combat, riding horses, foreign languages. And piano playing! [...] All waaaay outside my comfort zone.

500|$|After the {{parliamentary}} party agreed {{on this issue}} 12–8, Hall resigned the leadership on 16 March 1972, stating that [...] "I cannot continue to lead a Party that will not follow; I cannot lead a Party which has lost its idealism and which has forgotten that its purpose for existence is to govern successfully {{for the welfare of}} all South Australians. Our Party is still deeply cleft by the persuasive influence of a number of its members in the Legislative Council." [...] Later in the speech, he said [...] "Over the last three years I have been subject to a great deal of disloyalty on a continuing basis ... I had hoped this afternoon to move a motion of no confidence in the Government; <b>instead,</b> <b>I</b> found out Party had moved a vote of no confidence in itself." [...] Premier Dunstan, with whom Hall had never had amiable relations, crossed {{the floor of the house}} and shook Hall's hand in a gesture of solidarity. Hall said he [...] "was knifed" [...] and said the conservatives' actions were [...] "a clear example of how deeply the wooden horses of the Legislative Council have entrenched themselves in the ranks of the Assembly membership". The LCL President Ian McLachlan put on a brave face, saying [...] "Mr Hall had some personal problems with the party, but these differences do not make a divided party" [...] but he was quoted the next day as saying that the proposal was mooted to gauge Hall's power. The obscure and low-key conservative Bruce Eastick was installed as the new leader, as some more prominent figures such as Millhouse were seen as too sympathetic to Hall. In the meantime, there was a strong reaction to Hall's departure among the public, and segments of the LCL, notably the youth wings, demonstrated against the events and made motions of objection. Hall had expected to become a normal backbencher, but the groundswell of support prompted a change of heart.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But <b>instead</b> <b>I</b> had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E

So, <b>instead,</b> <b>I</b> settled for the detached anonymity of bookstores and rest stopsa compromise, but one that was wholly unfulfilling and morally unsatisfactory." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his career as an entertainer, Jones' other first love was horses. Training as a jockey in his teens, Jones later said, [...] "I made one huge mistake.

A brief illness delayed {{her performance}} of Lucrezia Borgia, but {{the cast of}} Gardoni (Gennaro), Luigi Lablache (Alfonso) and the debutante Mlle Schwarz (Orsini) made it worth waiting for. All this occurred before Easter 1848. H. F. Chorley at this time said she had 'youth – a presence commanding, if somewhat peculiar – a superb voice, almost three octaves in compass – and a fervour and ambition which it could not then be foreseen would take their after-forms of reckless and perverse eccentricity.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In proper names, ij often appears <b>instead</b> of <b>i</b> {{at the end}} {{of other}} diphthongs, where it does not affect the pronunciation: aaij, eij, oeij, ooij and uij are {{pronounced}} identically to aai , ei , oei , ooi [...] and ui [...] This derives from an old orthographic practice (also seen in older French and German) of writing y <b>instead</b> of <b>i</b> after another vowel; later, when y and ij came to be seen as interchangeable, the spellings with ij came to be used. Spelling reforms and standardization have removed the redundant js in common words, but proper names continue to use these archaic spellings.|$|R

Created by The O.C.s Seth Cohen ...." [...] The reviewer continued, saying that [...] "A thread of underlying sadness unites all four Chrismukkah episodes, but it's a sadness that begs to be redeemed {{by the end of the}} hour. Chrismukkah is really about traditional Christmas togetherness and your standard happy ending; it's the everyday miracle of people coming together to create something magical." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hynde and Honeyman-Scott {{have both}} {{acknowledged}} the influence their contrasting styles had {{on each other}} (Guitar Player, 1981; Uncut, 1999). According to Honeyman-Scott, Hynde had a unique style he adjusted to in several ways: [...] "She does {{quite a bit of}} rhythm guitar, and I don't know anybody who plays like her. It's real distinct, and I can't count her beat half the time. <b>Instead,</b> <b>I</b> just put a little guitar line over it, like the lick in 'Tattooed Love Boys'" [...] (Guitar Player, 1981). He joked about his other strategy: [...] "I've never told them I can't work out their time at all! They are used to me coming in a bar too late; they think that's the way I play. But it's because I've missed where she comes in! I just bluff it and hope for the best." ...|$|E

In the book, Lords revealed that she received only $35,000 as total compensation for all her porno movies, including the $5,000 for her underage appearance in Penthouse. Lords continued to use the now famous stage name that she had given herself as a minor, and ultimately made it her legal name. She explained, [...] "I chose to stop running from it. <b>Instead,</b> <b>I</b> won it, legally changing my name to Traci Elizabeth Lords. That's who I was, and that's who I was going to be."
