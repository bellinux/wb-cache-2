Kirito wins but Eiji reveals that Shigemura has been {{harvesting}} memories of SAO players {{in an attempt}} to reconstruct his lost daughter's soul and download her as an AI; having all players in the concert would make removing memories easier. Eiji adds that the drones used for harvesting possess enough power to damage the players' brains, killing them like the NerveGear did in SAO.|$|E
25|$|After Madotsuki {{falls to}} sleep, {{she begins to}} dream. The player is then {{presented}} with a dream world which resembles the same room Madotsuki lives in. In the dream world, the player is able to leave the room, which {{will lead to a}} nexus of 12 doors, with each leading to a different world, including a colorful neon maze, a forest, a world littered with numerical symbols, and a world full of body parts, among others. These 12 worlds, in turn, connect to a number of other worlds, forming a large and expansive area for the player to explore. The purpose of the game is for the player to navigate the main character's dream worlds to obtain 24 objects, known as effects. The player can attempt to interact with objects, although few will provide any response. The player can choose to wake from the dream world at any time, by causing Madotsuki to pinch her cheek and awaken. This behavior ensures that the player <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> out of the dream world at all times.|$|E

500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Many female artists {{behave like}} a diva for a period when they reach superstar status, and the 'Who's That Girl?' tour marked the {{beginning}} of Madonna's." [...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they had to talk to her representatives, lest they distract her from the business at hand. She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. [...] "You don't {{behave like a}} bitch until you are that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status", he commented.|$|E

People magazine named Usher the [...] "Sexiest R Star" [...] in 1998, with singer Monica who said on stage sexiness was manifest in [...] "his movements, his gestures, the way he expresses his lyrics."

500|$|Sharing what he {{perceived}} to be [...] "key" [...] moments {{in each of the}} seventeen music videos, Walker of MTV identified one for [...] "No Angel" [...] where Beyoncé [...] "proves she comes 'with a side of trouble'".

But like the song suggests, just because things might get rough sometimes doesn't mean it's not still home." [...] A mixed review came from an editor of Houston Chronicle who described the clip as [...] "somber, shocking" [...] and noted the omissions of many landmarks characteristic for the city such as Waterwall, the Houston Astrodome and The Galleria. The editor also noted that the video offered a glimpse in the town's sex industry and elaborated, Many Houstonians probably don't know that side of the city. They almost certainly don't see it as beautiful. ' culture' is what some pundits call it.

500|$|Wood's {{performance}} of Steffy has received acclaim, {{and she has}} become a fan favorite. On-Air On-Soaps said Wood had the [...] "unique challenge" [...] of making the despised character into a more complex and well-rounded one, who fans were rooting for, while also praising her as [...] "one of the hardest working younger actresses in daytime today".

While criticizing the material written for the character as being [...] "often repetitive and silly", Sara Bibel of Xfinity opined in June 2012 that Wood is a [...] "charismatic actress" [...] who rises above the script to [...] "deliver consistently interesting performances". In July 2012, Soaps In Depth commended Wood's performance, observing that [...] "While her sexiness is a given, Wood <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of bringing a cool, copacetic attitude to her scenes", while praising her ability to infuse [...] "both melancholy and mirth" [...] in her performance.

[...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee."

[...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E

Desmond later goes to Penny's billionaire father, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) and asks for his permission to marry his daughter. Widmore rejects Desmond, who is crushed and humiliated. Walking out of the building, Desmond sees Charlie singing and playing his guitar for money on the sidewalk. Desmond asks him if he remembers him but Charlie does not. Frustrated, Desmond rants about his time {{on the island and}} predicts it will rain, which it suddenly does. At a pub, Desmond meets with his friend, a physicist, and after retelling the events on the island asks him if time travel is possible. Desmond tries to predict more events but they do not happen and his friend assures him time travel is impossible. While shopping for a ring for Penny, Desmond runs into the shopkeeper, Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan). Hawking takes Desmond on a walk where they see a man crushed to death by falling scaffolding. She explains that although she knew the man would die, she did not help because the universe <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of [...] "course correcting", and he would die anyway. Desmond and Penny go on a walk together and take a picture, where he breaks up with her after realizing that he does not have enough money to support her. He returns to the pub, where one of his predictions before about the bartender being attacked finally comes true (proving that he really knew about the future, but that his timing was off), but he ends up being accidentally hit himself and is knocked out.
