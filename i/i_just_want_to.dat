But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
