5|$|It {{should be}} noted that convergency is {{considered}} responsible for uniquely tetrapod features found also in other non-elpistostegalian fish from the period like Sauripterus (finger-like <b>jointed</b> distal radial bones) or Tarrasius (tetrapod-like spine with 5 axial regions).|$|E
5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} arthropods, such as centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, and spiders, {{are sometimes}} confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar, sharing (as do all arthropods) a <b>jointed</b> exoskeleton. However, upon closer examination, their features differ significantly; most noticeably, {{they do not}} have the six-legged characteristic of adult insects.|$|E
5|$|Stream downcutting {{continued}} {{along with}} canyon-forming {{processes such as}} mass wasting; sediment-rich and abrasive flood stage waters would undermine cliffs until vertical slabs of rock sheared away. This process continues to be especially efficient with the vertically <b>jointed</b> Navajo Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|The {{projection}} dome was {{separate from}} the outer dome, and was 23 meters (75.4ft) in diameter. Made of curved aluminum sheets, it was lap <b>jointed</b> to create a continuous spherical surface. The sheets were painted white and perforated with 2.5-millimeter (0.1inch) holes, which were designed to let sound through and reduced echoes in the cavernous space.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly <b>jointed</b> petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} Anomalocaris from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that {{are thought to be}} close relatives of arthropods but lack <b>jointed</b> limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.|$|E
5|$|Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, {{a three-part}} body (head, thorax and abdomen), {{three pairs of}} <b>jointed</b> legs, {{compound}} eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including {{more than a million}} described species and representing {{more than half of all}} known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.|$|E
5|$|Smooth Meadow-grass and Broad-leaved Meadow-grass are {{widespread}} in damp lowland conditions, Wood Sedge (Carex sylvatica) in woodlands, and Oval Sedge and Early Hair-grass on upland moors. In damp conditions Phragmites reeds and {{several species of}} Juncus are found abundantly including <b>Jointed</b> Rush, Soft Rush and Toad Rush, and less commonly the introduced species Slender Rush. Common Cottongrass is a familiar site on marshy land, but Saltmarsh Sedge (Carex salina) was only discovered {{for the first time}} in 2004 at the head of Loch Duich.|$|E
5|$|Some spiders have a cribellum, a {{modified}} spinneret {{with up to}} 40,000 spigots, each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of bristles on the <b>jointed</b> tip of the cribellum, and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in snagging the bristles of insects. The earliest spiders had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of spiders have lost the cribellum.|$|E
5|$|The Chelicerata are {{arthropods}} as they have: segmented {{bodies with}} <b>jointed</b> limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during {{the development of the}} embryo; a much reduced coelom; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates, driven by a tube-like heart. Chelicerates' bodies consist of two tagmata, sets of segments that serve similar functions: the foremost one, called the prosoma or cephalothorax, and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen. However, in the Acari (mites and ticks) there is no visible division between these sections.|$|E
5|$|A lack {{of field}} {{observations}} limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts {{are known to}} sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents. The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a <b>jointed</b> club or flail. Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.|$|E
5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open <b>jointed</b> pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E
5|$|Isopoda is {{an order}} of {{crustaceans}} that includes woodlice and their relatives. Isopods live in the sea, in fresh water, or on land. All have rigid, segmented exoskeletons, two pairs of antennae, seven pairs of <b>jointed</b> limbs on the thorax, and five pairs of branching appendages on the abdomen {{that are used in}} respiration. Females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax. Isopods have various feeding methods: some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter, others are grazers, or filter feeders, a few are predators, and some are internal or external parasites, mostly of fishes. Aquatic species mostly live on the seabed or bottom of freshwater bodies of water, but some more derived taxa can swim for a short distance. Terrestrial forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool, moist places. Some species are able to roll themselves into a ball as a defence mechanism or to conserve moisture.|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar <b>jointed</b> lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava flows and domes.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates have {{segmented}} {{bodies with}} <b>jointed</b> limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins. The chelicerate bauplan consists of two tagmata, the prosoma and the opisthosoma, except that mites have lost a visible division between these sections. The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest pincers used to feed. However, spiders' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods, in which a tube-like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel, which is the major body cavity. Marine chelicerates have gills, while the air-breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae. In general, the ganglia of living chelicerates' central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the cephalothorax, but there are wide variations and this fusion is very limited in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as {{the oldest and most}} primitive group of spiders. Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations, air currents, and chemical changes in their environment. The most active hunting spiders also have very acute eyesight.|$|E
5|$|Steadily {{rising sea}} levels then further {{isolated}} this little island, which is entirely of volcanic origin. It {{consists of a}} basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure. By contrast, slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted towards each {{of a series of}} equally spaced centres as it cooled and solidified into prismatic columns, a process known as columnar jointing. The columns typically have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. These columnar <b>jointed</b> sections represent the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows. Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing, known as the entablature. The origin of the entablature is unknown, but could be due to flooding of the lava flow, causing much more rapid cooling, or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of columnar jointing as they approach one another.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{surfaces}} {{have been}} refined into three common types: <b>jointed</b> plain (JPCP), <b>jointed</b> reinforced (JRCP) and continuously reinforced (CRCP). The one item that distinguishes each type is the jointing system {{used to control}} crack development.|$|E
25|$|Solo on Crutches: Like a <b>jointed</b> puppet, the Limping Angel {{performs}} on crutches, sliding {{around the}} stage.|$|E
25|$|Surprise Creek Bridge {{is one of}} a {{small group}} of bridges extant in Queensland with pin <b>jointed</b> spans.|$|E
25|$|The Corvallis {{military}} prefers <b>jointed</b> pikes {{as their}} weapon of choice, bolstered by catapults, ballistae, and other siege engines.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Brusilovsky <b>jointed</b> the artists' {{group of}} the Ural Engineering Plant factory (Uralmash) {{consisting}} of 28 painters, graphic artists and sculptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jointed</b> rails {{were used}} {{at first because}} {{contemporary}} technology did not offer any alternative. However, the intrinsic weakness in resisting vertical loading results in the ballast becoming depressed and a heavy maintenance workload is imposed to prevent unacceptable geometrical defects at the joints. The joints also needed to be lubricated, and wear at the fishplate (joint bar) mating surfaces needed to be rectified by shimming. For this reason <b>jointed</b> track is not financially appropriate for heavily operated railroads.|$|E
25|$|Track rails in the tunnel, {{originally}} <b>jointed,</b> {{were replaced}} in the 1930's with continuous welded rail; {{one of the}} earliest such installations in North America.|$|E
25|$|Gustave Gilbert (1911–1977), {{co-author}} of the second of three stereotype studies that comprise the Princeton Trilogy, <b>jointed</b> the department as a visiting lecturer in abnormal psychology in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Fingal's Cave {{is formed}} entirely from hexagonally <b>jointed</b> basalt columns within a Paleocene lava flow, similar in {{structure}} to the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland {{and those of}} nearby Ulva.|$|E
25|$|Industrial robots usually {{consist of}} a <b>jointed</b> arm (multi-linked manipulator) and an end {{effector}} that {{is attached to a}} fixed surface. One of {{the most common type of}} end effector is a gripper assembly.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance of {{the line}} was improved, {{inspection}} techniques and jointing methods were revised, and plans for replacing <b>jointed</b> track by continuous welded rail were accelerated. Concrete sleepers were banned at rail joints on the Southern Region.|$|E
25|$|Ember Ridge, {{the oldest}} and {{southern}} known parasitic vent, is a subglacial volcano that formed and last erupted during the Pliocene period. It comprises a chain of steep-sided lava domes with glassy, tortuously <b>jointed</b> lava, such as hornblende-phyric basalt.|$|E
25|$|The {{anatomy of}} spiders {{includes}} many characteristics shared with other arachnids. These characteristics include bodies {{divided into two}} tagmata (sections or segments), eight <b>jointed</b> legs, no wings or antennae, the presence of chelicerae and pedipalps, simple eyes, and an exoskeleton, which is periodically shed.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} of <b>jointed</b> track is {{cracking}} around the bolt holes, {{which can lead}} to breaking of the rail head (the running surface). This was the cause of the Hither Green rail crash which caused British Railways to begin converting much of its track to continuous welded rail.|$|E
25|$|Slag Hill, another {{parasitic}} subglacial volcano {{located just}} north of Mount Cayley, was erupted during the Pleistocene period, producing glassy lava flows, such as augite-phyric basaltic andesite. These lava flows were cooled to form steep-sided, glassy, finely <b>jointed</b> lava domes comparable to those found at Ember Ridge, and one minor, flat-topped bluff.|$|E
25|$|The {{derailment}} {{was found}} to be due to a broken rail. The Ministry of Transport report criticised the maintenance of the line, especially following a recent increase of the maximum speed of trains over the route. Following the accident the maintenance of the line was improved and plans accelerated for replacing <b>jointed</b> track by continuous welded rail.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Russia {{also joined}} the Rome Convention, the {{analogue}} of the Berne Convention for neighbouring rights. The adherence of Russia to the Rome Convention became effective on May 26, 2003. The Rome convention covered performances, phonograms, and broadcasts. The Rome Convention is non-retroactive and {{applies only to}} phonograms created after and to performances or broadcasts that occurred after a country <b>jointed</b> the convention (article 20).|$|E
25|$|When Davenport was 14, she <b>jointed</b> the United States Tennis Association junior {{national}} team. She had a {{rapid growth}} spurt — {{about six inches}} in two years — which affected her coordination, but did not hinder her performance. She excelled at junior level competitions and swept the singles and doubles titles at the National Girls' 18s and Clay Court Championships in 1991 and won the Junior U.S. Open in '92.|$|E
25|$|The Surprise Creek Bridge, at 28.7km, is a 72.54m long steel {{lattice girder}} bridge set on tall {{concrete}} piers {{at the head of}} a waterfall. The approach spans are pin <b>jointed.</b> This is followed by a timber trestle bridge at 29.16km, and then Christmas Creek Bridge at 29.23km. The sixth and final steel {{lattice girder bridge}} on the section, the Christmas Creek Bridge is 39.6m long, with wrought iron trestles.|$|E
25|$|Rails are {{produced}} in fixed lengths {{and need to}} be joined end-to-end to make a continuous surface on which trains may run. The traditional method of joining the rails is to bolt them together using metal fishplates (jointbars in the US), producing <b>jointed</b> track. For more modern usage, particularly where higher speeds are required, the lengths of rail may be welded together to form continuous welded rail (CWR).|$|E
