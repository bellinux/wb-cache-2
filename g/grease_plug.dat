40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science [Â© IMechE]. It is also available at: [URL] and thermoelastohydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) analyses of grease lubricated bearings are presented. A <b>grease</b> <b>plug</b> flow is formed in the conjunction that, with no shear at the boundaries with the solid surfaces, adheres to them in the region of high pressures under isothermal conditions. The elastohydrodynamic lubrication grease pressure distribution conforms fairly closely to that of its base oil alone, with the exception of inlet trail and pressure spike regions. The dependency of film thickness on speed (rolling viscosity) and load parameters for the base oil agrees with previously reported findings of the research community. For grease there are subtle differences with the base oil film thickness load and speed dependencies. However, it is clear that extrapolated oil film thickness formulae for oils can be used reasonably for the prediction of grease films, at least as a first approximation. The results presented agree well with optical interferometric measurements reported in the literature for grease-lubricated contacts at low temperatures and low surface velocities. TEHL analysis shows breakdown of the plug flow and significant reduction in film thickness, which can lead to changes in the regime of lubrication to mixed or boundary conditions...|$|E
50|$|Missing mintmarks, dates, {{and other}} design {{elements}} are not distinct errors, but rather are what the observer sees when viewing other error types. A design element that {{is missing from}} the die when it is made is a fundamental error. Missing design elements that occur because dies are tilted and do not strike the planchet face-on are known as misaligned dies. A design element may be missing because foreign matter such as <b>grease</b> <b>plugs</b> the cavity into which the planchet's metal would normally flow under the striking pressure. This error {{is also known as}} a filled die and as a strike through. Although this does involve a die, it is typically thought of as a striking error, but is included here so as to provide a more complete list.|$|R
