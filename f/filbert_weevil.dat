50|$|Together with larva of the {{filbertworm}} moth (Cydia latiferreana), the <b>filbert</b> <b>weevil</b> {{feeds on}} the acorns of {{several species of}} oak tree. In British Columbia, up to 66% of acorns from garry oak (Quercus garryana) were infected with these larvae. These acorns are still able to germinate, but the germination rate is lower than for uninfected nuts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two-hundred shoots {{contained}} within randomly selected locations {{from each of}} thirty-six coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia, trees were sampled to determine the abundance and spatial distribution of acorns infested by the <b>filbert</b> <b>weevil,</b> Curculio occidentis in northern California during 1989. The seasonal abundance of infested acorns was highest at 30 percent during mid-September. Overall, 25 percent of all acorns ob-served on sample trees revealed signs of boring insect activity. Slightly higher infestation rate of 38 percent was obtained from laboratory dissections of field collected acorns (n = 501). Of those acorns dissected in the laboratory found to contain insect larvae, 70 percent contained C. occidentis and 30 percent con-tained the filbertworm, Melissopus latiferreanus. Although acorns were numerous on the sunny side of the tree, infested acorns were more abundant on the shady side. The differential distribution of acorns spatially within trees, acorn survivorship, {{and the impact of}} insect and other animal acorn predators on acorn production are discussed. The sweeping branches of a large regal oak is a vision common to all of us. As a single tree or forest stand, our native oaks {{play an important role in}} wildlife and human ecologies. In California there are 18 species of oaks, 10 of which reach tree size (Tucker 1980; Griffin and Muick 1990). The total acreage for California's oak species has been estimated at 15 - 20 million acres (Plumb and McDonald 1981). For thousands of years, native oaks have been a prominent and persistent floral feature in California. Unfortunately, it now appears many of our oak woodlands have been drastically reduced and are poorly regen...|$|E
40|$|The {{targeted}} {{application of}} prescribed fire {{has long been}} used by Native Californian peoples to manage plant resources of cultural value. Their ability to employ this management tool has been increasingly restricted by local, {{state and federal agencies}} in response to recent drought conditions and the highly flammable state of most western U. S. forests, where, for decades, fires of any magnitude have been suppressed as a matter of policy. This diminished access to cultural prescribed fire has impacted tribal access to many of the plant resources and cultural activities upon which Karuk and Yurok cultures are based. The research presented in this dissertation: 1) uses historical and modern references to describe fire management practices of tribes throughout California, specifically targeting acorns as food resource, 2) investigates the effect of non-traditional spring burns on rates of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus, Fagaceae) acorn infestation by frugivorous Filbertworms (Cydia latiferreana, Tortricidae) and <b>Filbert</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae (Curculio occidentalis, Curculionidae), 3) evaluates the effectiveness of indigenous acorn collection criteria in correctly assessing the consumption quality of acorns, and 4) examines the responses of culturally significant plant species found in tanoak gathering areas to prescribed fire applied non-traditionally in spring. Assessed metrics were species diversity, species richness, and vegetative cover. Traditionally, fires used to maintain productive heritage tanoak stands were set in late summer and fall. However, prescribed burns {{at this time of year}} have become very difficult to implement, so this study focused on the responses of the assemblages to a more easily executed, spring burn. During the two year study of acorn infestation rates in response to fire, I found that spring prescribed fire reduced acorn infestation in both the year of the fire and one year post-fire. Indigenous acorn collection criteria were very effective in distinguishing edible acorns from both inedible and insect-infested acorns. However, the traditional method of acorn evaluation did misclassify a sizeable proportion of the acorns as inedible, when they were actually of good food quality. Intended or not, this conservative misidentification provides added insurance that insect-infected acorns are not added to those stored within a household for future use. Over the three years that the responses of culturally valuable understory taxa to fire were monitored, all three metrics (species diversity, species richness, and vegetative cover) were sharply reduced by fire. Species diversity and richness showed substantial recovery by the second post-fire year, but neither had fully recovered. Understory plant cover showed very little, in any, recovery two years after the experimental fires. In particular, the percent cover of tanoak seedlings and lignotuber sprouts were greatly reduced, which may increase visibility of abscised acorns to tribal gatherers. As a single cultural fire targets multiple resource goals, these results indicate that some, but not all, resource goals traditionally achieved with fall fire were met with spring prescribed fire...|$|E
