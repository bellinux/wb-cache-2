5|$|Flower {{became the}} first player to carry <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> in two {{different}} international formats when he also carried <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> in a Test against Pakistan at Bulawayo in 1998; since then, Anwar, Stewart, Gayle and Javed Omar of Bangladesh have also managed this feat.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>bat</b> {{touches the}} turf {{in line with}} the off-stump, but his feet are well clear of the leg stump. He grips the bat near the tip of the handle, and it gives an {{impression}} that the bat is inordinately long.|$|E
5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with <b>his</b> <b>bat,</b> a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>batting</b> {{style is}} akin to Virender Sehwag, with minimal foot movement, and he has {{credited}} Sehwag to helping <b>his</b> <b>batting</b> improve.|$|R

5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the new ball.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, {{written by the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Before a batsman can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no ball — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batsman to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching <b>his</b> <b>bat,</b> {{in line with the}} wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. The batsman may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with <b>his</b> <b>bat,</b> he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5000|$|Staples played professionally from 1945 to 1950 {{and from}} 1953 to 1954, mostly as a catcher. <b>His</b> <b>batting</b> average was [...]264 in 672 games during {{career in the}} minor leagues, which spanned eight years.

5000|$|Players {{can be very}} {{particular}} about their bats. Ted Williams cleaned <b>his</b> <b>bats</b> with alcohol every night and periodically {{took them to the}} post office to weigh them. [...] "Bats pick up condensation and dirt lying around on the ground," [...] he wrote, [...] "They can gain an ounce or more in a surprisingly short time." [...] Ichiro Suzuki also takes great care that <b>his</b> <b>bats</b> do not accumulate moisture and thus gain weight: he stores <b>his</b> <b>bats</b> in humidors, one in the club house and another, a portable one, for the road. Rod Carew fought moisture by storing <b>his</b> <b>bats</b> in a box full of sawdust in the warmest part of his house. [...] "The sawdust acts as a buffer between the bats and the environment," [...] he explained, [...] "absorbing any moisture before it can seep into the wood." ...|$|R
5000|$|By 1951, Wyrostek was a good-hitting outfielder who {{averaged}} about a [...]266 batting average. But that year, <b>his</b> <b>batting</b> average skyrocketed to [...]311. While his power numbers went down (2 HR, 61 RBIs), <b>his</b> <b>batting</b> average {{was good for}} sixth {{in the league and}} his 167 hits was 10th. He made his second and final All-Star team.|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, {{the second}} innings in Adelaide saw England set Australia a near-impossible 532 for victory; even today, the highest {{successful}} Test run chase is 418. Australia lost its first wicket at three when Jack Fingleton was bowled by Larwood. Woodfull {{was joined by}} Bradman, who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method, before being dismissed for 66. Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73, carrying <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> as his teammates capitulated around him. Australia was eventually all out for 193, with Oldfield unable to bat due to his fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|A batsman can be out lbw even if {{the ball}} did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on the head could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), {{even if the}} ball would have {{otherwise}} hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted {{to hit the ball}} with <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Hutton rocked {{onto the}} front foot, played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32. The English opener had been {{uncertain}} against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> and pad. Later in the afternoon, Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England were out early on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.|$|E

5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with <b>his</b> <b>bat.</b> The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could be caught {{on the edge of the}} field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 {{the event}} was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands. Twelve teams contested the World Cup. Australia {{qualified}} for the semi-finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match. They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final also against South Africa where a mix-up between South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> and stranded mid-pitch to be run out. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Ishikawa {{signed with}} the Milwaukee Brewers, who used him mainly as a pinch-hitter and {{defensive}} replacement. Ishikawa spent most of 2013 in the minor leagues, though he played six games for the Baltimore Orioles and one game for the New York Yankees. In 2014, he made the Pittsburgh Pirates Opening Day roster. However <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> wasn't as hot as it was during Spring Training so the Pirates traded for 1B Ike Davis from the New York Mets and Ishikawa was designated for assignment. He was re-signed by his former team the San Francisco Giants in April and started for them in left field during the 2014 playoffs. On October 16, 2014, Ishikawa hit a walk-off three-run home run to give the Giants their third National League pennant in five years by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{then lifted}} Laker for another six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head. The English captain, noted {{for his ability}} to break {{partnerships}} with his occasional bowling, brought himself on. Miller responded by striking a four over long on from Yardley's bowling to reach 54. He drove the next ball through cover for four. The English skipper responded by stacking the leg side with outfielders and bowled outside leg stump, challenging Miller to attempt another hit for six. Yardley bowled a half-volley outside leg stump and the batsman obliged, but edged the ball off the back of <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> onto wicket-keeper Evans' head and was caught by a forward-diving Edrich at short fine leg.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, 2007, however, he tore {{his right}} ACL while being {{restrained}} by Padres manager Bud Black during an altercation with first base umpire Mike Winters. Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters {{said that he}} had tossed <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After Bradley reached first base, he questioned Winters about the alleged bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley and Padres first base coach Bobby Meacham, Winters addressed Bradley with a barrage of profanity. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground and injured himself. He missed the final week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres lost to the Colorado Rockies in a one game playoff for the National League wild card on October 1.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Woodfull established his partnership with Ponsford, and in 1926–27 Shield season, {{they put on}} a record-breaking 375-run opening stand, setting up a world record first-class team score of 1107. Woodfull averaged 69.00 for the season, and both he and Ponsford averaged over 125 the following summer, overwhelming opposition bowlers and helping Victoria win the Sheffield Shield easily. Woodfull was appointed as vice-captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928–29 home Ashes series following a spate of retirements. Woodfull carried <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> in a record-breaking first Test defeat. Although England easily won 4–1, Woodfull stood firm to score three centuries {{in the last four}} Tests, and added his best first-class score for 275 not out in a tour match against the Englishmen. The following season, Woodfull's campaign was truncated by a hand injury.|$|E

5|$|Woodfull {{played his}} first Test on Australian {{soil in the}} first Test at Brisbane. He made a duck in the first innings as Australia fell for 122 to concede a 411-run first innings lead. before Australia were forced to chase 742 for victory. Woodfull carried <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> to make an unbeaten 30 as Australia were skittled for 66 on a sticky wicket in Brisbane in the first Test to lose by a record 675 runs. Woodfull then made 68 to top-score in the first innings of the second Test in Sydney. Australia conceded another mammoth first innings lead, 383. Woodfull then scored his first Test century in Australia, with 111 in the second innings to force the {{tourists}} to bat again. Despite this, England scored 2/16 to win the match.|$|E
5|$|A {{fortnight}} later, Miller {{proceeded to}} the Second Test in Sydney, {{where he had}} a quiet match without his partner Lindwall, who was sidelined with chickenpox. England batted first and Miller opened the bowling with Victorian teammate and debutant Fred Freer. Miller bowled nine overs without success, conceding 24 runs as Hammond's tourists amassed 270. On a turning surface, nine of the English wickets fell to the spinners Johnson and McCool. In the hosts' reply, Miller contributed 40 with seven fours in a 63-run stand with Barnes as Australia reached 4/159. Bradman—who had dropped himself down the order—and Barnes then both scored 234 and put together a world record fifth-wicket partnership of 405 to propel Australia to 8/659 declared. Miller bowled 11 overs in the second innings, taking the wicket of Hutton who was out hit wicket after going on a short-lived attack that yielded 37 runs from 39 balls in 24 minutes. Hutton shaped to drive the last ball before lunch, and successfully made contact, but in following through, <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> slipped from his hand and clipped the stumps. Miller had a light bowling workload as Johnson and McCool took seven wickets between them for the innings and eight wickets each for the match as Australia completed another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Australia batted {{much more}} productively {{in the second}} innings in ideal weather on the third day. Morris and Barnes put on 122 before the former fell for 62. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease for his last Test innings {{at the home of}} cricket. Yardley {{surrounded}} the Australian captain with fielders and Laker then beat <b>his</b> <b>bat</b> thrice in an over. Bedser was then introduced with the leg trap ploy again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads.

Barnes then manipulated the strike to shield his captain from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap, and negated the danger Bedser was posing. Bradman accelerated after tea and took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty, with Barnes on 96 and Australia at 1/222.|$|E
