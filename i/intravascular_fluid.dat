50|$|The main <b>intravascular</b> <b>fluid</b> in mammals is blood, {{a complex}} mixture with {{elements}} of a suspension (blood cells), colloid (globulins), and solutes (glucose and ions). The blood represents both the intracellular compartment (the fluid inside the blood cells) and the extracellular compartment (the blood plasma). The other <b>intravascular</b> <b>fluid</b> is lymph. It too represents both the intracellular compartment (the fluid inside its lymphocytes) and the extracellular compartment (the noncellular matrix of the lymph, which is roughly equivalent to serum). The average volume of plasma in the average (70 kg) male is approximately 3.5 liters. The volume of the intravascular compartment is regulated in part by hydrostatic pressure gradients, and by reabsorption by the kidneys.|$|E
50|$|The {{second stage}} {{features}} the reabsorption of the initially extravasated fluid and it usually lasts {{just as long}} as the leak phase. <b>Intravascular</b> <b>fluid</b> overload leads to polyuria and can cause flash pulmonary edema, with possibly fatal consequences. The severity of the problem depends on to the quantity of fluid supplied in the initial phase, the damage that may have been sustained by the kidneys, and the promptness with which diuretics are administered to help the patient discharge the accumulated fluids quickly.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that in vivo glucose level changes affect the {{dielectric}} characteristics of the skin and underlying tissue, which can be measured non-invasively by impedance spectroscopy (IS). For a successful implementation of such an impedance sensor it is necessary that the sensor, when placed in contact with human skin, has a sufficient field penetration depth so that it is not only sensitive to changes in the dielectric properties of the upper skin layer, but also has a higher sensitivity to changes in the deeper skin layers. This {{is due to the fact}} that the upper layers of the skin are poorly vascularised, therefore their dielectric properties have a low sensitivity to changes associated with blood and <b>intravascular</b> <b>fluids.</b> A simplified model of the human skin and underlying tissue has been developed using electromagnetic field finite element simulations. This model can be used to optimise the electrode design of the impedance sensor. Initially, the applicability of the simulation concepts has been tested by comparing simulations with measurements of reference materials using sensor...|$|R
30|$|CVP is {{an innate}} {{pressure}} {{that is not}} only affected by manipulation of <b>intravascular</b> volume (<b>fluid</b> administration, restriction, or elimination) but also determined by various disease processes (intra-abdominal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension,…) or treatment (mechanical ventilation). Irrespective of volume status, an elevated CVP may harm the kidney by impeding renal venous return and causing renal interstitial edema. Individualizing CVP measurements and keeping CVP as low as possible should be encouraged to preserve kidney function or to avoid unnecessary renal damage.|$|R
30|$|Indeed, as {{detailed}} in the princeps article by Sort et al. [8] {{and in a}} meta-analysis by Salerno et al. [9] which integrates all RCTs on albumin infusion during SBP and constitutes the cornerstone of recommendations in favor of albumin, these RCTs compared vascular filling with albumin with {{the absence of any}} <b>intravascular</b> <b>fluids</b> [8, 10, 11] or a hydroxyethyl starch infusion which was subsequently shown to be nephrotoxic [12] (Table  1). One may wonder whether such studies would get published nowadays. The only conclusion that can be drawn from these studies is the confirmation of the paramount importance of fluid resuscitation during sepsis, at least at the initial phase. In addition, most recommendations were written by experts who had financial ties with the manufacturers of albumin solutions. Many major journals now preclude that guidelines be written by authors with such ties [13]. Interestingly, the only recommendation published by authors without financial ties highlighted that the previous studies which were selected for the meta-analysis by Salerno et al. [9] could be “criticized as the control groups were not given an equivalent amount of fluid as crystalloid” and added that “further studies are required before making any formal recommendations about the use of albumin in SBP” [6].|$|R
5000|$|The Starling {{equation}} for fluid filtration {{is named}} for the British physiologist Ernest Starling, who is also recognised for the Frank-Starling law of the heart. The classic Starling equation has in recent years been revised. The Starling principle of fluid exchange is key to understanding how plasma fluid (solvent) within the bloodstream (<b>intravascular</b> <b>fluid)</b> moves to the space outside the bloodstream (extravascular space). Starling can be credited with identifying that the [...] "absorption of isotonic salt solutions (from the extravascular space) by the blood vessels is determined by this osmotic pressure of the serum proteids." [...] (1896) ...|$|E
50|$|Permissive {{hypotension}} {{relies on}} the heart's ability to pump fluid through the body efficiently. Less <b>intravascular</b> <b>fluid</b> results in a less fluid filling the heart (lower end diastolic volume) which results in a lower amount of volume pumped out of the heart (stroke volume). This {{is based on the}} Frank-Starling law of the heart. Healthy patients should be able to compensate for lower volumes to some extent, but patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease limiting myocardial function (such as angina pectoris) may not. Applying permissive hypotension to the latter patient category may result in decreased coronary perfusion and result in ischemic damage to the heart and potentially myocardial infarction (heart attack).|$|E
50|$|Blood plasma is a straw {{coloured}} liquid {{component of}} blood that normally holds the blood cells in whole blood in suspension; this makes plasma the extracellular matrix of blood cells. It makes up about 55% of the body's total blood volume. It is the <b>intravascular</b> <b>fluid</b> part of extracellular fluid (all body fluid outside cells). It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume), and contains dissolved proteins (6-8%) (i.e.—serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen), glucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3−, Cl−, etc.), hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation) and oxygen.Plasma {{also serves as}} the protein reserve of the human body. It plays {{a vital role in}} an intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolytes in balanced form and protects the body from infection and other blood disorders.|$|E
30|$|After {{intravascular}} administration, CM {{are distributed}} rapidly over <b>intravascular</b> and extracellular <b>fluids,</b> i.e. the CM {{have a short}} distribution half-life (t½d). Usually, {{the time for the}} CM to distribute evenly over the fluids is several minutes, ranging from 2 to 30  min. Plasma protein binding is approximately 1 - 3  % [16].|$|R

Resuscitation was started immediately and he was treated with pericardiocentesis and a massive <b>intravascular</b> infusion of <b>fluid.</b> The torn area was plicated with Teflon felt and reinforced with an uninterrupted suture. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. This report points out the crucial importance of prompt clinical recognition {{and management of the}} acute stage of cardiac rupture in {{acute myocardial infarction}}...|$|R
50|$|Vasogenic edema occurs {{due to a}} {{breakdown}} of the tight endothelial junctions that make up the blood-brain barrier. This allows <b>intravascular</b> proteins and <b>fluid</b> to penetrate into the parenchymal extracellular space.Once plasma constituents cross the barrier, the edema spreads; this may be quite rapid and extensive. As water enters white matter, it moves extracellularly along fiber tracts and can also affect the gray matter.This type of edema may result from trauma, tumors, focal inflammation, late stages of cerebral ischemia and hypertensive encephalopathy.|$|R
50|$|Human {{expenditure}} of energy results in the generation of heat. The body heat generated by normal activities, and particularly by exercise, triggers homeostatic regulatory mechanisms {{with the goal of}} maintaining body core temperature within its relatively narrow, safe physiologic range by means of vasoregulation and diaphoresis. The weightlessness environment of spaceflight may impair heat dissipation by reducing evaporative and conductive heat exchange. Microgravity and spaceflight may perturb the body’s thermoregulatory mechanisms by altering the work efficiency, metabolic rate, or circadian rhythms of heat production. Additionally, human space travelers are often not well hydrated, have a 10-15% decrease in <b>intravascular</b> <b>fluid</b> (plasma) volume, and may lose both their preflight muscular and cardiovascular fitness levels as well as their thermoregulatory capabilities. As a result, they may become less heat-acclimated or may acquire an altered thermal sensitivity.|$|E
5000|$|Functional {{capacity}} {{can also}} be expressed as [...] "METs" [...] {{and can be used}} as a reliable predictor of future cardiac events. One MET is defined as the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest, and is equal to 3.5 ml oxygen per kilogram body weight per minute. In other words, a means of expressing energy cost of physical activity as a multiple of the resting rate. For instance; walking on level ground at about 6 km/h or carrying groceries up a flight of stairs expends about 4 METs of activity. Generally, >7 METs of activity tolerance is considered excellent while <4 is considered poor for surgical candidates. Determining one's functional capacity can elucidate the degree of surgical risk one might undertake for procedures that risk blood loss, <b>intravascular</b> <b>fluid</b> shifts, etc. and may tax an already strained cardiovascular system.|$|E

That fluid must be replaced to keep correct <b>intravascular</b> volume. The <b>fluid</b> replaced is different at different institutions. If a crystalloid like normal saline (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up oncotic pressure.

40|$|Sepsis is a dysregulation of the {{inflammatory}} response, termed systemic {{inflammatory response}} syndrome or SIRS, caused by stimulation of an infectious process.

The goal of treatment is to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapies, target the underlying infection, optimize <b>intravascular</b> volume, provide <b>fluid</b> resuscitation and maintain adequate perfusion and stroke volume (Taeb, Hooper 2 ̆ 6 Marik, 2017). Timing of treatment and early detection of sepsis is critical to patients with early warning signs.

5000|$|... • ABDOMINAL - Lymphangiomatosis {{has been}} {{reported}} in every region of the abdomen, though the most reported sites involve the intestines and peritoneum; spleen, kidneys, and liver. Often there are no symptoms until late in the progression of the disease. When they do occur, symptoms include abdominal pain and/or distension; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; decreased appetite and malnourishment. When the disease affects the kidneys the symptoms include flank pain, abdominal distension, blood in the urine, and, possibly, elevated blood pressure, which may result in it being confused with other cystic renal disease. When lymphangiomatosis occurs in the liver and/or spleen it may be confused with polycystic liver disease. Symptoms may include abdominal fullness and distension; anemia, disseminated <b>intravascular</b> coagulopathy (DIC), <b>fluid</b> accumulation in the abdomen(ascites), decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue; late findings include liver failure.|$|R
40|$|The role of ascitic fluid {{collagen}} in {{the pathogenesis}} of the coagulopathy that follows peritoneovenous shunting was examined. Collagen was partially purified from ascitic fluid and infused into rabbits. All animals developed changes in their haemostatic profile consistent with intravascular coagulation. Aspirin therapy, for five days before the collagen infusion, prevented these changes. Seven patients undergoing a total of eight peritoneovenous shunts for intractable ascites received antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and dipyridamole) in the immediate pre- and postoperative period. After six shunts no thrombocytopenia or prolongation of clotting times developed to suggest decompensated consumptive coagulopathy. Complicating factors {{may have contributed to}} the deterioration in haemostasis in the other two patients. There was no early shunt occlusion.

30|$|Modern iodinated {{contrast}} media (CM) consist {{of one or}} two tri-iodobenzene rings. They differ from each other in the composition of the side chains, creating different molecules and thus different brand substances. After intravascular administration, all CM are distributed rapidly into <b>intravascular</b> and extracellular <b>fluids.</b> They are eliminated solely by glomerular filtration. In patients with normal renal function, CMs are eliminated within 24  h. The pathophysiology of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is based on three distinct but interacting mechanisms: medullary ischaemia, formation of reactive oxygen species and direct tubular cell toxicity. The contribution of each of these mechanisms to the development of CIN in the individual patient remains unclear. CIN prevention is extensively described in guidelines, such as the recently updated guideline from the Contrast Media Safety Committee (CMSC) of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR). The recent update is briefly discussed. Furthermore, it remains unclear if volume expansion with either NaCl 0.9  % or NaHCO 3 1.4  % is superior.|$|R

If circulating antibodies play any direct role in the pathogenesis of human thyroid disease, for example by mediating cytolysis, or by blocking or stimulating function and growth (2), they {{must be able to}} interact in vivo with their specific antigens. This interaction will depend upon the accessibility of autoantigenic determinants on the cell surface, on basal membranes, and in the circulation, and the availability of adequate amounts of antibody in <b>intravascular</b> and interstitial <b>fluids.</b> Immunohistological examination of the affected target tissue, by direct immunofluorescence (IFL) l with labeled anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) or anti-complement sera, is an accepted way of looking for evidence of in vivo autoreactivity.

40|$|During {{the first}} few hours of a human spaceflight mission, a headward fluid shift out of the abdomen, pelvis, and legs initiates a number of {{adaptive}} cardiovascular responses, including a loss of <b>intravascular</b> and extravascular <b>fluid</b> volume. On return to earth, these cardiovascular changes may lead to debilitating symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in an unprotected astronaut. To test the hypothesis that an inflight increase in compliance of the leg veins may contribute to this condition, measurements of lower leg fluid shift and bulk venous compliance were collected from crew members during the eight-day First International Microgravity Laboratory shuttle mission.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare gravimetrical assessment of pulmonary edema with a stereological approach which allows for qualitative and quantitative distinction between <b>intravascular</b> and edematous <b>fluids</b> by light microscopy. Eight experimental groups which differed in mode of preservation, ischemic storage and pharmacological treatments were studied in an extracorporeal rat lung model. Analysis of the pooled data showed that the wet/dry ratio values mainly reflected the amount of intra-alveolar edema (rs = 0. 442; p = 0. 0057) but only stereological assessment of edema formation revealed differences depending on the treatment used. Only stereological data correlated significantly with oxygen tension measured at the end of reperfusion (rs = – 0. 530; p = 0. 0009). We conclude that gravimetry is of minor functional importance compared to assessment by stereological methods which prove to be a reliable and efficient tool for the evaluation of IR injury in the different experimental settings.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a lumped-parameter model that can reproduce blood volume response to fluid infusion. The model represents the fluid shift between the intravascular and interstitial compartments as {{the output of}} a hypothetical feedback controller that regulates the ratio between the volume changes in the <b>intravascular</b> and interstitial <b>fluid</b> at a target value (called target volume ratio). The model is characterized by only three parameters: the target volume ratio, feedback gain (specifying the speed of fluid shift), and initial blood volume. This model can obviate the need to incorporate complex mechanisms involved in the fluid shift in reproducing blood volume response to fluid infusion. The ability of the model to reproduce real-world blood volume response to fluid infusion was evaluated by fitting it {{to a series of}} data reported in the literature. The model reproduced the data accurately with average error and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0. 6 % and 9. 5 % across crystalloid and colloid fluids when normalized by the underlying responses. Further, the parameters derived for the model showed physiologically plausible behaviors. It was concluded that this simple model may accurately reproduce a variety of blood volume responses to fluid infusion throughout different physiological states by fitting three parameters to a given dataset. This offers a tool that can quantify the fluid shift in a dataset given the measured fractional blood volumes...|$|R

If so, N 2 O might serve as a tracer of fluid absorption during endoscopic surgery. Methods. Twelve male volunteers received continuous and intermittent i. v. infusions (5 – 45 min) of fluid containing 40 ml litre 1 of N 2 O. Breath N 2 O and CO 2 concentrations were measured every second via a flared nasal cannula, a standard nasal cannula, or a Hudson mask. Results. An expression {{for the amount of}} infused fluid was obtained by calculating the area under the N 2 O concentration–time curve for samples representative for exhalation (CO 2 >median) and then dividing this area by the median CO 2 for the remaining samples. The N 2 O method then estimated fluid volumes of between 50 and 1400 ml within a 95 % prediction interval of ± 200 ml. There were differences of up to 14 % in results between the airway devices tested, but the volunteers preferred the flared nasal cannula. N 2 O showed a distinctly higher 3 min variability during intermittent infusion, which could indicate whether fluid absorption is directly intravascular or extravascular. No adverse effects were seen. Conclusions. N 2 O method does not require forced end-expiratory breath sampling but still predicts an administered fluid volume with high precision. N 2 O variability can probably be used to distinguish immediately between <b>intravascular</b> and perivesical <b>fluid</b> absorption during surgery...|$|R
