25|$|On lap 14, Morbidelli crashed, and Brundle crashed off {{shortly after}} {{at the same}} point whilst the marshalls were still dealing with Morbidelli's car. Although no-one was hit by the car, one marshall was hit by debris and {{suffered}} a broken leg; the race was stopped. The race restarted after some time behind the Safety Car and Frentzen ran wide into the first corner, dropping down three places. Schumacher, who was <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> track but 6 seconds ahead on aggregate pitted early on lap 19. He took on fresh tyres and a fuel load that was insufficient to last {{to the end of the}} race. He rejoined 17 seconds behind Hill on aggregate but got caught in traffic and soon the gap was up to 30 seconds before it stabilized. This meant that Hill rejoined 7 seconds ahead on lap 25 when he pitted and fueled to the end of the race, but only 3 of his tyres were changed due to a sticking wheel nut. This, coupled with Hill's heavy fuel load appeared to hinder him and Schumacher began to close in.|$|E

6000|$|... "Look out!" [...] yelled Phil, suddenly. But {{the warning}} was not necessary, for Dunston Porter saw the danger {{and so did}} the others. A horse and buggy were <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the torn-up highway, going in the same {{direction}} as themselves. The horse was prancing and rearing and the driver was sawing at the lines in an effort to quiet the steed. It looked as if there might be a collision.|$|E

60|$|Those {{who sought}} us must have sent a party {{up the river}} {{immediately}} after we escaped; for when we came at last onto the river-trail not far from our destination, {{there can be no}} doubt but that we were seen by Hoojans who were <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> of us <b>on</b> the stream. The result was that as we were passing through a clump of bush a score of warriors leaped out upon us, and before we could scarce strike a blow in defense, had disarmed and bound us.|$|R
50|$|Prost thus {{signed off}} on his F1 career with his fourth Drivers' Championship and 99 points. Senna's win enabled him to secure {{second place in the}} standings with 73 points, <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> of Hill <b>on</b> 69. Schumacher was fourth with 52, with a big gap to team-mate Patrese in fifth with 20, {{followed}} by Alesi (16), Brundle (13), Berger (12), Johnny Herbert (11) and Mark Blundell (10). In the Constructors' Championship, Williams finished with 168 points - four more than their tally from 1992, and double the tally of McLaren (84). Benetton were a close third with 72, while Ferrari (28) edged out Ligier (23) for fourth.|$|R

My eye! what a place that is to go through in a boat, and on a strong flood! The gentleman, who watched the brig as a cat watches a mouse, says you struck on the Pot, as he called it, but I says `no,' for the Molly Swash was never know'd to hit rock or shoal in my time aboard her." ...|$|E
50|$|From 1980-1983, {{the club}} painfully {{finished}} runner-up on four successive occasions. In 1980 they finished second to Preston Makedonia, managed by former Essendon Croatia boss Brian Edgley, {{who had been}} replaced by Duje Zemunik midway through the previous season. Despite having a fantastic season where Essendon Croatia only lost 2 matches (both losses being to the eventual champions Preston). It was a close battle between the two sides for {{a large part of the}} season. After round 14 both Essendon Croatia and Preston Makedonia found themselves on equal points with Preston <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> goal difference, the following round saw the two sides face off. Preston won the crucial match 1-0 as they pulled away from Essendon Croatia, holding onto top spot for the rest of the season.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2006 Kentucky Derby on May 6, Bluegrass Cat was a 30-1 longshot in a {{field of}} 20. For the first [...] of a mile, he raced in fifth or sixth a few lengths behind the leaders, with Barbaro <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the outside. On the far turn, Barbaro made his move, {{eventually}} winning by [...] lengths. Bluegrass Cat could not match Barbaro's acceleration but was good enough to finish second by two lengths over Steppenwolfer, with Jazil and Brother Derek in a dead heat for fourth another length back. Bluegrass Cat's connections skipped the Preakness Stakes, won by Bernardini after Barbaro's tragic breakdown, and rested him for the Belmont Stakes. When Bernardini skipped the Belmont Stakes, Bluegrass Cat became the second choice in a wide-open field of twelve. He raced just behind the early pace and made his move on the far turn, but was out-kicked by Jazil and finished second.|$|E
50|$|Admiral Destouches {{was asked}} by General George Washington to take his fleet to the Chesapeake to support {{military}} operations against Arnold by the Marquis de Lafayette. Sailing on 8 March, he was followed two days later by Admiral Arbuthnot, who sailed from eastern Long Island. Arbuthnot's fleet outsailed that of Destouches, reaching the Virginia Capes <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> of Destouches <b>on</b> 16 March. After manoeuvring for several hours, the battle was joined, and both fleets suffered some damage and casualties without losing any ships. However, Arbuthnot was positioned to enter the Chesapeake as the fleets disengaged, frustrating Destouches' objective. Destouches returned to Newport, while Arbuthnot protected the bay {{for the arrival of}} additional land troops to reinforce General Arnold.|$|R
5000|$|Willowleaf blade: A long, narrow blade {{shaped like}} the foliage it is named after, the Willowleaf has an almost flat cross-section, and {{stresses}} flash over vibration, having very little vibration at all. It {{has the most}} flash out of all blade types, therefore, making it perfect for imitating baitfish. It is most successful {{during the summer and}} fall seasons when there is ample visibility and bass are actively feeding. The flash from the blade and clear waters allow prey to easily see it and be enticed. A popular safety-pin blade setup is to have a Willowleaf blade with a Colorado blade mounted <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> of it <b>on</b> the frame in a 'tandem' configuration.|$|R

50|$|To {{the people}} in the Hunsrück, the war’s imminence was {{something}} that was unknown. Only in mid July 1914 did it become apparent that a military conflict of some kind lay <b>just</b> <b>ahead.</b> <b>On</b> 6 August, Kaiser Wilhelm II issued a decree. A few days later, soldiers from Mittelstrimmig were leaving their homeland. With Germany’s defeat, {{the people in}} Mittelstrimmig saw the world that they had known fall apart. Not only was the monarchy gone, but the toll in blood had been quite high. Nine men from Mittelstrimmig had fallen “for Empire and Emperor”. When soldiers withdrew from the villages, they left behind weapons and ammunition. Civilians took these and used them for hunting. With the German soldiers gone, the villages on the Strimmiger Berg were occupied by the Americans, who were billeted in barns, stables, barrooms at inns and schools. Once Germany had been divided into occupation zones by the victorious powers, the Americans withdrew and the Rhineland, and along with it the Strimmiger Berg, once again fell under French rule.|$|E

5000|$|On 23 June {{was dropped}} in {{distance}} but elevated in class for the Group One Golden Jubilee Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot {{in which he}} was ridden for the first time by Johnny Murtagh and started at odds of 9/1 in a twenty-one runner field. The race featured a three-horse Australian challenge comprising Miss Andretti (the 2/1 favourite), Magnus (winner of The Galaxy) and Takeover Target whilst the other runners included Amadeus Wolf, Red Clubs, Borderlescott, Quito and Fayr Jag. Takeover Target went to the front from the start and set the pace but Soldier's Tale began to make progress in the last quarter mile. He caught the Australian gelding on the line and won by a head with Asset taking third place <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> Red Clubs. After the race Noseda said [...] "I love him for his heart. He has had countless fractures, had to have colic surgery and pieces of his stomach removed. He has to have a special diet and twice we have been on the verge of having to have him put down. It all sounds a bit soppy, but I love him to bits".|$|E
60|$|We climbed and climbed; {{and we kept}} on climbing; {{we reached}} about forty summits, {{but there was always}} another one <b>just</b> <b>ahead.</b> It came <b>on</b> to rain, and it rained in dead earnest. We were soaked through and it was bitter cold. Next a smoky fog of clouds covered the whole region densely, and we took to the railway-ties to keep from getting lost. Sometimes we slopped along in a narrow path on the {{left-hand}} side of the track, but by and by when the fog blew aside a little and we saw that we were treading the rampart of a precipice and that our left elbows were projecting over a perfectly boundless and bottomless vacancy, we gasped, and jumped for the ties again.|$|R

He was entered for the Derby but was scratched. Ridden again by Moore, he was in third place as the field turned into the finishing straight and in the straight he pulled away to win by five lengths. Kires finished second and Eranchild third. He then won the Prix du Prince d'Orange, before finishing sixth behind winner Puissant Chef in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.|$|R
5000|$|Operation Deepfreeze 1962-63 {{found the}} Arneb {{stranded}} on Christmas Day in 8' thick pressure ice {{well short of}} McMurdo Base.

5000|$|Then, with tail trimmer set, {{throttle}} and mixture lever fully forward... and {{puffs of}} grey exhaust smoke soon clearing at maximum r.p.m. came the surprise! There was no sudden surge of acceleration, {{but with a}} thunderous roar from the exhausts <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of the}} windscreen, only a steady increase in speed... In retrospect that first Hurricane sortie was a moment of elation, but also of relief. Apart from the new scale of speeds that the pilot had to adapt to, the Hurricane had all the qualities of its stable, secure biplane predecessor the Hart, but enhanced by livelier controls, greater precision and all this performance. Roland Beamont, a trainee pilot, describing his first flight in a Hurricane. Camm's priority was to provide the pilot with good all-round visibility. To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive [...] "hump-backed" [...] silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable [...] "stirrup" [...] mounted below the trailing edge of the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the footstep retracted into the fuselage. In addition, both wing roots were coated with strips of non-slip material.|$|E
5000|$|Heading {{directly}} {{south on}} a heading for Kings Bay, after 24 hours of increasing head winds and thick mist the Italia was only halfway back to base. The airship struggled to gain ground and {{break through to}} the zone of calmer winds which expedition meteorologist Finn Malmgren predicted was <b>just</b> <b>ahead.</b> Ice formed <b>on</b> the propellers and shot off into the envelope, necessitating running repairs. Engine speed was increased but with little effect, except for a doubling of fuel consumption. Dr Běhounek, {{in charge of the}} compass, started reporting variations in course of up to 30 degrees, and the elevator man Cecioni had similar problems maintaining control. By 07:30 on 25 May, Nobile, who had been awake for over 48 hours, knew that the situation was critical and Giuseppe Biagi, the wireless operator, sent out the message: [...] "If I don't answer, I have good reason". By dead reckoning, Nobile estimated his position as 250 mi northeast from Moffen Island. This estimate was 350 mi off.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, Magne again {{started in}} the Tour de France, in a strong French team. Magne led from the second day and his team won 19 of the 23 stages, Magne himself winning two stages, {{including}} the first time trial in the Tour de France, over 80 km from La Roche-sur-Yon to Nantes. His hopes looked over when he broke a wheel on the descent from l'Hospitalet to Ax-les-Thermes in the Pyrenees. He was rescued by the youngest rider in his team, René Vietto, who handed him his own wheel despite being in third place himself.The next day Magne again had trouble.
