25|$|In {{the recent}} years, the {{internal}} designs such as concourse, toilets and others parts were also upgraded. The duty free shops brought in international luxury branded products. As {{part of the}} development plan, the first international chain cafe, Barista Lavazza was opened in the international terminal in 2014 followed by <b>Krispy</b> <b>Kreme</b> in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Analysts {{suggested}} that Livengood had expanded the chain too rapidly after the IPO, which concentrated certain markets {{with too many}} stores. While this approach initially grew revenues and profits at the parent-company level, due to royalty payments from new franchisees, which also increased sales, this reduced the profitability of individual franchisees {{in the long run}} as they were forced to compete with one another. For the 2003-04 fiscal year, while the parent enjoyed a 15 percent increase in second-quarter revenues, same-store sales increased only a tenth of a percent during that time. By contrast, McDonald's focused on profitability at the franchise level. <b>Krispy</b> <b>Kreme</b> also had supermarkets and gas stations carry their donuts, which soon contributed up to half of the chain's sales, creating further market saturation as well as increasing competition to its franchisees. All this expansion devalued <b>Krispy</b> <b>Kreme</b> brand's novelty, by making the once-specialty donuts ubiquitous, particularly as the newer sales outlets required pre-made donuts as opposed to the ones made fresh in factory stores, which alienated brand devotees.|$|E
25|$|A new retail area, metrOasis, is now {{complete}} on {{the perimeter}} of the shopping centre.
