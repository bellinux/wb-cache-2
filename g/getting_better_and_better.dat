25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

Dylan threw {{him out of his}} limousine, saying, [...] "You're not a folksinger. You're a journalist".|$|E
500|$|Construction of the {{building}} will rely on cutting-edge technology, including the high-strength reinforced concrete and the pumps used to elevate it to record heights, similar to what was used during Burj Khalifa's construction. Bob Sinn, principal of Thornton Tomasetti states, “Concrete quality is <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better,</b> as is pumping technology. There have been very strong advances in reinforced concrete over the last 20 years." [...] He continued, [...] " [...] Tower is certainly feasible. It's not a structural challenge." ...|$|E

500|$|Rick Sanchez of IGN {{wrote that}} the pilot episode [...] "The Watchers" [...] {{demonstrated}} [...] "a huge leap in quality and style for the show that just keeps <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> by episode" [...] and that [...] "Season Two pretty much surpasses Season One in every way imaginable." [...] Sanchez gave the season an overall rating of 8 out of 10. Two episodes were nominated for the 1994 Golden Reel Awards in the One Hour Series category: [...] "The Darkness" [...] for sound editing, and [...] "The Zone" [...] for ADR editing.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{started playing}} and {{learned a few}} songs by other writers to begin with. [...] I started writing originals within a few months. [...] My songs were pretty horrendous to begin with. [...] They kept <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> [...] When I graduated, I started playing at open mics in bars in Boston. [...] Eventually {{discovered}} that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening, and not drinking and carousing while you played. [...] I got involved in that circuit. [...] I think that's why I've become so lyric conscious — because of those listening rooms, where {{you really have to}} rely on words in those situations." ...|$|E
500|$|Every year {{we change}} fewer wheels, because the {{wheels and tyres}} are <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> We changed about 20 wheels today. Five years ago, it was much worse— we'd be {{choosing}} about a hundred. Tyres are becoming much better than before. So, yes, our job is easier— except that the race generally goes faster now, so we're under a bit more pressure. Every year, there's new types of gears, new aluminium frames, new titanium frames, so it's getting more complex for us to offer neutral service. We have a list in the car of who is riding Mavic or Shimano or Campagnolo; the moment someone gets a flat tyre {{we need to think}} of a lot of things at once. Is it a titanium frame or a carbon frame or a steel frame? ...|$|E
5000|$|E. Reagan from The TV Chick {{gave the}} episode an A rating {{saying that the}} show <b>gets</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> [...] "I think they hit some amazing {{emotional}} notes today about the concepts of family and loyalty, {{and it was just}} so well done." ...|$|R

5000|$|E.Reagan from The TV Chick gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{saying that it}} was solid. [...] "Seriously, this show <b>gets</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> every week.

2500|$|Redknapp {{made even}} more {{positive}} comments regarding Bale in October 2012, stating {{that he is in}} the same class as both Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He said: [...] "He's an amazing, amazing talent and he's after the Ronaldos and Messis of this world and he's <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> He's almost unplayable when he's on his game.

2500|$|... "Maxwell has bowled {{extremely}} well, he {{is getting}} better and better," [...] said coach Mickey Arthur. [...] "One of the things we've sat down and said is {{if you want to}} be the spinning allrounder you've got to put a huge amount of time into your bowling, because Maxy would always try to bowl the miracle ball and then he'd bowl a leggie, then try a doosra, he just didn't settle on anything. All we've got him in the nets is bowling offspin, offspin, offspin. It's repetition all the time and he's <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> at it.

5000|$|Robbie Daw of Idolator {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review {{in which he}} noted the song's potential as a breakthrough in the US market.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} of the single-player mode received mixed reactions. Paul Mallinson of PC Zone {{stated that}} [...] "Mysteries Of The Sith starts off brilliantly <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> the further you <b>get</b> into it. The progressive {{nature of the}} constantly evolving storyline sees to that." [...] In contrast, Michael E. Ryan of GameSpot stated that the game is uneven and the challenging levels are only at the end. This adversely affects the gameplay by creating a steep change in how the game must be played. General aspects of the gameplay were seen as improvements, such as the artificial intelligence.|$|R
2500|$|Gouldman, in a 1995 interview, was {{philosophical}} {{about the}} album: [...] "When we finally did {{come back to}} record again, {{it was based on}} market research that our record company had done, that said a new 10cc album would do really, really well. And, ah, history has proved that wrong." [...] Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. [...] "We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs. Every day we were coming up with new ideas, and they were <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better,</b> as far as we were concerned. And they sounded like 10cc songs again." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 August 2008, Sampson {{made his}} stage {{debut in the}} West End hip-hop musical Into the Hoods. With some exceptions, he {{appeared}} in the show until it closed on 30 August.

[...] Into the Hoods played at the Novello Theatre in London and features music from popular artists such as Gorillaz, Massive Attack, Basement Jaxx and many more.

2500|$|Instead, Gun Runner's 2017 {{seasonal}} debut {{came in the}} Grade III Razorback Handicap on February 20 at Oaklawn Park.

The win cemented Gun Runner's reputation for durability, reliability and [...] "consistent class", and encouraged his connections to run him in the $10 million Dubai World Cup. [...] "He's <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> and (the Razorback) was an extremely pleasant performance, even better than anticipated," [...] said Doug Cauthen of Three Chimneys Farm.

5000|$|Allmusic critic Jose Promis {{praised the}} album and wrote [...] "Winter Light could arguably be {{classified}} as Linda Ronstadt's best pop album of the 1990s... {{there is not a}} single dud on this impeccably produced album, which, in fact, <b>gets</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> with each listening.

2500|$|Despite the fanfare, the {{expensive}} Macintosh {{was a hard}} sell. Shortly after its release in 1985, Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted [...] "a license for the Mac operating system software. Microsoft was developing its graphical user interface ... for DOS, which it was calling Windows and didn't want Apple to sue over {{the similarities between the}} Windows GUI and the Mac interface." [...] Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple. In addition, cheap IBM PC clones that ran on Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so [...] "through the late '80s, the Windows user interface was <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple." [...] Windows based IBM-PC clones also {{led to the development of}} additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM, and thus [...] "the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac...it seemed clear as the '80s wound down that Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bird {{said his}} {{victory in the}} sprint race felt [...] "fantastic", [...] "Being back in GP2 is already feeling very good, being back in the feeder series to Formula One {{is a great place}} to be. To win for RUSSIAN TIME after only four races of {{existence}} is a very good feeling." [...] He believed that he may have pushed too hard at the wrong time in the race, [...] "it was just a case of keeping it on the racing line and hoping they'd battle it out behind me. Felipe's car was like a rocket at the end. Big thanks to my new team: to win in our fourth race, with no pre-season testing, is amazing." [...] Nasr spoke about car management and maintaining the pace levels with the leaders and believed he could have won in an alternative situation, [...] "But anyway, it’s still a good result. We came here to score big points and it’s quite good to go back to Europe knowing that we have a good car, a good team. It keeps <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> I’m feeling quite confident." [...] Coletti believed his third-place finish contributed towards [...] "a good weekend" [...] for himself. He stated that entering the European leg of the season as the points leader had gave him additional motivation and hoped to be competing at the front of the field in Barcelona, [...] "We’re still a few points ahead – ten I think. But like I said, we need to score big points in Race 1 and I think that in Barcelona we’ll be in the front." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{reception}} {{for the movie}} was mostly mixed. The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stars saying that,"Emraan Hashmi & Kangana bring the Gangster magic again....they have {{done a good job}} whereas Adhyayan Suman shows promise." [...] Bollywood Hungama gave a good review saying [...] "On the whole, Raaz – The Mystery Continues is rich in the horror quotient {{and that is one of}} its major USPs, besides the highly competent performances by its principal cast and a lilting musical score. At the box-office, this one will continue the winning streak of Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt's Vishesh Films. The 4-day weekend [...] will only cement its status further. Go for it!". The lead actors were praised for their performance. In the review, [...] "On the acting front, both Emraan and Kangana vie for top honours. Emraan is excellent. He conveys a lot through facial expressions and that's the sign of a proficient actor. He's just <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> with every film. Kangana is top notch. After Fashion, this one's another power-packed performance from the actress. Adhyayan Suman is super-confident and registers a strong impact, especially towards the climax. He shows promise. Jackie Shroff is quite okay in a brief role." [...] NDTV gave negative reviews for the movie saying [...] "The first Raaz, which married the Hollywood film What Lies Beneath with the myth of Savitri who pursued Yamraj until her husband came back to life, had a cheesy appeal. This Raaz is a big bore. The scares are tired and Suri doesn't know how to pace them out. So, every minute, something awful is happening, from a bull attack to mutilation and murder. Was I scared? Not once. This mystery was better left discontinued." [...] AOL reviewer Noyon Jyoti Parasara too rated the film low. He gave the film a mere 2 out of 5 and said, [...] "Raaz – The Mystery Continues, which with all its hype was supposed scare the lights out of you, could not make me bat an eyelid out of fear. So there go all expectations!." ...|$|E

But to this they objected, declaring that the gravel was <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better,</b> {{and it would be}} well to go on down as long as the quality continued to be so good. So, at last, they put a ladder into the pit, one man carrying the gravel up in a hod, while the other dug it; and when they had gone down so deep that this was no longer practicable, they rigged up a derrick and windlass and drew up the gravel in a bucket.|$|E
60|$|Of course, we {{must now}} leave Chedcombe; {{and when we}} talked to Mr. Poplington about it {{he said there was}} two places the English went to for their rheumatism. One was Bath, not far from here, and the other was Buxton, up in the north. As soon as I heard of Bath I was on pins and needles to go there, for in all the novel-reading I've done, which has been <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> in quality since the days when I used to read dime novels on the canal-boat, up to now when I like the best there is, I could not help knowing lots about Evelina and Beau Brummel, and the Pump Room, and the fine ladies and young bucks, and it would have joyed my soul to live and move where all these people had been, and where all these things had happened, even if fictitiously.|$|E
5000|$|Lesley Savage of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review saying that [...] "How {{is it possible}} that this show gets funnier every week?
