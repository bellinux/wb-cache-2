Following {{the end of the}} Cold War, the first operations, Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991, were prompted by the Iraqi <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1990, British Airways Flight 149 {{landed at}} Kuwait International Airport four {{hours after the}} Iraqi <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The aircraft, a Boeing 747-100 G-AWND, was destroyed, and all {{passengers}} and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|RAF Uxbridge {{also became}} {{involved}} in Operation Granby following the Iraqi <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990. Personnel at Uxbridge were prepared for service in the Gulf at that time, and deployed that year in December. During the aerial assault on Iraq in January 1991, support group meetings began at the station {{for the families of}} service personnel serving during the Gulf War. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, visited one of these groups in February 1991.|$|E
50|$|In {{the biggest}} {{mobilisation}} of Australian Forces since the Vietnam War, the Government committed Australian naval {{forces to the}} 1991 Gulf War {{in support of the}} United States led coalition against the regime of Saddam Hussein, following the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> oil-rich <b>Kuwait</b> by Iraq on 2 August 1990.|$|R

5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990 by the forces of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by {{neighbouring}} Iraq in 1991, a {{total of}} eight Victor K.2s were deployed to Bahrain to provide in-flight refuelling support to RAF and other coalition aircraft during the subsequent 1991 Gulf War. RAF strike aircraft such as the Panavia Tornado would frequently {{make use of the}} tanker to refuel prior to launching cross-border strikes inside of Iraq. Shortly after the Gulf War, the remaining Victor fleet was quickly retired in 1993, at which point it had been the last of the three V-bombers in operational service; retiring nine years after the last Vulcan, although the Vulcan had survived longer in its original role as a bomber.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{was pushing}} OPEC to end {{overproduction}} and to send oil prices higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E
50|$|First {{category}} involves such {{sanctions that}} are designed to force cooperation with international law. This {{can be seen in the}} sanctions placed on Iraq in Resolution No. 661 on August 6, 1990, after the initial <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> neighboring <b>Kuwait.</b> The United Nations placed an embargo on the nation in an attempt to prevent armed conflict. Resolution 665 and Resolution 670 were further added creating both naval and air blockade on Iraq. The purpose of the initial sanctions was to coerce Iraq into following international law, which included the recognized sovereignty <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|R
25|$|As an {{international}} coalition under United States command assembled in anticipation <b>of</b> an <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iraqi-occupied <b>Kuwait,</b> the Iraqi regime decided to destroy as much <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait's</b> oil reserves and infrastructure {{as possible before}} withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from burning oil wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.|$|R
50|$|The Gulf War (2 August 1990 - 28 February 1991), codenamed Operation Desert Storm (17 January 1991 - 28 February 1991) {{was a war}} {{waged by}} {{coalition}} forces from 34 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq's <b>invasion</b> and annexation <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{was called}} to support the {{multinational}} response to the Iraqi <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on 2 August 1990. The brigade grew to a 7,700 soldier force composed of three groups, ten battalions, four separate companies, and eight detachments in support of XVIII Airborne Corps during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6,000 enemy bunkers and one million tons of munitions.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{half of all}} U.S. Apaches were {{deployed}} to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990. During Operation Desert Storm on 17 January 1991, eight AH-64As guided by four MH-53 Pave Low IIIs destroyed part of Iraq's radar network in the operation's first attack, allowing the attack aircraft to evade detection. The Apaches each carried an asymmetric load of Hydra 70 flechette rockets, Hellfires, and one auxiliary fuel tank. During the 100-hour ground war a total of 277 AH-64s took part, destroying 278 tanks, numerous armored personnel carriers and other Iraqi vehicles. One AH-64 {{was lost in the}} war, to a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) hit at close range, the Apache crashed but the crew survived.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{a member}} of the {{international}} coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team; in total about 750 personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Some ADF personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat, and a few were later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq. A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no-fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003.|$|E
50|$|Abu Ghaith first gained {{attention}} {{during the}} 1990-1991 Iraqi <b>invasion</b> and occupation <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> His sermons denouncing the occupation and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gained him {{some degree of}} popularity amongst the Kuwaiti people. The Kuwaiti government subsequently removed him from the mosque and banned him from giving sermons, and he became {{a high school teacher}} of religion.|$|R
2500|$|After Iraq's 1990 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> {{neighboring}} <b>Kuwait,</b> the 7440th Composite Wing (Provisional) assumed {{operational control}} of the 39th Tactical Group. The 7440th was the air component of Joint Task Force Proven Force, which eventually controlled 140 aircraft and opened a northern front, forcing Iraq to split its defenses {{between the north and}} the south, where the main thrust of coalition attacks originated as part of Operation [...] "Desert Storm". Following the war, Incirlik hosted [...] "Combined Task Force Provide Comfort", which oversaw Operation Provide Comfort (OPC), the effort to provide humanitarian relief to millions of Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq.|$|R
50|$|The United Nations Compensation Commission {{was created}} in 1991 as a {{subsidiary}} organ of the United Nations Security Council. Its mandate is to process claims and pay compensation for losses and damage suffered {{as a direct result}} <b>of</b> Iraq's 1990-1991 <b>invasion</b> and occupation <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> which started the Gulf War. These losses included claims for loss of property, deaths, loss of natural resources, damage to public health and environmental damage.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. He made this decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO. Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E
5|$|Following the Iraqi <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990, No.86 Wing {{prepared}} to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E

Several countries, including the USSR and China, placed arms embargoes on Iraq. NATO members were particularly critical of the Iraqi occupation <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and by late 1990, the United States had issued an ultimatum to Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait by 15 January 1991 or face war.|$|R
