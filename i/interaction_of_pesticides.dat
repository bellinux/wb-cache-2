50|$|Pesticides - Pesticides {{are still}} {{considered}} a potential factor influencing amphibian malformations (Johnson et al. 2010). However, recent investigations {{have focused on}} the <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> with parasite infection (Kiesecker 2002; Rohr et al. 2008). Field experiments indicated a link between agricultural run-off and increased infection (Kiesecker 2002). Laboratory studies further demonstrated that pesticide exposure reduced host immunocompetence against parasites as the biological mechanism (Kiesecker 2002). Furthermore, there may be a link between nutrient addition and pesticide contamination jointly leading to increased infections by simultaneously increasing exposure and suppressing host immune systems (Rohr et al. 2008a, b).|$|E
40|$|Pesticides are high-volume, widely used, {{environmental}} {{chemicals and}} there is continuous debate concerning their possible role in many chronic human health effects. Because of their known structures, known rates of application, {{and the presence of}} a large occupationally exposed population, they are not only important in their own right but are ideal models for the effects of environmental chemicals on the population in general. For reasons that are not always clear, this potential has not been realized. These exposed populations represent an underused asset {{in the study of the}} human health effects of environmental contaminants. Chronic effects thought to involve pesticides include carcinogenesis, neurotoxicity, and reproductive and development effects. In this paper we attempt to summarize this concern and, relying to a large extent on studies in our own laboratory, to indicate the importance and present status of studies of the mammalian metabolism of pesticides and indicate the need for further use of this model. Aspects considered include the role of pesticides as substrates for xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P 450 and the flavin-containing monooxygenase and their role as inducers or inhibitors of metabolic enzymes. The <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> with complex multienzyme pathways, the role of biological characteristics, particularly gender, in pesticide metabolism, and the special role of pesticides at portals of entry and in target tissues are also considered...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to {{pesticides}} {{as a consequence of}} their application in farming or their persistence in a variety of media, including food, water, air, soil, plants, animals, and smoke. The <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> with environmental factors may result in the alteration of their physicochemical properties. Square wave cathodic stripping voltammetry (SW-CSV), a technique that simulates electrodynamically the cellular membrane, is used to investigate whether the presence of potassium nitrate (KNO 3) in the culture medium interferes with the genotoxic behavior of imidacloprid. The cytokinesis block micronuclei (CBMN) method is used to evaluate imidacloprid's genotoxicity in the absence or presence of KNO 3 in the culture medium and, as a consequence, its adsorption by lymphocytes. Comparing micronuclei (MN) frequencies in control and imidacloprid-treated blood cell cultures, statistically significant differences were not detected. KNO 3 did not induce MN frequencies compared to control. Statistically significant differences in MN frequencies were observed when blood cell cultures were treated with imidacloprid in the presence of increasing concentrations of KNO 3. SW-CSV revealed that by increasing KNO 3 molarity, imidacloprid's concentration in the culture medium decreased in parallel. This finding indicates that imidacloprid is adsorbed by cellular membranes. The present study suggests a novel role of a harmless environmental factor, such as KNO 3, on the genotoxic behavior of a pesticide, such as imidacloprid. KNO 3 rendered imidacloprid permeable to lymphocytes, resulting in elevated MN frequencies...|$|E

40|$|On-farm biopurification {{systems were}} {{developed}} to remove pesticides from contaminated water generated at the farmyard. An important process in the system's efficiency is the sorption of pesticides to the substrates used in the biopurification systems. The composition and type of material present in the biobed are crucial for retention of chemicals. This study investigated the sorption of linuron, isoproturon, metalaxyl, isoxaben, bentazon and lenacil on substrates commonly used in a biopurification system, i. e. cow manure, straw, willow chopping, soil, coconut chips, garden waste compost, and peat mix. Linear, Freundlich. and Langmuir sorption isotherms were fitted to the obtained data. The best fit was obtained with the Freundlich model. More immobile pesticides (i. e. linuron and isoxaben) tended to associate with the organic substrate, while more mobile pesticides partition in the water (i. e. bentazon). According to sorption capacity, the substrates {{could be classified as}} peat mix > compost, coco chips, straw > cow manure, willow chopping > sandy loam soil. Sorption capacity was positively correlated with the organic carbon content, CaO and the cation exchange capacity. Furthermore, no significant differences in sorption could be found between technical and formulated isoproturon and bentazon, Moreover, the individual sorption coefficient K-d was additive, which means that individual sorption coefficients can be used to calculate the sorption coefficients of a mixture of substrates. What concerns the mutual <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> it could be observed that the sorption of linuron and metalaxyl was significantly lower in combination with isoproturon and bentazon, while the latter pesticides were not influenced by the presence of linuron and metalaxyl. As guidelines, firstly, it could be stated that using the most sorbing materials such as peat mix, might significantly increase the biopurification systems efficiency. Secondly, the treatment of very mobile pesticides, such as bentazon, should be taken with care as these will easily leach through the system. Additional chemical treatment might be necessary for these type of pesticides. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Surfactants are solubilising {{agents that}} are {{commonly}} used in householdand industrial applications. A large fraction of surfactants used is emitted to wastewater they can reach the soil through wastewater irrigation or applications of sewage sludge and pesticides. Surfactants are relatively harmless in the soil ecosystem since they are readily degradable and have low toxicity. However, surfactants can facilitate the mobility of different contaminants in soil, and this indirect risk of surfactants on groundwater contamination prompted this study. The aim of this soil chemical study is to evaluate the effects {{of different types of}} surfactant on mobility of four organophosphorous pesticides and of the trace metals Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn. Surfactants assayed through this thesis were selected as representative of compounds used in agriculture, i. e. their presence in pesticide formulations or their presence in sludge and wastewater. Sorption and desorption of organophosphorous pesticides were measured in the presence of different surfactants (cationic, anionic and non-ionic) through batch assays in 9 different Mediterranean soils. The presence of a cationic surfactant increased pesticide retention in soils more than 100 times for the most hydrophobic compound, and this increase was most pronounced in soils with high CEC values, suggesting that sorption of the cationic surfactant promotes pesticide binding at the hydrophobic moiety of the surfactant. Addition of non-ionic and anionic surfactants increased or decreased the pesticide retention in soil, depending on soil characteristics and type of pesticide, with a factor of 2 at most. A degradation experiment of the same organophosphorous pesticides in a Mediterranean soil in the presence of three different surfactants (cationic, anionic and non-ionic) or wastewater showed that the non-ionic surfactant enhanced degradation rates for all the pesticides except the mosthydrophobic and at high cationic surfactant concentration, pesticide half lives were increased 3  10 times, {{and in the case of}} the most hydrophobic compound (diazinon), circa 55 % of the added concentration was still recovered in the soil after 4 months of incubation. These results indicate that increased pesticide sorption in presence of cationic surfactantsdiminishes the availability of pesticides to microorganisms, thus decreasing biological degradation. The effect of surfactants on trace metal solubility was studied in short-term (24 h) batch experiments or in a long-term (1 70 days) incubationexperiment with a collection of 8 soils and different surfactants. Submicellar concentrations of cationic surfactants decreased trace metal solubility about 5 20 %, while submicellar concentrations of anionic surfactants increased metal solubility by 30 % at most. Cationic surfactants decreased the concentrations of dissolved soil organic matter, likely by promoting sorption of the hydrophobic matter. In contrast, anionic surfactant increased the soil organic matter solubility by reducing soluble Ca 2 + that acts as a coagulant for organic matter. The changes in soluble soil organic matter statistically explained surfactant effects and this was confirmed by speciation calculations. Above the critical micelle concentration, the increase in metal solubility was up to 100 -fold and was largely related to the relative increase in soil organic matter solubilitythat was pronounced at these high surfactant concentrations due to micellar solubilization. Effects of irrigation with A 22 on metal leaching were assessed in column experiments at two flow rates and at different surfactant concentrations. Leaching with A 22 increased copper (Cu) concentration in the leachates up to three times compared to the control treatment and Cu was not mobilised by complexation with the surfactant, but indirectly through solubilisation of soil organic matter. The solubilisation of soil organic matter is likely related to the precipitation of A 22 with Ca 2 + ions. The solution Ca concentration at the highest A 22 dose was only half of that in the control, which likely resulted in solubilization of humic substances, thereby facilitating leaching of soil DOC and associated Cu ions. Overall, the most significant effects are, in general, the enhancement of hydrophobic pesticides retention by cationic surfactants and the increased solubilisation of organic matter and resulting mobility of trace metals by anionic surfactants.

The review is divided into chapters {{on each of the}} techniques mentioned. As far as extraction techniques are concerned there are two categories: bulk extractions and sequential extraction methods. A humin extraction method was also found. Purification methods are numerous and it seems that purification is always necessary to make functional groups accessible to the reagents used in subsequent characterization steps. Fractionation techniques are all more or less based on the chromatography principle and can be divided into the following categories: fractionation based on differences in molecular size, chemical properties, and mobility in electrical fields. In the field of characterization techniques two divisions can be made: spectroscopial methods (E 4 /E 6 ratio, PYGCMS, IR, NMR etc.) and chemical methods (functional group titration).

40|$|Sorption-desorption <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> with soil {{determine}} their availability for transport, plant uptake, and microbial degradation.

This research evaluated changes in sorption/availability of nicosulfuron (2 -[[[[(4, 6 -dimethoxy- 2 -pyrimidinyl]aminolcarbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-N,N-dimethyl- 3 -pyridinecarboxamide) herbicide with aging in different soils, using a radiolabeled (C- 14) tracer. Aging significantly increased sorption. For instance, after the 41 -day incubation, calculated K-d,K-app increased by a factor of 2 to 3 in Mollisols from the Midwestern United States and by a factor of 5 to 9 in Oxisols from Brazil and Hawaii, as compared to freshly treated soils. In view of this outcome, potential transport of nicosulfuron would be overpredicted if freshly treated soil Kd values were used to predict transport. The fact that the nicosulfuron solution concentration decreased faster than the soil concentration with time suggested that the increase in sorption was because the rate of degradation in solution and on labile sites was faster than the rate of desorption of the neutral species from the soil particles. It may have also been due to nicosulfuron anion diffusion to less accessible sites with time, leaving the more strongly bound neutral molecules for the sorption characterization.

The overall conclusion is that BEEHAVE performs well in modelling honeybee colony dynamics, and the supporting documentation is generally good but does not fully meet the criteria of the good modelling opinion. BEEHAVE is not yet usable in a regulatory context primarily because it needs a pesticide module.

Microscopic insights and next-generation sequencing combined with bioinformatics allow us now to identify new functions and <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> plant-associated bacteria and perceive plants as meta-organisms. Host symbiotic, rhizo-epiphytic, endophytic microorganisms and their functions on plants have not been studied yet in accordance with uptake, tanslocation and action <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Root tips exudates mediated by rhizobacteria could modify the uptake <b>of</b> specific <b>pesticides</b> while bacterial ligands and enzymes can affect metabolism and fate <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> within plant.

40|$|The binding <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide</b> Isoprocarb and its {{degradation}} product, sodium 2 -isopropylphenate, with {{bovine serum}} albumin (BSA) was studied by spectrofluorimetry under simulated physiological conditions. Both Isoprocarb and sodium 2 -isopropylphenate quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA. This quenching proceeded via a static mechanism. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔH°, ΔS° and ΔG°) {{obtained from the}} fluorescence data measured at two different temperatures showed that the binding of Isoprocarb to BSA involved hydrogen bonds and that of sodium 2 -isopropylphenate to BSA involved hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy <b>of</b> the <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> BSA with either Isoprocarb or sodium 2 -isopropylphenate showed that the molecular structure of the BSA was changed significantly, {{which is consistent with}} the known toxicity <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide,</b> i. e., the protein is denatured. The sodium 2 -isopropylphenate, was estimated to be about 4 – 5 times more toxic than its parent, Isoprocarb. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and the resolution of the three-way excitation–emission fluorescence spectra by the PARAFAC method extracted the relative concentration profiles of BSA, Isoprocab and sodium 2 -isopropylphenate {{as a function of the}} added sodium 2 -isopropylphenate.

40|$|This study {{defined the}} ability of a large sample <b>of</b> {{heterogeneous}} <b>pesticides</b> and neurotoxins to interact with the [3 H]tyramine-labelled vesicular transporter of dopamine in rat striatum. Botanical (with rotenone as the most potent), and organochlorine (Kepone) insecticides, as well as fungicides (Zineb), as a whole, consistently inhibited [3 H]tyramine binding, with Ki values ranging from 5 nM to 10 microM. ATP/Mg(2 +) -dependent [3 H]tyramine uptake to purified striatal synaptic vesicles was also inhibited by rotenone. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, and miscellaneous herbicides poorly antagonized [3 H]tyramine binding, yielding Ki values exceeding 10 microM. Several, though not all, of the best recognized central neurotoxins tested were major binding antagonists. Their rank order of potency was 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) > trimethyltin > or = 6 -hydroxydopamine > N-(2 -chloroethyl) -N-ethyl- 2 -bromobenzylamine (DSP- 4) > 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), with Ki values ranging from 35 nM to 3 microM. Overall, the potent <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> selected <b>pesticides</b> and chemicals with the vesicular transporter for dopamine, although, by itself, not synonymous with neurotoxicity, would argue for a likely impairment of transmitter homeostasis, or the putative formation of neurodegenerative toxin pools...|$|R
40|$|Studying <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> {{multiple}} <b>pesticides</b> applied {{simultaneously in}} a mixture is a common task in phytopathology. Statistical methods are employed to test whether the treatment components influence each other's efficacy in a promotive or inhibitory way (synergistic or antagonistic interaction) or rather act independent of one another (additivity). The trouble is that widely used procedures based on chi-square tests are often seriously flawed, either because people apply them in a preposterous way or because the method simply does not fit the problem at hand. Browsing recent volumes of entomological journals, we found that numerous researchers have (in all likelihood unwittingly) analysed their data {{as if they had}} had a sample size of 100 or, equally bad, a sample size of one!

40|$|The EU risk {{assessment}} <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> for aquatic organisms relates measured effect data to exposure values obtained from model predictions. The FOCUS exposure models provide Predicted Environmental Concentrations in surface waters. Calculations use realistic worst-case scenarios, based on representative agricultural conditions. Pesticide input via spray drift, runoff or drain flow results in exposure patterns in a time-variable scale. Standard toxicity tests and effect data {{are based on}} the assumption of a single exposure event into a static water body. Relating the results of these standard tests to FOCUS time-variable exposure patterns is only possible by gross simplifications and the use of overly conservative worst-case assumptions. The topic on how to relate pulsed exposure patterns to simple exposure assumptions is discussed since the inclusion of the FOCUS scenarios in the EU {{risk assessment}} <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Population-level effects and time-to-recovery after time-variable exposure need to be considered for more realistic, but still conservative risk assessments. One way forward is the use of population models within the higher-tier risk assessment, in close combination with ecotoxicological experiments. Out of the multitude <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and aquatic non-target organisms, the example of herbicides and algae was chosen for this work. This work aimed to develop and test a new approach to assess the effects of time-variable exposure on algae. This approach comprised the close combination of ecotoxicological experiments and population modelling. It involved the development of an algae model including all necessary steps for verification and validation as well the performance of laboratory experiments. A mechanistic compartment model, SAM-X (Simple Algae Model EXtended), was developed. This model describes population dynamics of the four different algae species under static as well as under continuous culture conditions. The experimental approach of this work was the development and application of a flow-through system for the continuous culture of algae. Thereby, the exposure of algae populations to a pesticide could be investigated in a time-variable scale. This setup was based on the Chemostat principle, which allowed a continuous operation in a stable manner without the need of external influence. The results of this work confirm the proposals available in literature to use flow-through systems as appropriate higher-tier tools to assess effects of complex toxicant exposure to algae. The algae model proved its capability to simulate effects on population growth and times to recovery after time-variable exposure of toxicants. Moreover, the results support the use of the algae model as a predictive tool to assess effects <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> on population level. Thus, an implementation of the model as an inherent part <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide</b> risk assessment would be an asset. The usefulness of the combined approach was confirmed by the results, as not only the experiments offered detailed information on population-level effects after pesticide exposure, also the model application showed practical advantages: It can be applied for designing and improving the flow-through study as a first step, to describe the results as a second step, and thirdly, to extrapolate to different exposure scenarios to predict effects on the algae populations. In summary, this work demonstrated an excellent option to represent pulsed exposure <b>of</b> a <b>pesticide</b> and corresponding effects on algae a bit closer to reality. The conclusive results of the combined approach confirm the beneficial use of population models as supporting tools in higher-tier risk assessment of aquatic toxicants...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{glyphosate}} (GPS) adsorption {{on three}} soils of different characteristics {{show that the}} <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> this <b>pesticide</b> with the soils {{was not related to}} their CEC and clay minerals content, but to the content of iron and aluminum amorphous oxides and organic matter. The presence of Cu in treatment solutions enhanced GPS adsorption, due to several reasons: GPS coordinates strongly to Cu, and Cu-GPS complexes formed seem to have higher ability to be adsorbed on the soil than free GPS; GPS adsorption can take place on sites where Cu was previously adsorbed, acting as a bridge between the soil and GPS; when Cu was present the solution pH decreased, and GPs adsorption increased, since lower pHs lead to the formation of GPS species with lower negative charge, which are adsorbed more easily on the negatively charged soil surfaces.

40|$|Abstract Risk {{assessment}} of chemicals needs reliable scientific information and {{one source of}} information is the characterization of the metabolic fate and toxicokinetics of a chemical. Metabolism is often {{the most important factor}} contributing to toxicokinetics. Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes are a superfamily of microsomal proteins playing a pivotal role in xenobiotic metabolism. In the present study, pesticides were used as representative xenobiotics since exposure to pesticides is a global challenge to risk assessment. Human and animal in vitro hepatic models were applied with the advantage of novel analytical techniques (LC/TOF-MS and LC/MS-MS) to elucidate the in vitro metabolism and <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> selected <b>pesticides.</b> The results <b>of</b> these studies demonstrate that CYP enzymes catalyze the bioactivation of profenofos, diuron and carbosulfan into their more toxic metabolites desthiopropylprofenofos, N-demethyldiuron and carbofuran, respectively. The suspected carcinogenic metabolite of metalaxyl, 2, 6 -dimethylaniline, was not detected. CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 19 activities may be important in determining the toxicity arising from exposure to profenofos and carbosulfan. Individuals with high CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 C 19 activities might be more susceptible to diuron toxicity. Qualitative results of in vitro metabolism were generally in agreement with the results obtained from the published in vivo data, at least for the active chemical moiety and major metabolites. Considerable differences in the quantities of the metabolites produced within the species, {{as well as in the}} ratios of the metabolites among the species, were observed. These findings illustrate that in vitro screening of qualitative and quantitative differences are needed to provide a firm basis for interspecies and in vitro-in vivo extrapolations. Based on our findings, in vitro-in vivo extrapolation based on the elucidation of the in vitro metabolic pattern <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in human and animal hepatic models could be a good model for understanding and extending the results <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> metabolism studies to human health risk assessment...|$|R
