The importance of large scale data for visibility analyses {{on the local}} scale, where the detail of the surface model is the most defining factor, is described. The focus {{is not only the}} classic Boolean visibility, that is usually determined within GIS, but also on so called extended viewsheds that aims to provide more information about visibility. The case study with examples <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> analyses was performed on river Opava, near the Ostrava city (Czech Republic). The multiple Boolean viewshed analysis and global horizon viewshed were calculated to determine most prominent features and <b>visibility</b> barriers <b>of</b> the surface. Besides that, the extended viewshed showing angle difference above the local horizon, which describes angular height of the target area above the barrier, is shown. The case study proved that large scale models are appropriate data source for visibility analyses on local level.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} enigmatic megalithic {{buildings}} of Italy is the structure which lies on the S. Erasmo hill near Cesi, in Umbria, a huge complex encompassing an area of around 8000 square meters and enclosed by refined cyclopean walls. Although its date is uncertain, suggested dates comprise the Iron Age and archaic period, down to the third century B. C. The building’s function is also uncertain. Usually identified as a fortified structure, in fact there is a megalithic platform {{at the southern end}} of the enclosure which could have served as foundation of a temple or palace and, from the top of Monte Torre Maggiore, a complex of temples dating from the fourth century B. C. overlooks the hill. Similar combinations of megalithic buildings resting half-way to temples placed on high peaks are known to exist. In order to clarify the function of this structure and its position in relation to the surrounding landscape, with particular attention to its visibility and to the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> from the complex, as well as to the possible astronomical alignments, we present a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of the S. Erasmo complex, which includes the mapping of the sky at the various possible epochs of construction, the creation of a digital model of the landscape in forms of digital maps using Geographic Information System technologies, and a 3 D model using various 3 D software packages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} a computationally and memory efficient algorithm for radio frequency (RF) source-seeking with a single-wing rotating {{micro air vehicle}} (MAV) operating in an urban canyon environment. We present an algorithm that overcomes two significant difficulties of operating in an urban canyon environment. First, Global Positioning System (GPS) localization quality can be degraded {{due to the lack}} of clear line of sight to a sufficient number of GPS satellites. Second, the spatial RF field is complex due to multipath reflections leading to multiple maxima and minima in received signal strength (RSS). High quality GPS localization is maintained by observing the GPS signal to noise ratio (SNR) to each satellite and making inferences about <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> high GPS <b>visibility</b> (allowable) and <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> low GPS <b>visibility</b> (forbidden). To avoid local maxima in RSS due to multipath reflections we exploit the rotation of the MAV and the directionality of its RF antenna to derive estimates of the angle of arrival (AOA) at each rotation. Under mild assumptions on the noise associated with the AOA measurements, a greedy algorithm is shown to exhibit a global recurrence property. Simulations supplied with actual GPS SNR measurements indicate that this algorithm reliably finds the RF source while maintaining an acceptable level <b>of</b> GPS <b>visibility.</b> Additionally, outdoor experiments using Lockheed Martin’s Samarai MAV demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for static source-seeking in an urban canyon environment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explains how}} the politics <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> affect relations among {{states and the}} political power of marginalized people within them. I show that the key to understanding processes of social change lies in a closer examination of the ways in which-and the degree to which-marginalized groups make governments and societies see and interact with their ideas. Specifically, I explore the politics of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) visibility. For a group that many obse rvers have referred to as "an invisible minority," the newfound presence and influence of LGBT people in many different nation states offers fresh opportunities for the study of socio-political change and the diffusion of norms. Despite similar international pressures, why are the trajectories of socio-legal recognition for marginalized groups so different across states? This question is not answered by conventional explanations of diffusion and social change focusing on differences in international pressures, the fit between domestic and international norms, modernization, or low implementation costs. Instead, specific transnational and international channels and domestic interest groups can make visible political issues that were hidden, and it is that visibility that creates the political resonance of international norms in domestic politics, and can lead to their gradual internalization. A state's openness to international organizations and information flows has demonstrable effects on norm diffusion. It affects the ability of new ideas to enter domestic discourse. Furthermore, the degree to which domestic actors are embedded in transnational advocacy networks illuminates the issue and shapes the speed and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> diffusion. <b>Visibility</b> has engendered the interactions between movements and states that empower people-mobilizing actors to demand change, influencing the spread of new legal standards, and weaving new ideas into the fabrics of societies. It is this process of "coming out" that leads to the socio-political recognition of rights that alters the situation for such groups. Ultimately, the politics <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> is located at the intersection of international relations and social movement politics. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R

We have used Cristina Bicchieris theories about social and descriptive norms and Pelle Guldborg Hansens theory about ‘common knowledge’ to complete our understanding of this behavioural topic. This has pointed us in a <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> designing a <b>visibility</b> based nudge that activates the human cognitive reflection system.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between development policy and security policy has undergone rapid changes {{over a period}} of only a few years. In Germany, as well as other donor countries, there was in the past a clearly recogniz-able distance between development actors and military actors and between their respective tasks. This distance is shrinking. The new debate is impor-tant for many developing countries and regions (e. g. Afghanistan), but is especially relevant to sub-Saharan Africa. Peace and security are {{at the top of the}} agenda for Africa. While they have been recognized in the past as among the most urgent challenges facing the continent, they have not previously gained the marked profile they are now assuming as a political priority for practical policy approaches and efforts both in and outside Africa. The basic parameters involved have shifted in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> greater <b>visibility</b> and a heightened political will to act. The African Union (AU), created in 2002, is most important for this new situation. However, the new peace and security architecture faces a number of challenges. Although the AU's ownership approach to peace and security is fundamentally correct, it contrasts sharply with African funding and implementation capacities. Ultimately, the AU will prove to be effective only if the relevant donors are prepared to support, and above all to fund, its policies. Interfaces between development policy and security policy are not a phe-nomenon confined to Germany. The UN, for example, is increasingly interested in conducting comprehensive peace missions in Africa. Inte-grated missions with civil and military components were first undertaken in Sierra Leone.

40|$|Navigation can {{be studied}} in a graph-structured {{framework}} in which the navigating agent (which we shall assume to be a point robot) moves from node to node of a "graph space". The robot can locate itself {{by the presence of}} distinctively labeled "landmark" nodes in the graph space. For a robot navigating in Euclidean space, visual detection of a distinctive landmark provides information about the direction to the landmark, and allows the robot to determine its position by triangulation. On a graph, however, there is neither the concept <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> nor that <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> Instead, we shall assume that a robot navigating on a graph can sense the distances to a set of landmarks. Evidently, if the robot knows its distances to a sufficiently large set of landmarks, its position on the graph is uniquely determined. This suggests the following problem: given a graph, what are the fewest number of landmarks needed, and where should they be located, so that the distances to the landmarks uniquely determine the robot's position on the graph? This is actually a classical problem about metric spaces. A minimum set of landmarks which uniquely determine the robot's position is called a "metric basis", and the minimum number of landmarks is called the "metric dimension" of the graph. In this paper we present some results about this problem. Our main new result is that the metric dimension can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of O(n); we also establish some properties of graphs with metric dimension 2.

Road segments running in along-track direction are higher evaluated in contrast to road segments running in across track. The proposed fusion technique is demonstrated on a sub-urban SAR scene. The scene is viewed by three different aspect angles.
