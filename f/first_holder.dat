5|$|In 1969, The Beast {{became the}} <b>first</b> <b>holder</b> of the IW North American Heavyweight Championship. On August 5, he gained a second title when he teamed {{with his brother}} Rudy Kay to defeat The Fabulous Kangaroos (Al Costello and Don Kent) to win the ESA International Tag Team Championship. Three weeks later, he dropped the North American title to The Stomper (Archie Gouldie), who became his {{longtime}} rival. He then began competing for the Amarillo, Texas-based territory of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He won the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship and held it for several months before losing it in a match against Ricky Romero on February 2, 1970.|$|E
5|$|Puw's works include {{pieces for}} unusual {{combinations}} of instruments, {{such as a}} tuba quartet or a trio consisting of harp, cello and double-bass, {{as well as more}} traditional forces such as solo baritone and piano, choir or orchestra. He was associated with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales as its Resident Composer, the <b>first</b> <b>holder</b> of this title, from 2006 to 2010. Puw wrote an Oboe concerto as part of this association, and his latest composition for the orchestra was premiered at the 2007 Proms. Puw's own Welsh identity is a recurrent theme in his music: some of his pieces set Welsh-language poetry to music and one of his pieces, Reservoirs, is written about the flooding of Welsh valleys to provide water for England.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} impacts of the {{revolution}} in Zanzibar was to break {{the power of the}} Arab/Asian ruling class, who had held it for around 200 years. Despite the merger with Tanganyika, Zanzibar retained a Revolutionary Council and House of Representatives which was, until 1992, run on a one-party system and has power over domestic matters. The domestic government is led by the President of Zanzibar, Karume being the <b>first</b> <b>holder</b> of this office. This government used the success of the revolution to implement reforms across the island. Many of these involved the removal of power from Arabs. The Zanzibar civil service, for example, became an almost entirely African organisation, and land was redistributed from Arabs to Africans. The revolutionary government also instituted social reforms such as free healthcare and opening up the education system to African students (who had occupied only 12% of secondary school places before the revolution).|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford in England dates from 1634, {{when it was}} established by new statutes for the university brought in by William Laud (Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of the University). The <b>first</b> <b>holder</b> of the post was Brian Twyne, who prepared an index of the archives in 1631 {{as part of the}} preparatory work for the statutes: he was appointed Keeper of the Archives as a reward for his work. The archives were moved from the University Church of St Mary the Virgin into the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library under Twyne and his successor, and some of the storage cupboards built at that time are still in use. The archives include charters, title deeds, university registers and records, and other official documentation from the university (but not from the colleges of the university, which keep their own archives). Most of the material dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with few photographs and no sound or video recordings.|$|E

25|$|The {{title was}} created in 1388 for the future Henry III of Castile and Catherine of Lancaster. A part of the pact ("Accord of Bayonne") was to grant the young couple the title of Prince and Princess of Asturias, which was {{modelled}} after that of Prince of Wales in the Kingdom of England. The title was {{to belong to the}} official successor of the Castilian throne. Thus the <b>first</b> <b>holder</b> of the princedom was the young Henry of Castile and the first woman to hold the title by marriage was his wife, Catherine of Lancaster.|$|E

25|$|In 1856 he {{was elected}} to the first {{parliament}} under responsible government as the member for Cook and Westmoreland. He subsequently represented East Sydney, Orange, Tumut, Monaro, Lachlan and East Macquarie. In August 1856 he was made Attorney-General of New South Wales in the first ministry of Charles Cowper. The appointment was controversial, as Martin was the <b>first</b> <b>holder</b> of the post not to be a qualified barrister. The appointment was brief, as the government was defeated in a no-confidence motion in October 1856 and Martin returned to the backbench.|$|E
25|$|In November 1781, he {{was elected}} as President of the United States in Congress Assembled, {{and became the first}} {{president}} (third overall) to serve a one-year term under the provisions of the Articles of Confederation.

25|$|Although Whitehead did {{not teach}} very often, he was {{respected}} by those whom he did educate and his ward classes attracted good attendances.

He resigned the Chair {{at the time of}} his retirement from the MRI, believing that to be in the best interests of the university's medical college. It was announced in January 1905 that he had been elected to the Court of Governors of the university and, later in the year, also became a member of its Council. He remained a Governor after resigning from the Council in 1909.|$|E
25|$|Flair {{is officially}} {{recognized}} by WWE and Pro Wrestling Illustrated (PWI) as a 16-time world champion (eight-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, six-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, and two-time WWF Champion), although {{the actual number}} of his world championship reigns varies by source, ranging from 16 to 25. He considers himself a 21-time champion. He was the <b>first</b> <b>holder</b> of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship (which he also held last). As the inaugural WCW World Heavyweight Champion, he became the first person to complete WCW's Triple Crown, having already held the United States Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships. He then completed WWE's version of the Triple Crown when he won the Intercontinental Championship, after already holding the WWF Championship and the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
25|$|The officer {{commanding}} the Army of India was the Commander-in-Chief, India who {{reported to the}} civilian Governor-General of India. The title was used before {{the creation of a}} unified British Indian Army; the <b>first</b> <b>holder</b> was Major General Stringer Lawrence in 1748. By the early 1900s the Commander-in-Chief and his staff were based at GHQ India. Indian Army postings were less prestigious than British Army positions, but the pay was significantly greater so that officers could live on their salaries instead of having to have a private income. Accordingly, vacancies in the Indian Army were much sought after and generally reserved for the higher placed officer-cadets graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. British officers in the Indian Army were expected to learn to speak the Indian languages of their men, who tended to be recruited from primarily Hindi speaking areas. Prominent British Indian Army officers included Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood, Claude Auchinleck and William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim.|$|E
