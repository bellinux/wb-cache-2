40|$|Theoretical {{equations}} {{are derived}} and analytical procedures are presented for {{the interpretation of}} experimental measurements of large plastic strains in {{the surface of a}} plate. Orthogonal gage lengths established on the metal surface are measured before and after deformation. The change in orthogonality after deformation is also measured. Equations yield the principal strains, deviatoric stresses in the absence of surface friction forces, true stresses if the stress normal to the surface is known, and the orientation angle between the deformed <b>gage</b> <b>line</b> and the principal stress-strain axes. Errors in the measurement of nominal strains greater than 3 percent are within engineering accuracy. Applications suggested for this strain measurement system include the large-strain-stress analysis of impact test models, burst tests of spherical or cylindrical pressure vessels, and to augment small-strain instrumentation tests where large strains are anticipated...|$|E

The main {{requirement of the}} machine is to achieve a flexibility to calibrate {{a variety of different}} standards such as step <b>gages,</b> <b>line</b> scales and gauge blocks with high accuracy. The main parts of the system are a precision linear stage, an alignment system for the specimen, a system for detecting measurement points, and a laser interferometer.

40|$|Compressive {{tests were}} made of two series of {{stiffened}} circular cylindrical shells under axial load. All the shells were 16 inches in diameter by 24 inches in length and {{were made of}} aluminum-alloy sheet curved to the proper radius and welded with one longitudinal weld. The ratios of diameter to thickness of shell wall in the two series of specimens were 258 and 572. Strains were measured with Huggenberger tensometers {{at a number of}} <b>gage</b> <b>lines</b> on the stiffeners and shell. The results of these tests indicate that a spacing of circumferential stiffeners equal to 0. 67 times the radius is too great to strengthen the shell wall appreciably. The results are not inclusive enough to show the optimum in stiffeners. Plain cylinders without stiffeners developed ultimate strengths approximately half as great as the buckling strengths computed by the equation resulting from the classical theory and slightly greater than those computed by Donnell's large deflection theory...|$|R

In Boston proper, four hills were quickly fortified. They were to be the main defense of the city. Over time, each of these hills were strengthened. Gage also decided to abandon Charlestown, removing the beleaguered forces (that had retreated from Concord) to Boston. [...] The town of Charlestown itself was entirely vacant, and the high lands of Charlestown (Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill) were left undefended, as were the heights of Dorchester, which had a commanding view of the harbor and the city.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: As sensors become {{integrated}} in more applications, interest in magnetostrictive sensor technology has blossomed. Magnetostrictive sensors {{take advantage of}} the efficient coupling between the elastic and magnetic states of a material to facilitate sensing a quantity of interest. Magnetic and magnetostrictive theory pertinent to magnetostrictive sensor technology is provided. Sensing configurations are based on the utilization of a magnetostrictive element in a passive, active, or combined mode. Magnetostrictive sensor configurations that measure motion, stress or force, torque, magnetic fields, target characteristics, and miscellaneous effects are discussed. The configurations are compared and contrasted in terms of application, sensitivity, and implementation issues. Comparisons are made to other common sensor configurations as appropriate. Experimental and modeling results are described when available and schematics of the configurations are presented.

Article present results of susceptibility to cracking, on medium carbon mechanically capped (MCD), and silicon semi-killed (SSK) grades of hot rolled Q_BOP steel in gages up to 0. 5 " (12. 5 mm), shipped as coils or plates, processed through the heavy <b>gage</b> shear <b>line</b> (HGSL) or Temper Mill. SAMPLING PROCEDURE To characterize steel susceptibility to cracking, samples of processed plates were collected from the outside, inside and middle wrap of the processed coils. "Hard way " test coupons (long axis of samples is parallel to the rolling direction) were made in accordance to the General Requirements for Steel, Sheet, Carbon, and High Strength, Low-Alloy, Hot-Rolled grades of steel (ASTM A 568 /A 56 SH- 91 a) [4, 5, 6]. The 100 -ton hydraulic press was used for bending the specimen. Samples were bent ‘flat-on-self, or until crack appeared on the upper bent surface. The maximum diameter of the bend at the point of cracking for each specimen measured, and then DT_RATIO (the bend diameter / coil gage- 0 is the best), were calculated, as a measure of the bendability. Two samples of each bent coupon, representing the edge and quarter location across the coil width, analyzed for steel cleanliness. Steel cleanliness rated in accordance with Method A, ASTM E- 45. The cleanest rating being one, and the dirtiest being five. The table 1 shows number of tested samples by product type...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{performed}} {{in support of the}} engineering development of the NASA X- 38 Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) system. Wind tunnel experiments were used to visualize various aerodynamic phenomena encountered by the CRV during the final stages of descent and landing. Scale models of the CRV were used to visualize vortex structures above and below the vehicle, and in its wake, and to quantify their trajectories. The effect of flaperon deflection on these structures was studied. The structure and dynamics of the CRV's wake during the drag parachute deployment stage were measured. Regions of high vorticity were identified using surveys conducted in several planes using a vortex meter. Periodic shedding of the vortex sheets from the sides of the CRV was observed using laser sheet videography as the CRV reached high angles of attack during the quasi-steady pitch-up prior to parafoil deployment. Using spectral analysis of hot-film anemometer data, the Strouhal number of these wake fluctuations was found to be 0. 14 based on the model span. Phenomena encountered in flight test during parafoil operation were captured in scale-model tests, and a video photogrammetry technique was implemented to obtain parafoil surface shapes during flight in the tunnel. Forces on the parafoil were resolved using tension <b>gages</b> on individual <b>lines.</b> The temporal evolution of the phenomenon of leading edge collapse was captured. Laser velocimetry was used to demonstrate measurement of the porosity of the parafoil surface. From these measurements, several physical explanations have been developed for phenomena observed at various stages of the X- 38 development program. Quantitative measurement capabilities have also been demonstrated for continued refinement of the aerodynamic technologies employed in the X- 38 project. Detailed results from these studies are given in an AIAA Paper, two slide presentations, and other material which are given on a Web-based archival resource.
