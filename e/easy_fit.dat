500|$|Mars {{possesses}} a three octave tenor vocal range. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented {{that he is}} one of the most [...] "versatile and accessible singers in pop, with a light, soul-influenced voice that's an <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> in a range of styles, a universal donor", while Tim Sendra from AllMusic described Mars' vocals on Doo-Wops & Hooligans as [...] "the kind of smooth instrument that slips into your ear like honey." [...] Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone called Mars a [...] "nimble, soulful vocalist" [...] on Unorthodox Jukebox. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News praised Mars' voice due to [...] "the purity, cream and range of mid-period Michael Jackson" [...] in a review of a concert promoting Unorthodox Jukebox. Mars is also able to play drums, guitar, keyboard, bass, and piano. Mars usually plays the instrumentation or part of it, on his albums and on the songs he composes for other artists.|$|E
60|$|Ned cast {{a single}} glance backward, and beheld the people pushing and {{buffeting}} his uncle {{in a most}} unceremonious manner. His helmet was knocked down over his eyes, and the coat--so much too small for him--was rendered an <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> by being ripped up behind to the neck. Ned could not stand this. He was stout of limb and bold as a lion, although not naturally addicted to fighting, so he turned suddenly round and flew to the rescue. Plunging into {{the midst of the}} struggling mass of golden creatures, Ned hit out right and left like a young Hercules, and his blows rang upon their metal chests and noses like the sound of sledge-hammers, but without any other effect.|$|E
60|$|The {{warmth of}} the big stove, which glowed a dull red in places, had melted holes in the frost that {{obscured}} the double windows of Davies' office, but icy draughts flowed round the room, and {{the temperature of the}} passage outside was down to zero. From where the stove-pipe pierced the wall, drops of a black distillate trickled down, and the office was filled with the smell of tar and hot iron. Rents gaped in the pine paneling, and the door had shrunk to a remarkably <b>easy</b> <b>fit.</b> The building was new, pretentious, and supposed to be centrally heated, but Winnipeg was then passing through the transition stage which occurs in the history of most Western towns: emerging from rude disorder with bold but badly guided striving toward beauty and symmetry. Civic ambition was poorly seconded by builder's skill, and the plans of aspiring architects were crudely materialized.|$|E

6000|$|Now {{there was}} another early waking on that fine morning, though not quite so early as the one just described. Master Junkie Brook, lying in a packing-box, which served as an extempore crib, in the cottage of Kenneth McTavish, opened his large round eyes and rubbed them. Getting up, he {{observed}} that Mrs Scholtz was sound asleep, and quietly dressed himself. He was a precocious child, and had learned to dress without assistance. The lesson was more easily learned than beings living in civilised lands might suppose, owing {{to the fact that}} he had only two garments--a large leather jacket and a pair of leather trousers, one huge button in front, and one behind, holding the latter securely to the former. A pair of veltschoen and a fur cap completed a costume which had been manufactured by the joint efforts of his mother and sister and Mrs Scholtz. The husband of the last, on seeing it for the first time, remarked that it [...] "vas more like me garb of a man of dirty zan a boy of dree." [...] The garb had been made of such tough material that it seemed impossible to wear it out, and of such an extremely <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> that although the child had now lived in it upwards of two years there were not more than six patches on it anywhere.|$|E
60|$|And {{she made}} me believe that she loved me. Without ever quitting her tone of badinage and playful superiority, she {{intoxicated}} me with the sense that I was necessary to her, that she was never at ease, unless I was near her, submitting to her playful tyranny. It costs a woman so little effort to beset us in this way! A half-repressed word, a moment's unexpected silence, even an <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> of petulance on our account, will serve us as hashish for a long while. Out of the subtlest web of scarcely perceptible signs, she set me weaving the fancy that she had always unconsciously loved me better than Alfred, but that, with the ignorant fluttered sensibility of a young girl, she had been imposed on by the charm that lay {{for her in the}} distinction of being admired and chosen by a man who made so brilliant a figure in the world as my brother. She satirized herself in a very graceful way for her vanity and ambition. What was it to me that I had the light of my wretched provision on the fact that now it was I who possessed at least all but the personal part of my brother's advantages? Our sweet illusions are half of them conscious illusions, like effects of colour that we know to be made up of tinsel, broken glass, and rags.|$|E
50|$|From the outset, Muir's designs {{demonstrated}} the pared-down understatement and <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> {{that would become}} her design signature. Jane & Jane {{was one of the}} first companies to bring couture standards and quality to the wholesale fashion industry. Muir used Liberty textiles in many of her designs.|$|E

5000|$|To {{make the}} summer uniforms feel as cool and {{comfortable}} {{as possible in}} the Barcelona heat, Grethel selected the lightest cottons and tropical wools, and cut the garments with a loose, <b>easy</b> <b>fit.</b> The color scheme of the parade uniforms is patriotic, drawing inspiration from American flag colors, but not using the expected hues. [...] "Brighter and more fashionable -- the palette of the summer uniforms is cornflower blue, fuchsia and white," [...] Grethel said.|$|E
50|$|Netbooks offer several {{distinct}} {{advantages in}} educational settings. First, their compact {{size and weight}} make for an <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> in student work areas. Similarly, the small size make netbooks easier to transport than heavier, larger sized traditional laptops. In addition, prices ranging from $200-$600 mean the affordability of netbooks can be a relief to school budget makers. Despite the small size and price, netbooks are fully capable of accomplishing most school-related tasks, including word processing, presentations, access to the Internet, multimedia playback, and photo management.|$|E
5000|$|... "Reddy," [...] insisted Louise Bender in 1978, [...] "is {{the friend}} of the consumer," [...] adding that urging users to keep their power {{consumption}} down was just fulfilling his mission; however, the character's updated image was not an <b>easy</b> <b>fit.</b> Reddy Kilowatt had acted as a cheerleader for energy consumption {{for more than half}} a century and his transformation to environmentalist was viewed skeptically by many. Conservation groups and editorial cartoonists began to appropriate the character in ironic and negative ways to satirize the energy industry, to the irritation of the company. [...] In a 1979 case, RCI sued the Environmental Action Foundation (EAF) for its use of Reddy’s image to criticize the industry in its publications. The court sided with the EAF and concluded that their parody of the character was fair use.|$|E

5000|$|In 1993 Zoran {{described}} {{his approach to}} fashion as [...] "simplicity in fabric and way of cut. You cannot produce complicated clothes or spend 10 days making a dress. Mine is all done by scaling measurements. I use the body as the land, as when building a house." [...] Suzy Menkes {{described his}} work at the time as based on loose and <b>easy</b> <b>fits,</b> playing only with proportion, color and texture, such as lining chiffon with lamé, or pairing velvet with alpaca.|$|R

5000|$|In 1962, another joint model venture {{agreement}} {{took place}} between IKA and American Motors Corporation (AMC). Various Rambler models licensed from American Motors Corporation (AMC) replaced all of the old Kaiser and Alfa Romeo based cars. In order to meet local content regulations, however, the Ramblers were adapted to use an Argentine-built Kaiser engine - which luckily was an <b>easy</b> <b>fit,</b> perhaps since the same engineer (Ralph H. Isebrandt) had designed both drivetrains. The final form of the AMC variants was the potent Rambler American/Classic-based [...] "Torino" [...] that saw a success on international racing circuits.Production peaked in 1965, {{with a total of}} 55,269 vehicles were assembled by IKA of which about one-third were Kaiser-Frazer based cars and Jeeps, while other two-thirds were Nash Ramblers and (from 1960) Renaults produced under license. Representing about 28% of Argentina's total production, IKA was the nation's largest independent automobile manufacturer with 8,500 employees.|$|E

50|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that early {{members of the}} Church did not pay {{a great deal of}} attention to Book of Mormon details about distances. The “Hemispheric” or “Two-Continent” model proposes that Book of Mormon lands stretch many thousands of miles over much of South and North America. There is no first hand, verifiable statement by Joseph Smith endorsing this view. One of the earliest advocates of a hemispheric setting was the young missionary Orson Pratt, who as early as 1832 publicly promoted the idea that Lehi “crossed the water into South America”. For some who read the Book of Mormon, with maps of the Western Hemisphere in view, the Isthmus of Panama seems an <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> for the Book of Mormon’s “narrow neck of land”. Pratt claimed that the “running battle”, culminating in the destruction of the Nephite nation, started at “the Isthmus of Darien” (Panama) and “ended at Manchester” (western New York). Pratt never attributed his geography (or one like it) to Joseph Smith. Pratt in fact, indicated that the South American landing idea was supposition, not revelation. Pratt’s geographic views were published in the 1879 edition of the Book of Mormon, but retracted from later editions.|$|E

5000|$|Mathis {{and fellow}} easy {{listening}} singers like Williams began {{to succumb to}} the effects of the British Invasion by early 1966. [...] "The Beatles had ushered in the era of the performer-songwriter; therefore, good songs just weren’t getting past the artists who were recording them for their own releases. The result was a steady emergence of what in the industry became known as the 'cover album', upon which songs that had achieved a certain level of popularity were recorded or 'covered' by a number of artists and savored by their loyal fans." [...] Two of the Fab Four's quieter numbers, [...] "Michelle" [...] and [...] "Yesterday", were understandable choices to present to the Mathis audience, but he recalled that it was still not an <b>easy</b> <b>fit.</b> [...] "'I wasn't quite sure how to go about it because their recordings were so minimalist as far as orchestrations and sounded perfect when they did it, but I found it difficult to repeat. But I did get the chance to sing on [...] "Michelle" [...] with John Pisano, who is a great, great guitarist and a wonderfully nice man.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Kelley also {{explained}} {{that a big}} church sequence in the episode gave the staff a chance to include all of Springfield's citizens, saying: [...] "We pushed {{as much as we}} could to get everyone into those pews. We were like, 'More characters! More characters!' because we knew our audience would hate us if any of their favorites didn't get to be LEGOs. You won't see Señor Ding Dong or the Grumple, but I think we crammed in everyone else." [...] Al Jean also spoke about how Lego and The Simpsons were an <b>easy</b> <b>fit,</b> saying: [...] "But, in a way, the Lego-Simpsons is an even easier fit — and not just because our characters and their minifigures are both yellow. Both styles are similar and deceptive in their simplicity. When you get right down to it, Lego is just bricks, and Matt Groening's design for our characters is really just eyeballs and a few lines — easy enough for any kid to draw." [...] Kelley also spoke about The Simpsons staff being big fans of LEGO, saying: [...] "We are major Lego fans at The Simpsons, and the Lego master builders are huge fans of our show. It's been a fantastic, rewarding experience to pull this off together. After 550 episodes, we really need that shot in the arm. Now we're pushing ourselves for more big episodes. Onward and Upward!" [...] Selman also said that no one on the staff took issue with the episode's tamer approach, saying: [...] "Some of our episodes can get a little outrageous and push the envelope, but we would never want to be rude to our friends at Lego. Let the guys at South Park do their own Lego episode and go nuts. For us, it was all about sending a love letter." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{head of the}} Elven guard, Lilly says of Tauriel, [...] "She's {{slightly}} reckless {{and totally}} ruthless and doesn't hesitate to kill." [...] Lilly also describes Tauriel as a nonconformist, explaining {{that as a result}} of her relative youth among Elves, she is brash and impulsive, tending to rebel against the established social order of the Elves. [...] Lilly explains, [...] "She's only 600 years old, she's just a baby. So she's a bit more impulsive, and she's a bit more immature. I think she's more easily romanticized by a lot of things." [...] Alluding to Tauriel's pursuit of the dwarves in The Desolation of Smaug after Thranduil closes his kingdom's borders and forbids any interference on the part of Elves in outside affairs, and her refusal to fight alongside him in The Battle of the Five Armies, Lilly explains, [...] "In a very out of character move for an elf, she's broken ranks and disobeyed authority. That's driven from her own conviction about what is right and what is wrong. She feels so much at odds with Thranduil, that she feels the need to defy him. I think that any defiant role that boxes authority is an <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> for me, because in life I'm a little bit like that." [...] However, Tauriel also has a [...] "softer side", and her character arc includes a love story. Though she and Legolas first met as children, and their relationship is significant, her romantic arc is not with him, as she develops a mutual attraction to the dwarf Kili. Legolas' father, the Elven king Thranduil, is fond of Tauriel, and [...] "sees something very special in her", though she understands that Thranduil would not approve of her pairing with his son, which Thranduil confirms in The Desolation of Smaug when he tells her not to give Legolas false hope of such a relationship. Lilly accepted the role under the condition that her role in The Hobbit would not include a love triangle. When she was called back into production for reshoots following the decision to split the story into three films instead of two, she was told that such a plot device would indeed be added to the story.|$|E

40|$|Martha Ostenso's Wild Geese and Mazo de la Roche's Jalna {{were both}} prize-winning, wildly {{successful}} novels, in the United States {{as well as}} in Canada, but each received a rather different critical response in this country. Jalna's suggestive anti-Americanism and its explicit British loyalism was evidently to be preferred over Wild Geese's more ambiguously North American (as opposed to what was then considered distinctly Canadian) aesthetic. This is despite its <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> into T. D. Maclulich's classification as a Canadian "Northern" fiction (a tradition which includes Frederick Philip Grove, Ernest Buckler, Sinclair Ross, and others). As well, the intense and often violent eroticism of Ostenso's novel was more difficult for critics of the 1920 s to tolerate than was the coy sexiness of Jalna. Although little critical {{attention has been paid to}} either author in recent years, Ostenso's literary reputation appears to have surpassed de la Roche's...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} philosophies that profess a {{particular}} lifestyle, {{but most are}} very difficult to adhere to in today's western society. While the ideals, and in some cases, most of the lifestyle practices can be observed, there is always frustration when the necessities of modern life interfere and compromises need to be made. Taoism seems to escape nearly all conflicts with other lifestyles. As the main components of Taoism seem to be a major part of most eastern philosophies and many western philosophies there is an <b>easy</b> <b>fit</b> with most lifestyles. The lack of specifics and the use of paradox to illustrate ideas allows one to apply Lao Tzu's wisdom to one's own particular circumstances. Ultimately, I believe it is the idea of reverting to the natural way rather than opposing it that allows the Tao Teh Ching to be a useful tool in today's life...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} aided {{high temperature}} {{expansion of the}} magnetic susceptibility and the magnetic specific heat is presented and demonstrated for frustrated and unfrustrated spin chains.
