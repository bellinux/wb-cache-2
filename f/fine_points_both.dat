40|$|Ontological semantics, as {{envisioned by}} Nirenburg and Raskin (2004), {{is a system}} of {{software}} and databases that contains enough information to competently parse both the syntax and the semantics of natural language texts. The book discusses the <b>fine</b> <b>points</b> <b>both</b> of the system’s philosophy and of its inner workings, and the interested reader should refer to it for further reference. What follows is a layman’s introduction to the system and to its possible applications, limited {{to what it is}} necessary to understand {{for the purposes of this}} particular effort and avoiding any serious discussion of the several points of divergence, often through upgrading, between this introduction and the 2001 snapshot of ontological semantics captured in the book. As stated above, the system consists of software and of databases. The latter are called the static resources, because they are used, as they are at the moment, every time a text is processed. The various pieces of software, most importantly the analyzer and the generator, are the dynamic resources because trivially they transform texts into textmeaning representations (TMRs) or the other way around. Nothing is truly static in ontological semantics. One assumes that the system will be constantly dealing wit...|$|E

This {{can only}} be done {{properly}} with a brush; but a brush, being soft at the point, causes so much uncertainty in the touch of an unpracticed hand, that it is hardly possible to learn to draw first with it, and {{it is better to}} take, in early practice, some instrument with a hard and <b>fine</b> <b>point,</b> <b>both</b> that we may give some support to the hand, and that by working over the subject with so delicate a point, the attention may be properly directed to all the most minute parts of it. Even the best artists need occasionally to study subjects with a pointed instrument, in order thus to discipline their attention: and a beginner must be content to do so for a considerable period.|$|R
40|$|On September 21, 2013, the High Energy Replicated Optics to Explore the Sun, or HEROES, balloon-borne x-ray {{telescope}} {{launched from}} the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility's site in Ft. Summer, NM. The flight lasted for approximately 27 hours and the observational targets included the Sun and astrophysical sources GRS 1915 + 105 and the Crab Nebula. Over the past year, the HEROES team upgraded the existing High Energy Replicated Optics (HERO) balloon-borne telescope to make unique scientific {{measurements of the}} Sun and astrophysical targets during the same flight. The HEROES Project is a multi-NASA Center effort with team members at both Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and is led by Co-PIs (one at each Center). The HEROES payload consists of the hard X-ray telescope HERO, developed at MSFC, combined with several new systems. To allow the HEROES telescope to make observations of the Sun, a new solar aspect system was added to supplement the existing star camera for <b>fine</b> <b>pointing</b> during <b>both</b> the day and night. A mechanical shutter {{was added to the}} star camera to protect it during solar observations and two alignment monitoring systems were added for improved pointing and post-flight data reconstruction. This mission was funded by the NASA HOPE (Hands-On Project Experience) Training Opportunity awarded by the NASA Academy of Program/Project and Engineering Leadership, in partnership with NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Office of the Chief Engineer and Office of the Chief Technologist...|$|R

40|$|Set {{to fly in}} the Fall of 2013 from Ft. Sumner, NM, the High Energy Replicated Optics to Explore the Sun (HEROES) {{mission is}} a {{collaborative}} effort between the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and the Goddard Space Flight Center to upgrade an existing payload, the High Energy Replicated Optics (HERO) balloon-borne telescope, to make unique scientific measurements of the Sun and astrophysical targets during the same flight. The HEROES science payload consists of 8 mirror modules, housing a total of 109 grazing-incidence optics. These modules are mounted on a carbon-fiber - and Aluminum optical bench 6 m from a matching array of high pressure xenon gas scintillation proportional counters, which serve as the focal-plane detectors. The HERO gondola utilizes a differential GPS system (backed by a magnetometer) for coarse pointing in the azimuth and a shaft angle encoder plus inclinometer provides the coarse elevation. The HEROES payload will incorporate a new solar aspect system to supplement the existing star camera, for <b>fine</b> <b>pointing</b> during <b>both</b> the day and night. A mechanical shutter {{will be added to}} the star camera to protect it during solar observations. HEROES will also implement two novel alignment monitoring system that will measure the alignment between the optical bench and the star camera and between the optics and detectors for improved pointing and post-flight data reconstruction. The overall payload will also be discussed.
