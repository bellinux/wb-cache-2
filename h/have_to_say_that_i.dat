2500|$|On the {{following}} morning, the clerk of the Crown went through formality of asking if Mitchel {{had anything to}} say why sentence should not be passed upon him. Mitchel said: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been found guilty by a packed jury—by the jury of a partisan sheriff—by a jury not empanelled even {{according to the law}} of England. That is the reason I object to the sentence being passed upon me." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is not a}} {{day that}} goes by that I do not feel remorse for what {{happened}} that day in My Lai", he told members of the club. [...] "I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed, for their families, for the American soldiers involved and their families. I am very sorry....If you are asking why I did not stand up to them when I was given the orders, I will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a 2nd lieutenant getting orders from my commander and I followed them—foolishly, I guess.|$|E
2500|$|In {{letters to}} a Parliamentary group in March 2010, Tesco and Sainsbury {{stressed}} {{their commitment to}} animal welfare and stated {{that they had no}} plans to buy milk from Nocton. In another letter, Waitrose's managing director Mark Price stated, [...] "a dairy farm of the size proposed would not fit with the Waitrose way of doing business, and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am anxious that it represents the first step along the way towards a highly-industrialised, US approach to farming". [...] On 17 November 2010, Marks & Spencer declared, [...] "M does not buy milk from 'super-dairy' farms and we are committed to our current pool of dedicated dairy farms." [...] Jason Gissing, co-founder of Ocado, said in a letter published on the Ocado web site in December 2010, [...] "Rest assured, Ocado will not be milking it with Nocton.".|$|E

2500|$|Promoted to full {{general in}} 1962, he was {{assigned}} as vice {{chief of staff of}} the U.S. Army amid speculation that he would soon succeed Army chief of staff George H. Decker, who was not expected to be reappointed. As vice chief of staff, Hamlett negotiated the creation of U.S. Strike Command with Air Force chief of staff Curtis E. LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I think the most important thing was something I didn't recommend; and that was that we didn't become involved in Vietnam to the point where we would have to commit combat forces. I think it was a failure, and I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shared the responsibility because I didn't see far enough ahead to speak out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Who--I?" [...] {{said the}} boy. [...] "No--that is, I don't know. I wouldn't like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> anybody should be hung; but if anybody ever did deserve it, he does." ...|$|R

6000|$|But Rose found {{difficulties}} {{in the way of}} her angelic part, for her father addressed her in his most solemn and sententious manner: 'Rose, I have always looked on you as sensible and discreet, but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> disapprove of your late promenades with a young man connected with the aristocracy.' ...|$|E

60|$|Now another company. These get $5.36 each. The {{men look}} well. They, too, have great names; besides the Washingtons aforesaid, John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Calhoun, James Madison, Alfred Tennyson, John Brown, Benj. G. Tucker, Horace Greeley, &c. The men step off aside, count their money with a pleas'd, half-puzzled look. Occasionally, but not often, {{there are some}} {{thoroughly}} African physiognomies, very black in color, large, protruding lips, low forehead, &c.

I {{tell you that you}} are turning me into a scoundrel. I am being twisted up into a net of lies till I am obliged to lie myself to keep clear of ruin.

5000|$|The {{government}} is entirely frank in {{its desire to}} continue using [...] "class" [...] claims {{in order to protect}} communications between ministers and civil servants from disclosure in litigation.

I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> regard this [...] "candour" [...] argument … as unacceptable.|$|E
5000|$|Shayelizatrotter from The Comedy Critic gave a C+ grade <b>to</b> {{the episode}} <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> it didn't meet her expectations.

5000|$|I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the prose}} {{in this book}} often reads {{as if it were}} written, or maybe dictated, in a great hurry. There is some {{unnecessary}} repetition, and many paragraphs spend more time than they should on digressions that seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> occurred <b>to</b> the author in mid-thought. If not exactly chiseled, the prose is nevertheless lively, readable, and plainspoken. The haste may have been justified by the pace of the events he aims to describe and explain. Posner has an extraordinarily sharp mind, and what I take to be a lawyerly skill in argument. But I also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> in some respects, his grasp of economic ideas is precarious. Robert M. Solow ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{think the}} term is inappropriate, but the atomic bombs and the Soviet entry into the war are, in a sense, divine gifts. This way we don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we <b>have</b> quit the war because of {{domestic}} circumstances.|$|R

5000|$|In his {{decision}} in the judicial review of the original Phelan case on 5 January 1997, Mr Justice McCracken said: [...] "While I have great sympathy for two women, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not particularly impressed with their evidence." [...] He added, however, that this was [...] "not a deciding factor" [...] in {{his decision}} to prevent the DPP from taking the man to trial.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a comment}} to Hugh Lamb's review, Rosemary Pardoe noted, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think Hugh has been remarkably kind {{to a book}} which, for me, is a fine idea totally ruined by being put {{together}} by a packaging company who seem to know nothing about the subject.
