60|$|Then, hearing Markey {{open the}} door, <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> feigned sleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{with a smile}} he fell asleep. Uncle Tom too was free.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{the boys}} {{thought he was}} going to faint. Chet got some more coffee.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as <b>his</b> world went dim.|$|R
60|$|His voice sank {{to a low}} mumble, and <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> wearily.|$|R
60|$|Reinhart staggered, {{holding on}} {{tight to the}} desk. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> gasping.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> swooned again, as {{the doctor}} stooped to remove the {{temporary}} bandages from his wound.|$|E
60|$|Another spear {{and then}} another touched him. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> held his teeth firm set--he would not cry out.|$|E
60|$|A sound {{suspiciously like}} a giggle {{came from the}} landing and fell heavily on Gale's ears. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> tried to think.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> again, and I did not further disturb him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> languidly, {{and kept}} them closed until {{the men had}} departed.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> The cigar {{dropped from}} his fingers. There {{was a long}} silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> felt immensely {{sorry for}} himself; {{and when he}} opened his eyes again he found that he had been asleep, and that the sun was sinking fast.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Well,’ said he, ‘then without,’ and <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{dropped the}} piece of rush. This time there was no doubt. It went for the rapid as {{straight}} as any arrow.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a fearful}} moment--a {{moment in which}} Pawnee Brown's life hung by a single thread. The flames were leaping up all around him. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> half murmured a prayer for divine aid.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> impatiently, {{and tried}} to shut her out in a {{darkness}} of his own making.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> obediently. She {{slipped a}} cool {{hand under the}} nape {{of his neck and}} let it rest.|$|R
60|$|An {{expression}} of obstinate calm overspread Sir Richmond's face. He seemed {{to regard the}} matter as settled. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{decided he}} would {{sit down in the}} {{armchair}} and go to sleep. He crept very carefully to the chair and sat down. Another interval of listening and <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> composed himself for slumber.|$|E
6000|$|Stumps did not resist. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> the restful {{feeling that}} had {{suddenly}} arisen {{in his heart}} {{when he said the}} momentous words, [...] "I will," [...] coupled with exhaustion, resulted almost instantaneously in a quiet slumber.|$|E
60|$|Oxbye {{sank back}} upon the sofa. His eyes closed. Then he opened them again, looking about him strangely, {{as one who}} is {{suffering}} some new experience. Again he shook his head, again <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> he opened them no more. He was asleep.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> wearily and paused. Mr Dedalus took a bone {{from his}} plate and tore some meat from {{it with his}} teeth, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Soon the {{prisoner}} was curled {{up close to}} the fire and <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as if in slumber, but he kept as wide awake as before.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I---- Oh! how my head spins!" [...] muttered Songbird. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{again and}} {{was silent for}} a moment. Then he looked once more at Sam.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> after a {{few words}} of thankful prayer, thought how {{miraculously}} he had been preserved, and made a vow of candlesticks to the blessed Saint Jose. He then called in a faint voice, and presently the penitent Ignacio stood beside him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} {{afternoon}} when he awoke. Slowly the fact of life came back to him. He glanced about the room. Joe had evidently stolen away after he had dozed off. That was considerate of Joe, he thought. Then <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> slept again.|$|E
60|$|Kirk blinked. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{opened them}} again. The {{automobile}} was still there, {{and he was}} still in it. Ruth was still gazing at him with the triumphant look in her eyes. The chauffeur, silent emblem of a substantial bank-balance, still sat stiffly at the steering-wheel.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was sea-sick," [...] said Father Brown simply. [...] "I felt simply horrible. But feeling horrible {{has nothing}} to do with not seeing things." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> with {{a luxurious}} sense of self-esteem, and {{appeared}} to absorb himself in his own thoughts. Fritz unintentionally roused him by continuing the story of Jack's introduction to the bedroom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, like this!" [...] he {{answered}} very low, {{in a voice}} that trembled slightly with eagerness; and she pressed suddenly her lips to <b>his</b> while <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> in an ecstasy of delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{not fail}} you..." [...] he murmured, as <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> gave a final {{struggle}} to get his head at a comfortable angle, [...] "the letter will be written in my best cali... calig.... Lud! but I'm not so drunk as you think I am. ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr Baptist {{seemed to}} have a general {{understanding}} of what she said; or perhaps his quickness caught and applied her slight action of peeping. In any case <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> tossed his head with the air {{of a man who had}} sufficient reasons for what he did, and said in his own tongue, it didn't matter. Altro! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear me,' {{he thought}} to himself, 'that's rather tiring! I'll just rest for a few minutes; it will be some little time yet before the King has got to dessert.' So he threw himself down on the grass, and, {{as the sun was}} very dazzling, <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> in a few seconds had fallen sound asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... --"All fast!" [...] cried some one. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as if {{going off}} into a swoon, while huddled {{together}} about the brace we watched with scared looks what the ship would do now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] It was not {{irritation}} {{he appeared}} to express, but the slight strain {{of an effort to}} get into relation with the subject. Better to focus the image <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> a while.|$|R
6000|$|When Ralph Haverley came in {{from his}} long {{moonlight}} ramble, he was so happy {{that he went to}} bed and slept as sound as rock. But before <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>he</b> said to himself,-- ...|$|R
