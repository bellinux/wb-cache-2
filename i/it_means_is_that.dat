Attorney Mike Johnson of the Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly the Alliance Defense Fund), a Christian legal group, stated, [...] "I suspect {{most of it}} is childish pranks. Clearly, there are adults with an agenda to remove Christ from Christmas. But they tend to occupy themselves with the courts and courtroom of public opinion." [...] Stephen Nissenbaum, the author of The Battle for Christmas and a retired professor, views Baby Jesus theft as neither innocent vandalism nor religious hate crimes. Nissenbaum writes that, [...] "What <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's OK to go around violating even pretty important norms, as long as real human harm isn't being done. It's not exactly devaluing Christianity, but it is sort of a ritualized challenge to it. It could be Christian kids doing itand on January 2 they become good Christians again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before the Anglo-German summit at Berchtesgaden on 15 September 1938, the British Ambassador, Sir Nevile Henderson, and Weizsäcker {{worked out}} a private {{arrangement}} for Hitler and Chamberlain to meet with no advisers present {{as a way of}} excluding the ultra-hawkish Ribbentrop from attending the talks. Hitler's interpreter Paul Schmidt later recalled that it was [...] "felt that our Foreign Minister would prove a disturbing element" [...] at the Berchtesgaden summit. In a moment of pique at his exclusion from the Chamberlain-Hitler meeting, Ribbentrop refused to hand over Schmidt's notes of the summit to Chamberlain, a move that caused much annoyance on the British side. Ribbentrop spent the last weeks of September 1938 looking forward very much to the German-Czechoslovak war he expected to break out on 1 October 1938. Ribbentrop regarded the Munich Agreement as a diplomatic defeat for Germany, as it deprived Germany of the opportunity to wage the war to destroy Czechoslovakia that Ribbentrop wanted to see; the Sudetenland issue, which was the ostensible subject of the German-Czechoslovak dispute, had been just a pretext for German aggression. During the Munich Conference, Ribbentrop spent much of his time brooding unhappily in the corners. Ribbentrop told the head of Hitler's Press Office, Fritz Hesse, that the Munich Agreement was [...] "first-class stupidity… All <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we have to fight the English in a year, when they will be better armed… It would have been much better if war had come now". Like Hitler, Ribbentrop was determined that in the next crisis, Germany would not have its professed demands met in another Munich-type summit, and that the next crisis to be caused by Germany would result in the war that Chamberlain had [...] "cheated" [...] the Germans out of at Munich.|$|E

60|$|This {{situation}} has occurred so often before, {{always with the}} same result of a collapse of civilization (Professor Flinders Petrie has let out the secret of previous collapses), that the rich are instinctively crying 'Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die,' and the poor, 'How long, O Lord, how long?' But the pitiless reply still is that God helps those who help themselves. This {{does not mean that}} if Man cannot find the remedy no remedy will be found. The power that produced Man when the monkey was not up to the mark, can produce a higher creature than Man if Man does not come up to the mark. What <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if Man is to be saved, Man must save himself. There seems no compelling reason why he should be saved. He is by no means an ideal creature. At his present best many of his ways are so unpleasant that they are unmentionable in polite society, and so painful that he is compelled to pretend that pain is often a good.

6000|$|I {{sit here}} to-night, I quite crouch by my homely little fireside, muffled in soundless snow--where the loud tick {{of the clock}} is the only sound--and give myself up to the charmed sense that in your {{complicated}} career, amid all the more immediate claims of the bonne année, you have been moved to this delightful sign of remembrance of an old friend {{who is on the}} whole, and has always been, condemned to lose so much more of you (through divergence of ways!) than he has been privileged to enjoy. Snatches, snatches, and happy and grateful moments--and then great empty yearning intervals only--and under all the great ebbing, melting, and irrecoverableness of life! But this is almost a happy and grateful moment--almost a real one, I mean--though again with bristling frontiers, long miles of land and water, doing their best to make it vain and fruitless. You live on the crest of the wave, and I deep down in the hollow--and your waves seem to be all crests, just as mine are only concave formations! I feel at any rate very much in the hollow these winter months--when great adventures, like Paris, look far and formidable, and I see a domestic reason for sitting tight wherever I turn my eyes. That reads as if I had thirteen children--or thirty wives--instead of being so lone and lorn; but what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I have, in profusion, modest, backward labours. We have been having here lately the great and glorious pendulum in person, Mrs. Wharton, on her return oscillation, spending several weeks in England, for almost the first time ever and having immense success--so that I think she might fairly fix herself here--if she could stand it! But she is to be at 58 Rue de Varenne again from the New Year and you will see her and she will give you details. My detail is that though she has kindly asked me to come to them again there this month or spring I have had to plead simple abject terror--terror of the pendulous life. I am a stopped clock--and I strike (that is I caper about) only when very much wound up. Now I don't have to be wound up at all to tell you what a yearning I have to see you all back here--and what a kind of sturdy faith that I absolutely shall. Then your crest will be much nearer my hollow, and vice versa, and {{you will be able to}} look down quite straight at me, and we shall be almost together again--as we really must manage to be for these interesting times to come. I don't want to miss any more Harry's freshness of return from the great country--with the golden apples of his impression still there on the tree. I have always only tasted them plucked by other hands and--baked! I want to munch these with you--en famille. Therefore I confidently await and evoke you.

6000|$|... ...I am {{indebted to}} you for your most benignant letter of December last. It lies open before me and I read it again and am soothed and cheered and comforted again. You put your finger sympathetically on the place and spoke of what I wanted you to speak of. I have felt, {{for a long time}} past, that I have fallen upon evil days--every sign or symbol of one's being in the least wanted, {{anywhere}} or by any one, having so utterly failed. A new generation, that I know not, and mainly prize not, has taken universal possession. The sense of being utterly out of it weighed me down, and I asked myself what the future would be. All these melancholies were qualified indeed by one redeeming reflection--the sense of how little, for a good while past (for reasons very logical, but accidental and temporary,) I had been producing. I did say to myself [...] "Produce again--produce; produce better than ever, and all will yet be well;" [...] and there was sustenance in that so far as it went. But it has meant much more to me since you have said it--for it is, practically, what you admirably say. It is exactly, moreover, what I meant to admirably do--and have meant, all along, about this time to get into the motion of. The whole thing, however, represents a great change in my life, inasmuch as {{what is clear is that}} periodical publication is practically closed to me--I'm the last hand that the magazines, in this country or in the U.S., seem to want. I won't afflict you with the now accumulated (during all these past years) evidence on which this induction rests--and I have spoken of it to no creature till, at this late day, I speak of it to you.... All this, I needn't say, is for your segretissimo ear. What <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "production" [...] for me, as aforesaid, means production of the little book, pure and simple--independent of any antecedent appearance; and, truth to tell, now that I wholly see that, and have at last accepted it, I am, incongruously, not at all sorry. I am indeed very serene. I have always hated the magazine form, magazine conditions and manners, and much of the magazine company. I hate the hurried little subordinate part that one plays in the catchpenny picture-book--and the negation of all literature that the insolence of the picture-book imposes. The money-difference will be great--but not so great after a bit as at first; and the other differences will be so all to the good that even from the economic point of view they will tend to make up for that and perhaps finally even completely do so. It is about the distinctness of one's book-position that you have so substantially reassured me; and I mean to do far better work than ever I have done before. I have, potentially, improved immensely and am bursting with ideas and subjects--though the act of composition is with me more and more slow, painful and difficult. I shall never again write a long novel; but I hope to write six immortal short ones--and some tales of the same quality. Forgive, my dear Howells, the cynical egotism of these remarks--the fault of which is in your own sympathy. Don't fail me this summer. I shall probably not, as usual, absent myself from these islands--not be beyond the Alps as I was when you were here last. That way Boston lies, which is the deadliest form of madness. I sent you only last night messages of affection by dear little [...] "Ned" [...] Abbey, who presently sails for N.Y. laden with the beautiful work he has been doing for the new Boston public library. I hope you will see him--he will speak of me competently and kindly. I wish all power to your elbow. Let me hear as soon as there is a sound of packing. Tell Mildred I rejoice in the memory of her. Give my love to your wife, and believe me, my dear Howells, yours in all constancy, ...|$|E
