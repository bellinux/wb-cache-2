5|$|Because {{of their}} human qualities, we never entirely lose sympathy with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, and our <b>imagination</b> participates with theirs in the tragedy. Their <b>imagination</b> makes the two more human and yet also destroys them. As Kinnaird points out (elaborating on {{an idea of}} Joseph W. Donohue, Jr.), Hazlitt in part sees Macbeth as a tragedy of <b>imagination</b> itself.|$|E

5000|$|Geopolitical <b>imaginations</b> are {{constructed}} {{views of the}} world that reflect the vision of a place’s, a country’s or a society’s role within world politics. [...] Geopolitical <b>imaginations</b> are constituted by shared assumptions and representations of power relations and conflicts in world politics within a certain geographical territory. [...] By critically analyzing how and why these <b>imaginations</b> {{are constructed}}, it is possible to reveal underlying power relations and to get a better understanding of various conflicts. Therefore, geopolitical <b>imaginations</b> are closely connected to the academic field of critical geopolitics.|$|R
5000|$|Geopolitical <b>imaginations</b> are {{composed}} of the representation of a country’s territorial limits and its geopolitical code which is “... a set of strategic assumptions that a government makes about other states”. [...] These so-called geopolitical codes are based on national identity (particularly in ‘them’ and ‘us’ distinctions), emotional attachment to a place as well as national myths. [...] Geopolitical <b>imaginations</b> provide the legitimisation for geopolitical actions or certain positions in foreign and domestic policy. Geopolitical <b>imaginations</b> are reflections of current discourses and therefore they are not fixed but rather vary over time and in different societies. Research has primarily analyzed geopolitical <b>imaginations</b> of European and North American countries, ignoring {{the fact that in}} other socio-political contexts there exist different ‘non-western’ geopolitical <b>imaginations.</b>|$|R

60|$|It is {{a curious}} {{omission}} on Hume's part that, while thus dwelling on two classes of ideas, Memories and <b>Imaginations,</b> he has not, at the same time, taken notice of a third group, of no small importance, which are as different from <b>imaginations</b> as memories are; though, like the latter, they are often confounded with pure <b>imaginations</b> in general speech. These are the ideas of expectation, or {{as they may be}} called for the sake of brevity, Expectations; which differ from simple <b>imaginations</b> in being associated with the idea of the existence of corresponding impressions, in the future, just as memories contain the idea of the existence of the corresponding impressions in the past.|$|R

5|$|In 1954 Hamling {{started a}} {{companion}} magazine, Imaginative Tales; in addition, his company Greenleaf Publishing was {{the publisher of}} Rogue, a men's magazine modelled after Playboy. In 1957 the liquidation of American News Company, a major distributor, meant that many magazines had to scramble to find new distributors. Independent distributors often required that the magazines be monthly, and that they be in a larger format than the digest-size common in science fiction magazines. The larger format required higher revenue to be profitable, {{but in many cases}} it proved impossible to attract the additional advertising income that would have kept the magazines afloat. By the end of 1958, many titles had disappeared as a result, with <b>Imagination</b> one of the victims; Hamling closed down both <b>Imagination</b> and its sister magazine to invest the money in Rogue instead. The last issue of <b>Imagination</b> was October 1958, the 63rd issue, while Imaginative Tales, retitled Space Travel, ceased with the November 1958 issue. There was no indication in either magazine that the end had come, though the last issue of <b>Imagination</b> omitted its letter, book review and pen-pal columns, all of which had appeared regularly in prior issues.|$|E

In addition he gave practical advice for the aspirant who wishes to attain Self-realization and thereby escape the wheel of births and deaths. He also taught about the concept of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path that he called involution. His teachings are most importantly recorded in his principal books Discourses and God Speaks.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{describe}} {{some of the}} key geographical <b>imaginations</b> that geographers {{have used}} to explore subjectivity. These <b>imaginations</b> are "territories and boundaries", "subject positions", "spatial practices", "between me and you" and "outside in/inside out". Each of these has something to offer any analysis of subjectivity. However, they should not be seen as being mutually exclusive or competing versions of the subject, but rather as mutually informative of ways of mapping the subject. I conclude on the importance of experimenting with geographical <b>imaginations</b> to create new understandings of subjectivity – especially when it is no longer possible to presume the "where" of the subject...|$|R
