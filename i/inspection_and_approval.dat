The Survey is responsible for cadastral mapping, {{as a part of}} an inter-ministry procedure of documentation and registration of rights to land, according to a British mandatory law (Survey Ordnance, 1929). Private licensed surveyors are deeply involved in the cadastral activity. The cadastre system in Israel is based on Torrens registration principles. The responsibility for the <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> the <b>approval</b> of block maps and mutation plans is shared by five district surveyors and three senior civil servants acting at SOI central office. This historical, geographic distribution led to heterogeneity of various local standards of working and managing methods and procedures, data formats, hardware and software facilities, etc. In the era of worldwide standardization, the Israeli cadastre practice remained anachronistically particular and essentially not standardized. At the end of 2003, a comprehensive project was initiated aiming at the establishment of a better, highly standardized and homogeneously regularized cadastral practice. The existing working procedures will be critically studied and analyzed, and practical steps for their improvement will be proposed. Furthermore, a software application will be specified fo...|$|R

40|$|The Survey of Israel (SOI) is a {{national}} agency for geodesy, cadastre and geographic information. According to a British mandatory law (Survey Ordinance, 1929), the SOI is responsible for cadastral mapping, including <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>approval</b> of block maps and mutation plans. Private licensed surveyors are {{deeply involved in the}} cadastral activity. One of their most important tasks is the preparation of mutation plans of changes in the cadastre. In 1964, a special law of public dwelling was enacted by the parliament. This law permitted the government to build a large number of houses within a short time and to carry out re-parcellation and registration of rights to land following the completion of the building and housing process. The objective of the law was to assist mass immigration. As the result of various difficulties in the procedure, more than 600, 000 existing apartments are not registered in Israel until the present. An inter-ministry governmental committee analyzed the whole process and proposed improvements for its acceleration. One of them should be the classification of licensed surveyors according to the quality of cadastral block maps and mutation plans prepared by them. The idea is to correlate between the classification of the surveyor and the level of inspection carried out by the Survey, establishing a more effective, faster, selective <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>approval</b> procedure. At the end of 2003, a project was initiated for the completion of such a classification. The paper details the principal ideas of the project...|$|E

40|$|In this research, a risk-based {{shutdown}} <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> {{maintenance interval}} optimization for a processing facility is proposed. Often <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance activities can’t be performed until the processing unit or plant is taken into a non-operational state, generally known as “shutdown”. Extensive work on <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval estimation modeling {{is available in}} the concerned literature however, no to very limited application on shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance modeling is observed for a continuous operating facility. Majority of the published literature deals to optimize individual equipment <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval without considering the overall impact of plant unavailability due to shutdown. They all deal to optimize individual equipment <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval considering cost, risk, availability and reliability. The efforts towards finding an optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval is not considered in these studies especially when it requires unit or plant to be in shutdown state from an operational state for performing <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance. This topic is selected to bridge the existing gap in the available literature and to provide a means to develop a methodology to estimate the shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval for a continuous processing unit or plant, rather an <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval for each piece of equipment considering the overall asset availability, reliability and risk. A component failure due to wear or degradation is a major threat to asset failure in a processing facility. A carefully planned <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategy not only mitigate the effects of age-based degradation and reduce the threat of failure but also minimize the risk exposure. Generally failure caused by wear or degradation is modeled as a stochastic process. For an effective <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategy, the stochastic nature of failure has to be taken into consideration. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the risk of exposure considering effect of failure on human life, financial investment and environment by optimizing the interval of process unit shutdown. Risk-based shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance optimization quantifies the risk to which individual equipment are subjected and uses this as a basis for the optimization of a shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategy...|$|R
