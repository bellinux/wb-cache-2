50|$|The {{friction}} pile driving process starts by laying the grout shoe {{at the proper}} location and inserting the spigot end of the pile shaft into the conical point. The pile is kept in place {{by a series of}} keeper plates within the conical grout shoe. As the pile is driven the conical grout shoe creates an annulus between the pile shaft and the surrounding soils. This annulus is immediately and consistently filled with a sand grout that is pumped down the pile shaft and exits within spaced between the keeper fins in the conical points. The breaker hammer driving tool is fitted with a special grout box adapter to allow the grout to flow from the <b>grout</b> <b>pump</b> through the driving tool down into the upper most pile shaft. The pumping rate of the grout should slightly exceed the take rate of the grout. In softer soils the grout takes tend to be higher due to outward bulging of the grout column.|$|E

This paper evaluates adapting anti-washout admixture (AWA) and high range water reducing admixture (HRWRA) products to enhance controlled low-strength materials (CLSMs) for underwater placement. A simple experimental scale model (based on dynamic and geometric similitude) of typical <b>grout</b> <b>pump</b> emplacement equipment has been developed to determine the percentage of cementing material washed out. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify proportions of admixtures and underwater CLSM emplacement procedures which would minimize the cross-contamination of the displaced water while maintaining the advantages of CLSM. Since the displaced water from radioactively contaminated systems must be subsequently treated prior to release to the environment, the amount of cross-contamination is important for cases in which cementing material could form hard sludges in a water treatment facility and contaminate the in-place CLSM stabilization medium...|$|E

40|$|During this quarter, the {{majority}} of activity focused on grout emplacement at the Lodestar Energy Inc. (formerly Costain Coal Co.) surface mine auger holes described in the previous report. Specifically, {{two different types of}} <b>grout</b> <b>pumps</b> were investigated: a piston pump used in previous demonstrations, and a progressive cavity pump. The latter is currently utilized for grouting in underground coal mines, is relatively small and portable, and is capable of receiving dry material (e. g., fly ash) and water, mixing it to produce a <b>grout,</b> and <b>pumping</b> the <b>grout</b> at high pressure. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate it`s potential use in auger mine filling. Several field demonstrations were conducted using the different pumps. Numerous problems were encountered when using the progressive cavity pump, all of which were related to its inability to handle the highly reactive and heterogeneous FBC fly ash. Even relatively small ash agglomerates (< 1 in. in diameter), which were not a problem for the larger piston pump, caused blockages in the progressive cavity pump which not only proved extremely difficult to clear, but also resulted in significant mechanical failures. Furthermore, mixing of dry fly ash with water within the progressive cavity pump was inconsistent and difficult to control. Consequently, the pump was unable to completely fill even a single auger hole. It was found that a large proportion of bed ash in the grout generated a large amount of heat and caused early stiffening of the material. During the experiments, cylinders of grout were prepared for compressive strength testing, and moisture contents were determined on-site. A thermocouple assembly was also constructed to record grout temperatures within an auger hole...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to design and develop a group pump and solve {{associated}} technical issues for a construction company in Ireland. The design {{is based on a}} high shear colloidal group mixing and pumping rig. The initial machine has failed in terms of bearing and seal performance, has high manufacturing costs and is poorly designed. To account for these issues, extensive research of the design features of grout mixing units from various competitors and suppliers was carried out by research and field studies at trade fairs. Using the information gathered, and incorporating improvements into the existing design, a test rig was developed and tested. Performance tests consisted of varying the flow rates of the grout material through specified industrial flow rate ranges. The head loss through the system was plotted against flow rate to obtain system design curves. Design calculations were used to size the hydraulic motor, the impeller shaft diameter, dynamic loading on bearings and their operational lifetime. The result of the performance testing indicated that the machine performance met specifications. The new colloidal mixing unit met grout mixing standards for a water/cement ratio of 0. 4. This was validated with flow cone testing. The dual bearing system design proved satisfactory, with smooth operation even at higher ranges of industrial flow rates. The mechanical seals were selected for aggressive environments and the seal system developed for the <b>grout</b> <b>pump</b> remained leak proof, as designed. The original machine’s was smooth and provided high quality batches of grout. The new pump design features includes a widened pumping impeller for increased shearing of the group and gives higher volumetric flow rates.

40|$|Grouting {{is used in}} {{underground}} {{construction to}} reduce the water flow into tunnels and caverns and to limit the lowering of the surrounding groundwater table. Due to their wide availability and low cost relative to other materials, cement based materials are commonly used as grouts and, in this context, the rheology of the cement grout is an important factor. Rheological properties of cement grout such as viscosity and yield stress are commonly measured off-line using laboratory instruments, and some simple tools are available to make field measurements. However, these methods often lack accuracy and reliability. Although the rheological properties of the grout used play {{a fundamental role in}} design and execution, no method has yet been developed to measure these properties in-line in field work.   In this work, for the first time, an in-line rheometry method combining the Ultrasound Velocity Profiling (UVP) technique with Pressure Difference (PD) measurements, known as “UVP+PD”, was successfully tested for continuous in-line measurements of concentrated micro cement based grouts. The feasibility of using the UVP+PD method depends on the in-line determination of the rheological properties and time dependent behaviour of the cement grouts. A test set-up consisting of a combination of an experimental “flow loop” and a conventional field grouting rig – UNIGROUT E 22 H – from AtlasCopco, was used to investigate the feasibility of determining the rheological properties of cement grout using the UVP+PD method under field conditions. A laboratory based test set-up was used to further investigate the rheological properties in a more controlled environment.   The velocity profiles were measured directly in-line. The shape of the velocity profiles was visualized, and the change {{in the shape of the}} profiles with concentration and time was observed. The viscosity and yield stress of the grout were determined using rheological models, e. g. Bingham and Herschel-Bulkley. In addition, rheological properties were determined using the non-model approach (gradient method) and the tube viscometry concept and were compared with results obtained using the rheological models. In addition, the obtained rheological properties were subsequently compared with off-line measurements using a conventional rotational rheometer.  The UVP+PD method was found to be capable of determining the true rheological behavior of cement grout regardless of the rheological model, providing the opportunity to visualize the change in the shape of the velocity profiles. Furthermore, it was possible to make an accurate determination of the velocity by ultrasound velocity profiling at a very flow rate (i. e. 1 liter/min). The ultrasound velocity profiling was also found to be a reliable tool for determining the characteristics of the <b>grout</b> <b>pump.</b> In conclusion, the UVP+PD method was demonstrated to be a promising new in-line tool for determining the rheological properties of commonly used cement based grouts and the changes with concentration and time.

It includes {{an evaluation of the}} previous work, a rigorous experimental investigation, a new and original model for determining pipeline pressure drop characteristics and a new method of characterising typically homogeneous fluid behaviour based on a particle size distribution, slope factor and a median particle size. The experimental investigation was undertaken to obtain data for modelling the flow of dense phase fly ash slurries. Tests were conducted using fly ashes from different power stations in a purposely built test facility. The test facility contained 50 mm and 80 mm bore internal pipeline viscometers in series. Slurry pump discharge pressure, differential pressure over 5 meters of a 80 mm pipe section, differential pressure over 5 meters of a 50 mm of pipe section, slurry temperature, slurry volumetric and mass flowrates were measured. Slurries settling were determined visually using an 80 mm glass pipe section. The particle size distribution and solids density of the fly ash were analysed and the solids concentration of the slurries were determined using the wet weight, drying and dry weight method. The experimental results were used to develop a new model to determine the pressure drop characteristics of dense phase fly ash slurry <b>pumping</b> systems and <b>grout</b> <b>pumping</b> plants, in order to develop a new description of what typical characteristics homogeneous fluid contain. The model indicated a polynomial relationship between pipeline differential pressure and solids concentration which {{has proven to be a}} much improved predictor of actual system performance.

25|$|An augercast pile, often {{known as}} a {{continuous}} flight augering (CFA) pile, is formed by drilling into {{the ground with a}} hollow stemmed continuous flight auger to the required depth or degree of resistance.

While the cement <b>grout</b> is <b>pumped,</b> the auger is slowly withdrawn, conveying the soil upward along the flights. A shaft of fluid cement grout is formed to ground level. Reinforcement can be installed. Recent innovations in addition to stringent quality control allows reinforcing cages to be placed up to the full length of a pile when required. A typical reinforcing cage will consist of 4 to 8 bars from #5 to #8 bars typically 1/3 the length of the pile with longitudinal circular ties spaced {{along the length of the}} cage.

40|$|In this quarter, {{activity}} {{focused on}} the placement of Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) grout into auger holes at the Sunny Ridge Mining Co. site. As discussed in previous reports, the grout was prepared using fluidized bed combustion (FBC) by-product obtained from the Costain Coal Company. The grout was thoroughly mixed with water and transferred to a concrete pumping truck. The nozzle on the pumper truck was attached to PVC pipe through which the <b>grout</b> was <b>pumped</b> into the auger holes. The first field test involved the placement of a very high slump, flowable grout into auger holes sing a simple, earthern bulkhead. These tests were conducted to explore the flowability of the grout. The second series of test was conducted with a lower-slump, higher-viscosity material pumped at high pressure and using sandbags as a bulkhead. The goal of these tests {{was to examine the}} feasibility of pressure grouting to completely fill auger holes with a material that will exhibit high long-term strength because of this low initial water content. Although there were many problems encountered during the field demonstration, these initial tests were, overall, successful. It was shown that a high-slump <b>grout</b> can be <b>pumped</b> the length of the auger holes, and can be successfully placed in holes containing standing water. Furthermore, this can be accomplished using available concrete emplacement equipment. In contrast, the pressure grouting proved more challenging than emplacement of the flowable grout mainly because of pipe-joint failures and difficulties in working the stiff, high-viscosity grout; the amount of water added to the mix is critical when placing this type of material. Cylinders of grout for compressive strength testing were prepared during field demonstration, and cores of the in situ hardened grout will be recovered after a minimum of 30 days. Additional field demonstration will focus on improving the procedure for placement of the flowable grout...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of nuclear materials for weapons, medical, and space applications from the mid- 1950 's through the late- 1980 's at the Savannah River Site (SRS) generated approximately 35 {{million gallons of}} liquid high-level radioactive waste, which is currently being processed into vitrified glass for long-term storage. Upstream of the vitrification process, the waste is separated into three components: high activity insoluble sludge, high activity insoluble salt, and very low activity soluble salts. The soluble salt represents 90 % of the 35 million gallons of overall waste and is processed at the SRS Saltstone Facility, where it mixed with cement, blast furnace slag, and flyash, creating a grout-like mixture. The resulting <b>grout</b> is <b>pumped</b> into aboveground storage vaults, where it hydrates into concrete monoliths, called saltstone, thus immobilizing the low-level radioactive salt waste. As the saltstone hydrates, it generates heat that slowly diffuses out of the poured material. To ensure acceptable grout properties for disposal and immobilization of the salt waste, the grout temperature must not exceed 95 C during hydration. Adiabatic calorimetric measurements of the heat generated for {{a representative sample of}} saltstone were made to determine the time-dependent heat source term.

40|$|Prepacked {{aggregate}} concrete (PAC) {{is a special}} type of concrete which is made by placing coarse aggregate in a formwork and injecting a <b>grout</b> either by <b>pump</b> or under gravity force to fill the voids. Utilization of pozzolanic materials in traditional concrete has become increasingly extensive, and this trend {{is expected to continue}} in prepacked concrete as well.

This paper presents the results of some experimental tests on the performance behavior of POFA in developing physical and mechanical properties of prepacked {{aggregate concrete}}. Four concrete mixes namely prepacked concrete with 100 % OPC as control, and PAC with 10 %, 20 % and 30 % POFA were cast, and the temperature growth due to heat of hydration in all the mixtures was recorded. It has been found that POFA significantly reduced the temperature rise in prepacked concrete. The compressive and tensile strength, however, increased with replacement of POFA.

50|$|Soil nailing is a {{construction}} remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as {{a construction}} technique {{that allows the}} safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope - often general purpose reinforcing bars (rebar) although proprietary solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Solid bars are usually installed into pre-drilled holes and then grouted into place using a separate grout line, whereas hollow bars may be drilled and grouted simultaneously {{by the use of}} a sacrificial drill bit and by <b>pumping</b> <b>grout</b> down the hollow bar as drilling progresses. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination with bars installed at regularly spaced points across the slope face. A rigid facing (often pneumatically applied concrete, otherwise known as shotcrete) or isolated soil nail head plates may be used at the surface. Alternatively a flexible reinforcing mesh may be held against the soil face beneath the head plates. Rabbit proof wire mesh and environmental erosion control fabrics and may be used in conjunction with flexible mesh facing where environmental conditions dictate.|$|R
40|$|The Saltstone Facility, {{located within}} the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, South Carolina, {{consists}} of two facility segments: The Saltstone Production Facility (SPF) and the Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF). The SPF receives decontaminated legacy low level sodium salt waste solution that is a byproduct of prior nuclear material processing. The salt solution is mixed with cementitious materials to form a grout slurry known as “Saltstone”. The <b>grout</b> is <b>pumped</b> to the SDF where it is placed in a Saltstone Disposal Unit (SDU) to solidify. SDU 6 {{is referred to as}} a “mega vault” and is currently in the design stage. The conceptual design for SDU 6 is a single cell, cylindrical geometry approximately 114. 3 meters in diameter by 13. 1 meter high and is larger than previous cylindrical SDU designs, 45. 7 meters in diameter by 7. 01 meters high (30 million gallons versus 2. 9 million gallons of capacity). Saltstone slurry will be pumped into the new waste disposal unit through roof openings at a projected flow rate of about 34. 1 cubic meters per hour. Nine roof openings are included in the design to discharge material into the SDU with an estimated grout pour radius of 22. 9 to 24. 4 meters and initial drop height of 13. 1 meters. The conceptual design for the new SDU does not include partitions to limit the pour radius of the grout slurry during placement other than introducing material from different pour points. This paper addresses two technical issues associated with the larger diameter of SDU 6; saltstone flow distance in a tank 114. 3 meters in diameter and quality of the grout. A long-radius flow test scaled to match the velocity of an advancing grout front was designed to address these technology gaps. The emphasis of the test was to quantify the flow distance and to collect samples to evaluate cured properties including compressive strength, porosity, density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Two clean cap surrogate mixes (saltstone premix plus water) were designed to simulate slurry with the reference saltstone rheology and a saltstone with extra water from the process flushing operation. Long-radius flow tests were run using approximately 4. 6 cubic meters of each of these mixes. In both tests the pump rate was 0. 063 liters/second (1 gpm). A higher pump rate, 0. 19 liters/second (3 gpm), was used in a third long-radius flow test. The angle of repose of the grout wedges increased as a function of time in all three tests. The final angles of repose were measured at 3. 0 º, 2. 4 º, and 0. 72 º. The pump rate had the largest effect on the radial flow distance and slope of the grout surface. The slope on the pour placed at 0. 19 liters/second (3 gpm) was most representative of the slope on the <b>grout</b> currently being <b>pumped</b> into SDU 2 which is estimated to be 0. 7 º to 0. 9 º. The final grout heights at 1 / 3 of a meter from the discharge point were 115, 105, and 38 cm. Entrapped air (≥ 0. 25 cm bubbles) was also observed in all of the mixes. The entrapped air appeared to be released from the flows within about 3. 1 meters (10 feet) of the discharge point. The bleed water was clear but had a thin layer of floating particulates. The bleed water should be retrievable by a drain water collection system in SDU 6 assuming the system does not get clogged. Layering was observed and was attributed to intervals when the hopper was being cleaned. Heat from the hydration reactions was noticeable to the touch...|$|R
40|$|The Tank Closure and Technology Development Groups are {{developing}} a strategy for closing the High Level Waste (HLW) tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Two Type IV tanks, 17 and 20 in the F-Area Tank Farm, have been successfully filled with grout. Type IV tanks at SRS do not contain cooling coils; on the other hand, {{the majority of the}} tanks (Type I, II, III and IIIA) do contain cooling coils. The current concept for closing tanks equipped with cooling coils is to <b>pump</b> <b>grout</b> into the cooling coils to prevent pathways for infiltrating water after tank closure. This task addresses the use of grout to fill intact cooling coils present in most of the remaining HLW tanks on Site. The overall task was divided into two phases. Phase 1 focused on the development of a grout formulation (mix design) suitable for filling the HLW tank cooling coils. Phase 2 will be a large-scale demonstration of the filling of simulated cooling coils under field conditions using the cooling coil grout mix design recommended from Phase 1. This report summarizes the results of Phase 1, the development of the cooling coil grout formulation. A grout formulation is recommended for the full scale testing at Clemson Environmental Technology Laboratory (CETL) that is composed by mass of 90 % Masterflow (MF) 816 (a commercially available cable grout) and 10 % blast furnace slag, with a water to cementitious material (MF 816 + slag) ratio of 0. 33. This formulation produces a grout that meets the fresh and cured grout requirements detailed in the Task Technical Plan (2). The grout showed excellent workability under continuous mixing with minimal change in rheology. An alternative formulation using 90 % MF 1341 and 10 % blast furnace slag with a water to cementitious material ratio of 0. 29 is also acceptable and generates less heat per gram than the MF 816 plus slag mix. However this MF 1341 mix has a higher plastic viscosity than the MF 816 mix due to the presence of sand in the MF 1341 cable grout and a lower water to solids ratio. Nevertheless, the higher viscosity grout may still meet the requirements for the cooling coil <b>grout</b> under certain <b>pumping</b> conditions or alternatively, the mix may be made more fluid by a short period of high shear mixing during production. The mixes have not been optimized for large scale production. It may be possible, for example, to adjust the water to cementitious materials ratio to provide improved performance of these mixes based on the results and conclusions of the large scale testing at CETL. Recommendations from this task include incorporation of a backup mixing/pumping system that is either integrated into the system or is available for immediate use in case of a pump or mixer failure of the primary system. A second recommendation is to conduct a laboratory scale investigation to determine the impact of operational variation on the properties of the grout. This effort would be initiated after feedback is received from the large scale testing at CETL. The purpose of this proposed variability testing is to better understand the limits of the operational variations (such as temperature and mixing time), and to identify possible approaches for remediation to ensure that the grout produced will flow effectively in the coils while still meeting the performance requirements...|$|R
40|$|Cementitious {{composites}} with adapted rheology {{are becoming}} increasingly used {{in a wide variety}} of civil engineering applications. Assessing the fundamental rheological properties of cement suspensions is a crucial task, instrumental not only to mix-design of SCCs and assessment of its fresh state performance, but also to the design of casting procedures, such as <b>pumping,</b> <b>grouting,</b> underground and underwater injections etc., where the rheology of the fluid may discriminate the successful accomplishment of the application. The measurement of the fundamental rheological properties of cement suspensions is a not simple task and requires dedicated and expensive equipments which are not compatible with field applications and may not even be available in every laboratory. Correlations between fundamental properties and field test measurements have hence been sought and, in some cases, quite well assessed, as, e. g., for the yield stress vs. the spread diameter in slump/minislump flow test. As for the viscosity, different attempts have been made, e. g. with the Marsh cone flow time or with the time to reach a prescribed diameter in the slump flow tests. This works aims at providing further evidence to the aforementioned correlations, with reference to a broad range of cement pastes and mortars formulated from High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC). A robust assessment by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling will be performed, employing an approach developed by the second author.

40|$|If {{the minimum}} {{anticipated}} fluid temperature in a ground source {{heat pump system}} falls near or below 0 oC, an antifreeze mixture must be used to prevent freezing in the heat pump. The antifreeze mixture type and concentration has a number of implications for the design and performance of the system. These include the required ground loop heat exchanger length, the capacity and energy consumption of the heat pump, the circulating pump selection, pumping energy, and the first cost of the system. For example, the required ground loop heat exchanger length and first cost will decrease, due to lower permissible operating temperatures, with increasing antifreeze concentration in heating-dominated climates. On the other hand, the antifreeze also degrades the heat pump performance; operating costs can be expected to increase with increasing antifreeze concentration, and a larger capacity heat pump may be needed. The complex interaction between all of the design variables makes it difficult to choose an optimal design, and it is desirable to have a simulation and life cycle cost analysis {{that can be used to}} evaluate all of the variable interactions, to be used as the basis for an optimal design procedure. This paper reports on a simulation procedure implemented in HVACSIM+ and a life cycle cost analysis and gives example result for a typical Canadian residential building.

40|$|Backfilling and {{injection}} of granular materials into mining induced voids, separated beddings, and cracks, as either diluted slurry or concrete paste, {{is widely used}} to control coal mine subsidence. As a viable environmental solution, mine waste and rejected materials from underground coal seams are used in both backfilling and injection mine operations. During longwall mining, the <b>grout</b> slurry is <b>pumped</b> into the separated beds of the fractured rock mass through a pipeline connected to a central vertical borehole, which is drilled deep into the interburden rock strata above the coal seam. Either as dilute slurry or thick paste or cake, the fill material normally needs to travel a significant distance in a long pipeline. A blockage can occur in the pipeline when the slurry velocity falls below a certain critical threshold value, indicating a material phase change from cohesive-viscous to cohesive-frictional. In a previous study of radial flow through disks, complete analytical solutions of the required pump pressure versus fluid volume rate were presented for such slurries, categorized as frictional Bingham-Herschel-Bulkley fluids. This paper is an extension {{to the theory of}} fluid mechanics to this type of flow in uniform circular pipes. General analytical solutions were developed for complex fluids in velocity and pressure gradients and velocity and pressure as a function of pipe length, from which special and familiar equations for simpler fluids are derivable by mathematical reduction of the general equations. This study differs from the previous research in consideration of the variable shear parameters rather than fixed values, inclusion of total nonlinear behavior, and implementation of a friction function to mimic behavior of the depositing and consolidating stiff slurry, which can cause a significant pressure rise {{as a result of the}} increased shear resistance...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{support for the}} Tank Closure and Technology Development (TCTD) group's strategy for closing high level radioactive waste (HLW) tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Specifically, this task addresses the ability to successfully fill intact cooling coils, presently within the HLW tanks, with grout that satisfies the fresh and cured grout requirements [1] under simulated field conditions. The overall task was divided into two phases. The first phase was {{the development of a}} grout formulation that satisfies the processing requirements for filling the HLW tank cooling coils [5]. The second phase of the task, which is documented in this report, was the filling of full scale cooling coils under simulated field conditions using the grout formulation developed in the first phase. SRS Type I tank cooling coil assembly design drawings and pressure drop calculations were provided by the Liquid Waste (LW) customer to be used as the basis for configuring the test assemblies. The current concept for closing tanks equipped with internal cooling coils is to <b>pump</b> <b>grout</b> into the coils to inhibit pathways for infiltrating water. Access to the cooling coil assemblies is through the existing supply/return manifold headers located on top of the Type I tanks. The objectives for {{the second phase of the}} testing, as stated in the Task Technical and Quality Assurance plan (TTQAP) [2], were to: (1) Perform a demonstration test to assess cooling coil grout performance in simulated field conditions, and (2) Measure relevant properties of samples prepared under simulated field conditions. SRNL led the actual work of designing, fabricating and filling two full-scale cooling coil assemblies which were performed at Clemson Engineering Technologies Laboratory (CETL) using the South Carolina University Research and Education Foundation (SCUREF) program. A statement of work (SOW) was issued to CETL [6] to perform this work...|$|R
40|$|Mining induced {{subsidence}} {{can significantly}} affect mining costs where major surface facilities and natural environment {{need to be}} protected. Overburden grout injection is a technology used to control coal mine subsidence by injecting the mine waste material extracted from the coal back into the inter-burden rock during longwall mining. The flowing slurry is here categorised as a nonlinear viscous cohesive (Bingham plastic) fluid. During longwall mining the <b>grout</b> slurry is <b>pumped</b> into the separated beds of the rock mass through a central vertical borehole, which is drilled deep into the inter-burden rock strata above the coal seam. However, a blockage can occur in the injection system when the slurry velocity falls below a certain critical threshold velocity, indicating a material phase change from cohesive-viscous to cohesive-frictional. In situ field injection tests through boreholes have been simulated at a smaller scale at the CSIRO laboratory in Brisbane by pumping the slurry through a radial disk (gap = 4  mm) from its centre. Laboratory experiments indicate a general, nonlinear, cohesive, viscous, frictional model for shear behaviour of the slurry, in which the material shear parameters are functions of the disk radial distance. Complete dimensional and dimensionless analytical solutions have been developed based on an approach related to Bingham-Herschel-Bulkley fluid mechanics. The derived formulae include relations for minimum pump pressure, local pressure and pressure gradient, wall shear stress, volume rate, velocity and velocity gradient. The theoretical results match the experimental measurements. The experiments covered slurries with maximum particle sizes of 0. 5 to 2  mm with about 50 % being larger than 100  μm. The viscosities at the various solids concentrations were measured with a standard torsion viscometer. This study differs from the previous research in several distinct aspects, namely, consideration of the variable shear parameters rather than fixed values, inclusion of total nonlinear behaviour, and implementation of a friction function to mimic behaviour of the deposited and consolidating stiff slurry, which can cause a significant pressure rise {{as a result of}} the increased shear resistance.

40|$|For {{around two}} decades of {{research}} and development in the field of grouting in hard jointed rock, the design process has taken some leaps forward. Stille and Gustafson, 2005 and Funehag and Gustafson 2008, shows how a grouting design can be computed. A grouting design in hard rock can based on the penetration length of grout in rock fractures. The design comprises considerations of the fracture apertures in the rock mass, the type of grout and its rheological properties and how the grout is injected i. e pressure and grouting times. When knowing these parameters an optimized geometry fitting the design is made. Thörn, et al, 2014 describes a fundamental analysis with a comprehensive tool to retrieve the fracture distribution and aperture distribution of the fractures crossing a cored borehole. The data needed about the core is geological mapping and hydraulic section tests. In Gustafson, Claesson and Fransson, (2013) a full derivation of a radial Bingham flow in a slit is described for constant pressure. By optimizing with a specific pressure and an efficient grouting time (efficient time means the time when the pressure has reached the designed pressure) a prognosis a more realistic time consumption for grouting can be computed. However, {{the time it takes to}} reach a certain pressure is dependent on the capacity of the pump and the how large the fractures widths are. For poorly chosen pumps together with large fractures the time to reach the design pressure can be significant. The overall objective for this new formulation was to involve the grouting pressure as a variable rather than constant. A pressure build-up mimic more a realistic pumping scenario which enables better prognosis of grouting works. This paper brings up this new formulation of the radial Bingham flow with variable injection pressure in slit. The benefits of this new formulation is that it can easily be integrated in other computer programs. One program that uses this new formulation is a grouting simulator owned and developed by Edvirt AB. The simulator has been used to pedagogically demonstrate how a variable pressure and restrictions in <b>grout</b> flow (the <b>pump</b> capacity) affect the penetration length. Further, the results show that it can be used to predict suitable pump capacity to fit the coming grouting works...|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} {{successfully}} {{demonstrated that the}} extraction ratio in a room-and-pillar panel at an Illinois mine can be increased from the current value of approximately 56 % to about 64 %, with backfilling done from the surface upon completion of all mining activities. This was achieved without significant ground control problems due to the increased extraction ratio. The mined-out areas were backfilled from the surface with gob, coal combustion by-products (CCBs), and fine coal processing waste (FCPW) -based paste backfill containing 65 %- 70 % solids to minimize short-term and long-term surface deformations risk. This concept {{has the potential to}} increase mine productivity, reduce mining costs, manage large volumes of CCBs beneficially, and improve the miner's health, safety, and environment. Two injection holes were drilled over the demonstration panel to inject the paste backfill. Backfilling was started on August 11, 1999 through the first borehole. About 9, 293 tons of paste backfill were injected through this borehole with a maximum flow distance of 300 -ft underground. On September 27, 2000, backfilling operation was resumed through the second borehole with a mixture of F ash and FBC ash. A high-speed auger mixer (new technology) was used to mix solids with water. About 6, 000 tons of paste backfill were injected underground through this hole. Underground backfilling using the ''Groutnet'' flow model was simulated. Studies indicate that grout flow over 300 -foot distance is possible. Approximately 13, 000 tons of <b>grout</b> may be <b>pumped</b> through a single hole. The effect of backfilling on the stability of the mine workings was analyzed using SIUPANEL. 3 D computer program and further verified using finite element analysis techniques. Stiffness of the backfill mix is most critical for enhancing the stability of mine workings. Mine openings {{do not have to be}} completely backfilled to enhance their stability. Backfill height of about 50 % of the seam height is adequate to minimize surface deformations. Freeman United Coal Company performed engineering economic evaluation studies for commercialization. They found that the costs for underground management at the Crown III mine would be slightly higher than surface management at this time. The developed technologies have commercial potential but each site must be analyzed on its merit. The Company maintains significant interest in commercializing the technology...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) is in {{the process}} of closing two {{underground}} high-level waste (HLW) storage tanks at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to meet Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations and Department of Energy orders. Closure of these two tanks is scheduled for 2004 as the first phase in closure of the eleven 1. 14 million liter (300, 000 gallon) tanks currently in service at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC). The INTEC Tank Farm Facility (TFF) Closure sequence consists of multiple steps to be accomplished through the existing tank riser access points. Currently, the tank risers contain steam and process waste lines associated with the steam jets, corrosion coupons, and liquid level indicators. As necessary, this equipment will be removed from the risers to allow adequate space for closure equipment and activities. The basic tank closure sequence is as follows: Empty the tank to the residual heel using the existing jets; Video and sample the heel; Replace steam jets with new jet at a lower position in the tank, and remove additional material; Flush tank, piping and secondary containment with demineralized water; Video and sample the heel; Evaluate decontamination effectiveness; Displace the residual heel with multiple placements of grout; and Grout piping, vaults and remaining tank volume. Design, development, and deployment of a remotely operated tank cleaning system were completed in June 2002. The system incorporates many commercially available components, which have been adapted for application in cleaning high-level waste tanks. The system is cost-effective since it also utilizes existing waste transfer technology (steam jets), to remove tank heel solids from the tank bottoms during the cleaning operations. Remotely operated directional spray nozzles, automatic rotating wash balls, video monitoring equipment, decontamination spray-rings, and tank -specific access interface devices have been integrated to provide a system that efficiently cleans tank walls and heel solids in an acidic, radioactive environment. Through the deployment of the tank cleaning system, the INEEL High Level Waste Program has cleaned tanks to meet RCRA clean closure standards and DOE closure performance measures. Design, development, and testing of tank grouting delivery equipment were completed in October 2002. The system incorporates lessons learned from closures at other DOE facilities. The grout will be used to displace the tank residuals remaining after the cleaning is complete. To maximize heel displacement to the discharge <b>pump,</b> <b>grout</b> was placed in a sequence of five positions utilizing two riser locations. The project is evaluating the use of six positions to optimize the residuals removed. After the heel has been removed and the residuals stabilized, the tank, piping, and secondary containment will be grouted...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{restoration}} of the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was a priority to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) because of their age and deteriorating structure. These eight tanks ranging up to 170, 000 gallons in capacity were constructed in 1943 of a Gunite or ''sprayed concrete material'' {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project. The tanks initially received highly radioactive waste from the Graphite Reactor and associated chemical processing facilities. The waste was temporarily stored in these tanks to allow for radioactive decay prior to dilution and release into surface waters. Over time, additional wastes from ongoing ORNL operations (e. g., isotope separation and materials research) were discharged to the tanks for storage and treatment. These tanks were taken out of service in the 1970 s. Based on the structure integrity of GAAT evaluated in 1995, the worst-case scenario for the tanks, even assuming they are in good condition, is to remain empty. A recently completed interim action conducted from April 1997 through September 2000 removed the tank liquids and residual solids to the extent practical. Interior video surveys of the tanks indicated signs of degradation of the Gunite material. The tanks continued to receive inleakage, which generated a relatively high volume waste stream that required periodic removal, treatment, and disposal. For these reasons, DOE chose in-place stabilization of Tanks W- 3 through W- 10 as a non-timecritical removal action under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). Tank stabilization activities involved removal of liquid from inleakage and placement of a grout mixture or ''flowable fill'' into the tanks to within 3 -ft of the ground surface. Bechtel Jacobs Company, LLC (BJC) awarded Safety and Ecology Corporation (SEC) a subcontract in March 2001 to complete the documentation and fieldwork necessary to achieve tank stabilization in accordance with the Action Memorandum. Tank stabilization activities began on April 23, 2001, and were completed one month ahead of schedule on August 31, 2001. Over 7400 cubic yards of grout were placed in these tanks stabilizing over 4, 000 Ci of radioactive material in place. This schedule acceleration was the result of good pre-planning during pre-mobilization by working with BJC, <b>grout</b> vendor, and <b>pumping</b> company, and other subcontractors. This planning allowed refinement of the pump and hose system used to convey the grout and the formulation of the grout mixture. Because of expediting the work, additional activities could be accomplished at the GAAT site that resulted in complete site restoration to a paved area for future parking, which was completed by September 30, 2001. This paper will focus on the following items associated with this successful environmental restoration project: regulatory process; integrated safety management systems used to achieve zero accident performance while expediting the schedule; tank stabilization design and implementation; and implementation strategies involving partnering of multiple subcontractors, DOE, and regulators...|$|R
40|$|In {{areas of}} high traffic, long term bridge {{construction}} can have significant {{impacts on the}} traveling public and surrounding communities. To minimize this impact, engineers and contractors prefabricate bridge elements and utilize technologies that facilitate rapid bridge assembly. This strategy is known as Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) and has gained {{the attention of the}} bridge community as information and the benefits of ABC projects has been shared. There is untapped potential in this movement as some advantages of certain bridge types, like the integral abutment bridge, have seen limited use. Integral abutment bridges were developed as a means of eliminating the expansion joint from the bridge superstructure which present long term maintenance concerns. To eliminate the joint, integral abutments rigidly connect the superstructure and foundation so that the entire structure experiences thermal expansion and contraction as one. For this reason, the integral abutment is often large and heavily reinforced which present challenges for use in ABC projects. The size of the abutment presents weight issues and mechanical splicing of the abutment to the deep foundation presents tight construction tolerances. This research investigated integral abutment details for use in ABC projects through mechanical splicing of the integral diaphragm and the pile cap. To complete this task, two ABC details were evaluated in the laboratory based on constructability, strength and durability. The construction process used to fabricate and erect the specimen was documented and is presented in this report, as this criteria often governs the design of ABC details. The specimen were tested for strength and durability by simulating thermal loads and live loads. Strain gages placed on the concrete and reinforcing steel captured the strain developed in the testing to evaluate strength. Displacement transducers placed across the precast joint measured the crack width that developed under loading in order to assess durability. The ABC details investigated are the grouted rebar coupler detail and the pile coupler detail. In order to establish baseline performances for an integral abutment, a typical cast-in-place detail was also constructed and tested. In the grouted rebar coupler detail, a plywood template was used to “match cast” the pile cap and the integral diaphragm. The template marked the locations of the spliced reinforcing steel and served as the base for the formwork in the integral diaphragm, holding the grouted couplers in position. The template proved to be simple to construct and resulted in the successful alignment of seventeen spliced steel bars and grouted couplers over the length of an eight foot specimen. A <b>grout</b> bed was <b>pumped</b> into the precast joint on the specimen, unfortunately grout leaked past two of the grouted coupler seals and obstructed the grouting of two couplers. Even with the two un-grouted rebar couplers, there was more than adequate strength created by the connection and the crack width that developed at the precast joint was comparable to that of the cast-in-place specimen. The pile coupler detail was developed to facilitate the use of a slide in bridge with integral abutments. The pile coupler reduced the number of spliced connections between the pile cap and integral diaphragm significantly in order to facilitate adequate construction tolerances. The splicing system worked well during construction; however the detail’s performance in terms of strength and durability was less than ideal. If there is a demand for the benefits of the pile coupler detail in terms of constructability, the detail should be further investigated as several lessons were learned from the testing which could improve the structural performance of the detail...|$|R

When {{the ground is}} insufficient such as bearing capacity problems of shallow foundations on weak soils, large setting etc [...] , deep foundations and/or soil improvement methods are considered for solving the problems.   Many constructions of deep foundation have been made desired depth and purpose with different machine and equipment since 60 years. Especially pile foundations commonly used {{the purpose of the}} main function is to transfer the load to lower levels in the ground which are capable of sustaining the load with an adequate factor of safety. Soil improvement methods can be preferred to when pile foundations can not be used. The purpose of the {{jet grouting}}, uses a high-pressure jet of fluid to break up and loosen the soil at depth in a borehole and to mix it with a self-hardening grout to form columns in the ground. At the end of this proses more strength and new soilcrete is occured without reinforcement. Jet grouting systems define that a special drill bit with horizontal and vertical high speed water jets to cut soils and constructed hard impervious columns by <b>pumping</b> <b>grout</b> through the nozzles. Jet grouting systems is not depend on grain size distrubitions. There are three fluid systems and can make coulums in any soils. The advantages of jet grouting systems can be listed below: § It is more economical and efficient than the other injection methods. § Je grout columns can be made different geometry. § Jet grout columns can be made any depths which is desired. § Application of columns are easier than other methos of improvement methods. The purpose of pile foundations is to transfer the loads that are from superstructure to lower levels which are capable the sustaining the loads with factor of safety without setting and has bearing capacity.   Pile foundations are used when the soil under the foundation has not bearing capacity and/or not capable the loads with factor of safety with setting. During this situations, mat foundation and spread footings can not be used with factor of safety on this soils. There are four type piles which are listed below: § Frictions piles § End – bearing piles § Compactions piles § Anchor piles Different kind of piles have been discussed. Before choosing of pile types, economical situations and factor of safety of design use. According to material used in their installation can be classified below: § Concrete piles § Steel Piles § Timber piles During the design methods of pile foudation, pile loads can be divided in three groups. This loads are listed below: § Dynamic formulas § Static formulas § Load tests Pile load test method is the most certain method to determine the bearing capacity of piles. Testing a pile for failure make sure that valuable information about pile setting and bearing capacity to design engineer. The static pile load test is common method of testing to considered capacity of piles. It is applicaple to all kind of pile types and it involves the direct measurement of pile heads displacement. Pile load test have three objectives: § To establish load-deflections relationships in the pile-soil systems § To determine capacity of the pile-soil system  § To determine load distrubition in the pile-soil system Three types of loading for a static load tests are given below: § The quick load test § The incremental static load test § The constant rate of penetration test  The static load test was conducted in general accordance with ASTM-D 1143.   During the this thesis; design criteria of pile foundations, construction phases and the reasons what designer uses pile foundation are explained. Additionaly, operating parameters of jet grouting which is a soil improvement methods, construction phases, advantages and limitations of the methods are explained. In the application part of thesis, Zonguldak Catalagzi Power Plant project was given for an example. Site investigations and labrotary works were completed before the design phase. Totally 11 pieces boreholes were done and from these application disturbed and undisturbed samples collected. At the end of the site investigation phase of design were completed.   During the construction of Coal Stock Area, some problems were occurred. The problems that are bedrock is different depth in area and the soil on the bedrock is weak, during the drilling can be use casing. So this problem was solved with jet grouting that was constructed between bedrock and end of pile. After the construction of jet grout columns (dia. 80 cm), pile (dia. 100 cm) was applied in jet grout column which is socketed in 3 meters in improvement area that was made with jet grout columns. Jet grout columns under the pile was constructed 9 columns with intersects 10 cm to create a unit improvement area. Hereby an improvement area was created to socketed the pile foundations. Then the pile load test performed on the pile that is named KSS/ 159 and the results were given in thesis to determine the bearing capacity of pile and setting value. During the pile load test on number of KSS/ 159 test pile, the pile was installed on 150 % of the service load of pile. According to results of static load test amount of displacement was measured at 4 mm. In this thesis, jet grouting which is a soil improvement method and pile foundation, which is a deep foundation method, are investigated and told construction phases of two methods. For understanding of applicability and performance of combined system, Zonguldak Catalagzi Power Plant project is investigated. The purpose of the thesis, different systems can be used together.
