5|$|Castell y Bere is a Welsh castle near Llanfihangel-y-pennant in Gwynedd, Wales. Constructed by Llywelyn the Great in the 1220s, {{the stone}} castle was {{intended}} to maintain his authority over the local people and to defend the south-west part of the princedom of Gwynedd. In 1282 war with Edward I of England resulted {{in the death of}} Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Castell y Bere fell to English forces. Edward I expanded the castle further and established a small town beside it. In 1294 the Welsh leader Madoc ap Llywelyn mounted a major revolt and the castle was besieged and apparently burnt. Edward did not repair it and it became ruined. Today it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction.|$|E

Ignoring instructions to return to Cloudbase, with his Spectrum Jet under fire from the Angel fighter squadron, the Scarlet duplicate ejects himself and the President over southern England; on the ground, both the duplicate and the President, the latter being held hostage, set off towards London in a stolen car.|$|E

25|$|Cousin {{marriage}} normally {{results in}} a reduced bride price. Patai states that bride price to a cousin is usually about half as high as to a nonrelative.

The bride's family moreover is expected to spend much of the bride price on the bride herself, {{so there is a}} reduced incentive to gain a higher price by avoiding cousin marriage.|$|E
