2500|$|McKagan {{was one of}} {{the last}} people {{confirmed}} to have seen Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain before he died on April 5, 1994. He sat next to Cobain on a flight from Los Angeles to Seattle on April 1. McKagan later recalled, [...] "I didn't have any foresight that the guy was going to do what he did. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bummed out, and I'd been that way before... I thought I'd ask him to come stay at my house; I turned around and he was gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Haggard {{recorded}} [...] "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive," [...] {{also written}} by Liz Anderson {{with her husband}} Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single. When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch. Bonnie Owens, Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road: [...] "I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he {{never talked about it}} all that much.... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Cause I'm afraid someday I'm gonna be out there ... and there's gonna be ... some prisoner ... in there the same time I was in, stand up—and they're gonna be about the third row down—and say, 'What do you think you're doing, 45200?'" [...] Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard's career: [...] "It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in Music City News, his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge." ...|$|E

For all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead. I never {{wanted him to be}} dead," [...] she defended herself to herself in {{something}} above the intelligence of the boy. [...] "I married Laban, who's been more of a father to you than what he was." ...|$|E
40|$|My {{interview}} with Melvin young takes {{places in the}} sun porch of the senior center where he tends to eat {{the majority of his}} meals. Melvin has hearing aids in both his ears but surprisingly it seems as though he hears better than I do. Melvin is a Korean War vet and seems very pleased to be interviewed even though through the duration of the interview <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> is a man of few words...|$|R
5000|$|He Lemmy {{gets home}} tour, {{we have a}} big {{birthday}} party for him at the Whisky A Go Go. His friends came down and played. Two days later <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> wasn't feeling good. So we took him to the hospital. They release him. Then after the brain scan, they found the cancer in his brain and his neck. The doctor comes with the result {{a couple of days later}} and says [...] "It's terminal." ...|$|R

60|$|Made {{reckless}} by this, I {{stepped down}} to another branch {{directly over the}} bear, and tried again to rope him. It was of no use. He {{slipped out of the}} noose with the sinuous movements of an eel. Once it caught over his ears and in his open jaws. He gave a jerk that nearly pulled me from my perch. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> growing angrier every instant, and also braver. Suddenly the noose, quite by accident, caught his nose. He wagged his head and I pulled. The noose tightened.|$|E
5000|$|... "As far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> happy," [...] said fellow Cracked artist Dan Clowes. [...] "I dont {{think he}} ever {{seemed to notice}} that Mad was respected, whereas Cracked was loathed." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "If Tomorrow Never Comes" [...] will {{probably}} always be my signature song. I ran {{the idea for}} this song by {{what seemed like a}} thousand writers and no one really seemed to understand what I was looking for. On the day that Bob Doyle, my co-manager, introduced me to Kent Blazy, I passed this idea by Kent and he had the first verse down within fifteen seconds. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> just felt it. Kent Blazy is a wonderful man, full of love and energy, and if we never write again, I hope that we are always friends first. Think you Ireland for this moment." ...|$|R

5000|$|Barbara Marx married Sinatra on July 11, 1976, {{and they}} {{remained}} married {{until his death}} on May 14, 1998. It was his fourth and final marriage, and her third and final marriage.

According to her book, Lady Blue Eyes: My Life With Frank, [...] "He Frank never asked me to change faith for him, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pleased that I'd consider it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stewart set {{conditions}} {{for working with}} Tyson that included better behavior and academic achievement. Tyson met Stewart's conditions {{and they began to}} work together. Stewart said, “He was a complete gentleman as he wanted to fight so bad.” Stewart also noticed Mike's physique; at 13, the young detainee from Brooklyn weighted 190 pounds while standing only 5 feet 8 inches tall. Stewart told a friend, “Some have made him out to be a 120 pound weakling or something like that before I got hold of him but he wasn’t anything like that. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> strong and later I found out just how strong he really was.” [...] His powerful build suggested boxing potential to Stewart and Tyson's work ethic strengthened that opinion.|$|E
5000|$|Moving to Radio Invicta, Spence {{maintained}} his actor-DJ style. However, {{by the time}} he arrived at Radio London in late 1966 his performance was still considered [...] "stuffy" [...] by senior DJ Tony Windsor and programme director Ben Toney. Windsor was tasked with turning Neil Spence the announcer and presenter into Dave Dennis the DJ, and was asked by Toney to [...] "break in" [...] Spence and [...] "give him a few tips on how to present a proper deejay show." [...] Spence, who had grown up with little else to listen to except the BBC, responded poorly to Windsor's direction. [...] "In the end <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to drive Dave around the bend," [...] said Toney, who then asked Spence to use his acting training and in effect to create [...] "Dave Dennis, the Double-D" [...] as a character to be played on air.|$|E
5000|$|Jia Jia {{reference}} to Chua's online handle {{did not get}} why he had to re-do the scenes so many times.

It was very painful for a mother to watch.|$|R

60|$|The detective {{knew we were}} booked {{through for}} Edinburgh. So much <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> because <b>I</b> saw him make {{inquiries}} of the ticket examiner at York, and again at Berwick, and because the ticket-examiner thereupon entered a mental note of the fact as he punched my ticket each time: 'Oh, Edinburgh, miss? All right'; and then stared at me suspiciously. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> {{had heard of the}} Ashurst will case. He also lingered long about the Maharajah's compartment, and then went back to confer with the detective. Thus, putting two and two together, as a woman will, I {{came to the conclusion that}} the spy did not expect us to leave the train before we reached Edinburgh. That told in our favour. Most men trust much to just such vague expectations. They form a theory, and then neglect the adverse chances. You can only get the better of a skilled detective by taking him thus, psychologically and humanly.|$|R

5000|$|The other {{moment with}} Steve that really {{stands out in}} my mind was when I decided to contact him about getting back in the ring at WrestleReunion 2 in Valley Forge, PA. He was {{concerned}} and rightfully so with {{what he was going}} through that everything would have to go well. I assured him that I had the perfect opponent in mind for him. It was Mike Kaluha from Pennsylvania. I had met Mike early on in my career and I knew he was the right man for the job. He was solid in the ring and a credible human being outside the ring. He understood why he was there and I knew he wouldn’t let me down. Well, although Steve knew me, he didn’t know Mike and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> plenty worried. After a while he kept coming to me with his concerns I asked him to trust me that I wouldn’t put him in harm’s way at all. If I hadn’t had the right guy we wouldn’t have even done this. Well, Steve had his comeback match and afterwards came to me and apologized for giving me so much grief and to let me know I had made the right choice of opponent and how appreciative he was. I am not sure exactly what has gone in with Steve’s in ring career since that match in August 2005 but I am sure that was a very special moment for him if not his last really great in ring moment. It was a great moment for me as well it will always be with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you,--till <b>he</b> had spoken? And yet I knew it myself! It {{has been}} so,--oh,--ever so long! What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do? You {{will say that}} you will forgive me." ...|$|R
60|$|I hesitated. Should I whisper {{something}} to him? But what? His immobility {{seemed to have}} been never disturbed. What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>he</b> did not know already?... Finally I went on deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Decidedly {{he has had}} {{too much}} wine," [...] I thought; and I {{did not know what}} answer to make to his queer question: how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> whether <b>he</b> was capable of being re-transformed? ...|$|R
6000|$|The boy {{burst into}} a fit of laughter. [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>he</b> was going to fall flat upon the ground and shout a million murders, when I fired {{straight}} into the air?" ...|$|R
60|$|I was sorely perplexed {{and deeply}} touched. Never had I a harder task {{than that of}} the hour--to put her out of my mind. I went boldly to Steele's house. He was not there. There was nothing by which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> when <b>he</b> had been there. The lamp might have been turned out or might have burned out. The oil was low. I saw a good many tracks round in the sandy walks. I did not {{recognize}} Steele's.|$|R
50|$|What {{kind of a}} man is Yao Chang? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> when <b>he</b> {{would go}} and when he would come. Everyone thought that he is near death, but he lives to fight. It is unfortunate that I live {{at the same time}} as this old Qiang.|$|R
60|$|When we got up-stairs to {{his room}} he got me a coarse shirt and a {{roundabout}} and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he asked me what my name was, but before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>he</b> started to <b>tell</b> me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, {{and he asked me}} where Moses was when the candle went out. I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.|$|R
5000|$|... "Up to the Mountain" [...] first {{appeared}} in public during Griffin's concert appearances {{in the spring of}} 2005; she has performed it both with her own acoustic guitar accompaniment and also with a band member's electric guitar. Based upon a rough demo, it was suggested to and selected by soul artist Solomon Burke (who had known King) for recording on his September 2006 album Nashville. Griffin participated in the recording, singing a backup part; she later said, [...] "He sang it ten times I think, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> when <b>he</b> got his take—little chills came on my arms." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{recommended}} this fellow, Stanborough, if you remember.

You told me to bring him round here this afternoon, you remember, to talk things over. He's waiting downstairs.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} say any more, for Dora, who had been watching, here burst on us with cries of welcome, and it was long before there was any renewal of the conversation, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>he</b> really persuaded himself {{that he had no}} hopes, or was waiting to see how matters should turn out.|$|R
50|$|Anders Parker is a first-generation Swedish American. He {{was born}} circa 1970 {{and grew up}} in Upstate New York, in the Hudson Valley, in a musical family. His father lived in Vermont. In the 1990s Anders moved briefly to Portland, Oregon. He spent some time in North Carolina where he lived with Matt Brown, founder of Bladen County Records. Brown recalled: “I lived with Anders for a while. We odd coupled. I’d drink tequila and rant, he’d drink whiskey and smolder. We both got jobs at a little bar called the Stingray. He’s a Northerner and a big guy with a dark {{presence}} who likes to drink alone. If a Southerner (like myself) drinks alone, it means he’s probably going to fight. I imagined Anders had all the fight he could handle inside of himself; I’d heard right from his first album Man of Sin. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> cared, and that it confounded him.” He then moved back up north with his one-eyed dog Oly. He lived for some time in New York City. In 2008 he moved to Burlington, Vermont, where he lived with his wife as of 2014. In 2016 he had been living in the town of Alert, Nunavut in the Canadian Arctic - the northernmost permanently inhabited place in the world, located 508 miles from the North Pole.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>he</b> {{contemplated}} acceding to my demand or facing me with drawn sword. For an instant he stood hesitating, and then throwing down his arms {{he turned and}} rushed {{to the opposite side}} of the deck. Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> overtake him he had sprung to the rail and hurled himself headforemost into the awful depths below.|$|R
60|$|During {{the day we}} met an old man so {{loaded down}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>he</b> was man, woman, or beast. A sort of cap or wide cloth band went across his head, concealing his forehead. His huge pack loomed over his shoulders, and as he walked, using two paddles as canes, he seemed some {{anomalous}} four-footed beast of burden.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never. Do {{not tell}} him that I forgive him. I command you not to {{tell him that}}. Tell him,--tell him, that I hate him, and that if I ever meet him, I will look at him so that he shall never forget it.

6000|$|She {{sank into}} a chair.

He's stopped to get a shave, to my thinking, seeing he wanted it. What he said was that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>he</b> had heard the news in Ireland, and would have come sooner, his hand being forced; but was hindered crossing by the weather, having took passage in a sailing vessel. What news he meant he didn't say.' ...|$|R
