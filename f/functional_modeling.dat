2500|$|The IDEF0 <b>Functional</b> <b>Modeling</b> {{method is}} {{designed}} to model the decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system. [...] It {{was derived from the}} established graphic modeling language Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) developed by Douglas T. Ross and SofTech, Inc.. In its original form, IDEF0 includes both a definition of a graphical modeling language (syntax and semantics) and a description of a comprehensive methodology for developing models. The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers to develop a function model method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} research aims at {{contributing to}} a better understanding of the diverse <b>functional</b> <b>modelling</b> approaches proposed across disciplines, often involving more than one function model. The paper presents a review of 41 systematic design approaches from different disciplines, analysing what is addressed by <b>functional</b> <b>modelling</b> at which point in the proposed development process, i. e. in which sequence, if any. The analysis aims at deriving potential commonalities across disciplines, which could support the development of an integrative <b>functional</b> <b>modelling</b> approach. Finally, the results of the analysis are discussed, concluding that while there seems to be no shared sequence in <b>functional</b> <b>modelling</b> across disciplines, a common base can be derived, with regard to what is prominently addressed by <b>functional</b> <b>modelling</b> in the different disciplines...|$|R

40|$|By {{discussing}} several examples, {{the theory}} of generalized <b>functional</b> <b>models</b> is shown to be very natural for modeling some situations of reasoning under uncertainty. A generalized <b>functional</b> <b>model</b> is a pair (f, P) where f is a function describing the interactions between a parameter variable, an observation variable and a random source, and P is a probability distribution for the random source. Unlike traditional <b>functional</b> <b>models,</b> generalized <b>functional</b> <b>models</b> do not require {{that there is only}} one value of the parameter variable that is compatible with an observation and a realization of the random source. As a consequence, the results of the analysis of a generalized <b>functional</b> <b>model</b> are not expressed in terms of probability distributions but rather by support and plausibility functions. The analysis of a generalized <b>functional</b> <b>model</b> is very logical and is inspired from ideas already put forward by R. A. Fisher in his theory of fiducial probability.

40|$|In this paper, a <b>functional</b> <b>model</b> of {{interactions}} in quantum theory (QT) is proposed.

In QT, the results {{of interactions}} are computed using quantum field theory (QFT). Therefore, the proposed <b>functional</b> <b>model</b> of interactions is based on QFT. There are a number of important QT concepts, such as measurement, entanglement, and decoherence, that are related to interactions.

We propose a class of <b>functional</b> <b>models</b> of the dual content of professional training based on the timing of psychological, pedagogical and engineering component of the professional training. As the main synchronizers in the <b>functional</b> <b>models</b> of dual content two professionally designed psycho-pedagogical disciplines "Didactic bases of vocational education" and "Methods of vocational training" were selected. <b>Functional</b> <b>models</b> which were selected and proposed are represented by the <b>functional</b> linear <b>model</b> of the dual content of professional training for the first stage of integration, by <b>functional</b> concentric <b>model</b> (after the composition of methods) of dual content of professional training of future engineers-teachers for the first stage, the concentric <b>functional</b> <b>model</b> of the dual content of professional training (after the content of methodology) for the second stage, the <b>functional</b> <b>model</b> of adaptive dual control of the content of professional training of future engineers-teachers for the third stage of implementation of the dual content of the vocational training.

40|$|A <b>functional</b> <b>model</b> of an {{artifact}} shows {{an important part}} of designer’s intention. A taxonomy of generic functions plays a crucial role in describing such <b>functional</b> <b>models.</b> Improving interoperability among <b>functional</b> <b>models</b> of different <b>functional</b> taxonomies facilitates sharing <b>functional</b> <b>models</b> among designers in organizations. The mapping between the different functional taxonomies and the conversion of <b>functional</b> <b>models</b> based on this mapping are one of the ways to support such interoperability. Among the different functional taxonomies, however, there are not only terminological differences but also ontological differences implicitly. By ontological differences we mean the conceptual differences between taxonomies and the general structural differences between models. In this article, firstly we propose a framework for mapping between functional taxonomies using a reference ontology of function in order to bridge the conceptual differences. The reference ontology contributes to specify the ontological differences between the functional taxonomies. Second, {{in order to reduce the}} structural differences between the <b>functional</b> <b>models,</b> we discuss how to capture the modeling world. These results enable us to convert the <b>functional</b> <b>models</b> among different taxonomies. As examples of the functional taxonomies, we focus on the reconciled functional basis proposed by Hirtz et al. and our functional concept ontology based on Function & Behavior Representation Language...|$|R
