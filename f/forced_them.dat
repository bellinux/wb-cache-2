5|$|According to Diodorus, Philip {{marched on}} his enemies in this {{alliance}} {{before they had}} chance to combine, and <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to ally to Macedon instead. However, other sources suggest that the picture was actually much more complex, and that Philip in turn defeated each of the powers {{over the next few}} years, with the exception of Athens.|$|E
5|$|Gregory excommunicated Frederick II on 29 September 1227, {{accusing him}} of {{breaking}} his oath to lead a crusade to the Holy Land; the emperor had dispatched two fleets to Syria, but a plague <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to return. His wife Isabella died after giving birth to a son, Conrad, in May 1228. Frederick continued to consider himself king of Jerusalem, {{in accordance with the}} precedent set by John during Isabella's minority.|$|E

5|$|Hostilities did not {{end with}} the {{publication}} of the Dictum. The garrison at Kenilworth refused to accept the terms given, and held out until 14 December, when deprivation <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to surrender. In April 1267, the earl of Gloucesterwho had been central both to the royal victory at Evesham and to the drafting of the Dictumturned against the king. He occupied the city of London, and set himself up as the champion of the disinherited. After negotiations involving both Edward and Ottobuono, Gloucester relented, and by June a settlement was reached. Gloucester had forced a change to the conditions of the Dictum, whereby the disinherited were allowed to recover their lands before they had paid their fines rather than after; an arrangement that made repayment much easier. In the summer of that year, Prince Edward moved at the Isle of Ely, where the last of the rebels still held out, and <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> into submission under terms favourable to the rebels.|$|E
5|$|In the 2nd centuryBC, the Iazyges {{began to}} migrate {{west to the}} steppe near the Lower Dniester. One {{possible}} explanation of this was that the Roxolani, who were the Iazyges' eastern neighbors, were also migrating west, due to pressure from the Aorsi, which {{put pressure on the}} Iazyges and <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to migrate west as well.|$|E

5|$|Skirmishes on the {{frontier}} between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire first occurred in 1050. Emperor Henry invaded Hungary in August 1051, but Andrew and Béla successfully applied scorched earth tactics against the imperial troops and <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to withdraw. Legend says that the Vértes Hills near Székesfehérvár were named after the armoursvért in Hungarianwhich were discarded by the retreating German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not {{initially}} investigate; no crime had been committed, and the morals of ministers were not their concern. Although the relationship {{lasted only a}} few weeks it became public knowledge in 1962. Keeler attempted to publish her memoirs in the Sunday Pictorial in January 1963 but Profumo, still insisting that he had done nothing wrong, <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to back down with threats of legal action should the story be published.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the nearly}} {{contemporaneous}} chronicle of John of Küküllő, Louis launched his first campaign against {{a group of}} Transylvanian Saxons, who had refused to pay taxes, and <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to yield {{in the summer of}} 1344. During his stay in Transylvania, Nicholas Alexanderwho was the son of Basarab, the ruling prince of Wallachiaswore loyalty to Louis on his father's behalf in Brassó (now Brașov in Romania); thus the suzerainty of the Hungarian monarchs over Wallachia was, at least outwardly, restored.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, New Zealand {{performed}} the haka {{in the dressing}} room prior to the matchinstead of on the field immediately before kick-offafter a disagreement with the Welsh Rugby Union, which had wanted Wales to sing their national anthem after the haka. In 2008, New Zealand played Munster at Thomond Park. Before the match, Munster's four New Zealanders challenged their opponents by performing a haka before the All Blacks started theirs. On the same tour, Wales responded by silently refusing to move after New Zealand's haka, and the two teams simply stared at each other until the referee <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to start the game.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the incident, the NFL suspended Brady without pay for the first four games of the 2015 season, fined the Patriots $1 million, and <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to forfeit their 2016 first round draft pick and 2017 fourth round draft pick. Brady appealed his suspension, which was eventually vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, only for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reinstate it a year later for the 2016 NFL season. Brady eventually agreed to serve the suspension in 2016, but led the Patriots to win Super Bowl LI in spite of it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1450s, Stafford {{might have been}} in the service of his distant {{relative}} John Stafford, Earl of Wiltshire, son of Humphrey Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. His association with James Touchet, Baron Audleyone of Wiltshire's menimplies so. If so, this represent a short episode of loyalty to the House of Lancaster over the House of York in the ongoing civil war. In 1460 the two were sent to Guînes to relieve the English garrison there. Bad weather <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> into the harbour of Calais, which was held by the Yorkist leader Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. Here they were both recruited for the Yorkist cause.|$|E
5|$|Most French {{prisoners of}} war were not held in camps {{for most of the}} war, but instead, over 93 percent of French {{prisoners of war}} lived and worked on Kommandos of work details. Under the terms of the Geneva Convention NCOs were, like officers, {{exempted}} from work during captivity, but Germans often <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to work. Workers were fed but virtually their entire wages were paid directly to the German army and prisoners were only allowed to retain 70 pfennigs per day.|$|E
5|$|Nabis {{also made}} his own preparations. Nabis had always been on good terms with Cretan leaders and he {{requested}} 1,000 of their best soldiers who were hand picked to assist him. As well as the Cretans, he hired 3,000 mercenaries and 10,000 citizens. The Romans and their allies then advanced upon Sellasia not far north of Sparta. The Romans were defeated in a small battle and they retreated. The Romans then won another battle against the Spartans and <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to retreat into the city.|$|E

5|$|On 14 March, {{with the}} ship at 84°4′N, the pair finally began their polar march. This was their third attempt to leave the ship; on 26 February and again on the 28th, damage to sledges had <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to return after {{travelling}} short distances. After these mishaps Nansen thoroughly overhauled his equipment, minimised the travelling stores, recalculated weights and reduced the convoy to three sledges, before giving the order to start again. A supporting party accompanied the pair and shared the first night's camp. The next day, Nansen and Johansen skied on alone.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April, at {{the start}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) landed at what later became known as Anzac Cove. Included in the {{landings}} was the New Zealand and Australian Division, but the division had been forced to leave part of its strength, including the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, behind in Egypt. The commanders believed there would be no requirement or opportunities for mounted troops on the peninsula. However, heavy casualties, and the lack of any other reinforcements, <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to reconsider the decision, and the mounted troops were later dispatched to Gallipoli to serve in a dismounted role.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 1913, the Ottoman Navy and Army {{attempted}} a landing at Bozca Ada (Tenedos) to retake the island from the Greeks. Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest}} of the fleet supported the operation, but the appearance of the Greek fleet forced the Ottomans to break off the operation. The Greeks also withdrew, and several Ottoman cruisers opened fire as both sides departed, but no damage was done. By 15:30, Barbaros Hayreddin was back at Çanakkale inside the safety of the Dardanelles. On 10 January, the fleet conducted a patrol outside the Dardanelles. They encountered several Greek destroyers and <b>forced</b> <b>them</b> to withdraw, but inflicted no damage on the Greek ships.|$|E
