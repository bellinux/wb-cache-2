The New York Attorney General's office issued a {{statement}} saying the attorney general was confident the motion would fail. On 31 January 2016, Barclays settled with both the New York Attorney General's office and the SEC, agreeing to pay $70 million split evenly between the SEC and New York state, admitting it violated securities laws and agreeing to install an independent monitor for the <b>dark</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014 the US {{state of}} New York {{filed a lawsuit}} against the bank alleging it {{defrauded}} and deceived investors with inaccurate marketing material about its unregulated trading system known as a <b>dark</b> <b>pool.</b> Specifically, the firm was accused of hiding the fact that Tradebot participated in the <b>dark</b> <b>pool</b> when they were in fact one of the largest players. [...] The state, in its complaint, said it was being assisted by former Barclays executives and it was seeking unspecified damages. The bank's shares dropped 5% on news of the lawsuit, prompting an announcement to the London Stock Exchange by the bank saying it was taking the allegations seriously, and was co-operating with the New York attorney general.|$|E

40|$|Using {{over forty}} {{trillion}} observations of market data, we analyze {{the effect of}} increasing the minimum price variation (MPV) for quoting equity securities {{in light of recent}} proposals to increase it to a nickel. A larger MPV encourages investors to trade in <b>dark</b> <b>pools</b> at the midpoint of the national best bid and offer. Enhanced order flow to <b>dark</b> <b>pools</b> reduces price competition by exchange liquidity providers, especially those using high frequency trading (HFT). Consistent with concerns about HFT liquidity provision, trading in <b>dark</b> <b>pools</b> due to a wider MPV reduces volatility and increases trading volume...|$|R

50|$|These {{systems and}} {{strategies}} typically seek liquidity among open and closed trading venues, such as other alternative trading systems. As such, they are particularly useful for GPU-based algorithmic strategies. <b>Dark</b> <b>pools</b> {{have grown in}} importance since 2007, with dozens of different pools garnering {{a substantial portion of}} U.S. equity trading. <b>Dark</b> <b>pools</b> are of various types and can execute trades in multiple ways, such as through negotiation or automatically (e.g., midpoint crosses, staggered crosses, VWAP, etc.), throughout the day or at scheduled times.|$|R
50|$|Truly dark {{liquidity}} can {{be collected}} off-market in <b>dark</b> <b>pools</b> using FIX and FAST protocol based APIs. <b>Dark</b> <b>pools</b> are generally {{very similar to}} standard markets with similar order types, pricing rules and prioritization rules. However, the liquidity is deliberately not advertised—there is no market depth feed. Such markets have no need of an iceberg-order type. In addition, they prefer not to print the trades to any public data feed, or if legally required to do so, will do so with as large a delay as legally possible—all to reduce the market impact of any trade. <b>Dark</b> <b>pools</b> are often formed from brokers' order books and other off-market liquidity. When comparing pools, careful checks should be made as to how liquidity numbers were calculated—some venues count {{both sides of the}} trade, or even count liquidity that was posted but not filled.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>pools</b> allow {{funds to}} line up and move large blocks of {{equities}} without tipping their hands {{as to what they}} are up to. Modern electronic trading platforms and the lack of human interaction have reduced the time scale on market movements. This increased responsiveness of the price of an equity to market pressures has made it more difficult to move large blocks of stock without affecting the price. Thus <b>dark</b> <b>pools</b> may protect traders from market participants who use HFT in a predatory manner.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} for institutional investors in using <b>dark</b> <b>pools</b> is for buying or selling large blocks of securities without showing their hand to others and thus avoiding market impact as neither {{the size of the}} trade nor the identity are revealed until some time after the trade is filled.
