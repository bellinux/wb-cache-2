They were all male and their age ranged from 18 to 48 years old. Their level of paralysis varied from Th 5 to L 1. Five kinds of wheelchair cushions were studied: an air cushion, a contour cushion, a polyurethane <b>foam</b> <b>cushion,</b> a Cubicushion (which is made of polyurethane foams) and a silicone gel cushion. A tactile sensor consisting of 2064 matrices was used for measuring the buttock pressure distribution and the data was analyzed on a personal computer.

The areas of total contact measured for each cushion were as follows (in descending order) : the air cushion, the silicone gel cushion, the polyurethane <b>foam</b> <b>cushion,</b> the contour cushion and the Cubicushion.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the CUR {{committee}} 159 B {{has been working on}} the new Dutch Design Guideline for the design of piled embankments. To validate the guideline several field tests have been performed. From the field measurements is concluded that the design method is very conservative. Improving the design guideline will reduce the construction costs. To understand the physical behaviour of the piled embankment and to validate the theory, experimental scale tests have been performed. During these tests the load distribution, deformation and strains were measured. The results of the scale tests are analysed and published. To improve the understanding of the phenomenon arching and where possible, to confirm the observed load distributions and displacements, numerical analysis of the scale tests have been performed and reported in this thesis. The numerical analysis of the scale test is performed with Plaxis 3 D Tunnel version 2. 4 (Plaxis). The geometry of the Plaxis model is one quarter of the geometry of the scale test. This reduces the amount of elements and therefore the calculation time. In the scale test circular piles are applied. Circular geometry cannot be modelled in Plaxis, therefore the circular pile is mathematically converted to a square pile. The sand and granular material are modelled with Mohr Coulomb (MC) model and Hardening Soil (HS) model. The scale test is driven by applying top load and by drainage of the <b>foam</b> <b>cushion.</b> The top load is modelled as the measured equally distributed load on the embankment. To model the drainage of the <b>foam</b> <b>cushion,</b> the measured water pressure is assigned to the subsoil clusters in Plaxis by a water pressure head. From the Plaxis results can be concluded that arching is immediately found after the first drainage of the <b>foam</b> <b>cushion.</b> Increasing the top load and drainage of the <b>foam</b> <b>cushion</b> in Plaxis results in an increase of loads transferred to the pile by arching and GR, thus results in improvement of arching. The by Plaxis calculated tensile forces in the GR are concentrated in ‘tensile strips’ that lie on top and between adjacent piles. The largest displacement of the GR is found at the middle of four piles. The results of the Plaxis calculations are compared to the scale test results. The total load on the pile and water pressure in the <b>foam</b> <b>cushion</b> found with Plaxis are corresponding with the scale test results. During {{the first part of the}} test, the load distribution shows similar results as the measured load distribution. During the second part of the test the load transferred to the pile by arching is overestimated and the load transferred to the pile by the GR is underestimated. The displacement of the geosynthetic reinforcement calculated with Plaxis is underestimated compared to the scale test results. In general the results of the HS model are better than the MC model. By varying a number of parameters in the model, possible causes for the underestimated displacement are investigated. This research concludes that the stiffness of the <b>foam</b> <b>cushion</b> and the water pressure in the <b>foam</b> <b>cushion</b> does not have influence on the GR displacement. The vertical effective stresses are concentrated on and directly next to the pile and are relatively small between the piles. The internal friction angle does have a large influence on the geosynthetic reinforcement displacement, because when the internal friction angle is decreased, the arch decreases and the settlements increase. However, the measured geosynthetic reinforcement displacement from the scale test is still not found in the numerical results calculated in Plaxis.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of {{a seat in}} reducing vibration depends {{on the characteristics of}} the vibration, the dynamic characteristics of the seat, and the dynamic characteristics of the person sitting on the seat. However, it is not known whether seat cushions influence the dynamic response of the human body, whether the human body influences the dynamic response of seat cushions, or the relative importance of human body nonlinearity and seat nonlinearity in causing nonlinearity in measures of seat transmissibility. This study was designed to investigate the nonlinearity of the coupled seat and human body systems and to compare the apparent mass of the human body supported on rigid and foam seats. A frequency domain model was used to identify the dynamic parameters of seat foams and investigate their dependence on the subject-sitting weight and hip breadth. With 15 subjects, the force and acceleration at the seat base and acceleration at the subject interface were measured during random vertical vibration excitation (0. 25 – 25 Hz) at each of five vibration magnitudes, (0. 25 – 1. 6 ms? 2 r. m. s.) with four seating conditions (rigid flat seat and three <b>foam</b> <b>cushions).</b> The measurements are presented in terms of the subject’s apparent mass on the rigid and foam seat surfaces, and the transmissibility and dynamic stiffness of each of the <b>foam</b> <b>cushions.</b> Both the human body and the foams showed nonlinear softening behaviour, which resulted in nonlinear cushion transmissibility.

40|$|Predicting the {{responses}} of the combined human body-seat structure to vibration excitation is still a challenging task. This is mainly due to the complex dynamics behaviour of the seated human body in response to vibration. It is however essential to characterize and predict the critical frequencies and the corresponding vibration patterns of the seat when it is coupled with a human occupant. This study provides important knowledge to predict the structural resonant frequencies and corresponding vibration mode shapes of the vehicle seat coupled with occupant from the seat alone or seat bare-frame (seat without <b>foam</b> <b>cushion).</b> An experiment is designed to measure the frequency responses, resonant frequencies, and corresponding mode shapes of the three different selected vehicle seats when mounted on the test rig. Six volunteers have participated in the experiments. The experiment data for each of the seats were collected for the seat bare-frames, seat alone (seat with <b>foam</b> <b>cushion),</b> and seat with human occupant. The results indicate that the vehicle seat bare-frame, seat alone, and seat with occupant have similar main seatback lateral, seatback fore-aft, and seat twisting structural resonant frequencies below 80 Hz. The coupling of the seated human body with the seat shows that the human occupant is not adding any new structural resonant frequency or mode shape to the seat below 80 Hz. It is therefore possible to characterize and predict the key vibration attributes such as occupied seat structural resonant frequencies and mode shapes from their corresponding unoccupied seat or bare frame characteristics. This alleviates the need for complex modelling or detailed analysis of the human body structure itself...|$|E

The primary parameter used to quantify {{the ability of the}} cushion to distribute load was the indention force deflection (IFD) metric. The EC was compared to a high-density planar <b>foam</b> <b>cushion</b> (HD). The IFD was measured for both cushions after successive periods of compression to simulate use. Study results failed to support the common perception that the soft EC would lose its supportive properties more rapidly than the much firmer HD cushion. Although the initial IFD of the EC was much lower than that of the HD, a smaller percentage of its IFD was lost after compression. This difference between the two cushions likely was due to differences in packaging.
