50|$|Volvo's {{first modern}} convertible, the C70 was {{manufactured}} in Uddevalla, Sweden {{on a separate}} assembly line from the 70-series sedan and station wagon. The four-seater convertible featured an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> glass <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> automatic (pop-up) rollover hoops system ROPS, seat belt pre-tensioners, boron steel reinforced A-pillars, front and side airbags, and a safety cage — a horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment.|$|R

5000|$|... 08/1969: <b>Heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> for hardtop, {{hazard lights}} for all models, single master key for all locks.|$|R
50|$|In 1976 nothing major was changed, but a {{self-adjusting}} clutch was introduced. The engines were adapted for tougher emissions requirements and several models with an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> were introduced. A luxurious 4-door sedan model was available, the 99 GLE. {{it came with}} power steering, an automatic transmission, a fuel-injected engine, luxurious upholstery on the seats and an armrest in the rear seat. The five-door Combi-coupé model was also introduced.|$|E
5000|$|The test is {{conducted}} with all ancillary loads turned off (Air conditioning compressor and fan, lights, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> etc.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{all of the}} 420 extras as standard, {{including}} a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> overdrive on manual transmission cars and power assisted steering ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1975: Fuel tank enlarged, {{revisions}} to the rear squab bed adaption facility. All models now feature cigar lighter and <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> as standard.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966 a {{dashboard}} switch was {{provided for the}} <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> which had previously remained [...] "on" [...] {{as long as the}} ignition was on, leading to instances of flat batteries.|$|R
50|$|The {{specification}} gradually improved {{over the}} years. In October 1972 front disc brakes were {{fitted as standard}} on both models and a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> became standard equipment by late 1973 / early 1974.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Rekord C's {{production}} run, in July 1971, {{a special}} edition [...] "Rekord Holiday" [...] appeared in the showrooms, attractively priced and laden with a package of (normally optional) extras including a steel panel sunroof, supplementary front lights and even a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|Until the 1960s, {{automobiles}} used DC dynamo generators with commutators. With {{the availability}} of affordable silicon diode rectifiers, alternators were used instead. This was encouraged by the increasing electrical power required for cars in this period, with increasing loads from larger headlamps, electric wipers, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> and other accessories.|$|R
50|$|In September 1967 the Diplomat (along {{with its}} less {{expensive}} siblings) received a work-over consisting of rub strips on its flanks, new recirculating ball steering by ZF and <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> At {{the same time}} a HL (Hochleistung or high performance) version of the 2.8-liter six became available (140 PS/138 hp) for the Kapitän and Admiral models.|$|R
50|$|In February 1983, Mitsubishi {{launched}} {{a special edition}} Sigma GL Satellite. Priced $1,000 below the GL luxury level, the Satellite was built in sedan and wagon versions, with air conditioning, five-speed manual or automatic transmission all as options. However, two-tone paintwork, a laminated windscreen, AM/FM radio, adjustable steering column, intermittent windscreen wipers and a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> were fitted as standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its launch in October 1969 at the Paris Motor Show, the Renault 12 was only {{available}} as a 4-door saloon, in L and TL specifications. The more expensive TL featured two separate reclining front seats instead of one front bench seat, armrests on the doors, lights in the boot and glovebox, a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> and extra warning lights.|$|R
50|$|The MR2 Spyder {{featured}} a <b>heated</b> glass <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> A hard top was also available from Toyota in Japan and Europe.|$|R
25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, independent front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and servo-assisted dual circuit brakes. Initial standard equipment included two-speed heater fan, radial tyres, reversing lights, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and reclining front seats.|$|R
50|$|It {{is based}} on the Mégane Renault Sport 230 F1 Team R26, but it is 123 kg lighter. Weight {{reduction}} is achieved via the removal of the rear seats and seat belts, passenger airbag and curtain airbags (the driver's airbag remains), climate control (air conditioning remains as standard), <b>rear</b> wash/wipe and <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> front fog lamps, headlamp washers, radio/CD player and most of the soundproofing.|$|R
50|$|The woodgrained {{instrument}} panel {{was replaced by}} brushed aluminum trim, while the gauge faces changed from silver with black letters and numbers to black with white letters and numbers. The same seating choices in either cloth or Morrokide trims were offered including the standard notchback bench seat, or optional 60/40 bench or Strato bucket seats with console. An AM/FM CB radio combo was available and a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was optional.|$|R
50|$|For 1969, {{the only}} {{exterior}} change was the {{fuel filler flap}} {{no longer had a}} finger indentation due to a new interior-mounted fuel door release. For North America, the Beetle received a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> day/night mirror and the semi-trailing, independent suspension with double jointed swing axles as standard equipment. In other markets, manual transmission models retained a swing axle independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, the Citi Golf {{received}} a facelift {{that included a}} new dashboard lifted from the Škoda Fabia, as well as larger front side <b>windows.</b> The <b>rear</b> wiper-washer combination was also moved into {{the glass of the}} (now standard) <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> to give the car a more sleek appearance. Along with this modification, the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was curved {{in such a way that}} it resembled a sort of [...] "bubble"-like appearance, presumably to eliminate the annoying reflection of sunlight from the flat, steeply sloped window into the eyes of other drivers following behind.|$|R
5000|$|The first TF {{model to}} be {{produced}} by NAC MG UK was the TF LE500. [...] As the name suggests, this was a limited edition of five hundred cars each individually numbered. The better suspension set-up and the <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> from the 2005 model TF were carried over to the LE500. Styling was reminiscent of the original MGF, with an intake {{on either side of}} the MG badge, and a large single intake below the license plate.|$|R
50|$|The Standard {{trim level}} {{included}} clock, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> electro-door locks, power door locks, power trunk lock, onboard control system, immobilizer, body-color bumpers, seat trims tweed and tapestries, front head restraints. The Normal featured powered windows, exterior mirrors with antidazzle effect, velour seat and door upholstery, and rear head restraints. In the Luxe the owner also received heated front seats, trip computer, fog lights, electric and heated outside mirrors, velvet upholstery and doors, a trunk spoiler with brake lights, and tinted windows.|$|R
5000|$|January 1972: Introduction of the Renault 5 in L and TL forms. Both models (which were {{available}} as three-door hatchbacks) had folding rear seats, grey bumpers, wind up front windows, and dashboard-mounted gear shift levers. The TL was better equipped, {{and had a}} vanity mirror for the front seat passenger, three ashtrays (one under the gear shift and two in the rear), two separate reclining front seats instead of one bench seat, front pull handles, and three stowage pockets {{as well as a}} <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|During 1968 to 1973, a {{total of}} 103,463 cars were sold. The most {{collectable}} GTs are probably the first few hundred cars hand-assembled in 1968 and the 1968-1970 models with the 1.1 L engine, which totaled out at 3,573 cars. Of the later cars 10,760 were the cheaper model (GT/J), which lacked nearly all chrome parts and offered fewer standard features. In some markets, items like a limited slip differential, front and <b>rear</b> anti-sway bars, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and engine bay light were standard, although most cars were shipped without them.|$|R
5000|$|The Kadett-Sport buyer could {{specify any}} one of three {{eye-catching}} body colours: [...] "roof-tile red", [...] "yellow ochre" [...] and [...] "lemon yellow" [...] (Ziegelrot, Ocker und Citrusgelb). Appropriate features included in the [...] "customer-friendly" [...] price were a sports exhaust/muffler, the rallye gauge cluster from the Rallye model, a sports steering wheel, servo assisted brakes with discs at the front, anti-roll bars, high-backed front seats, sports wheels and tires, a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> seat belts and, under the bonnet, an enhanced alternator {{to cope with the}} anticipated demands of additional electrical equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Produced from October 1967 to 1969, the V8-250 {{was a minor}} face-lift and re-labelling of the 2.5 V8 saloon and {{differed}} in relatively small details: [...] "slimline" [...] bumpers and over-riders (shared with the Jaguar 240/340 relabelled at the same time), negative-earth electrical system, an alternator instead of a dynamo and twin air cleaners, one for each carburettor. Other new features included padding over the instrument panel, padded door cappings and ventilated leather upholstery, reclinable split-bench front seats and a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> Power steering and overdrive were optional extras.|$|R
50|$|February 1980 - Introduction of the Fuego three-door coupé. Available as TL and GTL with 1,397 cc engine (rated at , with manual choke), and GTS with 1,647 cc engine (rated at , with {{automatic}} choke), with 4-speed manual gearbox on TL and GTL, 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic gearbox on GTS. TL has basic equipment level with 155 SR 13 tires, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> <b>rear</b> fog light, split/fold rear seat, and cloth upholstery. The GTL adds 175/70 13 tires, electric front windows, tachometer, height-adjustable steering wheel, front head restraints, analog clock, wheel covers, remote-adjustable drivers door mirror, laminated windscreen, opening <b>rear</b> quarter <b>windows,</b> H4 headlights, pre-installed radio kit, and velour upholstery. The GTS adds {{engine oil level}} gauge, power-assisted steering, and optional 3-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|In July 1984, Mitsubishi reintroduced the Super Saloon trim level, again {{based on}} the Sigma SE sedan and {{incorporating}} luxury items normally offered as options. The GK Super Saloon generally followed the GJ's structure, although changes included new corduroy trim and stereo system with Compact Cassette facility, AM/FM scan tuning, and digital display. Mitsubishi also introduced a limited edition GK Sigma Satellite in late 1984, {{based on the}} XL but with the 2.6-litre engine and five-speed manual (or automatic optional), side stripes with Satellite badge identification, cloth-trimmed upholstery, AM/FM/MPX radio with dual speakers, distinguished wheel trim, additional silencing, tinted windscreen, and <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From 2 January 1984 to the [...] "S" [...] {{instead of}} the {{previous}} version [...] "de luxe" [...] was produced from VIN 19:00 401. The special design was characterized by matt black PVC door window frames, fittings trim with imitation leather in wood grain, trunk liner, fog lights (fog lights and -schlusslicht [...] ) two-tone horn, stick shift / steering wheel circuit, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and a Malimo corduroy interior. In addition, all models which until then had chromed body parts were black plastic powder coated. This {{is a sign of}} shortage of raw materials the East German economy and as an attempt {{to keep up with the}} prevailing taste step.|$|R
2500|$|The new more {{aerodynamic}} body {{looked a}} bit more plain than its sharp predecessor, but the fastback shape echoed Giugiaro's original design. The headlights were square, there was more glass than on the SS20 (but with a broad B-pillar) and the larger rear glass hatch (still not a proper hatch) now offered better access to a much more usable luggage space. The rear seat folded; some versions even offered a remote opening mechanism and <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> The SS40 {{was also the first}} Cervo to offer automatic transmission, a two-speed. This all reflected a steady move away from the original [...] "mini Gran Turismo" [...] concept towards a much softer [...] "Personal Car".|$|R
50|$|The car {{was aimed}} at the then-new compact performance-luxury sector, vying for sales against cars such as the BMW 2002 and Ford Cortina GXL, and was offered {{with a high level}} of {{standard}} equipment, including twin headlamps, a clock, full instrumentation, luxury seats and carpets, a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> and a cigar lighter. Styling was similar to the Triumph 1500, with some updates such as a black painted rear panel, vinyl D-posts, and new wheel trims. The car was capable of 100 mph, with 60 mph coming up in just over 11 seconds. An overdrive gearbox was soon made available as an option, offering relaxed motorway cruising and improved fuel economy, and there was also an optional automatic transmission.|$|R

5000|$|The two initial models, {{introduced}} in 1968 and sold through 1977, were the 2.5 L 2500 and 2.8 L 2800. The airy design was roomier than BMW's existing range and appeared rather large, {{in spite of}} being no more than 1 cm longer than Mercedes' midrange sedans, which were generally considered {{to compete in a}} lower class than the new E3. They were large six-cylinder cars that handled well and impressed contemporary reviewers. Road & Track called the later Bavaria [...] "delightful" [...] and [...] "superb", concluding that it was [...] "one of the world's best buys". Aside from the larger engine, the 2800 also had bigger tyres and a somewhat sportier suspension, as well as various creature comforts such as a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> a full tool set, Boge Nivomat self-levelling rear suspension, and a smattering more external chrome.|$|R
