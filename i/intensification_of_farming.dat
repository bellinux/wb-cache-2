40|$|Extensive {{livestock}} production systems have faced socio-economic factors (such as {{the loss of}} profitability and competitiveness) {{that have led to}} modifications in their management and structure. The main changes have been the abandonment of grazing, the increase in the use of external feed, the abandonment <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> and the <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> the systems. The dehesa is the consequence of human intervention in the natural Mediterranean forest. Due to this, the conservation of this ecosystem depends on the use of appropriate agricultural practices (Gaspar et al., 2007). Thus small changes in the production systems may have a great impact on its conservation and on the rural population. As consequence, the <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> and the high prices of feed, make it difficult to increase farms’ profitability while preserving the dehesas. In this context, dehesa livestock farms have increased their dependence on subsidies. In view of the above it is necessary to identify the different livestock systems located in agroforestry systems, in order to allow appropriate measures to be developed for each system. Moreover, given the lack of knowledge about the organic beef cattle sector, and its potential impacts on both the dehesa ecosystem and the rural population, this study has the objective of identifying and describing the production systems, paying special attention to their level <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> and their dependence on subsidies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the key factors limiting maize (Zea mays L.) productivity in eastern India to develop effective crop and nutrient management strategies to reduce yield gap. A series <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> surveys was conducted in two distinct agro-ecological zones of eastern India to evaluate the importance of crop management and structural constraints for maize productivity in a range of socio-economic settings prevalent in smallholder farms. Surveys revealed yield gap and yield variations among farms across growing seasons. Lower yields of farmers were mainly associated with farmer's ethnic origin, availability of family labor, land ownership, legumes in cropping sequence, irrigation constraints, seed type, optimal plant population, labor and capital investment, and use of organic manure. These constraints varied strongly between sites as well as growing seasons. Stochastic Frontier Analysis suggested <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> input use and removal of socio-economic and structural constraints for increasing efficiency in maize production. The use of multivariate classification and regression tree analysis revealed that maize yield was affected by multiple and interacting production constraints, differentiating the surveyed farms in six distinct resource groups. These farm types lend scope for introducing typology-specific crop management practices through appropriate participatory on-farm evaluation/trials. Summarily, this research indicated that interacting production constraints should be addressed simultaneously, considering the need <b>of</b> different <b>farm</b> types, if significant productivity improvements are to be achieved. This will be, however, more challenging for less endowed farms due to lack of social and financial capital to improve management intensity. A typology-specific farm support strategy may be formulated to offset this lack of entitlement among resource-poor farmers...|$|R
