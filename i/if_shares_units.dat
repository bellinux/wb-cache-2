40|$|Several {{studies and}} recent real world designs have {{promoted}} sharing of underutilized resources between cores in a multicore processor to achieve better performance/power. It {{has been argued}} that when utilization of such resources is low, sharing has negligible impact on performance, while offering considerable area and power benefits. In this paper we investigate the performance and performance/Watt implications of sharing large and underutilized resources between pairs of cores in a multicore. We first study sharing of the entire floating-point datapath (including reservation stations and execution units) by two cores, similar to AMD’s Bulldozer. We find that while this architecture results in power savings, for certain workload combinations, it also results in significant performance loss of about 28 %. Next, we study an alternative sharing architecture where only the floating-point execution <b>units</b> are <b>shared,</b> while the individual cores retain their reservation stations. This reduces the performance loss to 14 %. We then extend the study to include sharing of other large execution units that are used infrequently, namely the integer multiply and divide units. Subsequently, we analyze the impact of sharing hardware resources in Simultaneously Multi-Threaded (SMT) processors where multiple threads run concurrently on the same core. It is observed that sharing improves performance/Watt at a negligible performance cost only <b>if</b> the <b>shared</b> <b>units</b> have high throughput. <b>Sharing</b> low throughput <b>units</b> reduces both performance and performance/Watt.

40|$|In {{the panel}} conditionally {{homogenous}} vectorautoregressive model, the cross-sectional units' dynamics are generally heterogenous, but homogenous <b>if</b> <b>units</b> <b>share</b> the same structural characteristics. The panel conditionally homogenous vectorautoregressive model thus allows (i) {{to account for}} heterogeneity in dynamic panel data sets, (ii) to nevertheless exploit the panel nature of the data, and (iii) to analyze {{the relationship between the}} units' observed heterogeneities and structural characteristics. I show how standard least squares estimation can be applied, how impulse responses can be computed, how multivariate conditioning is implemented, and how polynomial order restrictions can be incorporated. Finally, I present an easy-to-use Matlab routine which can be used to estimate the panel conditionally homogenous vectorautoregressive model and produce impulse responses as well as forecast error variance decompositions. ...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. (Construction Management) This {{research}} {{provides an}} overview of intra-organisational centralised/decentralised structures and inter-organisational consortia. It then aims to provide a theoretical explanation of Management Shared Services, prior to providing case study evidence of management shared services performance and proposed areas of improvement, comprising business units and services departments of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The research provides empirical evidence of the proposed improvement areas of selected processes of management shared services as a viable structural option for improving services provided to the business units and a starter to currently untapped reservoir of potential research. It suggests an additional improvement options to be considered in determining the optimum management shared services model and to provide business case evidence and suggestions for optimum usage of the management shared services. The research assessed the actual level of performance of Management <b>Shared</b> Services <b>Unit</b> in order to provide a basis on which to identify potentials for efficiently improving and optimising existing Management <b>Shared</b> Services <b>Unit.</b> The research identified two areas as success areas in the current set-up and six other areas as requiring improvement <b>if</b> Management <b>Shared</b> Services <b>Unit</b> is to serve the purpose of providing non-core services to the Business Units.

The areas identified by research as requiring improvement are strategy, customer relations, human resources, business processes, performance management and continuous improvement...|$|R
