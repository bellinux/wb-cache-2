2500|$|The Unit of Emergency Medicine from Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel {{performed}} a two-year research and review surrounding the medical care of child terror victims. The results, which {{were published in}} 2003, stated, [...] "During the study period, 41 mass-casualty events (MCEs) were managed by Magen David Adom. Each event involved on average, 32 regular and nine {{mobile intensive care unit}} ambulances with 93 medics, 19 paramedics, and four physicians. Evacuation time was 5–10 minutes in urban areas and 15–20 minutes in rural areas. In most cases, victims were evacuated to multiple facilities. To improve <b>efficiency</b> <b>and</b> <b>speed,</b> the Magen David Adom introduced the use of well-trained 'first-responders' and volunteer, off-duty professionals, in addition to 'scoop and run' on-the-scene management." [...] It added that, [...] "Compared to children with non-terrorism-related injuries, the terrorism-related group had a higher rate of surgical interventions, longer hospital stays, and greater needs for rehabilitation services." ...|$|E
2500|$|The lateral giant (LG)-mediated escape {{mechanism}} {{is the most}} extensively analyzed form of the tail flip. [...] The LG is not actually one neuron, but rather a group of closely associated neurons arranged end to end and connected by electrical synapses (also called [...] septate synapses). As a result, the LGI functions as one giant, continuous [...] neuron, such as the MG. The LGI's large diameter and the <b>efficiency</b> <b>and</b> <b>speed</b> of electrical synapses, make the LGI-mediated escape especially rapid and effective. The LGI only innervates the first three rostral segments of the tail and [...] is activated within 10 ms from when a mechanical stimulus is presented to the abdomen. When flexion occurs, only the first three segments flex and the tail fan is not directed under the body and forward but rather straight down. The unflexed segments increase {{the length of the}} paddle. The result is the rear end of the animal is directed upward and forward causing the animal to tumble or somersault forward. The tail is then rapidly extended, and this is usually followed by directed swimming.|$|E
