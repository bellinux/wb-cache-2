40|$|Current {{recommendations}} {{for the use of}} CO 2 as a euthanasia agent for rats require the use of gradual fill protocols (such as 10 % to 30 % volume displacement <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> in order to render the animal insensible prior to exposure to levels of CO 2 that are associated with pain. However, exposing rats to CO 2, concentrations as low as 7 % CO 2 are reported to cause distress and 10 %– 20 % CO 2 induces panic-associated behavior and physiology, but loss of consciousness does not occur until CO 2 concentrations are at least 40 %. This suggests that the use of the currently recommended low <b>flow</b> volume <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> displacement rates create a situation where rats are exposed to concentrations of CO 2 that induce anxiety, panic, and distress for prolonged periods of time. This study first characterized the response of male rats exposed to normoxic 20 % CO 2 for a prolonged period of time as compared to room air controls. It demonstrated that rats exposed to this experimental condition displayed clinical signs consistent with significantly increased panic-associated behavior and physiology during CO 2 exposure. When atmospheric air was then again delivered, there was a robust increase in respiration rate that coincided with rats moving to the air intake. The rats exposed to CO 2 also displayed behaviors consistent with increased anxiety in the behavioral testing that followed the exposure. Next, this study assessed the behavioral and physiologic responses of rats that were euthanized with 100 % CO 2 infused at 10 %, 30 %, or 100 % volume <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> displacement rates. Analysis of the concentrations of CO 2 and oxygen in the euthanasia chamber and the behavioral responses of the rats suggest that the use of the very low <b>flow</b> volume <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> displacement rate (10 %) may prolong the duration of panicogenic ranges of ambient CO 2, while the use of the higher <b>flow</b> volume <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> displacement rate (100 %) increases agitation.

40|$|The hemodynamic and phasic {{ascending}} aortic flow changes {{induced by}} acetylstrophanthidin and glucagon were studied in closed-chest sedated dogs with aortic regurgitation. While the positive inotropic effect of both agents {{was reflected in}} an increase in peak rate of rise of left ventricular pressure, acetylstrophanthidin increased aortic regurgitation, while glucagon decreased it. With the former, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure rose from 20 ± 6 to 27 ± 6 mm Hg (P < 0. 005), but fell from 18 ± 4 to 11 ± 3 mm Hg (P < 0. 001) with glucagon. Acetylstrophanthidin increased systemic vascular resistance, aortic diastolic pressure, and diastolic regurgitant flow rate, and, heart rate and the duration of regurgitation per beat and per minute being unchanged, regurgitant flow per beat increased 32 ± 15 % (P < 0. 001). Glucagon decreased regurgitant flow per beat 27 ± 14 % (P < 0. 001) because of abbreviation of diastole associated with tachycardia, and because of reduction in regurgitant flow rate. Despite tachycardia, the duration of regurgitation per minute was unchanged, and the small fall in regurgitant blood <b>flow</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> was not significant, but this pertained in the face of 47 % increase in effective cardiac output (P < 0. 001). In contrast, acetylstrophanthidin increased regurgitant <b>flow</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> 28 ± 14 % (P < 0. 001) without change in effective cardiac output. The increase in cardiac contractility, tachycardia, and systemic vasodilatation induced by glucagon preferentially enhanced forward blood flow, which led to reduction in left ventricular volume overload, while it increased cardiac output. Contrarily, acetylstrophanthidin increased aortic regurgitation and, despite its inotropic effect, increased left ventricular volume overload without an increase in cardiac output...|$|E

In popliteal veins, Peak Systolic Velocities (PSV), ejected volume per individual stimulus (Stroke Volume SV) and ejected Total Volume <b>Flow</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (TVF) of expelled blood were determined using ultrasound. Stimulation rates from 2 to 120 Beats Per Minute (bpm) were applied. ResultsMean baseline popliteal PSV was 10  cm/s. For stimulation rates between 2 and 8  bpm, the PSV was 10 times higher and reached 96 – 105  cm/s. Stroke volume (SV) per individual stimulus decreased in a similar fashion. With increasing rates of stimulation the TVF increased by a factor of 12 times (from 20  ml/min to 240  ml/min).

At each sonographic evaluation, umbilical vein blood flow parameters were obtained by digital color Doppler velocity profile integration. To allow comparisons among fetuses, the umbilical vein blood <b>flow</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> was normalized for abdominal circumference. Results. The absolute vein blood flow was lower in growth-retarded than in normally grown fetuses (209 ml/min ± 73 vs. 313 ml/min ± 72, p < 0. 01). The median (range) umbilical vein blood flow normalized for abdominal circumference was significantly lower in growth-retarded than in normally grown fetuses at the first [0. 70 (0. 32; 1. 15) vs. 1. 11 (0. 65; 2. 07), p < 0. 05] and at the second [0. 71 (0. 30; 1. 09) vs. 1. 14 (0. 69; 2. 05), p < 0. 05] sonographic evaluation.

40|$|THE {{apparatus}} to {{be described}} represents an attempt to develop a simple, cheap halothane vaporizer {{which could be used}} without modifi-cation of existing anaesthetic equipment and which would allow accurate but economical use of halo-thane. An earlier version of this vaporizer has been described (Cole, 1959) and the present model has already been referred to (Cole, 1960). The aim of the present paper is to describe the vaporizer and to record experiences of performance after ex-tensive use by the writer and by a number of other anaesthetists to whom vaporizers have been supplied. The vaporizer (fig. 1) consists of a metal assembly into which is screwed a 100 -ml bottle with a suitable washer intervening. The pro-jecting side tube is the oxygen inlet. Oxygen enters here, passes through ducts drilled in the metal and then through a vertical tube 8. 25 cm long to escape through a jet 1. 5 mm in diameter 2 cm above the bottom of the bottle. A safety valve which is spring loaded to open at 5 lb. /sq. in., is set in the metal cap and is connected with the oxygen duct so that if the pressure exceeds that figure only oxygen escapes. The oxygen and halothane mixture leaves the apparatus through a metal tube which terminates in a yoke block. Before use the apparatus is filled with halothane to a level just below the inlet pipe (about 22 ml), screwed into the cyclopropane yoke, and connec-ted to a supply of oxygen. It is now possible to pass a halothane and oxygen mixture through the cyclopropane flowmeter.

To elucidate cardiopulmonary bypass factors controlling cerebral oxygen extraction, {{we examined the}} effect of perfusate temperature, pump flow rate, and hematocrit value on cerebral hemoglobin-oxygen saturation as measured by near infrared spectroscopy. Methods: Forty children less than 7 years of age scheduled for cardiac operations with continuous cardiopulmonary bypass {{were randomly assigned to}} warm bypass, hypothermic bypass, hypothermic low-flow bypass, or hypothermic low-hematocrit bypass. For warm bypass, arterial perfusate was 37 ° C, hematocrit value 23 %, and pump <b>flow</b> 150 ml/kg <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Hypothermic bypass differed from warm bypass only in initial perfusate temperature (22 ° C); hypothermic low-flow bypass and low-hematocrit bypass differed from hypothermic bypass only in pump <b>flow</b> (75 ml/kg <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> and hematocrit value (16 %), respectively. Cerebral oxygen saturation was recorded before bypass (baseline), during bypass, and for 15 minutes after bypass had been discontinued. Results: In the warm bypass group, cerebral oxygen saturation remained at baseline levels during and after bypass. In the hypothermic bypass group, cerebral oxygen saturation increased 20 % ± 2 % during bypass cooling (p < 0. 001), returned to baseline during bypass rewarming, and remained at baseline after bypass. In the hypothermic low-flow and hypothermic low-hematocrit bypass groups, cerebral oxygen saturation remained at baseline levels during bypass but increased 6 % ± 2 % (p = 0. 05) and 10 % ± 2 % (p < 0. 03), respectively, after bypass was discontinued. Conclusions: In children, cortical oxygen extraction is maintained during warm cardiopulmonary bypass at full flow and moderate hemodilution. Bypass cooling can decrease cortical oxygen extraction but requires a certain pump flow and hematocrit value to do so. Low-hematocrit hypothermic bypass and low-flow hypothermic bypass can also alter cortical oxygen extraction after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass.
