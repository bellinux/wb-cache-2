2500|$|Eddy {{covariance}} is {{a surface}} monitoring technique that measures the flux of [...] from the ground's surface. It involves measuring [...] concentrations {{as well as}} vertical wind velocities using an anemometer. This provides {{a measure of the}} total vertical flux of CO2. Eddy covariance towers could potentially detect leaks, however, the natural carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and the respiration of plants, would have to be accounted for and a baseline [...] cycle would have to be developed for the location of monitoring. An example of Eddy covariance techniques used to monitor carbon sequestration sites is the [...] Another similar approach is utilizing accumulation chambers. These chambers are sealed to the ground with an inlet and outlet <b>flow</b> <b>stream</b> connected to a gas analyzer. This also measures the vertical flux of [...] The disadvantage of accumulation chambers is its inability to monitor a large region which is necessary in detecting [...] leaks over the entire sequestration site.|$|E
2500|$|Metabolic chambers: Chambers may be {{glass jars}} with rubber {{stoppers}} for lids; syringe barrels for small animals and insects; or constructed from Plexiglas. Ideally, chambers should be constructed from inert materials; for example, the acrylic plastics can absorb O2 {{and may be}} a poor choice for respirometry with very small insects. Chambers need to be constructed {{in a manner that}} yields rapid mixing of gases within the chamber. [...] The simplest metabolic chamber for a small vertebrate might be a glass jar with a stopper. [...] The stoppers are fitted with two ports: short extensions of Teflon tubing are provided for line connections. Teflon tube extensions are pushed through the bulkhead and the line connection is finished by attaching a small hose clip {{to the base of the}} Teflon tube extension. Additionally, an extension to the inlet port inside the jar should be provided—this ensures that the animal's expiratory gases are not washed away by the in <b>flow</b> <b>stream.</b> The animal is sealed inside and the rubber stopper is held in place with Velcro straps. If an upstream system is used, any metabolic chamber leak will result in loss of animal air and, therefore, an underestimate of the animal's metabolic rate. When you close an animal inside a metabolic chamber, attention must be paid to the seal. To ensure tight seals before closing the lid, firmly work the stopper into the jar and make sure that it is even. Use 1-2 straps (2 are better) and pull tightly. Acrylic (Plexiglas) chambers will be constructed for some uses, but precise engineering will be needed to ensure proper seating; gaskets will help, and judicious use of tight-fitting clamps will minimize leaks.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the species {{diversity}} {{and distribution of}} macrophytes in 131 surveyed sites of middle-sized streams of Latvia were investigated. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the composition of macrophyte vegetation in Latvian streams in relation to the environmental factors (stream width, water depth, substrate type, shading and flow velocity). On the basis of these factors, five major groups of streams were distinguished representing mutually different typical macrophyte communities &ndash; (1) fast <b>flowing</b> <b>streams</b> on gravelly and stony substrate, (2) slow <b>flowing</b> <b>streams</b> on gravelly and stony substrate, (3) fast <b>flowing</b> <b>streams</b> on sandy substrate, (4) slow <b>flowing</b> <b>streams</b> on sandy substrate, and (5) streams with soft, silty substrate. Totally, 47 macrophyte taxa were found in the streams. The most common macrophyte species were Nuphar lutea found in 65 % of all sites, followed by Sparganium emersum (64 %), S. erectum s. l. (48 %), Phalaris arundinacea (50 %), Alisma plantago-aquatica (54 %) and Lemna minor (41 %). The highest species richness (22) was found in slow <b>flowing</b> <b>streams</b> with gravelly substrate. Species-poor macrophyte communities were characteristic for fast <b>flowing</b> <b>streams</b> on sandy substrate...|$|R

50|$|For {{midstream}} and upstream operations, multiphase pumps can {{be located}} onshore or offshore {{and can be}} connected to single or multiple wellheads. Basically, multiphase pumps are used to transport the untreated <b>flow</b> <b>stream</b> produced from oil wells to downstream processes or gathering facilities. This means that the pump may handle a <b>flow</b> <b>stream</b> (well stream) from 100 percent gas to 100 percent liquid and every imaginable combination in between. The <b>flow</b> <b>stream</b> can also contain abrasives such as sand and dirt. Multiphase pumps are designed to operate under changing or fluctuating process conditions. Multiphase pumping also helps eliminate {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} as operators strive to minimize the flaring of gas and the venting of tanks where possible.|$|E
50|$|Die swell is a {{phenomenon}} directly related to entropy and the relaxation of the polymer within the <b>flow</b> <b>stream.</b> Initially, a <b>flow</b> <b>stream</b> has a constant rate before entering the die, and the polymers within the stream occupy a roughly spherical conformation, maximizing entropy. Extrusion through the die causes an increase in flow rate through the polymer <b>flow</b> <b>stream.</b> As the polymer spends time inside the die and {{is subject to the}} much increased flow rate, the polymers lose the spherical shape, becoming longer due to the increased flow rate. Physical entanglements may relax, if the time scale of the polymer within the die is long enough. When the polymer stream leaves the die, the remaining physical entanglements cause the polymers in the die stream to regain a portion of its former shape and spherical volume, in order to return to the roughly spherical conformation that maximizes entropy.|$|E

5000|$|Pressurisation of {{materials}} within microreactors (and associated components) is generally easier than with traditional batch reactors. This allows reactions {{to be increased}} in rate by raising the temperature beyond the boiling point of the solvent.

Pressurisation may also allow dissolution of reactant gasses within the <b>flow</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E

50|$|The disentanglement of polymer chains is a kinetic process, and so {{the longer}} the die is, the more time is given for the {{physical}} entanglements within the polymer stream to disentangle. With a longer die and a slower polymer <b>flow</b> <b>stream,</b> less pronounced die swell will be observed. This {{is due to the}} longer die providing a longer time period for polymer, when subject to the increase flow rate, to disentangle. This characteristic relaxation time determines the length of time the polymer must spend inside the die to minimize die swell.|$|E
