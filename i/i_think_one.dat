5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, {{they tend to be}} totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the things about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic {{within the framework of the}} drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|Hoping to {{capitalize}} on the parody's success, Yankovic attempted to get a record contract. He and Schwartz quickly began duplicating the original [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] recording on cassettes, and the two then sent them to anyone who might be interested in the spoof. Schwartz later joked, [...] "Some were cleverly targeted to record executives, others were randomly addressed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> went to Santa Claus, [...] the North Pole." ...|$|E

500|$|To all the praise, Youngblood responded, [...] "I don't {{consider}} myself tough, I {{consider myself}} a nut {{for some of the}} things I did". Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, I certainly wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of my biggest assets was that I had an undeniable determination to be the best that has ever {{put his hand on the}} ground, I had a genuine desire to be great." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{pre-production}} for the episode, {{the cast}} and crew realized that the Halloween conceit would allow the various cast members to wear costumes, rather than their [...] "usual, realistically plain suits". B. J. Novak called the dress-up experience [...] "fun", noting that [...] "seeing the most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such silly and bizarre visuals was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> of the most inspired ideas of the episode's writer, Greg Daniels." [...] The idea for Pam to be dressed as a cat was inspired by several unused stories, created by Gene Stupnitsky, in which [...] "Pam Beesley must disguise herself as a cat". The plot lines were vetoed by the shows writers, but Stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow Pam to wear a cat costume.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} National Basketball Association athletes—current and former—{{paid tribute to}} Scott, {{including}} Stephen Curry, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Jason Collins, Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Bruce Bowen, Dennis Rodman, James Worthy and others. A number of golfers paid tribute to Scott: Tiger Woods, Gary Player, David Duval, Lee Westwood, Blair O'Neal, Jane Park and others. Other athletes paid tribute including Robert Griffin III, Russell Wilson, Jon Lester, Lance Armstrong, Barry Sanders, J. J. Watt, David Ortiz and Sheryl Swoopes. UNC basketball coach Roy Williams called him a [...] "hero." [...] Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians said: [...] "We lost a football game but we lost more this morning. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the best {{members of the media}} I've ever dealt with, Stuart Scott, passed away." ...|$|E

"the physics {{department}} UCL, with Mike Seaton, my supervisor, {{had very}} close relations with JILA and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was <b>one</b> of three students there who eventually came to JILA.

500|$|Although Scott had {{accepted}} the job Demme had rejected, he said: [...] "My first question was: 'What about Jonathan?' and they said: 'The original team said it's too violent.' I said, 'Okay. I'll do it.'" [...] Scott did, himself, have some uncertainty with the source material. In particular, he had difficulties with {{the ending of the}} novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: [...] "I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal—I'm sure that's been {{in the back of his}} mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is." [...] He also [...] "didn't buy the book from the opera scene onwards, which became like a vampire movie." [...] He asked Harris if he was [...] "married to his ending". Harris said he was not, so Scott changed it.|$|E
500|$|Author Gary Tillery draws {{parallels}} between Harrison's approach to [...] " [...] {{through the motions}} of living in the material world" [...] and the way someone in the 21st century might play a virtual reality game. Tillery writes that [...] "what we see and experience during the game is actually an illusion" [...] – or maya in the Hindu belief to which Harrison subscribed – and that [...] "hat does matter in the great scheme of things is to wake up from the dreamlike state we mistake for reality." [...] Speaking at a 1974 press conference, in reply to whether there was a [...] "paradox" [...] between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician, Harrison conceded: [...] "It is difficult... You can go to the Himalayas and miss it completely and [...] be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> by one we all free ourselves from the chains that we have chained ourselves to, whatever we're chained to." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had {{met on the}} set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a {{relationship}} at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to {{his newly}} formed label. Early into the album production, {{in a meeting}} where Borchetta and Swift {{discussed}} potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, [...] "That's your first single." [...] She responded, [...] "Well. That's how that works then." [...] Prior to that event, Swift {{did not believe that}} the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song [...] "is reminiscent, and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the most powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That was a really good song to start out on, {{because a lot of people}} can relate to wanting something you can't have." [...] When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was [...] "cool" [...] and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the {{disturbing}} {{things is that}} you're starting to see this in some [...] you know, it's not just sort of right-wing ultranationalist skinhead types. It's now you're getting some fairly otherwise respectable intellectuals that are left of center who are anti-globalization who are starting to let this stuff creep into their rhetoric.|$|E
2500|$|Buscema next {{produced}} {{a series of}} Western, war, and sword and sandal film adaptations for Dell's Four Color series. Buscema recalled, [...] "I did a bunch of their movie books ... {{that was a lot}} of fun. I worked from stills on those, except for The Vikings. ...<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the best books I ever did was Sinbad the Sailor." ...|$|E

2500|$|I may {{remark that}} the curious transformations many {{formulae}} can undergo, the unsuspected {{and to a}} beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the chief difficulties {{in the early part}} of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 14, 2008, when Quinn {{was asked}} about his {{relationship}} with Blagojevich, he said, [...] "Well, he's a bit isolated. I tried to talk to the Governor, but the last time I spoke to him was in August of 2007. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the problems is the Governor did sort of seal himself off from all the statewide officials... Attorney General Madigan and myself and many others." [...] Blagojevich had announced in 2006 that Quinn was not to be considered part of his administration.|$|E
2500|$|Orson Welles was so {{impressed}} by McGoohan's stage presence ("intimidated," [...] Welles would later say) that he cast him as Starbuck in his York theatre production of Moby Dick—Rehearsed. Welles said in 1969 that he believed McGoohan [...] "would now be, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> of the big actors of our generation if TV hadn't grabbed him. He can still make it. He was tremendous as Starbuck." [...] and [...] "with all the required attributes, looks, intensity, unquestionable acting ability and {{a twinkle in his}} eye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "you {{heard me}} quite correctly. It's not worth discussing, but <b>I</b> {{scarcely}} <b>think</b> <b>one</b> could place you in {{quite the same}} category." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{later in}} the same lecture, {{discussing}} modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states: That sort of God is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> not <b>one</b> that can actually be disproved, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the omnipotent and benevolent creator can.|$|R

2500|$|Rowling said [...] "I've never thought, 'It's {{time for}} a post-9/11 Harry Potter book,' no. But what Voldemort does, in many senses, is terrorism, and that was quite clear in my mind before 9/11 happened.... but there are {{parallels}}, obviously. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the times I felt the parallels was when I was writing about the arrest of Stan Shunpike, you know? I always planned that {{these kinds of things}} would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, [...] "Swim Until You Can't See Land" [...] and its b-side [...] "Fun Stuff" [...] {{were made}} {{available}} for streaming on the FactCat website. A video for [...] "Swim Until You Can't See Land", which featured flickering flashlights, was made available on 16 October, and the single was {{made available for}} digital download on 16 November and on seven-inch vinyl on 7 December. Alongside {{the announcement of the}} album's title on Scottish music blog, The Pop Cop, the band unveiled a fifth member, Gordon Skene, formerly of Make Model. Later, NME confirmed the band would be playing a special intimate show in London to celebrate Skene's arrival. Similar to Andy Monaghan's entry into the band in early 2008, Skene was not involved in recording the album. Upon his arrival, Hutchison noted that [...] "it must be difficult for him coming into something that four other people were involved in studio-wise. He's not seen any of that process yet. He's coming in playing these songs that perhaps he likes, but doesn't have that same level of connection with, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the aims [...] is to try and help build that for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|A minor {{controversy}} erupted when Lowell {{admitted to}} having incorporated (and altered) private letters from his ex-wife, Elizabeth Hardwick into poems for The Dolphin. He was particularly criticized for this by his friends Adrienne Rich and Elizabeth Bishop. Bishop presented Lowell with an argument against publishing The Dolphin. In a letter to Lowell regarding The Dolphin, dated March 21, 1972, before he'd published the book, Bishop praised the writing, saying, [...] "Please believe that I think it is wonderful poetry." [...] But then she stated, [...] "I'm sure my point is only too plain ... Lizzie [...] is not dead, etc.--but there is a 'mixture of fact & fiction' , and you have changed [...] letters. That is 'infinite mischief,' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> ... <b>One</b> can use one's life as material--one does anyway--but these letters--aren't you violating a trust? IF you were given permission--IF you hadn't changed them ... etc. But art just isn't worth that much." [...] Adrienne Rich responded to the controversy quite differently. Instead of sending Lowell a private letter on the matter, she publicly criticized Lowell and his books The Dolphin and To Lizzie and Harriet in a review {{that appeared in the}} American Poetry Review and that effectively ended the two poets' long-standing friendship. Rich called the poems [...] "cruel and shallow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{pleasant}} Lady Courtown and I used to {{discourse about}} martingales! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> invented <b>one,</b> did not I? Pray, Mrs. Felix Lorraine, {{can you tell}} me what a martingale is? for upon my honour I have forgotten, or never knew." ...|$|R
