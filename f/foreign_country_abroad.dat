40|$|Since 2013 the Italian Prison and Society Association (Associazione Carcere e Territorio Onlus) {{has been}} working on a project in favour of Italians who are {{detained}} abroad, with the aim to provide them support. Taking advantage of the experience of London-based Prisoners Abroad and from a number of best practices made available by the EuroPris/CEP FNPP network. The most important actions and outcomes of this project are presented in the “Italian Prisoners Abroad” paper. The living conditions of foreign detainees in Italy have long been the subject of study by academics and other stakeholders at national and international level. The acknowledgment of the added discomfort and the anguish associated with the deprivation of liberty suffered in a country other than the birthplace, has given rise to multiple efforts aiming at mitigating the hurdles experienced by individuals incarcerated in a foreign territory. The research focus, however, is greatly narrowed when in the same condition we have Italian nationals detained abroad: the situation is almost reversed with the difference that there is no frank determination to own up to the experience of Italian nationals detained abroad. Perhaps the numerical paucity of this category, when compared to that of foreigner nationals detained in Italy, makes less urgent a reflection on the operational strategies to be implemented to alleviate the experience of detention in a <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> <b>abroad.</b> Furthermore, given the relatively small number of Italian nationals detained abroad, it is challenging to generate public interest on penal policy practices that are relevant only for a minor fragment of the population. Embedded with this general framework, with the intent to provide support to Italian nationals detained abroad, the NGO Carcere e Territorio (Prison and Community) has designed a project aimed at Italians who are detained abroad. In full operation since 2015, the outlines of such project are briefly described in this paper...|$|E

Parents were afraid to let their children join lion dance troupes because of the [...] "gangster" [...] association with the members. During festivals and performances, when lion dance troupes met, there may be fights between groups. Some lifts and acrobatic tricks are designed for the lion to [...] "fight" [...] and knock over other rival lions. Performers even hid daggers in their shoes and clothes, which could be used to injure other lion dancers’ legs, or even attached a metal horn on their lion’s forehead, which could be used to slash other lion heads. The violence became so extreme that at one point the Hong Kong government banned lion dance completely. Now, as with many other countries, lion dance troupes must attain a permit from the government in order to perform lion dance. Although there is still a certain degree of competitiveness, troupes are a lot less violent and aggressive. Today, lion dance is a more sport-oriented activity. Lion dance is more for recreation than a way of living. But there are still plenty of troupes who still practice the traditional ways and taboos of the lion dance as it is practiced in the past.|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{governance}} reform challenges Chinese firms {{trying to}} establish themselves in global markets. When they enter foreign markets, Chinese enterprises are likely to bring their pre-existing corporate governance practices with them. This article examines how the corporate governance practices of foreign-listed corporations operating in China have been received and how major Chinese companies operating outside China have responded to corporate governance requirements of <b>foreign</b> <b>countries</b> when listing <b>abroad.</b> The pervasive role of the State within individual Chinese companies is fundamental to understanding China’s corporate governance practices {{both at home and}} abroad. Since the State in China is somewhat fragmented (its various agents operating at the national, provincial, and local levels), large company shares may be held by different state agencies and may be used in different ways. This can result in conflicting obligations to the State. Although China may have copied Western corporate laws, stock market rules, and corporate governance codes, the local meaning of these transplants is inevitably different due to the dominance of the state in large listed companies both as a shareholder and as the regulator. The ‘Go Global’ campaign of senior Chinese officials might have been expected to consolidate the transposition of corporate governance practice and to have hastened some convergence between Chinese and Anglo-American corporate governance practice. However, this {{does not seem to have}} happened as expected. The listing of Chinese companies on foreign stock exchanges does not seem to have resulted in these companies embedding foreign principles of corporate governance. ...|$|R
5000|$|African American {{music had}} always been {{influential}} in Tanzania, especially soul and R&B, but {{with the birth of}} a socialist government, foreign music was banned in Tanzania. For example a hip hop group from Tanzania, Berry White, exemplifies the influence of African American music solely {{in the name of the}} band. It seems as though they are imitating and/or mimicking the world renown Barry White. Moreover, before the socialist government in Tanzania banned foreign music, it was evident that Tanzanian hip hop was heavily influenced by western music, specifically African American music. [...] This gave Tanzanian citizens limited access to hip-hop, and early artists either learned of it by hearing it in a <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> through connections <b>abroad.</b> For young rappers like Dolasoul, or Balozi, (Ahmed Dola), [...] "it was just for the fun, no money was involved." [...] Rap music was merely a pastime for the upper and middle classes, in opposition to early hip-hop artists in the United States and South Africa. Education was seem as their way to gain financial and social success and early rappers mostly rapped in English using American lyrics and tracks. The scene began to change in the early 1990s with the breakdown of socialism, allowing hip-hop to become accessible to lower classes through the increase in circulation, and as it became acceptable for local artists and hip-hop fans began recording, copying and distributing hip-hop.|$|R

Also, Currency wars, a phenomenon evident in post recessionary markets is a protectionist policy, whereby countries devalue their currencies to ensure export competitiveness.
