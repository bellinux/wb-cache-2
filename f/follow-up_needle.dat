50|$|Dr. James Forsythe (born August 11, 1938) is an American author, anti-aging physician, and {{integrative}} oncologist. In 2009, Forsythe {{was charged}} by the Nevada Board of Medical Examiners with diagnosing a patient with prostate cancer and administering chemotherapy without verifying the diagnosis with a biopsy. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy of the patient's prostate showed {{that there was no}} evidence of cancer. The complaint was dismissed later that year. In 2006 he was found to have illegally distributed an unapproved form of human growth hormone.|$|E
40|$|Background:The Purpose of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the yield of stereotactic core breast biopsy and its cost-saving potential. Methods: This observational study was conducted at the Department of Radiology at Aga Khan Hospital in Karachi. All female Patients (n = 84) undergoing stereotactic core breast biopsy under mammographic guidance from January 2005 to May 2010 were included. Stereotactic core biopsy was performed on a dedicated mammography unit employing a 14 -gauge needle with an automated biopsy device. Ten Patients with incomplete medical records were excluded. All breast biopsy results were either compared with surgical findings in cases of malignant histopathological findings or with <b>follow-up</b> <b>needle</b> localization in case of benign core biopsy findings. Results: Fifteen of our 74 Patients had malignant findings on stereotactic biopsy, confirmed on histopathology of the final surgical mastectomy specimen. The remaining 59 Patients had benign results on histopathology, five Patients had needle localization of the same area due to either suspicious mammographic findings or clinical suspicion of malignancy. All were proven to be histopathologically benign on open surgical biopsy. Fifty-four Patients with benign results had follow-up mammograms, and the follow-up period was 18 months to 5 years. The sensitivity and specificity was 100 %. The cost saving per Patient was US$ 253. Conclusion: Stereotactic core breast biopsy is a safe and cost-effective method for determining the nature of suspicious mammographic findings...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} assigning BI-RADS category- 3 to breast lesion with respect to follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Radiology Department, the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from January 2002 to December 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women undergoing X-ray mammography and assigned BI-RADS category- 3 and recommended short-term (6 -monthly) follow-up were included. Out of these, 44 patients were lost to follow-up and {{were excluded from the}} study. The lesions that remained stable after short-term follow-up were recommended routine (annual) <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Needle</b> localization and open surgical biopsy was performed, if the lesion progressed or calcifications increased in number/size and/or on physician or patient preference. The effectiveness of this approach was analyzed by determining the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for BI-RADS category- 3. RESULTS: Of the 65 lesions, 55 remained stable. Of the remaining 10 lesions, two showed increase in number of microcalcification prompting biopsy. Both turned out to be ductal carcinoma in situ. Eight biopsies were performed on clinician or patient preference {{which turned out to be}} benign. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 100 %, 87 %, 20 % and 100 % respectively. CONCLUSION: Assessment with short-interval mammographic follow-up is useful to confirm the nature of most non-palpable breast lesions considered probably benign and permits detection of a small number of breast cancers at an early stage. The local setup, patient compliance is a major limitation for performing a follow-up study, as the available numbers can have a profound effect on the determined accuracy value...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{are only}} few {{reports on the}} fine needle {{aspiration}} cytology (FNAC) findings of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) of the liver. CASE: A 30 -year-old woman who had undergone surgery for a leiomyosarcoma of the calf, {{was found to have}} a hepatic mass five years later on imaging during routine <b>follow-up.</b> Fine <b>needle</b> aspiration was performed to rule out metastasis. Cytology revealed a few fragments of bland-looking spindle cells in a metachromatic stroma along with benign hepatocytes and bile duct cells. It was interpreted as "consistent with metastasis of leiomyosarcoma. " The excised mass showed histologic features typical of FNH. CONCLUSION: Spindle cell fragments have not been previously observed in the FNAC of FNH. These fragments probably represent the muscular wall of the abnormal blood vessels of FNH. If smooth muscle fragment is seen accompanying benign hepatocytes and bile duct cells, one should consider the diagnosis of FNH in the needle aspirate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Thyroid cancer {{harbours}} {{in about}} 5 % of thyroid nodules. The {{majority of them}} are well-differentiated cancers originating from the follicular epithelium, and are subdivided into papillary and follicular carcinomas. Undifferentiated carcinomas and medullary thyroid carcinomas arising from C cells are less common. Although most thyroid nodules are benign, distinguishing thyroid cancer from benign lesions is crucial for an appropriate treatment and <b>follow-up.</b> The fine <b>needle</b> aspiration cytology (FNAC) allows the diagnosis of nature of thyroid nodules in the majority of cases. However, FNAC has some limitations, particularly in the presence of follicular lesions which can appear dubious in rare instances even at histology. In an effort to improve diagnostic accuracy and offer new prognostic criteria, several immunohistochemical and molecular markers have been proposed. However, most of them have to be validated on large series before being used in routine practice...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the appropriate management of thyroid nodules with prior non-diagnostic or atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: This study included 4, 235 thyroid nodules from 26 eligible studies. We investigated the conclusive rate of <b>follow-up</b> core <b>needle</b> biopsy (CNB) or repeat fine needle aspiration (rFNA) after initial fine needle aspiration (FNA) with non-diagnostic or AUS/FLUS results. A diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) review was performed to determine the diagnostic role of the follow-up CNB and to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) on the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. Results: The conclusive rates of follow-up CNB and rFNA after initial FNA were 0. 879 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 801 to 0. 929) and 0. 684 (95 % CI, 0. 627 to 0. 736), respectively. In comparison of the odds ratios of CNB and rFNA, CNB had more frequent conclusive results than rFNA (odds ratio, 5. 707; 95 % CI, 2. 530 to 12. 875). Upon subgroup analysis, follow-up CNB showed a higher conclusive rate than rFNA in both initial non-diagnostic and AUS/FLUS subgroups. In DTA review of followup CNB, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0. 94 (95 % CI, 0. 88 to 0. 97) and 0. 88 (95 % CI, 0. 84 to 0. 91), respectively. The AUC for the SROC curve was 0. 981, nearing 1. Conclusions: Our results show that CNB has a higher conclusive rate than rFNA when the initial FNA produced inconclusive results. Further prospective studies with more detailed criteria are necessary before follow-up CNB can be applied in daily practice...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is {{the most}} widely applied {{procedure}} for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux. However, it can be followed by adverse outcomes, including dysphagia and "wind-related" problems. To {{reduce the likelihood of}} side effects, we have progressively modified this procedure to an anterior 90 ° partial fundoplication. METHODS: The procedure entails posterior hiatal repair, posterior esophagopexy, accentuation of the angle of His, and construction of a 90 ° anterior partial fundoplication. Clinical follow-up was performed prospectively using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: From February 1999 to June 2001, 83 patients underwent 90 ° anterior fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 45 the procedure was chosen because of specific patient or surgeon preference, and in 38 it was performed within the context of an ongoing randomized trial. Operating time ranged from 20 to 140 minutes (median, 52 min), and {{all but one of the}} procedures were completed laparoscopically. One patient experienced a major postoperative complication [...] small bowel injury from Veress <b>needle.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> extends up to 2 years (median, 1 year). Two patients have undergone further surgery, both for recurrent reflux. Control of reflux has been acceptable, with a reduction in heartburn symptom scores and high overall satisfaction. Postoperative dysphagia measured using a visual analog scale was less following surgery compared with preoperative scores. Eighty-two percent of patients could belch normally 3 and 12 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-degree anterior fundoplication achieves good control of reflux and a low incidence of side effects. To further evaluate its potential, we are currently undertaking a prospective randomized trial. R. J. Krysztopik, G. G. Jamieson, P. G. Devitt and D. I. Watso...|$|R
