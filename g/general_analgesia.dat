40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of electroacupuncture analgesia (EAA) at local and paravertebral acupoints for a rabbit undergoing an ovariohysterectomy. Twelve clinically healthy New Zealand white rabbits were chosen and divided into two groups: the control group (5 rabbits) and the experimental group (7 rabbits). A neuroleptanalgesic (ketamine + xylazine) was administered to the control group (NLA group); the experimental group received EAA treatment (EAA group). The EAA treatment includes one acupuncture formula for local stimulation at the incision site and systemic stimulation. Results of clinical research have shown postoperative analgesia using EAA treatment to be superior to that using NLA. The average postoperative recovery time was 5. 2 times longer in the NLA group than in the EAA group. Because consciousness was maintained, EAA presented an advantage in thermoregulation. Animals administered NLA had prolonged thermal homeostasis because of neurovegetative disconnection. For the EAA group, the operative times were characterized as excellent (28 %, p =  0. 28) or good (72 %, p =  0. 72). Local stimulation at the incision site provided excellent analgesia of the abdominal wall (100 %). In conclusion, EA can provide <b>general</b> <b>analgesia</b> with a considerable analgesic effect for a rabbit undergoing an ovariohysterectomy, resulting in a short postoperative recovery time...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to develop}} an {{algorithm}} in order to choose a method for anesthesia and its components that minimally affect heart rhythm and the cardiac conduction system (CCS) for patients {{at high risk for}} perioperative arrhythmias. Subjects and methods. Seventy-five patients aged 62. 2 ± 9. 63 years, who received cardiotropic therapy for the compensation of cardiovascular diseases and had undergone surgery for abdominal malignancies, were examined. According to the anesthesia technique, the patients were randomized into 4 groups: 1) (n= 16) multimodal intravenous <b>general</b> <b>analgesia</b> (IGA); 2) (n= 17) sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia (IA); 3) (n= 19) combination epidural anesthesia (EA) and IGA; 4) (n= 20) a combination of EA and IA. The effects of anesthesia components on heart rhythm and CCS were evaluated from the results of Holter continuous ECG monitoring. Results. A change in the heart rhythm pattern was recorded in all the study group patients. Group 1 had increased ectopic activity: a {{rise in the number of}} supraventricular and ventricular premature beats (SPB and VPB) by 67. 2 and 29. 9 %, respectively (p 2000 msec), which required special correction in 8 of the 19 patients in Group 3 and in 5 of the 20 patients in Group 4, respectively. There were no postoperative complications associated with cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances. Conclusion. The choice of an anesthesia technique at high risk for perioperative arrhythmias is determined by the baseline cardiological status of a patient and by the nature of the arrhythmogenic effect of anesthetics. Multimodal IGA is preferred for baseline conduction disturbances. Sympathetic epidural blocks in combination with IGA and IA are indicated for patients with tachysystoles. Sevoflurane has no considerable effect on rhythm and CCS. Key words: peri-operative arrhythmias, anesthesia for high vascular risk patients, operation, cardiotropic therapy...|$|E
40|$|Inter{{national}} {{and national}} use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) {{is high in}} the general population and among patients. The level of knowledge about CAM among health care professions is low, but an interest in receiving education about this field has been observed. Concerning surgical care, previous studies indicate a wide range of CAM use among patients, but the level of knowledge among health care professions is poorly investigated, both internationally and in Sweden. Concerning CAM therapies in the management of signs and symptoms in surgical care, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) was used with a variety of effectiveness and osteopathic medicine was found to be poorly investigated in this context. The overall objective of this thesis was to investigate CAM in the surgical context with a focus on health care professions’ perceptions and understanding and the usefulness of therapy in symptom management in clinical settings. Both inductive (paper I; semi structured interviews, n= 16) and deductive (paper II; questionnaire, n= 737) methods were used to investigate perceptions and understanding of CAM among Swedish health care professions in surgical care. TENS as a pain relieving complement during the transition from epidural analgesia (EDA) to <b>general</b> <b>analgesia</b> after major abdominal surgery was investigated in a randomized controlled trial design (paper III; n= 20). Osteopathic intervention in management of chronic signs and symptoms after thoracotomy was investigated with a single-subject research design (paper IV; n= 8). The results reveal that surgical health care professions understand and perceive CAM as a wide range of therapies, remedies and systems. Their self valued level of knowledge was low, both concerning CAM and CAM research, but a desire was found to gain knowledge about CAM. A majority of the participants would consider learning a CAM therapy. Dialog about and referral to CAM occurred, but to a limited extent. Concerning therapy usability, TENS was not found to significantly relieve pain, promote recovery or reduce consumption of analgesics. In addition, comments from nurses and patients indicated that TENS treatment obstructed postoperative care. A significant improvement was observed in the osteopathic intervention in stiffness and benefits for pain, but not in breathing. The comprehensive conclusion of the thesis is that Swedish health care professions recognise the concept of CAM and some of its therapies, but their knowledge is in general low. Concerning therapy usability and the effectiveness of CAM in surgical care, the context is essential; TENS after major abdominal surgery in EDA elimination is questionable as concerns pain and its clinical application, while osteopathy may be beneficial in the management of chronic signs and symptoms after thoracotomy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Paravertebral block (PVB) is a {{safe and}} {{effective}} anesthetic technique for thoracotomy and mastectomy. However, no systematic review or meta-analysis has focused on PVB for inguinal herniorrhaphy. Our study compares PVB with <b>general</b> anesthesia/systemic <b>analgesia,</b> neuraxial blocks, and other peripheral nerve blocks. METHODS: We analyzed 14 randomized controlled trials from PubMed, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and CINAHL up to February 2015, without language restriction, comparing PVB under sedation with <b>general</b> anesthesia/systematic <b>analgesia</b> (135 vs 133 patients), neuraxial blocks (191 vs 186 patients), and other peripheral nerve blocks (119 vs 117 patients). We investigated pain scores, consumption of postoperative analgesia, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), length of hospital stay, postanesthesia care unit bypassing rate, time to perform blocks, intraoperative hemodynamics, and incidence of urinary retention. Joint hypothesis testing was adopted for pain and analgesics, PONV, and hemodynamic variables. All analyses were performed with RevMan 5. 2. 11 (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen). Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method was used for post hoc testing. RESULTS: PVB reduced PONV (nausea: risk ratio [RR] = 0. 22; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 05 - 0. 93; numbers needed to treat [NNT] = 4. 5; I = 15 % and vomiting: RR = 0. 15; 95 % CI, 0. 03 - 0. 76; NNT = 8. 3; I = 0 %) compared with <b>general</b> anesthesia/systematic <b>analgesia</b> (quality of evidence [QoE]: high). Compared with neuraxial blocks, PVB resulted in less postoperative nausea (RR = 0. 34 [95 % CI, 0. 13 - 0. 91], NNT = 8. 3, I = 0 %) and urinary retention (RR = 0. 14 [95 % CI, 0. 05 - 0. 42], NNT = 7. 4, I = 0 %) than neuraxial blocks (QoE: high). More time was needed to perform PVB than neuraxial blocks (standardized mean difference = 1. 90 [95 % CI, 0. 02 - 3. 77], I = 92 %; mean difference = 5. 33 minutes; QoE: moderate). However, the available data could not reject the null hypothesis of noninferiority on all pain scores and analgesic requirements for both PVB versus <b>general</b> anesthesia/systematic <b>analgesia</b> and PVB versus neuraxial blocks (QoE: low), {{as well as on}} hemodynamic outcomes for PVB versus neuraxial blocks (QoE: moderate). Our systematic review showed that PVB decreased postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirement as compared with ilioinguinal block and transversus abdominis plane block. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that PVB provides an anesthesia with fewer undesirable effects for inguinal herniorrhaphy. The choice between <b>general</b> anesthesia/systematic <b>analgesia,</b> neuraxial blocks, PVB, and other peripheral nerve blocks should be based on time available to perform the block and a complete coverage over the relevant structures by the blocks...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND General Anaesthesia (GA) is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used technique for all laparoscopic surgeries. The aim is to study the attenuation of physiological changes that are associated with laparoscopic surgeries by regional (epidural) analgesia when combined with general anaesthesia to compare the intraoperative variables after administering general anaesthesia and combined general anaesthesia with regional analgesia (epidural) in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgeries. Our aim is to compare the requirement of anaesthetic drugs between patients receiving only general anaesthesia and those receiving general anaesthesia with epidural analgesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred patients posted for laparoscopic abdominal surgeries were enrolled in this randomised controlled trial. They were randomly selected to undergo general anaesthesia or combined general anaesthesia with regional analgesia. Monitoring was done for heart rate, blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide and awareness during anaesthesia. RESULTS Cardiovascular stability (heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure) was satisfactory in the intraoperative period in both the groups. The anaesthetic and analgesic drugs required were significantly lower in the combined <b>general</b> anaesthesia-regional <b>analgesia</b> group as compared to patients receiving only general anaesthesia. CONCLUSION The combined <b>general</b> anaesthesia-regional <b>analgesia</b> group has the advantage of more cardiovascular stability, lower requirement of analgesics and general anaesthetic agents/drugs...|$|R
30|$|Surgical findings: A {{combination}} of <b>general</b> and epidural <b>analgesia</b> was administered {{with the patient}} lying on his right side. A T-shaped incision was made directly above the tumor in the left axilla. The tumor had a maximum diameter of 21  cm, was relatively inflexible, and had invaded {{the muscles of the}} thoracic wall; however, it had not invaded the ribs. Many swollen lymph nodes, located from the interpectoral area (Rotter’s lymph node) to the left supraclavicular fossa, were connected to the main tumor. We removed as many lymph nodes as possible to ease the symptoms associated with tumor enlargement.|$|R
40|$|Morphine is {{the core}} of {{perioperative}} pain management. However, when it comes to cancer surgery the possibility that this drug might affect tumor recurrence and metastasis has raised concerns. The results of two recent retrospective clinical trials indicated that regional anesthesia/analgesia might be beneficial in prostate and breast cancer surgery. It was proposed that morphine could be responsible for the higher recurrence and mortality rate observed in the <b>general</b> anesthesia/opioid <b>analgesia</b> groups. Nevertheless, the results of several other retrospective studies and one randomized prospective trial failed to confirm any advantage for regional anesthesia/analgesia over general anesthesia and opioid analgesia. Moreover laboratory data on the effect of morphine on cancer are contradictory, ranging from tumor-promoting to anti-tumor effects. Considering that surgical stress and pain promote the recurrence and spread of cancer, choosing a proper analgesic strategy is of high significance. Although the question of whether morphine causes any harm to cancer patients remains unanswered, alternative analgesic regimens could be used concomitant to or instead of morphine to limit its potential adverse effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{spinal cord}} plays an {{important}} role in modulating anesthetic-induced suppression of nociceptive transmission. To gain some insight into the anesthetic mechanisms of propofol at the spinal level, we investigated the direct action of propofol and its modulation on the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor (GABA(A) R) and the glycine receptor (GlyR) in acutely dissociated rat spinal dorsal horn neurons by using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Propofol induced Cl- currents (I-Cl), which were sensitive to bicuculline and, to a lesser extent, to strychnine. The activation, desensitization, and deactivation of propofol-induced I-Cl, were slower than those of GABA- and glycine-induced I-Cl, In addition, this study revealed similar modulatory actions of propofol on GABA(A) R and GlyR. Propofol potentiated both GABA- and glycine-incluced I-Cl at small concentrations and inhibited both GABA- and glycine-induced I-Cl at large concentrations. The potentiation of propofol on I-Cl, was caused by slowing current desensitization and deactivation, whereas the inhibition actions might be involved in the cross-desensitization between GABA- and propofol-induced I-Cl and the cross-inhibition between the GABA(A) R and GlyR. The results suggest that propofol facilitation of GABA(A) R and GlyR at the spinal level could contribute significantly to <b>general</b> anesthetic-induced <b>analgesia</b> and anesthesia...|$|R

40|$|Analgesias {{induced by}} an {{interaction}} between restraint and morphine, {{an interaction between}} exposure to a novel environment and morphine, and by restraint alone were all shown to be dependent upon an increase in brain tryptophan uptake. Further investigation of the analgesia induced by an interaction between retraint and morphine revealed {{that the increase in}} brain tryptophan uptake was induced by sympathetic activity and that the nucleus raphe magnus, the nucleus raphe dorsalis, and the periaqueductal gray were critical to the analgesia. Examination of the endogenous opiod activity critical to analgesia induced by restraint alone revealed that the opioid activity was in the central nervous system and independent of tryptophan uptake.

40|$|Ketamine elicits various neuropharmacological effects, {{including}} sedation, <b>analgesia,</b> <b>general</b> anesthesia, and antidepressant activity. Through an {{in vitro}} screen, we identified four mouse olfactory receptors (ORs) that responded to ketamine. In {{addition to their}} presence in the olfactory epithelium, these G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein) –coupled receptors (GPCRs) are distributed throughout the central nervous system. To better understand the molecular basis of the interactions between ketamine and ORs, we used sequence comparison and molecular modeling to design mutations that (i) increased, reduced, or abolished ketamine responsiveness in responding receptors, and (ii) rendered non-responding receptors responsive to ketamine. We showed that olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that expressed distinct ORs responded to ketamine in vivo, suggesting that ORs may serve as functional targets for ketamine. The ability to both abolish and introduce responsiveness to ketamine in GPCRs enabled us to identify and confirm distinct interaction loci in the binding site, which suggested a signature ketamine-binding pocket that may guide exploration of additional receptors for this general anesthetic drug...|$|R

In this study, we investigated the role of deferoxamine (DFO), a clinically used iron chelator, in a mouse model of surgery-induced {{cognitive dysfunction}} and assessed its neuroprotective effects on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and memory function. METHODS: A model of laparotomy under <b>general</b> anesthesia and <b>analgesia</b> was used to study POCD. Twelve to 14  months C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice were treated with DFO, and changes in iron signaling, microglia activity, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and neurotrophic factors were assessed in the hippocampus on postoperative days 3, 7, and 14. Memory function was evaluated using fear conditioning and Morris water maze tests. BV 2 microglia cells were {{used to test the}} anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of DFO. RESULTS: Peripheral surgical trauma triggered changes in hippocampal iron homeostasis including ferric iron deposition, increase in hepcidin and divalent metal transporter- 1, reduction in ferroportin and ferritin, and oxidative stress. Microglia activation, inflammatory cytokines, brain-derived neurotropic factor impairments, and cognitive dysfunction were found up to day 14 after surgery. Treatment with DFO significantly reduced neuroinflammation and improved cognitive decline by modulating p 38 MAPK signaling, reactive oxygen species, and pro-inflammatory cytokines release. CONCLUSIONS: Iron imbalance represents a novel mechanism underlying surgery-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. DFO treatment regulates neuroinflammation and microglia activity after surgery...|$|R

Methods: This was an analytic retrospective study with cross sectional design. This study uses medical record’s data from 149 neonates born alive through a cesarean section with general anesthesia and spinal analgesia at RSUP dr. Kariadi Semarang during period 1 January 2008 - 31 December 2009. Data were collected then grouped and displayed in table form. Then analyzed with SPSS 15 for Windows, with the Mann-Whitney test. Results: Mann-Whitney test was significant(p< 0. 05) for all apgar scores (p 1 = 0. 005; p 5 = 0. 007; P 10 = 0. 001). No significant difference in the type of elective cesarean section and non-elective cesarean section in this study (p 1 = 0. 726; p 5 = 0. 862; p 10 = 0. 224). In elective caesarean section there was no significant apgar scores difference between these two techniques, whereas in non-elective caesarean section there were significant differences(p 1,p 5,p 10 = 0. 000). Conclusion: There was a significant difference between neonates apgar score in cesarean section at the first, fifth and tenth of minutes under general anesthesia and spinal <b>analgesia.</b> Keywords: <b>general</b> anesthesia, spinal <b>analgesia,</b> apgar score, cesarean section...|$|R
40|$|Aloe vera is a {{perennial}} succulent {{belong to the}} Lily (Liliaceae) family. This plant has been known as the healing plant. Aloe vera {{has been used for}} traditional medical purposes in several cultures for millennia. It has been demonstrated that Aloe vera has growth promoting activities. The objective {{of this study was to}} determination of the effect of Aloe vera on healing of the experimental skin wounds on rats and its comparison with zinc oxide. Zinc oxide is being used worldwide as an absorbent and protective compound. Its pharmacological properties are wide and its non-toxic material allows it to be used as a routine skin care substance. In current study, 70 female wistar rats where included in 5 groups. Full thickness incisional wound with 23 mm diameter was made with surgical scissors and scalpel. The whole operation was taking place under <b>general</b> anesthesia and <b>analgesia</b> circumstances. After making surgical wounds, rats are treated as mentioned in the text. Rats are observed for 21 days for wound closure process and inflammatory conditions taking place in wound. Biopsy intervals are 0 (the day of surgery), 3, 7, 14 and 21 th day after surgery. In these certain days rats were euthanized and biopsies of wound sites were obtained. Wounds areas are also, measured by Scion Image ™ Software daily. At last, all data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics Ver. 17. As a result, Aloe vera at the dose of 10 % has significant healing properties compared to Zinc oxide. These data were validating under confidence surface of 95 % (p< 0. 01) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of an {{international}} initiative and is a first attempt to develop guidelines for the care and welfare of cephalopods (i. e. nautilus, cuttlefish, squid and octopus) following the inclusion of this Class of ∼ 700 known living invertebrate species in Directive 2010 / 63 /EU. It aims to provide information for investigators, animal care committees, facility managers and animal care staff which will assist in improving both the care given to cephalopods, {{and the manner in which}} experimental procedures are carried out. Topics covered include: implications of the Directive for cephalopod research; project application requirements and the authorisation process; the application of the 3 Rs principles; the need for harm-benefit assessment and severity classification. Guidelines and species-specific requirements are provided on: i. supply, capture and transport; ii. environmental characteristics and design of facilities (e. g. water quality control, lighting requirements, vibration/noise sensitivity); iii. accommodation and care (including tank design), animal handling, feeding and environmental enrichment; iv. assessment of health and welfare (e. g. monitoring biomarkers, physical and behavioural signs); v. approaches to severity assessment; vi. disease (causes, prevention and treatment); vii. scientific procedures, <b>general</b> anaesthesia and <b>analgesia,</b> methods of humane killing and confirmation of death. Sections covering risk assessment for operators and education and training requirements for carers, researchers and veterinarians are also included. Detailed aspects of care and welfare requirements for the main laboratory species currently used are summarised in Appendices. Knowledge gaps are highlighted to prompt research to enhance the evidence base for future revision of these guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Background: Paravertebral {{block is}} a popular {{regional}} anesthetic technique used for perioperative analgesia in multiple surgical procedures. There are very few randomized trials of its use in laparoscopic cholecystectomy in medical literature. This study was aimed at assessing its efficacy and opioid-sparing potential in this surgery. Methods: Fifty patients were included in this prospective randomized study and allocated to two groups: Group A (25 patients) receiving general anesthesia alone and Group B (25 patients) receiving nerve-stimulator-guided bilateral thoracic Paravertebral Block (PVB) at T 6 level with 0. 3 ml/kg of 0. 25 % bupivacaine prior to induction of <b>general</b> anesthesia. Intraoperative <b>analgesia</b> was supplemented with fentanyl (0. 5 μg/kg) based on hemodynamic and clinical parameters. Postoperatively, patients in both the groups received Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) morphine for the first 24 hours. The efficacy of PVB was assessed by comparing intraoperative fentanyl requirements, postoperative VAS scores at rest, and on coughing and PCA morphine consumption between the two groups. Results: Intraoperative supplemental fentanyl was significantly less in Group B compared to Group A (17. 6 μg and 38. 6 μg, respectively, P = 0. 001). PCA morphine requirement was significantly low in the PVB group at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively compared to that in Group A (4. 4 mg vs 6. 9 mg, 7. 6 mg vs 14. 2 mg, 11. 6 mg vs 20. 0 mg, 16. 8 mg vs 27. 2 mg, respectively; P < 0. 0001 at all intervals). Conclusion: Pre-induction PVB resulted in improved analgesia for 24 hours following laparoscopic cholecystectomy in this study, along with {{a significant reduction in}} perioperative opioid consumption and opioid-related side effects...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{aim of the}} study: Patients with {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and femoral catheter analgesia may develop quadriceps amyotrophy. We aimed to determine whether this amyotrophy {{might be related to}} a femoral neuropathy. Material and method: After Ethical Committee approval and patients' written informed consent, 17 patients ASA I and II scheduled to undergo ACL reconstruction were recruited. An electromyography (EMG) was performed before the operation in order to exclude a femoral neuropathy. A femoral nerve catheter was inserted before the surgery {{with the aid of a}} nerve stimulator, and 20 ml of 0. 5 % ropivacaine was injected. The operation was done under spinal or <b>general</b> anaesthesia. Postoperative <b>analgesia</b> was provided with 0. 2 % ropivacaine for 72 hours, in association with oxycodone, paracetamol and ibuprofen. A second EMG was performed 4 weeks after the ACL repair. A femoral neuropathy was defined as a reduction of the surface of the motor response of more than 20 %, compared to the first EMG. A third EMG was performed at 6 months if a neuropathy was present. Results: Mean age of this group of patients was 27 years old (range 18 - 38 y.). Among the 17 patients, 4 developed a transient femoral neuropathy (incidence of 24 %) without clinical complain. Conclusion: In this study, the incidence of subclinical femoral neuropathy after ACL reconstruction is high. This lesion may be caused by the femoral catheter (mechanical damage, toxicity of local anaesthesia) or by the Tourniquet. Further studies are needed to investigate the incidence of subclinical neuropathy, according to the type of analgesia (epidural analgesia, PCA) and surgery...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} current {{clinical practice}} against the BSPAR/ARMA Standards of Care (SOCs) {{for children and}} young people (CYP) with incident JIA. Methods. Ten UK paediatric rheumatology centres (including all current centres nationally accredited for paediatric rheumatology higher specialist training) participated in a retrospective case notes review using a pretested pro forma based on the SOC. Data collected per centre included clinical service configuration and the initial clinical care for a minimum of 30 consecutive new patients seen within the previous 2 years and followed up for at least 6 months. Results. A total of 428 CYP with JIA (median age 11 years, range 121 years) were included, with complete data available for 73 % (311 / 428). Against the key SOCs, 41 % (175 / 428) were assessed 410 weeks from symptom onset, 60 % (186 / 311) 44 weeks from referral, 26 % (81 / 311) had eye screening at 46 weeks, 83 % (282 / 341) had joint injections at 46 weeks, 59 % (184 / 311) were assessed by a nurse specialist at 44 weeks and 45 % (141 / 311) were assessed by a physiotherapist at 48 weeks. A median of 6 % of patients per centre participated in clinical trials. All centres had access to eye screening and prescribed biologic therapies. All had access to a nurse specialist and physiotherapist. Most had access to an occupational therapist (8 / 10), psychologist (8 / 10), joint injection lists (<b>general</b> anaesthesia/ inhaled <b>analgesia)</b> (9 / 10) and designated transitional care clinics (7 / 10). Conclusion. This first description of UK clinical practice in paediatric rheumatology benchmarked against the BSPAR/ARMA SOCs demonstrates variable clinical service delivery. Considerable delay in access to specialist care is evident and this needs to be addressed in order to improve clinical outcomes.

40|$|Introducción: Nuestro objetivo es valorar la eficacia de dos técnicas anestésicas en el tratamiento del dolor postoperatorio, así como su influencia en la estancia hospitalaria, tras la cirugía artroscópica de hombro. Material y métodos: Estudio retrospectivo basado en la recogida de datos de las historias de anestesiología y de nuestra unidad de dolor agudo (UDA), durante un período de 6 meses, seleccionando los casos de artroscopias de hombro {{realizadas}} y distribuyendo los pacientes en 2 grupos en función de la técnica anestésica empleada. En el grupo I se incluyó a pacientes con anestesia locorregional (bloque interescalénico e interesternocleidomastoideo) combinado con anestesia general. En el grupo II se incluyeron los casos de anestesia <b>general</b> con <b>analgesia</b> por vía intravenosa con bolos de fentanilo. Las variables registradas fueron: dolor posoperatorio, tanto en reposo como en movimiento, en las primeras 24 h, utilizando una escala verbal simple (EVS), la presencia de efectos secundarios, la necesidad de rescate analgésico y el tiempo quirúrgico empleado. En los casos en que los pacientes fueron dados de alta en las primeras 24 h, se realizó una consulta telefónica para valoración de dichas variables. El análisis estadístico se realizó mediante prueba de la t de Student (para variables numéricas) y prueba de la χ² (para analizar las relaciones entre variables cualitativas), considerando el estudio estadísticamente significativo si se obtuvo una p 0, 05). En el grupo de la anestesia combinada el tiempo medio de estancia fue de 36 h, frente a las 60 h de media en el grupo de anestesia general (p Objectives: Our aim is {{to evaluate}} the efficacy of two anesthetic techniques {{for the treatment of}} the postoperative pain, as well as their influence on hospital stay, after surgery arthroscopic of shoulder. Materials and methods: Retrospective study based on the collection of data from anesthesia histories and from of our postoperative acute pain unit, during a 6 -months period. Cases of shoulder arthroscopies carried out during this period were selected and the patients were distributed in 2 groups depending on the anesthetic technique used: group I consisted of patients treated with locoregional anesthesia (interscalene and inter-sternocleidomastoid block) combined with general anesthesia. Group II was general anesthesia cases with intravenous analgesia. The recorded variables were the following: postoperative pain, both at rest and during exercise in the first 24 h, using a simple verbal scale (SVS); the presence of side effects, need of analgesic rescue and duration of hospital stay. In the cases where the patients were discharged from hospital in the first 24 h, a telephone consultation was carried out for the evaluation of the abovementioned variables. Statistical analysis: Student-t and Chi-square tests. A P. 05). In the group of combined anesthesia the average duration of hospital stay was 36 h, compared to the 60 h average duration in the group of General Anesthesia. (P<. 05). Discussion: The blockade of the brachial plexus over the clavicle combined with general anesthesia has shown greater efficacy in the control of perioperative pain, both at rest and during exercise than the general anesthesia with intravenous analgesia. In addition, the incidence of undesirable effects, the need of rescue and the duration of hospital stay were lower in the group of patients with the combined technique, without significant effects on the duration of operating room occupation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFrom January 2013 {{scientific}} projects involving cephalopods became {{regulated by}} Directive 2010 / 63 /EU, but at present {{there is little}} guidance specifically for cephalopods {{on a number of}} key requirements of the Directive, including: recognition of pain, suffering and distress and implementation of humane end-points; anaesthesia and analgesia, and humane killing. This paper critically reviews these key areas prior to the development of guidelines and makes recommendations, including identifying topics for further research. In particular: a) Evidence on how cephalopods might experience pain is reviewed; and a draft scheme of behavioural and physiological criteria for recognising and assessing pain, suffering and distress in cephalopods used in scientific procedures is presented and discussed. b) Agents and protocols currently used for <b>general</b> anaesthesia and <b>analgesia</b> are evaluated. Magnesium chloride, ethanol and clove oil are the most frequently used agents, but their efficacy and potential for induction of aversion need to be systematically investigated, according to the species of cephalopod and factors such as body weight, sex and water temperature. Means of sedating animals prior to anaesthesia should be investigated. Criteria for assessing depth of anaesthesia, including depression of ventilation, decrease in chromatophore tone (paling), reduced arm activity, tone and sucker adhesiveness, loss of normal posture and righting reflex, and loss of response to a noxious stimulus, are discussed. c) Analgesia should be provided for cephalopods used in scientific procedures, whenever this would be the case for vertebrates. However, research is needed to evaluate effective agents and administration routes for cephalopods. d) Techniques for local anaesthesia need to be defined and evaluated. e) Currently used methods of killing and criteria for confirmation of death in cephalopods are evaluated. Based on present knowledge, a protocol for humane killing of cephalopods is proposed. However, further evaluation is needed, along with development of humane methods of killing that will not compromise study of the brain. On humane grounds: i. mechanical (as opposed to chemical) methods of killing should not be used on conscious cephalopods (unless specifically authorised by the national competent authority); and ii. hatchlings and larvae should be killed by overdose of anaesthetic and not by immersion in tissue fixative. Key gaps in current knowledge are also highlighted, so as to encourage research that will contribute to the evidence base needed to develop guidelines to the Directive...|$|R
