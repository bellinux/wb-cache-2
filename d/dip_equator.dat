5000|$|Okeke has {{dedicated}} {{much of her}} career to studying the ionosphere and the “equatorial electrojet phenomenon.” Energized by the sun, the electrojet is a river of electric current that traverses the globe eastward around the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> and causes the magnetic field at the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> to vary almost fives time more than anywhere else on the planet. (The dip or magnetic equator differs from the equator by a few degrees, as the Earth’s magnetic north pole is {{different from what we}} generally think of as the north pole.) ...|$|E
50|$|The EEJ {{phenomenon}} {{was first}} identified using geomagnetic data. The amplitude {{of the daily}} variation of the horizontal magnetic intensity (ΔH) measured at a geomagnetic observatory near the dip-equator is 3-5 fold higher than the variation of data from other regions of Earth. A typical diurnal equatorial observatory data show a peak of strength ~80 nT at 12:00 LT, {{with respect to the}} night-time level. Egedal (1947) showed that the enhancement of quiet day solar daily variations in ΔH (Sq(H)) lay within the 50 latitude centered on the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> The mechanism that produced the variation in the magnetic field was proposed as a band of current about 300 km in width flowing over the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b>|$|E
30|$|We have {{analyzed}} the Sq current system {{in terms of}} the Sq foci track variability with respect to longitude, day, season, and solar activity. The computed tracks result in pronounced mid-latitude bands in the northern and southern hemisphere. The computed Sq tracks seem to neither follow the geographic nor the geomagnetic or <b>dip</b> <b>equators.</b> We observe a pronounced scattering of the tracks over the SAA. Remarkably, the scattering appears to be very robust, irrespective of the dataset used. This systematic scattering manifests as a large shift of the southern hemisphere focus northwards during northern summer and southwards during the southern solstice. The shift of the southern Sq focus tracks with respect to the seasons is clearly evident. The physical mechanism of this systematic effect remains unclear. The longitudinal variations of the Sq foci are believed to have their origin from an influence of non-migrating tides as reported in recent studies and the anomalous weak amplitude of the geomagnetic main field over the SAA.|$|R
40|$|The diurnal, seasonal, {{spatial and}} {{magnetic}} activity {{variations of the}} southern-hemisphere mid-latitude trough has been studied by using GPS and TOPEX satellite techniques during the low-sunspot number period of February 1995 –February 1996. The ionospheric total electron content (TEC) values {{were obtained from the}} raw satellite data to observe the trough both locally in the Australian longitude region and globally over the world oceans. Various trough features were observed and investigated under different magnetic conditions, and were compared to the results of other researchers employing different techniques at Macquarie Island (− 54. 5 °N; 154. 95 °E, geographic and the magnetic shell parameter (L) is 5. 38). The ionization build-up on the equatorward trough wall, which has not been investigated since Foster (1993), is discussed in detail with the ΔTEC parameter utilized to characterize it. Some of the GPS findings were confirmed with the TOPEX results. Comparisons with the model generated TEC plots indicated that the model did not reproduce the trough. Several day-time and night-time global TOPEX TEC maps, showing also the geomagnetic and <b>dip</b> <b>equators,</b> were constructed for the season of the 1995 autumnal equinox to observe the trough globally, {{the first time in the}} literature, with other large-scale ionospheric formations. The magnetic alignment of these large-scale ionospheric formations is obvious. On the night-time maps the empirical position of the trough were plotted for various local time values at Kp= 0 and 6, and indicated a very good agreement between the experimental and theoretical results...|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} storm petrels {{are found}} in the northern hemisphere although some species around the <b>equator</b> <b>dip</b> into the south. They are strictly pelagic, coming to land only when breeding. In the case of most species, little is known of their behaviour and distribution at sea, where they can be hard to find and harder to identify. They are colonial nesters, displaying strong philopatry to their natal colonies and nesting sites. Most species nest in crevices or burrows and all but one species attend the breeding colonies nocturnally. Pairs form long-term monogamous bonds and share incubation and chick-feeding duties. Like many species of seabird, nesting is highly protracted with incubation taking up to 50 days and fledging another 70 days after that.|$|R
50|$|EEJ {{studies from}} {{satellite}} data were initiated {{with the arrival}} of data from the POGO (Polar Orbiting Geophysical Observatories) series of satellite (1967-1970). The characteristic signature of the EEJ is a sharp negative V-shaped curve in the H field, attaining its minimum within 0.5° of the magnetic <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> The magnetic data from satellite missions like Ørsted (1999-present) and CHAMP (2000-present) have vastly improved our knowledge of the EEJ.|$|E
50|$|The {{worldwide}} solar-driven wind {{results in}} the so-called Sq (solar quiet) current system in the E region of the Earth's ionosphere (100 - 130 km altitude). Resulting from this current is an electrostatic field directed east-west (dawn-dusk) in the equatorial day side of the ionosphere. At the magnetic <b>dip</b> <b>equator,</b> where the geomagnetic field is horizontal, this electric field results in an enhanced eastward current flow within ±3 degrees of the magnetic equator, known as the equatorial electrojet (EEJ).|$|E
50|$|Lunar (L) {{currents}} are weaker by {{a factor}} of about 20 than the Sq currents. The dominant wind component to drive these currents is the (2, 2) tidal mode. The L current is similar in shape as the Sq current, with the difference that four vortices instead of two exit. In each vortex a total current of about 4 kA flows. The seasonal variation of L {{is similar to that of}} Sq. During sunlit hours, L is strongly enhanced, while it approaches zero during the night. Thus, the L current exhibits, in addition, a modulation depending on the lunar phase. The geomagnetic effect of the L-current can best been seen near the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> where the Cowling conductivity strongly enhances that current.|$|E
30|$|It is interesting, however, to {{contrast}} F 2 -layer critical frequency analysis results {{obtained from the}} present study with the recent results presented by Oyekola (2011) within West-African sector, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso (12 °N, 1.5 °W; dip latitude: 1.5 °N) and Ibadan, Nigeria (7.4 °N, 3.9 °E; dip latitude: 2.3 °S). Using observational data collected from Ibadan during very high solar activity year of 1958, yearly-averaged sunspot number R 12 = 184.8 for quiet geomagnetic conditions. CCIR model of foF 2 was chosen. The hourly percent deviation (%ΔfoF 2) varies from − 11 % to 12 % (March), − 34 % to 11 % (June), − 16 % to 12 % (September) and − 10 % to 13 % (December). The model error ranges between about 50 – 125 % over the four selected months, with maximum error occurring in the month of June. On the other hand, the present analysis utilizes ionosonde data acquired from Ouagadougou during high solar activity year of 1990, yearly mean sunspot number R 12 = 142.6 for quiet-day F 2 -layer. Both URSI and CCIR models of foF 2 were used for the study. The hourly percent deviation is as follows: January: − 30 % to 124 % (URSI) and − 70 % to − 9 % (CCIR), April: − 70 % to 15 % (URSI) and − 70 % to near zero % (CCIR), July: − 65 % to − 3 % (URSI) and − 76 % to − 2 % (CCIR) and October: − 67 % to 11 % (URSI) and − 67 % to 17 % (CCIR). Here, the total normalized root mean squared difference is typically within approximately 12 % to 35 % (URSI) and 30 % to 44 % (CCIR). On the basis of these results, the following main points are in order: (1) CCIR foF 2 model consistently presents substantial hour-to-hour and season-to-season percent deviation over Ouagadougou compared to that of Ibadan, while Ibadan demonstrates higher values and wider range of model error than those of Ouagadougou for similar undisturbed geomagnetic conditions but appreciably different yearly-averaged sunspot number, ∼ 23 % difference in R 12 values. (2) The substantial disparity in value of ΔfoF 2 is partly probably due to peculiarity in magnetic hemisphere, even though the stations are almost close to <b>dip</b> magnetic <b>equator.</b> (3) F 2 -layer critical frequency results in such a narrow longitudinal range represent the complicated behaviors of the foF 2 parameter derived from equatorial ionograms and hence equatorial ionosphere.|$|R
40|$|In {{the effort}} of {{modelling}} the global distribution 7 Be, 210 Pb and 210 Po in surface air, the results from exploration of radioactivity exploration from the Arctic to the Antarctic during 1980 to 1996 are compiled with the results reported by other authors. Partial least square regression modelling PLS-regression, predict missing 7 Be, 210 Pb and 210 Po values of air concentration or annual deposition. All available data of air concentration and deposition, of these radionuclides are then correlated with geophysical parameters. The {{results indicate that the}} global latitudinal distribution of 7 Be air concentration was rather flat, with an overall global average of 4. 2 (SE 0. 4) mBq. m- 3, although with a slight <b>dip</b> at the <b>equator</b> and decrease towards high latitudes. The corresponding latitudinal distribution was also flat, and decreased slightly at high and low altitudes, with overall global average of 7 Be annual deposition was 1500 (SE 100) Bq. m- 3. a- 1. The 7 Be deposition rate estimated from reported annual mean air concentration and annual deposition is 13. 4 +/- 1. 7 (SE) mm. s- 1. By using PLS-r modelling of either air concentrations or annual depositions, the average deposition rate of 7 Be was estimated to 12. 3 +/- 1. 6 (SD) mm. s- 1. The 7 Be deposition-rate don´t vary significantly with longitude, latitude or geometrical average year of sampling date. Linear regression with height, however, is negative with a coefficient of - 0. 02. At sea level, the 7 Be deposition-rate was estimated to 13 mm. s- 1, while at a height of 800 m it was predicted to be 7 mm. s- 1. The 16 values of 7 Be deposition rate, reported in the literature, are widely scattered (SD = 18) with an average of about 18 mm. s- 1. The latitudinal distribution of the activity concentration of 210 Pb in air showed a maximum of about 600 +/- 200 micoBq. m- 3 around 45 oN with a steady decrease towards higher and lower latitudes. Minimum values of 400 micoBq. m- 3 and 80 micoBq. m- 3 were estimated at 90 oN and at 90 oS respectively. The latitudinal distribution of all 210 Pb air concentration values (micoBq. m- 3) is given by the following equation: log 10 [210 Pb] = 2. 52 + 0. 0083 ·(Latitude) - 9. 87. 10 - 5 · (Latitude) 2. The latitudinal distribution of all 210 Pb annual deposition values (Bq. m- 2. a- 1) showed a maximum of about 200 +/- 100 Bq. m- 2. a- 1 around 45 oN, with a steady decrease towards higher and lower latitudes. A minimum of 100 Bq. m- 2. a- 1 was predicted at 90 oN, although a value of 17 +/- 4 Bq. m- 2. a- 1 has been recorded at 84. 4 oN 2. 3 oW. At 90 oS the predicted 210 Pb annual deposition was 3 Bq. m- 2. a- 1. The 210 Pb deposition rate was estimated 12. 5 +/- 0. 7 mm. s- 1 with no significant variation with latitude, height, or average of interval of sampling date. With longitude, however, the 210 Pb deposition rate varied significantly (linear k= 0. 02) R= 0. 99. The values of 210 Po air concentration around 20 - 45 oN ranged between 50 – 1000 micoBq. m- 3 with a mean of 200 micoBq. m- 3, and the 210 Po annual deposition ranged between 20 - 800 Bq. m- 2. a- 1 with a mean of 100 Bq. m- 2. a- 1. The longitudinal distribution of the 210 Po/ 210 Pb activity ratios follow a narrow linear relation from 0. 2 at 90 oW to 1. 0 at 170 oE. While the 210 Po air concentration and annual deposition are widely distributed along the longitudes with a slight decrease west of the Greenwich meridian...|$|R
5000|$|At heights between about 85 and 200 km however -the dynamo region-, solar X- {{and extreme}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation (XUV) is almost completely absorbed generating the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers. Here, the electrons are already {{bound to the}} geomagnetic field gyrating several times about these lines before they collide with the neutrals, while the positive ions still essentially move with the neutral gas. Thus, the electric conductivity becomes anisotropic. The conductivity parallel to an electric field E is called Pedersen conductivity. The conductivity orthogonal to E and the geomagnetic field Bo [...] is the Hall conductivity. Ohmic losses and thus Joule heating occur when Pedersen currents flow. The component parallel to Bo [...] still increases with altitude. Near the geomagnetic <b>dip</b> <b>equator,</b> a west-east directed electric field generates vertical Hall currents which cannot close. Therefore, a vertical polarization field builds up generating a horizontal Hall current which adds to the Pedersen current. Such enhancement is described by the Cowling conductivity. Pedersen and Hall conductivities reach maximum values near 120 to 140 km altitudes with numbers of about 1 mS/m during sunlit conditions. During the night, these numbers may decrease by a facor of ten or more. The values of these conductivities depend on local time, latitude, season and solar 11- year cycle. The height integrated conductivities become {{of the order of}} 50 S, or a total resistance of the dynamo region of about 1/50 = 0.02 Ohm during daytime conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{driver of}} the Sq current is the {{external}} (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height, while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights. A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by 180°. This {{appears to be the}} result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity [...] The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity. [...] Near the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150 km from the equator. Such enhancement of the Sq current by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. During a solar flare, bursts of solar radiation from the environment of an active sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet. During a solar eclipse, the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area. It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity. In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar thermosphere. This current system is called Ddyn.|$|E

30|$|According to the Tsunoda model (Tsunoda 2008), Esb patch {{is stopped}} from further {{advancement}} to the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> {{by the presence}} of the vertical Ep that drives the EEJ.

30|$|We, however, {{have found}} that {{scintillation}} is observed over the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> and that {{it appears to be}} rare. We shall address this problem with this new interpretation.

30|$|Second, from Figs.  6 and 7, which {{correspond}} {{to the location of}} moderate and strong daytime scintillation, respectively, it is revealed that the moderate and strong daytime GHz scintillations {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> tend to occur away from the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> In other words, the intensity of scintillations increases with distance from the magnetic <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> because of the presence of large-scale irregularities embedded in the Esb layer.|$|E
30|$|The secular {{trends of}} the {{vertical}} component (Z) {{for the six}} Indian stations for quiet day annual means is shown in Fig. 3 (c). The Z-field decreased since 1958, reaching a minimum value around 1970, and then it increased again. The increase in Z from 1970 is more rapid at equatorial stations (denoting the southward migration of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator)</b> as compared with mid-latitude stations. The southward migration of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> was suggested by Srivastava (1992) and confirmed by Rangarajan and Deka (1991). The maximum speed of the southward migration of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> {{is estimated to be}} ~ 5 km/year during 1980 – 1990 (Deka et al., 2005). The southward migration of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> is also shown in Fig. 1 for different years from 1975 to 2005. Srivastava and Abbas (1977) have found a quasi-periodicity of ~ 80 years in the migration of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> In our analysis, the Z-field also completes a half-cycle in 40 years; hence, the period of the secular change of the position of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> is of the order of ~ 80 years, attributable to the Gleissberg cycle (Gleissberg, 1965).|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{characteristics}} of daytime GHz scintillation using GPS Ionospheric Scintillation and Total Electron Content Monitor (GISTM) systems from two stations in Malaysia: Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) (2.55 °N, 101.461 °E; Ф[*]=[*] 5.78 ° S) and National Observatory at Langkawi (6.19 °N, 99.51 °E; Ф[*]=[*] 1.90 ° S). The sites are particularly interesting for their locations in terms of EEJ strength; Langkawi is situated {{very close to the}} magnetic <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> whereas UKM is displaced from the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> These sites offer the opportunity to determine the latitudinal distribution of daytime GHz scintillation {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> In this paper, we describe experimental results of the investigation of the properties of daytime GHz scintillation in the vicinity of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> This experiment led to a large data set collected over a period of 1  year using two receivers. Our findings are shown to be consistent with the latitudinal boundary of Esb proposed by the Tsunoda model (Tsunoda, 2008). We, however, have found that daytime GHz scintillation can occur very close to the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> In order to interpret how scintillation might be produced over the <b>dip</b> <b>equator,</b> we, therefore, envision a scenario in which Esb can be present at the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> when there is no EEJ. We close the paper with a discussion of our key findings, and we clarify the role of GDI as a source mechanism of daytime GHz scintillation in the vicinity of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> This mechanism requires irregularities produced by a sufficient gradient in the electron density and electric current flow produced by an electric field or a wind (Fejer and Kelley 1980).|$|E
30|$|One {{possible}} {{interpretation is}} {{that there could be}} patches of Esb that have penetrated near to the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> and been left there.

30|$|This paper {{concentrated}} {{on some of}} the unique characteristics of the daytime GHz scintillation {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> in Malaysia, where little or no previous information existed and where the new results have obvious utility for understanding the features of daytime GHz scintillation and their relationship to the Esb. We have found, for the first time, that daytime GHz scintillation does occur very close to the <b>dip</b> <b>equator,</b> where it is not expected based on prevailing models. Therefore, in order to make it clear, we provide a consistent interpretation for these observations. The interpretations require two parts: (1) the Tsunoda model (Tsunoda 2008) and (2) the new interpretation, which is an explanation of how scintillation might be produced very close to the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> Finally, from the comprehensive study of the properties of daytime GHz scintillation in the vicinity of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator,</b> we have extracted three key findings, which are discussed separately in the following subsections.|$|E
30|$|The {{reason why}} the strongest {{amplitude}} is seen around 8 ° in the dipole latitudes may be interpreted as follows. In our model, {{the value of the}} FACs is approximately proportional to the conductivities. The conductivity becomes larger as latitude decreases to the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> On the other hand, in less than around 8 ° in the dipole latitude, because the apparent period gets longer, the amplitude gets attenuated by the high-pass filter. In the region, the effect of the attenuation is steeper than that of the amplification due to the conductivity enhancement toward the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> Therefore, the strongest amplitude of the objective magnetic fluctuation is located at about 8 ° in latitude from the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b>|$|E

30|$|We {{describe}} {{here for}} the first time the morphology of the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) in the Central American Sector based on an analysis of the geomagnetic field components from six stations distributed on both sides of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> along the 60 °W geographic longitude sector. Diurnal and latitudinal variations in the horizontal and vertical components are shown to follow the Chapman model of EEJ. The horizontal component vector due to the ionospheric current aligned itself close to magnetic north, with a mean Declination of 10 °W (ranging from 9 °W to 14 °W). There was a significant counter-electrojet effect before sunrise at stations close to the <b>dip</b> <b>equator,</b> suggesting late reversal of solar-quiet (Sq) electric field in the morning hours. The observed variations in the magnetic meridional current did not seem to be associated with EEJ currents. The centre of the electrojet was around 0.25 °S of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> in the morning hours and shifted gradually to 1.5 °S by the evening hours. Magnetic storms occurring during the midday hours produced an exceptionally large decrease in the H (horizontal component) field at stations close to the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{finding that}} the GHz {{scintillation}} that occurred at the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> (Langkawi) {{is consistent with the}} equatorial band of Esb. This provides evidence that daytime GHz scintillation at the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> is relatively rare. In fact, according to the new interpretation (see “New interpretation”Section), once the Esb is dumped, it will no longer be pushed out of the EEJ region by the Ep. At the same time, the electric field and Esb should be able to produce scintillation by GDI.|$|E
30|$|The {{coupling}} {{hypothesis is}} supported by the larger bumps in the non-winter _N curves at UT between 0 and 15, corresponding to longitudes where the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> is in the Northern hemisphere and to seasons when the Sq current system is largest and most prone to interact with the EEJ. Conversely, the only bump in the winter _N curve is found in the American sector, where the northern vortex gets partially enclosed by the bended <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> in that sector (Fig.  8). In the Southern hemisphere, the largest _S bumps are found in the American sector, where the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> goes deep into the that hemisphere. The more intense current in the Spring could also be explained by some coupling with the EEJ, as the EEJ strength is largest at equinoxes (e.g., Matsushita and Maeda 1965; Stening 1995).|$|E
40|$|Using the spherical {{harmonic}} coefficients {{defining the}} International Geomagnetic Reference Field Models for the 21 epochs 1900 to 2000, the geographic {{locations of the}} <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> in different longitudes were computed. It is shown that the migratory trends in the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> are widely different in the American, African and Indian sectors. The largest change is seen over 30 °W to 40 °W while there is practically no secular movement over 100 years in the 30 °E longitude. It is seen that the geographic longitude of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> farthest away from the geographic equator in the American sector shows a westward migration {{at the rate of}} ~ 0. 2 °/year which compares favorably with the average westward drift of the non-dipolar field discussed in the literature. The distance between the magnetic center of the eccentric dipole and the Earth’s center, the South Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly (SAGA) center and the migration of the local minimum of the dip equatorial longitude in the American center are all linearly related. In addition, the westward drift in the agonic line over the geographic equator in the American sector, indicative of the contributions from non-dipolar terms, is also linearly related to the three parameters. As the observed location of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> in the American sector closely matches the model-based one, it is suggested that identification of the geographic longitude of the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> in the American zone based on a survey over a small area can provide useful information on several other parameters of the westward drift of the geomagnetic field...|$|E

30|$|Therefore, {{in order}} to explain the {{observed}} occurrence of scintillations over the <b>dip</b> <b>equator,</b> another element of the Tsunoda model (Tsunoda 2008) is clearly needed (these occurrences, of course, should be relatively rare). Keeping {{in mind that the}} U profile is produced by the solar tide, we should expect an associated, downward phase velocity. In other words, the wind-shear node should move downward in altitude with time. Given enough time, the Esb patch should be transported to an altitude, where the ions become unmagnetized, which means that the Esb patch will no longer be transported vertically. If this happens {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>dip</b> <b>equator,</b> we envision that the Esb patch will be left there, despite any recovery in strength of the Ep associated with the EEJ. The return of the Ep, together with the presence of Esb over the <b>dip</b> <b>equator,</b> is envisioned to lead to irregularity generation by GDI. The reason is that the Hall current will be driven by Ep, and the Esb can provide the gradient needed for irregularity generation. Hence, we envision that scintillation over the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> could occur after the recovery of the EEJ from quiet conditions. This will be discussed in “Comparison of daytime GHz scintillation occurrences at UKM and Langkawi” section.|$|E
40|$|Simulations {{with the}} NCAR Thermosphere - Ionosphere - Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) {{have been carried}} out to {{understand}} the cause of strong thermospheric zonal wind at the magnetic <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> The simulations show that the zonal winds blow strongly at the magnetic <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> instead of at the geographic equator due to the latitude structure of ion drag. The fast winds at the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> are seen throughout the altitude between 280 km and 600 km, and the wind above 400 km is mainly accelerated via viscosity. A test simulation without viscosity verifies that the extension of the fast equatorial wind to heights above 400 km is maintained by viscous coupling with the winds at lower altitudes, in spite of there being an ion-drag maximum instead of relative minimum at the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> at high altitudes. Basically, viscosity is not so large compared to the pressure gradient and ion drag, but dynamics causes the pressure gradient and ion drag approximately to balance, and viscosity becomes important. The simulation results are consistent with the observations by the DE- 2 and CHAMP satellites. Therefore we suggest that the zonal wind velocity in the low latitude region is controlled by ion drag and viscosity...|$|E
30|$|The {{second to}} fifth panels in this figure show the monthly mean Sq {{amplitude}} {{derived from the}} H component of the geomagnetic field at Addis Ababa (AAE) (5.36 °, 1.82 ° in geomagnetic and dip latitudes), Bangui (BNG) (4.13 °, − 16.82 °), Guam (GUA) (5.56 °, 12.46 °), and Trivandrum (TRD) (− 0.12 °, 2.20 °), respectively. The Sq amplitude at the Addis Ababa and Trivandrum stations near the <b>dip</b> <b>equator</b> was approximately 1.5 to 1.8 times larger than that at the other stations off the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> The enhancement of the Sq amplitude {{was caused by a}} significant enhancement of ionospheric conductivity due to the Cowling effect [Hirono [1952]. The most prominent long-term variation of the Sq amplitude at each station was a 10 - to 12 -year periodic oscillation, which corresponds to the signature of the solar F 10.7 index as seen in the first panel in Figure  2. The amplitude of this oscillation tended to be large at the Addis Ababa and Trivandrum stations near the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> Moreover, the Sq amplitude displayed short-term variation with a period of 1  year or less. The amplitude of the short-term variation was also large near the <b>dip</b> <b>equator.</b> The Sq amplitude at the Addis Ababa and Guam stations was the smallest around 2008, which corresponds to the solar cycle 23 / 24 minimum.|$|E
