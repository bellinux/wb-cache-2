5000|$|On April 30, 2006, Graham Nelson {{announced}} the beta release of <b>Inform</b> 7 to the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup.Inform 7 {{consists of three}} primary parts: The <b>Inform</b> 7 IDE with development tools specialized for testing interactive fiction, the <b>Inform</b> 7 compiler for the new language, and [...] "The Standard Rules" [...] which form the core library for <b>Inform</b> 7. <b>Inform</b> 7 also relies on the <b>Inform</b> library and <b>Inform</b> compiler from <b>Inform</b> 6. The compiler compiles the <b>Inform</b> 7 source code into <b>Inform</b> 6 source code, which is then compiled separately by <b>Inform</b> 6 to generate a Glulx or Z-code story file. <b>Inform</b> 7 also defaults to writing Blorb files, archives which include the Z-code together with optional [...] "cover art" [...] and metadata intended for indexing purposes. The full set of <b>Inform</b> 7 tools are currently available for Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Linux. The March 25, 2007 release added command line support for Linux, and new releases now include an IDE using the GNOME desktop environment under the GNOME <b>Inform</b> 7 SourceForge project.

40|$|The {{essential}} elements of an <b>informing</b> system are a sender, a communications pathway, and a client. Academic <b>informing</b> systems, however, are best viewed as two interacting <b>informing</b> systems, one that <b>informs</b> clients of a discipline, one that <b>informs</b> clients of the institution. The paper proposes that the greater the degree of overlap between the clients of these two systems, the stronger the position of an individual discipline is likely to be. MIS is presented {{as an example of}} a disciplinary <b>informing</b> system that has ceased to <b>inform</b> external clients. This situation, it is argued, is likely to result in the discipline's downfall. The <b>informing</b> sciences transdiscipline itself is then examined using the same lens. While much younger than MIS, the paper argues that <b>informing</b> sciences needs to begin its search for clients in earnest.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to define the architecture of computer <b>informing</b> systems. The methodology {{is based on an}} interdisciplinary, big-picture view of the cognition units which provide the foundation for <b>informing</b> systems. Among the findings are the following: <b>informing</b> systems should be designed for rigor and relevance with respect to the cognitive units (information), integrating its purpose and goal to achieve its expected utility; <b>informing</b> systems should also be designed for reasoning richness, <b>informing</b> modes, <b>informing</b> quality, and predicting <b>informing</b> biases and filters. Practical implications: A well-designed <b>informing</b> system should provide as an output a message and resonant change by reflecting information that triggers the client’s behavior. Social implication: The quest for the development of <b>informing</b> systems is not supported by Academia in practice; it is only supported by a close circle of early leaders of such systemic applications who sought to enhance the existing information systems which very often process data but do not <b>inform</b> as they should. Originality: This investigation, by providing an interdisciplinary and graphic modeling of <b>informing</b> channels and systems, indicates the vitality of these systems and their potential to create better decision-making in order to solve problems and sustain organizations and civilization...|$|R

50|$|<b>Inform</b> is a {{programming}} language and design system for interactive fiction originally created in 1993 by Graham Nelson. <b>Inform</b> can generate programs designed for the Z-code or Glulx virtual machines. Versions 1 through 5 were released between 1993 and 1996. Around 1996, Nelson rewrote <b>Inform</b> from first principles to create version 6 (or <b>Inform</b> 6).Over the following decade, version 6 became reasonably stable and a popular language for writing interactive fiction. In 2006, Nelson released <b>Inform</b> 7 (briefly known as Natural <b>Inform),</b> a completely new language based on principles of natural language and {{a new set of}} tools based around a book-publishing metaphor.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Informing</b> {{science is}} a transdiscipline that was {{established}} to promote the study of <b>informing</b> processes across a diverse set of academic disciplines, including management information systems, education, business, instructional technology, computer science, communications, psychology, philosophy, library science, information science and many others. Its principal unit of analysis is the <b>informing</b> system, a collection of informers, clients and channels that has been designed or has evolved to serve a particular <b>informing</b> need. The organization created to advance the <b>informing</b> science transdiscipline is the <b>Informing</b> Science Institute (ISI), whose founder, Eli Cohen, proposed the need for field in his article [...] "Reconceptualizing Information Systems as a Field of the Transdiscipline <b>Informing</b> Science: From Ugly Duckling to Swan" [...] (Cohen, 1999). The ISI presently host an annual conference (<b>Informing</b> Science & Information Technology Education (InSITE)), publishes seven academic journals, and—through its <b>Informing</b> Science Press—has published for dozens of books.
