5|$|Alex Shaw is on a {{motorcycle}} chasing a vehicle with stolen goods. After he catches {{the driver of the}} vehicle, his girlfriend Annie runs into him during her <b>driving</b> <b>test.</b> She finds out that Alex is on the SWAT team after he lied and told her he was a beach officer. As an apology, Alex surprises her with a Caribbean cruise on Seabourn Legend.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pam {{has been}} helping Nellie {{practice}} for a <b>driving</b> <b>test.</b> The two bond after Nellie shows appreciation for Pam's art. After {{telling her that}} she is worried that her husband Jim is not telling her something, Nellie immediately states that Jim is probably having an affair. Nellie later asks Pam to paint a mural in the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut costs, the Kentucky State Police {{announced}} in May 2009 that it would only offer the state <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> in English beginning June 1, 2009. The test had previously been offered in 22 foreign languages, but the state police said that the foreign language versions of the test had not been updated to reflect recent changes to driving laws. Two days later, Beshear announced the reversal of the state police's new policy, saying he was not informed of it and believed {{it was the wrong}} thing to do. He promised the foreign language versions of the test would be updated and would continue to be offered.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{assessment}} of weight parameters impact on driving dynamics. History and basic categories of personal vehicles {{are described in}} the introductory part. Weight parameters and driving dynamics of personal vehicles are described in the next part. Methodology and results of realized <b>driving</b> <b>tests</b> (braking test, circular test and avoidance maneuver) are presented in the experimental part of this work. Simulation of realized <b>driving</b> <b>tests</b> that was made by simulation software Virtual Crash is devised in the penultimate chapter. Evaluation of results that were found out from realized and simulated <b>driving</b> <b>tests</b> {{is made in the}} last chapter. Achieved results are briefly summarized in conclusion...|$|R
5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million designâ€“build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E

25|$|The {{rules on}} what a driver can tow are {{different}} depending on when they passed their <b>driving</b> <b>test.</b> If they passed their car <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> on or after 1 January 1997, they may drive a car or van up to 3,500kg maximum authorised mass (MAM) towing a trailer of up to 750kg MAM, and they may tow a trailer over 750kg MAM {{as long as the}} combined MAM of the trailer and towing vehicle is no more than 3,500kg MAM when loaded. They must pass the car and trailer <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> to tow anything heavier. If a driver passed their car test before 1 January 1997, they are usually allowed to drive a vehicle and trailer combination up to 8,250kg MAM. They are also allowed to drive a minibus with a trailer over 750kg MAM.|$|E

25|$|Applications for a {{provisional}} driving licence {{can be made}} in the UK from the age of 15 years and 9 months. Once a United Kingdom <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> has been passed, the driving licence is valid for driving a moped or light quad bike from age 16, and a car from age 17, or 16 for those who receive, or have applied for, the higher or enhanced rate of the mobility component of PIP or DLA. A <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> consists of three sections: theory, hazard perception and a supervised driving examination. Until this test has been passed, a driver may hold only {{a provisional}} licence and is subject to certain conditions.|$|E
50|$|Some provinces, such as Ontario, Alberta and Nova Scotia, {{require the}} resitting of all theory and {{practical}} <b>driving</b> <b>tests</b> if the licence suspension {{is longer than}} a prescribed time period.|$|R

25|$|Typically, {{communication}} {{about the}} parking {{status of a}} roadway {{takes the form of}} notices, e.g. fixed to a nearby wall and/or road markings. Part of the requirements for passing the <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> in some countries is to demonstrate understanding of parking signs.|$|E
25|$|If {{the student}} has passed these tests, a <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> in the city is performed, and then on a highway. The student {{must be able to}} handle traffic, know the traffic rules and be able to handle the {{acceleration}} of the motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{student must}} show {{ability to hold}} {{the weight of the}} {{motorcycle}} by walking with it. Then the student must do a <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> in very slow speed, in order to show balance. After that there is a test to maneuver away from obstacles at 50km/h, and then a brake test at 70km/h and 90km/h.|$|E
50|$|The {{standards}} and form {{of these tests}} {{is the same as}} {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom, where they are performed by the DSA for <b>driving</b> <b>tests</b> and the VOSA for vehicles.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we built}} the {{remote-controlled}} rescue robot with the independent four crawler arms for running and the arm for the rescue, and evaluated {{the performance of}} the robot by the participation in the rescue robot contest [resucon] and the <b>driving</b> <b>tests.</b> In the resucon, we could remove rubble and get over rough terrain, but we could not rescue the damiyan (the doll which simulated a rescuer). Afterwards, we improved the arm for the rescue, and we could rescue the damiyan. The position control of the crawler arms occasionally became unstable though the effectiveness of the crawler arms was able to be confirmed in the <b>driving</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Methods: Eighteen {{patients}} with severe SAHS performed a <b>driving</b> simulator <b>test</b> at baseline (before treatment) and at days 1, 3, and 7 of a 2 week CPAP trial period. CPAP was then discontinued and the patients performed three further <b>driving</b> simulator <b>tests</b> after 1, 3, and 7 days. Eighteen {{patients with}} severe SAHS acted as controls and performed the <b>driving</b> simulator <b>test</b> on seven occasions {{in a pattern}} {{similar to that of}} the treated patients...|$|R
25|$|Acquiring a CDL {{requires}} a skills test (pre-trip inspection and <b>driving</b> <b>test),</b> and knowledge test (written) covering the unique handling qualities of driving a large, heavily loaded commercial vehicle, and the mechanical systems required to operate such a vehicle (air brakes, suspension, cargo securement, et al.), plus be declared fit by medical examination {{no less than}} every two years.|$|E
25|$|Students {{then take}} a <b>driving</b> <b>test.</b> If they pass, a driver's licence is granted; it usually comes by mail a few days later. Until then newly {{licensed}} drivers are given a temporary licence (valid for a year). The licences are issued by the Swedish Transport Agency. For both tests a fully valid identity document is needed.|$|E
25|$|The Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS) is {{a system}} whereby demerit points {{will be added to}} the driver's record. The system is meant to deter drivers from {{infringing}} the rules-of-the-road and, if they do, suspend their driving licence for a period of time. This system requires offenders to retest and pass the <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> again from the beginning.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark, the B licence {{is valid}} until the driver reaches 70 years of age, {{although}} further <b>driving</b> <b>tests</b> combined with medical examinations allows {{the driver to}} retake his licence every {{two years after the}} age of 70.|$|R

50|$|Four {{different}} types (A1, A2, B1, B2) were planned, but one prototype {{was made and}} that did not see service; only <b>driving</b> <b>tests</b> were made in Thun from 1946 to 1947 for testing in troop deployment. Development was stopped in 1947.|$|R
25|$|The <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> ends {{when the}} test period {{finishes}} and the candidate is then {{informed of the}} result. If the candidate obtained no more than 20 penalty points, he is given the result passed, if the candidate made mistakes that sum at least 21 points, he is given the result failed and can reschedule another examination after a 15-day period has lapsed.|$|E
25|$|After {{passing a}} <b>driving</b> <b>test,</b> the {{provisional}} licence may be surrendered {{within two years}} {{in exchange for a}} full UK licence for the relevant kind of vehicle. Full car licences allow use of mopeds and motorcycles provided a CBT (Compulsory Basic Training) course is completed (the requirement to have a CBT in Northern Ireland was introduced on 21 February 2011).|$|E
25|$|Both learner {{permits and}} the former {{provisional}} licences are identical in format to full licences, but green in colour. They do not carry the full translations list as they are not valid outside of the Republic of Ireland and are marked as such on the front. Once a <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> has been passed, all categories of driver {{with the exception of}} motorcycle drivers have no restrictions on road usage or vehicle type.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure rate}} for <b>driving</b> <b>tests</b> in 2011 was 28%. Automobile {{associations}} {{have given the}} opinion that {{this is due to}} the low quality of the education at driving schools as it benefits their income if students take additional lessons after failing.|$|R
