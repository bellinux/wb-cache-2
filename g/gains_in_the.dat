5|$|Nixon {{was one of}} the few leading Republicans not {{blamed for}} the {{disastrous}} results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections.

5|$|Christian princes {{continued}} to make <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Iberian peninsula: the King of Portugal, AfonsoI, captured Lisbon and Raymond BerenguerIV of Barcelona conquered the city of Tortosa. In northern Europe the Saxons and Danes fought against tribes of Polabian Slavs known as Wends in the Wendish Crusade, although no official papal bulls were issued authorising new Crusades. The Wends were finally defeated in 1162.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the RPF waged a classic {{hit-and-run}} style guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making significant <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{war against the}} Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across {{the north of the}} country.|$|E

Coordinated attacks pushed A Company to the north back from their hills with heavy casualties on August 7. K Company to the south was also attacked but held its line, reinforced by L Company on August 10. Fighting continued for several days, resulting in heavy casualties as both sides captured and recaptured the hills along the Naktong, neither side able to gain a decisive advantage against the other.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north were undone {{because of}} the {{contradictory}} policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in {{the family of the}} Peshwa, which culminated in the murder of Narayanrao Peshwa in 1773. Due to this, the Marathas virtually disappeared from north India. Raghunathrao was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the Treaty of Surat with him in March 1775. This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of Salsette Island and Bassein Fort.|$|E
5|$|Under Basil's son and successor, Leo VI the Wise, the <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east {{against the}} now-weak Abbasid Caliphate continued. However, Sicily {{was lost to}} the Arabs in 902, and in 904 Thessaloniki, the Empire's second city, was sacked by an Arab fleet. The naval {{weakness}} of the Empire was rectified. Despite this revenge the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911.|$|E

5|$|While his ten-year reign {{was marked}} by various {{state-building}} accomplishments, Mindaugas's conflicts with relatives and other dukes continued, and Samogitia (western Lithuania) strongly resisted the alliance's rule. His <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeast were challenged by the Tatars. He broke peace with the Livonian Order in 1261, possibly renouncing Christianity, and was assassinated in 1263 by his nephew Treniota and another rival, Duke Daumantas. His three immediate successors were assassinated as well. The disorder was not resolved until Traidenis gained the title of Grand Duke c. 1270.|$|E
5|$|Within the Triple Alliance, Prussia {{was hoping}} for some {{territorial}} <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baltic region, through war (with Russia) or diplomacy (from the Commonwealth), {{or a combination of}} the above. With regard to the Balkans, the Triple Alliance aimed at restraining the Russian Empire, as well as the its ally, the Austrian Empire, and there were expectations of a war between the Alliance and Russia (and possibly Austria) around 1791.|$|E
5|$|After socialist <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several {{bills in}} May 1914 {{which would have}} put the battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the ships reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the ships never left Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that the ships would then find their way into the war.|$|E

5|$|Germany and Europe {{as a whole}} {{was almost}} totally {{dependent}} on foreign oil imports. In an attempt to resolve the persistent shortage, in June 1942 Germany launched Fall Blau (Case Blue), an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields. The Red Army launched a counter-offensive on 19 November and encircled the Axis forces, who were trapped in Stalingrad on 23 November. Göring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air, but {{this turned out to be}} infeasible. Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war. Soviet forces continued to push the invaders westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk and by the end of 1943 the Germans had lost most of their territorial <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pocket}} boroughs {{abolished}} by the Reform Act belonged to the Tory Party. These losses were somewhat offset by {{the extension of the}} vote to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. This clause, proposed by the Tory Marquess of Chandos, was adopted in the House of Commons despite opposition from the Government. The tenants-at-will thereby enfranchised typically voted as instructed by their landlords, who in turn normally supported the Tory party. This concession, together with the Whig Party's internal divisions and the difficulties faced by the nation's economy, allowed the Tories under Sir Robert Peel to make <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elections of 1835 and 1837, and to retake the House of Commons in 1841.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 969, Antioch {{fell to the}} Byzantine {{commander}} Michael Bourtzes. The fall of {{the great}} metropolis of northern Syria was soon followed by a treaty between the Byzantines and the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo, which made Aleppo a tributary vassal and {{handed over to the}} Byzantine Empire the entirety of the former Abbasid frontier zones (thughur) in Cilicia and Upper Mesopotamia, as well as the coastal strip of Syria between the Mediterranean Sea and the Orontes River until the environs of Tripoli, Arqa, and Shayzar. Byzantine control of this area was initially only theoretical, and the murder of the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas in December 969 threatened to nullify Byzantine <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November British {{warships}} bombarded outer forts in the Dardanelles. Two {{days later}} the United Kingdom extended {{a declaration of war}} to the Ottoman Empire, as did France. Due to these attacks, there was a common impression in Britain that Churchill had brought the Ottomans into the war. Prime Minister Lloyd George held this belief for several years to come. In the meantime, Churchill tried to promote the advantages of the conflict, such as the possibility of territorial <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East (the reason that would ultimately bring Italy and Balkans nations like Greece into the war). The Ottoman government finally declared war on the Triple Entente on 11 November. Three days later Ottoman Sultan Mehmed V called for a Jihad campaign by Sunni and Shia Muslims against the Western powers.|$|E
5|$|Stone's {{organizational}} {{activities for}} the cause of women's rights yielded tangible <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> difficult political environment of the 19th century. Stone helped initiate the first National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts and she supported and sustained it annually, along with a number of other local, state and regional activist conventions. Stone spoke in front of a number of legislative bodies to promote laws giving more rights to women. She assisted in establishing the Woman's National Loyal League to help pass the Thirteenth Amendment and thereby abolish slavery, after which she helped form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which built support for a woman suffrage Constitutional amendment by winning woman suffrage {{at the state and local}} levels.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Congressional midterm {{elections}} took place {{less than three}} months after Ford assumed office and {{in the wake of the}} Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865–1869). Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan. In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body.|$|E

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{instance}} of Ba Cụt's abandoning {{the fight against}} the Việt Minh came in mid-1953. At that time, his forces had been helping to defend the regional Mekong Delta town of Mỹ Tho, but the French decided to transfer more of the military power to their more mainstream allies, the Vietnamese National Army (VNA). As the French tried to undermine his position, tensions with Ba Cụt increased. On 25 June, the Hòa Hảo leader ordered his men to evacuate their French-supplied bases; they took their weapons with them and razed the camps. Ba Cụt then withdrew his forces from a string of military posts in the Plain of Reeds and retreated to Châu Đốc in the extreme south of the country. As a result, the French-aligned presence in the Mekong Delta was severely dented and the Việt Minh made substantial <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Eventually, the French defeat at Điện Biên Phủ in May 1954 signaled the end of French Indochina.|$|E
5|$|The same Senate {{that had}} {{rejected}} the Tyler–Calhoun treaty {{by a margin}} of 2:1 in June 1844 reassembled in December 1844 in a short lame-duck session. (Though pro-annexation Democrats had made <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall elections, those legislators – the 29th Congress – would not assume office until March 1845.) Lame-duck President Tyler, still trying to annex Texas in the final months of his administration, wished to avoid another overwhelming Senate rejection of his treaty. In his annual address to Congress on December 4, he declared the Polk victory a mandate for Texas annexation and proposed that Congress adopt a joint resolution procedure by which simple majorities in each house could secure ratification for the Tyler treaty. This method would avoid the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Bringing the House of Representatives into the equation boded well for Texas annexation, as the pro-annexation Democratic Party possessed nearly a 2:1 majority in that chamber.|$|E
5|$|A {{rapprochement}} {{between the}} two men was achieved in the winter of 1384, when Carrouges and Le Gris were both invited to the estate of a mutual friend, Jean Crespin, to celebrate the birth of his son. For the first time, Carrouges brought his wife Marguerite into society and it was at this party that she made her first acquaintance with Le Gris. Despite the tension between them, Carrouges and Le Gris shook hands and drank together, putting their quarrel behind them before their peers and neighbours. A few months later Jean de Carrouges departed on campaign to Scotland and Le Gris took the opportunity to increase his influence with the Count, making substantial financial and territorial <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> his rival's absence. Carrouges returned a year later, now a knight but bankrupt, ill and suffering the aftermath of a long and unsuccessful campaign. When Carrouges appeared at Argentan in January 1386 he was involved in a confrontation with his erstwhile friend. Although it is not known what was said, the two men separated on poor terms and Carrouges departed for Paris in a state of agitation.|$|E
