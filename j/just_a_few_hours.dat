5|$|After exchanging ideas, Parker {{will write}} a script, {{and from there}} the entire team of animators, editors, technicians, and sound {{engineers}} will each typically work 100–120 hours in the ensuing week. Since the show's fourth season (2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished {{his share of the}} directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production. On Wednesday, a completed episode is sent to Comedy Central's headquarters via satellite uplink, sometimes in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> before its air time of 10 PM Eastern Time.|$|E
5|$|By October 10, 2004, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} situated well to the southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Later that day, a surface low pressure system developed, and convection began to organize into slightly curved bands. The disturbance continued to in this manner, and at 1800 UTC on October 11, the low level circulation had become sufficiently organized to be designated as a tropical depression. At the time, the depression consisted of a well-defined circulation, with some deep thunderstorm activity. Despite weak steering currents, the system started what was initially {{thought to be a}} westward drift, though <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> later was found to be towards the northwest. A small cyclone, a burst of deep convection formed at around the same time, and was said could have produced tropical storm-force winds.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknown to Bompart's force, Humbert's {{army and}} the {{rebellion}} as a whole had been defeated by the British Army a week before Bompart departed France. Bompart's squadron too was woefully understrength consisting of only a single ship {{of the line and}} eight frigates carrying 3,000 men. This small force faced {{a large proportion of the}} British Channel Fleet, which was prepared for a second invasion attempt after Humbert's army had landed unopposed in August. As a result, Bompart's force was spotted <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> after he left Brest and he was then chased into the Atlantic Ocean by several British frigates which followed him for a week until he was able to lose them in heavy weather. This weather persisted throughout the campaign, causing significant damage to both sides in a series of storms.|$|E

5|$|When the Kingdom of Montenegro {{declared}} war on Turkey on 8 October 1912, it was joined quickly by Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece in {{what is known as}} the First Balkan War. George was on vacation in Denmark, so he immediately returned to Greece via Vienna, arriving in Athens to be met by a large and enthusiastic crowd on the evening of 9 October. The results of this campaign differed radically from the Greek experience at the hands of the Turks in 1897. The well-trained Greek forces, 200,000 strong, won victory after victory. On 9 November 1912, Greek forces commanded by Crown Prince Constantine rode into Thessaloniki, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> ahead of a Bulgarian division. Three days later King George rode in triumph through the streets of Thessaloniki, the second-largest Greek city, accompanied by the Crown Prince and Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 25 September 1806 was a naval battle fought {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars off the French Biscay port of Rochefort. A French {{squadron}} comprising five frigates and two corvettes, sailing to the French West Indies with supplies and reinforcements, was intercepted by a British squadron of six ships {{of the line}} that was keeping a close blockade of the port {{as part of the}} Atlantic campaign of 1806. The British ships, under the command of Commodore Sir Samuel Hood, spotted the French convoy early in the morning of 25 September, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> after the French had left port, and immediately gave chase. Although the French ships tried to escape, they were heavily laden with troops and stores, and the strong winds favoured the larger ships of the line, which caught the French convoy after a five-hour pursuit, although they had become separated from one another during the chase.|$|E

5000|$|Short {{operational}} life. In {{the most}} common applications, valves have a working life of <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand <b>hours,</b> much shorter than solid state parts. This is due various commonplace failure mechanisms: cathode depletion, open or shorts circuits—notably of the heater and grid structures, cathode poisoning, and physical breakage of the glass envelope. Heater failure most often happens due to the mechanical stress of a cold start. Only, in certain always-on professional applications such as specialized computing and undersea cables, specially designed valves in carefully designed circuits and well cooled environments reached operational lives of tens or {{hundreds of thousands of}} hours.|$|R

After finding her old guitar in the garage and the prompting of a new friend, they start up a weekly jam session and are joined by a neighbor, the mail-woman and her daughter’s boyfriend for nightly rehearsals.

Juškevičius was chosen as his replacement, and Šarūnas Vasiliauskas also won a roster spot. Paulius Jankūnas became the new team captain.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} imaging {{modality}} {{to be used}} in hybrid ORs is a C-Arm. Expert consensus rates the performance of mobile C-arms in hybrid ORs as insufficient, because the limited power of the tube impacts image quality, the field of view is smaller for image-intensifier systems than for flat-panel detector systems and the cooling system of mobile C-Arms can lead to overheating after <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> which can be too short for lengthy surgical procedures or for multiple procedures in a row, that would be needed to recover the investment in such a room.|$|E
25|$|The pneumonic form of plague {{arises from}} {{infection}} of the lungs.

The incubation period for pneumonic plague is short, usually two to four days, but sometimes <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> The initial signs are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses; they include headache, weakness, and spitting or vomiting of blood. The course of the disease is rapid; unless diagnosed and treated soon enough, typically within a few hours, death may follow in one to six days; in untreated cases mortality is nearly 100%.|$|E

Rimmer is naturally incredulous, as if he couldn't pass the Astronavigation Exam, what chance does Lister have? Turns out that Lister has no intention to pass the Astronavigation Exam, as he plans to take the chef's exam. It's the easiest exam available, but if he passes Lister will be made an officer and outrank Rimmer.|$|R
50|$|The leading {{elements}} of the Austrian attack ran into Montbrun's determined cavalry, who managed to reduce the impetus of the charge thanks to hilly and wooded terrain. Rosenberg displayed serious concern {{when he realized that}} Davout's troops were not moving to account for the ongoing battle, and rightly assumed that more French troops were on the way. These troops had, in fact, arrived and brushed aside Rosenberg's flank guard. Napoleon had set the French army into motion around 2 a.m. on the 22nd and had his men march 18 miles north in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short <b>hours,</b> meaning reinforcements for Davout would be arriving faster than promised.|$|R

The where of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire looking at all the churches. <b>As</b> the last <b>few</b> minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property.
