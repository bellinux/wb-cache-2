5|$|The Bears won the toss and deferred. The {{first four}} drives {{of the game}} ended without scores, as the Packers turned the ball over on downs during their first drive and the ensuing series were punts. On the next drive, Tracy Porter intercepted Rodgers, but was penalized for illegal contact, and the play was nullified. Afterwards, Rodgers threw a 25-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Lacy. The Bears' woes continued with the following kickoff, when Marc Mariani and Deonte Thompson collided while attempting to catch the kick and the latter had to kneel in the endzone for the touchback. The next four possessions led to punts; on Green Bay's next drive, Lacy recorded a 15-yard run, but was hit from behind by Chris Prosinski and <b>fumbled,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball being recovered by Lamarr Houston. Chicago {{took advantage of the}} takeaway when Jay Cutler threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller. However, on the next kickoff, nickelback Bryce Callahan missed a tackle and allowed Jeff Janis to record a 64-yard return; the Packers eventually converted it into a 22-yard field goal. Assisted by a 37-yard kickoff return by Thompson, the Bears offense scored with Cutler's 20-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson, but the play was overturned after he was downed at the one. Afterwards, Jeremy Langford's one-yard run gave the Bears the 14â€“10 lead. Mason Crosby kicked a 50-yard field goal to end the half. The third quarter featured no scores, though the Bears' last drive of the quarter (which lasted into the final quarter) ended with Robbie Gould's 21-yard field goal to extend the lead by four points. After two further punts, Rodgers' slant pass for Davante Adams was intercepted by Porter. However, the Bears were unable to capitalize, and punted. With 2:23 left in the game, the Packers drove from their own 20-yard line to the Bears' eight. Rodgers' passes to James Jones, Richard Rodgers and Adams all fell incomplete, and Cutler kneeled once to seal the win.|$|E
5|$|The Bears won {{the coin}} toss and elected to kick off. The Rams scored {{on the opening}} {{possession}} with Gurley's six-yard touchdown run, but the Bears tied the score on a two-play drive; after Jeremy Langford was stopped for a one-yard loss, Jay Cutler threw a short pass to Zach Miller, who managed to break free and score on the 87-yard play. The next drive for the Rams saw the offense go three-and-out, but on the punt return, Marc Mariani was quickly hit by Bradley Marquez and <b>fumbled,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball being recovered by St. Louis' Maurice Alexander. On the first play since the turnover, Austin scored on a 17-yard reverse, but the touchdown was nullified by Greg Robinson's holding penalty; the Rams eventually {{had to settle for}} Zuerlein's 26-yard field goal. After the Bears punted, they regained possession on the first play of the Rams' next drive, when Shea McClellin stripped Tre Mason and recovered the ball. Robbie Gould eventually kicked a 35-yard field goal to tie the score {{at the end of the}} first quarter. The Rams punted on their next drive, and the Bears took the lead with Cutler throwing a two-yard touchdown pass to Miller. St. Louis later punted again, and Chicago's next series started at their own 14-yard line due to cornerback Alan Ball's holding penalty on the punt return. After Langford's three-yard run, Cutler held off a blitzing defense to throw a screen pass to Langford, who scored on the 83-yard play. The two teams exchanged punts for the remainder of the half; the first three drives of the second half also ended in punts. Afterwards, the two teams traded field goals, Zuerlein's being 38 yards and Gould's being 33 yards. On St. Louis' next drive, the team elected to try a fake punt, but Hekker's pass to Cody Davis fell short. The Bears increased the lead to 17 points with Gould's 36-yard field goal, and after the Rams' turned the ball over on downs again, scored on Langford's six-yard touchdown run. The next two drives ended with turnovers for both teams: Willie Young intercepted Foles, but runningback Ka'Deem Carey fumbled after being hit by Rodney McLeod, with the fumble being recovered by Aaron Donald. With 2:23 left in the game, the Rams reached the Bears' 28-yard line before time expired.|$|E
25|$|The {{second quarter}} {{started with the}} Aggies' offense advancing. They went from their own 25-yard line to midfield using the run game. The Aggies punted to Vanderbilt's 25-yard line. Wakefield netted a long punt over the Aggies' safety man back to their own 20-yard line. A pass of 15 yards had the Aggies' driving until stopped at the 43-yard line. On the next {{possession}} for Vandy, Reese lost 15 yards {{in an attempt to}} go around the right end. Vanderbilt was getting the upper-hand in field position from the series of punts, but Kuhn <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Aggies recovering at their own 40-yard line. On the next possession for Vanderbilt there was again another lost fumble, this time by Tom Ryan at Mississippi's 45-yard line.|$|E

500|$|Lang did not {{disguise}} his {{relief that}} the crisis was over. He wrote of George VI: [...] "I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response." [...] On 12 May 1937, Lang crowned George VI with full pomp in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. Time magazine recorded: [...] "All through the three-hour ceremony, {{the most important person}} there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England." [...] Supposedly the archbishop <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: [...] "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten." [...] He also said of the Coronation: [...] "It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. Once I saw it was going well, I enjoyed every minute." [...] "Thank God that is over!" [...] said his chaplain, as they got into the car to leave. [...] "Lumley, how can you say such a thing!" [...] cried the archbishop. [...] "I only wish it was beginning over again." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Flynn, {{with slow}} fingers, <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> button at {{his neck and}} looked hard at Mrs. Scutts.|$|E
60|$|He {{began to}} <b>fumble</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cord, then he {{suddenly}} lets go {{and begins to}} chuckle to himself.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Hoopdriver got out his screw {{hammer and}} went to the handle. He was annoyed. [...] "That's my business, I suppose," [...] he said, <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> screw. The unusual {{exertion}} had made his hands shake frightfully.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Holder {{did not trust}} himself to reply. He looked down across the desk at the financier, who was <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> leaves.|$|R
60|$|Gasping, with a {{bursting}} heart, {{overwhelmed by}} an unutterable joy of divination, Gale <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> paper {{until he got}} it open.|$|E
60|$|He <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> door latch, grumbling some inarticulate self-pity, as if {{he sought}} a handle, {{and then he had}} it open.|$|E
6000|$|... "A taking little minx," [...] I {{heard him}} muttering {{to himself as}} he <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> door. [...] "And no doubt meant well. But as for that cock-and-bull story--" ...|$|E
6000|$|But then {{we heard}} the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them begin to <b>fumble</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pad-lock, and heard a man say: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, Herky." [...] I {{jumped off}} at once, led the horse over, {{and held out}} the bridle. Herky dismounted, and began <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stirrup straps.|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} felt that she could walk; she tottered back across the room, back to the door, and her {{twitching}} fingers were once more <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bolts.|$|R
60|$|Quickly Nat stepped {{behind the}} man, {{and while he}} <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crown with one hand, he brought out the rope with the other. He was greatly excited and his hands trembled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, more {{beautiful}} and bright and charming than ever she was before, {{if such a}} thing can be"--and Hester turned away and <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> medicine-bottles, to hide her shame and grief.|$|E
60|$|By {{means of}} the balcony and tree the man slowly raised himself until he was visible to Mrs Green. With a choking cry she made for the door and <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> handle.|$|E
6000|$|He ceased. She was <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{buttons of}} his waistcoat. [...] "Harry," [...] she said, softly, [...] "did {{you think of}} the {{property}} when--when--you kissed me in the conservatory?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Step One Carly instructs {{that the}} {{potatoes}} {{have to be}} washed and covered in aluminum foil. Dorf hurriedly douses them in water to keep up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> show's fast pace, but <b>fumbles</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> foil, tossing the potatoes hastily in the fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they're after. I'm the {{one they}} want. You shall not lose your lives because of me. Let me go." [...] She was <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{fastenings}} of the door.|$|R
60|$|Obediently and wearily she {{dismounted}} {{from the}} burro {{and got up}} on Nack-yal. The stirrups were long for her {{and he had to}} change them. His fingers were all thumbs as he <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> buckles.|$|E
60|$|But Mr. Conant did not explain. He sat {{bolt upright}} on his seat, {{staring at the}} back of Bub's head, {{for the rest of the}} journey. Mary Louise noticed that his fingers {{constantly}} <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> locket on his watch chain.|$|E
60|$|Even as Arthurâ€™s eyes fell on {{this poor}} {{creature}} his heart sank, and the revulsion of feeling was {{so severe that}} he tottered and almost fell. Runyon grabbed his arm and supported him while Peters <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wrappings of the baby.|$|E
5000|$|... spectacularly gross, {{a figure}} of wild disarrangement, but without a shred of real sincerity. You see a pot-bellied {{scarecrow}} flapping erratically.

60|$|The man hesitated, but all {{the time}} his fingers were <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> keys. Quest's lips {{continued}} to move. The warder {{opened the door and}} entered. A few minutes later, Quest passed the key through the window to Laura, who was standing on guard.|$|R
60|$|Between {{the fierce}} sun and his anger at being kept waiting, the Knight of the Fish {{had grown so}} hot that he lifted his visor, and when the old woman saw how {{handsome}} he was, she began <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lock of the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; she's {{engaged to}} play here the whole summer." [...] The head waiter <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{knife and fork}} at the place opposite, and blushed. [...] "But you'll hear her to-night yourself," [...] he ended incoherently, and hurried away, to show another guest to his, or rather her, place.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must hurry," [...] {{she went}} on, as she <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hard knots in the {{stiffened}} rawhide, [...] "for Buckingham will be after you soon.

60|$|He {{did not go}} out {{till after}} dinner. When he got downstairs he found the heavy night-door closed. He wondered: then remembered the Signorina's fear of riots and disturbances. As again he <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> catches, {{he felt that the}} doors of Florence were trying to prevent his egress. However, he got out.|$|E
60|$|As he rose the lioness lurched, and {{reaching}} him, fastened her fangs in his leg. Jones roared. Emett and Jim yelled. And I, though frightened, was so obsessed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{idea of getting}} a picture that I began to <b>fumble</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> shutter of my camera.|$|R
60|$|His human {{likeness}} {{departed from}} him. When the momentary red had passed, Horrocks saw a charred, blackened figure, its head streaked with blood, still clutching and <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chain, and writhing in agony--a cindery animal, an inhuman, monstrous creature that began a sobbing intermittent shriek.|$|R
60|$|No man moved. The three {{passed out}} into <b>the</b> moonlight, Learoyd <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> buttons of his coat.
