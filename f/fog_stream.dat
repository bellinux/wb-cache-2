40|$|The {{emerging}} Fog paradigm {{has been}} attracting increasing interests from both academia and industry, {{due to the}} low-latency, resilient, and cost-effective services it can provide. Many Fog applications such as video mining and event monitoring, rely on data stream processing and analytics, which are very popular in the Cloud, but have not been comprehensively investigated {{in the context of}} Fog architecture. In this article, we present the general models and architecture of <b>Fog</b> data <b>streaming,</b> by analyzing the common properties of several typical applications. We also analyze the design space of <b>Fog</b> <b>streaming</b> with the consideration of four essential dimensions (system, data, human, and optimization), where both new design challenges and the issues arise from leveraging existing techniques are investigated, such as Cloud stream processing, computer networks, and mobile computing...|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} in the afternoon, and blowing fresh enough to make diving risky, when Jimmy {{prepared}} to go down for what he hoped would be the last attempt; but stopping a few moments he looked anxiously about. Gray <b>fog</b> <b>streamed</b> up from seaward in ragged wisps, and the long swell had broken into short, white-topped combers, over which the sloop plunged with spray-swept bows, straining hard at her cables as the flood tide ran past.|$|R

60|$|The <b>fog</b> <b>streamed</b> past him, {{the wind}} whipped his face, and he clenched the wheel as he rocked with the jolts. He {{was not far}} from home now and looked for the curve where his road {{branched}} off. The curve was sharp and ran between two rows of old thorn trees; Jim remembered that he had meant to cut them down. There was a deep ditch between the trees and a belt of rough grass, then the narrow road, and a ditch on the other side. After a few minutes a dark mass loomed in the haze and Jim {{knew it would be}} prudent to slacken speed, but his lamps were nearly out, and a little farther on he must avoid an awkward gatepost.|$|R

60|$|By {{this time}} the sun had got so high, as to begin to stir the <b>fog,</b> and <b>streams</b> of vapour were {{shooting}} up from the beach, like smoke rising from coal-pits. The wind increased, too, and rolled the vapour before it, and in less than ten minutes, the veil was removed; ship after ship coming out in plain view, until the entire fleet was seen riding in the roadstead, in its naked and distinct proportions.|$|R

5000|$|Salvia shannoni is {{a tender}} {{perennial}} {{native to the}} Mexican state of Chiapas, and to Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, growing in or near pine forests at approximately 3,000-5,000 feet elevation. Its native habitat receives regular moisture {{in the form of}} <b>fog,</b> rain, and <b>streams,</b> with mild temperatures that stay above freezing. The plant was named by botanist John Donnell Smith in 1893 for William Cummings Shannon, who collected it in the wild. The two were apparently serving in the United States military at the same time. Even though it has been grown in Central America for many years, it is relatively new to horticulture in North America. In El Salvador it has been used for treating malaria, and is known as monte amargo, or [...] "bitterwood.|$|R
500|$|Along the California coast, {{the cooler}} water {{sets up a}} surface marine layer that is much cooler than inland areas during the summer. [...] At the same time, the intense heating inland creates a {{pronounced}} thermal trough aligned with the Great Central Valley and typically linked to the broader thermal low across the North American deserts.

[...] The same thermal trough is sometimes pushed toward the coast, especially in late Fall as higher pressure develops to the east due to cooling further east.

40|$|The Internet of Mobile Things {{encompasses}} stream data being {{generated by}} sensors, network communications that {{pull and push}} these data streams, as well as running processing and analytics that can effectively leverage actionable information for transportation planning, management, and business advantage. Edge computing emerges as a new paradigm that decentralizes the communication, computation, control and storage resources from the cloud {{to the edge of}} the network. This paper proposes an edge computing platform where mobile edge nodes are physical devices deployed on a transit bus where descriptive analytics is used to uncover meaningful patterns from real-time transit data streams. An application experiment is used to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of our proposed platform to support descriptive analytics at a mobile edge node and generate actionable information to transit managers.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if Ischyrolepis sieberi, a common restiod species found at high altitudes in the Cederberg captures fog to supplement its water needs. This was done by comparing the isotopic ratios of δD and δ¹⁸O in captured <b>fog,</b> rainwater, and <b>stream</b> water and comparing these to the δD and δ¹⁸O values found in the xylem water of Ischyrolepis sieberi plants growing at the study site. The δD values of the collected fog samples were enriched relative to rainwater, stream water, and xylem water from I. sieberi, however these differences were not significant. The δ¹⁸O values of the I. sieberi xylem water were significantly (p < 0. 01) more enriched than rain, <b>stream,</b> and <b>fog</b> water. The xylem water of I. sieberi was depleted in δD and enriched in δ¹⁸O relative to all other water sources. The plants therefore did not appear to be utilizing fog during the three months of this study. The δ¹⁸O values of I. sieberi were consistently 4 - 6 ‰ enriched compared to rainwater, suggesting that they are utilizing rainwater, which has undergone fractionation due to evaporation in the soil before being taken up by the plants. This study was run during the wet winter months. The δD and δ¹⁸O values from previous data suggest that the I. sieberi plants do utilize fog during the dry summer months...|$|R
5000|$|After the Japanese {{occupation}} of Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands, and fearing their attack posed {{a serious threat}} to the Northwest, a strong American naval force was deployed in Alaskan waters. Some estimates had put the Japanese naval strength at four 6-inch cruisers, eight destroyers and as many as eighteen submarines in the Aleutians. Late August 1942, Prince David, Prince Henry, Prince Robert and the corvettes [...] and , were ordered to co-operate with American forces being transported to Kodiak. Operating under orders of the United States Navy, and designated as Force [...] "D", they escorted convoys between Kodiak and Dutch Harbor (now Unalaska), Alaska as part of the Aleutian Islands campaign. Prince David and her sister ships made no actual contact with the enemy during their almost 3-month tour of duty in the northern waters. This was not to say, however, that the work was dull or uneventful. Seamen who were used to the open ocean seldom allow themselves to be impressed by anything the weather and navigational difficulties have to offer; but the men of the 'Prince' ships soon realized that whatever the perils of the North Atlantic, nothing compared with the sudden gales, erratic currents and uncharted shoals of the North Pacific. In 1942, the Canadian ships were equipped with only rudimentary radar which made navigation a source of constant danger. Fog gave way to gales which gave way to fog. Known as the Aleutian [...] "Williwaw", violent winds born in the [...] "storm factory" [...] of the Bering Sea roared down the narrow mountain passes to challenge labouring convoys with little sea room to begin with. Many of the convoy ships, who could not exceed 6 kn, battled a 4 kn current and, when hit with such a gale, often force 10, frequently had to disperse and find shelter as best they could.The 'Princes' themselves were not known for their manoeuvrability; heavy and blocky, when forced to keep pace with a slow convoy and in order to maintain steerage, the ships often ran with the leeward shaft at twice the speed of the other. Despite these extreme conditions, there were surprisingly few mishaps.On one occasion, while escorting two merchant ships to Dutch Harbor, Prince David encountered a thickening fog. Captain Godfrey deployed a fog buoy as a precaution. SS Elias Howe, one of Prince Davids charges, immediately sounded an emergency signal of six blasts on her whistle. Thinking that it was a periscope, she opened fire on the <b>fog</b> buoy <b>streaming</b> from Prince Davids stern.
