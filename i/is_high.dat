Their charity is tested by their response to Carry Brattle, and it is Fenwick who passes the test.

5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{fluctuations in}} the decades immediately after the independence of India, the economies of South Indian states have registered growth {{higher than the national}} average over the past three decades.

40|$|Four locally {{available}} {{crop residues}} viz., jowar stover (JS), maize stover (MS), red gram straw (RGS) and black gram straw (BGS) were evaluated for carbohydrate and protein fractions using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein (CNCP) system. Lignin (% NDF) <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> in legume straws {{as compared to}} cereal stovers while Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) (% DM) followed the reverse trend. The carbohydrate fractions A and B 1 <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> in BGS while B 2 <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> in MS as compared to other crop residues. The unavailable cell wall fraction (C) <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> in legume straws when compared to cereal stovers. Among protein fractions, B 1 <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> in legume straws when compared to cereal stovers while B 2 <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> in cereal stovers as compared to legume straws. Fraction B 3 largely, bypass protein <b>was</b> <b>highest</b> in MS as compared to other crop residues. Acid detergent insoluble crude protein (ADICP) (% CP) or unavailable protein fraction C was lowest in MS and highest in BGS. It is concluded that MS is superior in nutritional value for feeding ruminants as compared to other crop residues...|$|R
5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there <b>is</b> <b>high,</b> with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites <b>is</b> <b>high,</b> at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E
5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the Western High Plateau, although rainfall <b>is</b> <b>high.</b> Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E
