5000|$|Dimethylaminoisopropanol is a {{chemical}} compound with the molecular formula C5H13NO that {{is classified as}} an amino alcohol. It {{is used as a}} building block in organic synthesis. [...] Under the name <b>dimepranol,</b> it is also used as an ingredient in some pharmaceutical formulations such as <b>dimepranol</b> acedoben, a component of inosine pranobex.|$|E

5000|$|Inosine pranobex (BAN; {{also known}} as inosine {{acedoben}} <b>dimepranol</b> (INN) or methisoprinol) an antiviral drug that {{is a combination of}} inosine and <b>dimepranol</b> acedoben (a salt of acetamidobenzoic acid and dimethylaminoisopropanol) in a ratio of 1 to 3. Inosine pranobex has no effect on viral particles itself. Instead, it acts as a immunostimulant, an analog of thymus hormones. [...] It is most commonly used to treat the rare measles complication subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in conjunction with intrathecal interferon therapy.|$|E
40|$|Inosine pranobex (inosine <b>dimepranol</b> acedoben, isoprinosine) (Inos) is an {{immunomodulatory}} and {{antiviral drug}} {{used in some}} viral infections, especially in patients with weakened immunity. In the present study, effects of Inos on the production of cytokines attributable to Th 1 (IL- 2, IFN-g, and TNF-a) or Th 2 cells (IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 10) were tested in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Inos enhanced TNF-a secretion significantly (in short-term - 24 -hour, and prolonged term - 72 -hour cultures) and IFN-g (in 72 -hour cultures). Surprisingly, production of IL- 10 by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes was suppressed by Inos in a dose-dependent manner in both 24 -hour and 72 -hour cultures. These results {{shed some light on}} immunomodulatory properties of Inos and suggest applicability of this agent in patients with a depressed function of the immune system...|$|E
