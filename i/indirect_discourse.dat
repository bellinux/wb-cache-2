40|$|My {{dissertation}} aims {{to analyze}} twenty novels and some short stories that portray {{the decay of}} the Hispano-American oligarchy, {{in the context of}} the economic and social change at the end of the 19 th and the beginning of the 20 th centuries. I give special attention to La casa de los Felipes (Luisa Mercedes Levinson, 1951), La casa (Manuel Mujica Láinez, 1954), La casa del ángel (Beatriz Guido, 1954), Coronación (José Donoso, 1957), and Un mundo para Julius (Alfredo Bryce Echenique, 1970). Since the publication of Oligarquía y literatura (Blas Matamoro, 1975) and Apogeo de la oligarquía: literatura argentina y realidad política (David Viñas, 1975), only a few monographic works dedicated to specific authors consider the relations between oligarchy and literature. A comparative approach allows examining both the narrative techniques and the motifs of the literary corpus. The decadent ambience is accentuated by the frequent use of flashbacks and a circular narration structure, suggesting that the main characters are paralyzed, prisoners of the past, their solitude emphasized by the predominance of inner monologues and free <b>indirect</b> <b>discourses.</b> At the same time, fortified mansions and country houses play a central role in the configuration of an oligarchic space of self-enclosure, where the main characters are interpreted as symbols embedded in a hermetically sealed, doomed social stratum. Topics of frustration, emotional disorder, incest, and death cross the stories as leitmotifs. Finally, child figures always appear in this narrative context provided with an open attitude that contrasts their parents’ stiffness. The children are the ones who try to establish the communication between the static universe of their families and the dynamic world beyond the houses’ walls and fences. Their subversive deeds and transgressions make possible to unveil a life, which existence is otherwise ignored by the adult view...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} continuous, parametric {{study of the}} development of task-switch efficiency between the ages of 3 - 7 years. It examines the degree to which several leading explanations for switching efficiency from both the developmental and adult literature predict individual and age-related gains in accuracy and reaction time (RT) in switching tasks in early childhood. These include executive functioning (executive functions-based) accounts along with newer models of cue-processing effects. Previous work has recognized the importance of cue- processing in adult task-switch, but this dissertation provides one of the first systematic investigations of cue -processing effects in childhood. We manipulate the semantic content of verbal cues both in task-switch paradigms and in simple, no-conflict, non-switch cued matching tests. We find that differences integrating such cues can account for both individual differences and age- related changes in flexibility. These include the catastrophic switching errors made by young children in traditional task-switch tests (and also made by older children in more complicated, indirectly or arbitrarily- cued paradigms) as well as children's switch costs. Traditional explanations for performance on card-based rule sorting tasks (such as the Dimension Change Card Sort Task, DCCS (Zelazo, 1996, 2006) do not adequately account for both performance patterns. Further, we extend the idea of cue-processing and cognitive flexibility as predictors of one kind of real-world <b>indirect</b> cue: <b>discourse</b> referent...|$|R

500|$|A {{study of}} other {{important}} {{dimensions of the}} French translations, such as free <b>indirect</b> <b>discourse</b> (FID) do much to nuance our understanding of Austen's initial [...] "aesthetic" [...] reception with her first French readership. Austen uses a narrative technique known as free <b>indirect</b> <b>discourse</b> (FID) to represent Anne Elliot's consciousness in Persuasion. Indeed, the portrayal of the heroine's subjective experience is central to its narration. The frequent use of FID imbues Perusasions narrative discourse {{with a high degree}} of subtlety, placing a huge burden of interpretation on Austen's first translators. [...] Recent studies demonstrate that FID from Persuasion was translated extensively in Montolieu's La Famille Elliot. Indeed, Montolieu was aware of the propensity of Austen's narrator to delve into the heroine's psychology in Persuasion as she comments on this in the preface to La Famille Elliot. She characterises it as [...] "almost imperceptible, delicate nuances that come from the heart": des nuances délicates presque imperceptibles qui partent du fond du cœur, et dont miss JANE AUSTEN avait le secret plus qu'aucun autre romancier. Montolieu's extensive translations of Austen's FID demonstrate that she was in fact one of Austen's first critical readers, whose own finely nuanced reading of Austen's narrative technique meant that her first French readers could also share in Anne Elliot's psychological drama in much the same way that her English readership could.|$|E
500|$|The {{period after}} the Second World War saw a {{flowering}} of scholarship on Austen {{as well as}} a diversity of critical approaches. One school that emerged in the United States was the New Criticism, which saw literary texts in only aesthetic terms, an object of beauty to be appreciated in and of itself without no study of the individual that had produced it or the society that she lived in. The New Critics tended to praise Austen for her literacy skills at combining irony and paradox, but other critics argued that the New Criticism by only focusing on the aesthetic qualities of the books ignored the message of the books and Austen herself, who was reduced down to merely being the mere scribe who produced these books that they admired so much. More typical of the post-1945 scholarship Marvin Mudrick's 1952 book Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery, where he argued that Austen used irony as a way of deflating conventions and to gently challenge the reader's beliefs. Ian Watt in his 1957 book The Rise of the Novel argued that 18th century British literature was characterized by a dichotomy between either novels that were told from the first person and novels from the third person; the significance of Austen rested according to Watt in her ability to combine both subjective and objective tendencies in her books though her use of free <b>indirect</b> <b>discourse.</b> Another influential work was Wayne Booth's 1961 book The Rhetoric of Fiction, in which offered a detailed study of Emma, which he argued was told from three points of view; Emma's, Mr. Knightley's and the unnamed narrator. Booth argued Austen adopted this three-fold narration because Emma is in many ways an unlikable character, a spoiled and immature busybody, and Austen {{had to find a way}} to make her likable and engaging to the reader. Booth's book was widely praised for the way in which he highlighted how a moral problem (Emma's character) was turned into an aesthetic problem (how to tell the story while keeping its protagonist likable enough to engage the reader's sympathy), and has been the basis of much Austen scholarship since. Critics like Graham Hough have pointed out that the morality of the characters in Emma is related to their diction of the characters with those closest to the narrator having the best character, and in this reading Mr. Knightley has the best character. A. Walton Ktiz argued the aspect of the novel of [...] "Knightley as the standard" [...] prevents the irony of Emma from becoming a cynical celebration of feminine manipulation that see it, writing that Austen's use of free <b>indirect</b> <b>discourse</b> allowed the reader to understand's Emma mind without becoming limited by it.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{goal of the}} dissertation is {{the analysis}} of the discursive formulation of indirect threat in political discourse with American administration discourse regarding Russia and its actions in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict as the newly-arisen case study. More precisely, the thesis examines how Barack Obama’s rhetoric relies on metaphor and proximisation {{to the end of the}} formulation of the indirect threat that Russia constitutes to the US, the aim behind which is to prove the applicability of the two – both as rhetorical strategies and methodological apparatuses – in the <b>indirect</b> threat-focused <b>discourses</b> as well as hypothesize on further prospects of proximisation studies in yet different contexts of political discourse and beyond it. The dissertation offers an overview of the roots and current state of knowledge and use of metaphor and proximisation out of which it employs the tripartition of metaphorical roles in Lakoff’s (1991) fairy-tale scenario, Critical Metaphor Analysis of Charteris-Black (2004, 2006), Wieczorek’s (2013) P-D-P (Perspective-Distanciation-Proximisation) model and finally the S-T-A (Spatial-Temporal-Axiological) proximisation model by Cap (2013). In the empirical part concerned with the use of metaphor the twenty (main) metaphors or source domains found in Obama’s administration discourse (comprising seventy-five texts of various kind obtained from the White House official website in 2014) are analysed against their contribution to the tripartition of metaphorical roles assigned respectively to Russia as the villain, Ukraine as the victim and America as the hero. The proximisation analysis is led through the gradation of the threat that Russia constitutes to entities on the subsequent layers of the Deictic Centre and in its three aspects: spatial, temporal and axiological, paying special attention to their cooperation for the superior goal of legitimisation of America’s leadership in the world, reminiscing of the US war-on-terror and policeman-nation notions in Bush’s post 9 / 11 interventionist rhetoric. The final result of the analysis, pinpointing values, ideals and rules as the pivotal element of America-Russia opposition and the starting point for the proximised threat, whose natural progression is the threat in spatial terms, allows to draw more far-reaching suggestions as to the applicability of proximisation in any discourse thanks to its axiological aspect that is never-exhaustive in face of prevalence and boundlessness of differences in value systems.

While the questions at its core are old (questions {{of the interaction between}} syntactic form and discourse context), they are addressed here with the aid of tools only recently made available. Those tools are in the first place theoretical [...] the Minimalist framework for syntax and a Question Under Discussion framework for formal pragmatics, but in the second place also methodological. The ability to search large electronic corpora for naturally produced data in full discourse context massively expands our ability to explore subtle interactions between syntactic form and discourse context. The goal of this dissertation is to exploit these new opportunities and in so doing to combine a technically sophisticated syntax with an equally sophisticated pragmatics in a way that gives serious consideration to both components of the grammar and, especially, to the often subtle ways in which they interact.

40|$|Theory of Mind (ToM) {{refers to}} the ability to predict and explain others’ {{behaviour}} {{on the basis of their}} emotions, intentions, desires, attitudes etc. By doing this, mental states can be posited inside a person to explain behaviour that doesn’t seem logical at first. It is generally assumed that in persons with an autistic disorder ToM is impaired. The purpose of this study was to find out whether or not autistic children have problems with language that requires understanding of other people’s mental states. In this study this ‘mental language’ is divided in a lexical and a discourse part. A group of 10 autistic children and a control group of 19 typically developing children were tested with ToM tests, general language tests, Executive Function tests and mental language tests. To examine the comprehension of mental language, two types of tests were used: an <b>indirect</b> requests test (<b>discourse)</b> and a modal comprehension test (lexical). The results showed that the two groups differed only in their performance on the Theory of Mind tasks. As expected, the autistic children performed worse on these tests. Both groups did not score significantly differently on the mental language tests. However, when the children were divided differently, in a group that did pass the ToM tests and a group that did not, it was shown that the children who had passed the ToM tests scored better on the modal comprehension test than the children who had failed. The children were also divided according to their score on the general language ability tests. From this division, it was shown that whenever their general language ability score was low, their score on the indirect request test was also low in comparison to the children who had a high general language ability score. These results provide evidence for the theory that for the lexical part of mental language, a fully functioning ToM is important, whereas for the discourse part this is not the case. A possible theory could be that the discourse part of mental language is more influenced by general language abilities than by ToM abilities...|$|R
40|$|Background: Research on {{language}} comprehension in aphasia has primarily focused on comprehension of isolated words and sentences. Even though {{previous studies have}} provided insights into comprehension abilities of individuals with aphasia at the word and grammatical level, {{our understanding of the}} nature and extent of their language comprehension (dis) abilities is not yet complete. In contrast to the highly restricted semantic and syntactic interpretation of sentences, discourse comprehension requires additional pragmatic and non-linguistic skills. Aims: The purpose of this study was to assess language comprehension in individuals with and without aphasia at the discourse level. In particular, it addressed the question of whether the use of direct speech, compared to indirect speech, affects comprehension of narrative discourse in Dutch aphasic and non-brain-damaged (NBD) listeners. Methods & Procedures: The Direct Speech Comprehension (DISCO) test was developed to examine the effects of manipulating direct vs. <b>indirect</b> speech on <b>discourse</b> comprehension. Twenty-three individuals with aphasia and 20 NBD participants were presented with spoken narratives that contained either direct or indirect speech reports. The narratives were presented audio-visually on an iPad, and comprehension was assessed with yes/no questions. Outcomes & Results: The performance of the participants with aphasia was significantly poorer than that of the NBD participants. Moreover, a main effect for condition type was found, indicating that narratives with direct speech reports were better understood than narratives with indirect speech reports by listeners with and without aphasia. There was no interaction between group and condition type indicating that this main effect held for both the aphasic and the NBD listeners. However, for the participants with aphasia, there was an interaction between condition and Token Test error score indicating that the positive effect of direct speech constructions diminishes for individuals with poorer comprehension. Conclusions: Direct speech constructions facilitate language comprehension in listeners with and without aphasia. One explanation for this finding is the occurrence of additional "layers" of communication, such as intonation and facial expression, often accompanying direct speech constructions. An alternative account is the degree of grammatical complexity: In Dutch, the syntactic construction of indirect speech requires embedding, whereas in direct speech the introductory sentence and the quote are both main clauses. The finding that the beneficial effect of direct speech {{on language}} comprehension diminishes for individuals with severe aphasia may indicate that the DISCO is too difficult for them to reveal an effect of a subtle manipulation such as that of condition type. 23 page(s...|$|R

In this thesis, the occurrence of direct speech (e. g., Mary said: "Let's go") in language produced by individuals with aphasia {{and its effects on}} listener perception are explored. The thesis also investigates the effects of direct and indirect speech (e. g., Mary said that she wanted to go) on discourse comprehension in individuals with aphasia. The principal finding is that direct speech has a positive effect on both language production and language comprehension in Dutch individuals with aphasia. In the General Introduction, Chapter 1, possible causes of aphasia are discussed, followed by a description of how aphasia affects language production and comprehension. Next, possible ways that individuals with aphasia may compensate for these difficulties are considered. This is followed by a description of the main findings from the literature on direct and indirect speech processing and, more specifically, the use of direct speech in aphasia. Although much attention had been paid to reported speech in “healthy” interaction, the review of the literature makes it clear that {{little is known about the}} role of reported speech in aphasic discourse. In addition, there are a number of methodological limitations in the previous research, such as a reliance on English language studies, small participant groups, the absence of a control group, and a major focus on written language. Hence, even though needed because of these methodological limitations. The chapter ends with the formulation of the research questions that are addressed in this thesis. In the study presented in Chapter 2, the occurrence of direct speechprevious research on the production of direct speech constructions in narratives of Dutch individuals with and without aphasia is examined. The question posed in this chapter is whether and how often the construction is used, and in which forms it becomes manifest. To answer this question, the relative frequencies of direct speech constructions are calculated and compared within and between groups and tasks. Based on the patterns found in the data, different forms of direct speech are categorised: speech quotations, thought quotations, bare quotations and question-answer sequences. The results show that both groups make use of various forms of direct speech, but the individuals with aphasia produce more direct speech constructions than the non-brain-damaged (NBD) speakers. In addition, their direct speech instances have a different distribution across categories. The larger proportion of direct speech by individuals with aphasia is suggested to be a strategy to avoid difficulties with word-finding and grammar. In Chapter 3 the effects of the occurrence of direct speech on the perceived liveliness and speech comprehensibility of spontaneous speech produced by speakers with and without aphasia are assessed. Previous studies have shown that direct speech is frequently accompanied by, for example, shifts in prosody, voice quality, and pitch. As modification of intonation has been suggested to affect the degree of perceived liveliness of speech, the occurrence of direct speech is expected to have a positive effect on perceived liveliness. Furthermore, since increased liveliness has been argued to help a listener to stay focused and understand the content of a message, the occurrence of direct speech is expected to positively affect speech comprehensibility. The study demonstrates, as expected, that communication is perceived as more lively in both populations when it contains direct speech than when it does not. However, it is not more comprehensible. We suggest that the relatively high frequency of use of direct speech by speakers with aphasia reflects a strategy to increase not only liveliness of their discourse, but also listener focus and involvement. Chapter 4 addresses the question of whether the use of direct speech,compared to indirect speech, affects comprehension of narrative discourse in Dutch listeners with and without aphasia. The Direct Speech Comprehension (DISCO) test is developed to examine the effects of manipulation of direct versus <b>indirect</b> speech on <b>discourse</b> comprehension. As predicted, narratives with direct speech are better understood than narratives with indirect speech by listeners with and without aphasia. Two possible explanations are proposed: 1) the positive effect of direct speech is caused by the additional “layers” of communication (e. g., changes in pitch, volume and speech rate, facial expression, pauses) accompanying direct but not indirect speech; 2) in Dutch, direct speech is easier to comprehend than indirect speech, since the grammatical structure of direct speech is less complex than that of indirect speech. That is, direct speech constructions do not have grammatical embedding and are in canonical word order. Indirect speech constructions are embedded sentences with an (obligatory) complementiser (‘that’) and the word order of the embedded sentence is non-canonical. for the Dutch results is correct by replicating the study in English. In English, like in Dutch, indirect speech constructions are embedded. However, English indirect speech constructions have the same (canonical) word order as direct speech constructions, and the complementiser is optional and usually omitted. Hence, an English version of the DISCO test is developed and presented to participants with and without aphasia. The effects of language (Dutch versus English), group (speakers with aphasia versus speakers without aphasia) and condition (direct versus indirect speech) are examined. All three variables affect DISCO scores: the Dutch participants perform better than the English-speaking participants, the non-aphasic control group outperforms the aphasic group, and the direct speech condition is easier than the indirect speech condition. However, for English speaking participants with aphasia, direct speech is not easier to understand than indirect speech. Given these differential effects for the Dutch and English aphasic individuals, it is argued that both the extra “layers” of communication (changes in intonation, facial expression, pauses, etc.) and the grammatical characteristics of direct and indirect speech constructions play a role in discourse comprehension success, but that the surface syntactic ambiguity of English reported speech constructions influences performance. In Chapter 6, the issues raised in Chapter 1 and explored in Chapters 2 to 5 are discussed, and the results interpreted in relation to previous literature. Individuals with aphasia produce more direct speech constructions than speakers without aphasia, and this relative increase is suggested to reflect a strategy to mask word finding difficulty and to avoid grammatically complex constructions. It is argued that this is the first research to show that communication is perceived as more lively when it contains direct speech than when it does not. Furthermore, the positive effects of direct speech constructions on discourse comprehension in individuals with aphasia are considered. Finally, some clinical implications of the research are discussed: As direct speech is a linguistic format used by speakers without aphasia, it can provide a natural strategy to compensate for word-finding problems and grammatical difficulties. Direct speech can be a way that individuals with aphasia can complement or even replace verbal communication by relying on paralinguistic and non-linguistic devices, such as intonation, gestures, and body movements (aspects that are usually intact in individuals with aphasia). In this way, direct speech can contribute to the perceived liveliness of speech, helping individuals with aphasia to be stronger communication partners. Direct speech provides them with a natural, economical and flexible linguistic format that can be used in versatile communicative contexts. Therefore, speech language pathologists should consider practicing the use of direct speech in everyday communication with aphasic speakers. Similarly, there may be benefits from communication partners of individuals with aphasia using direct rather than indirect speech constructions to report speech, since the reduced grammatical complexity and extra non-verbal and paralinguistic cues may help individuals with aphasia better understand a message.
