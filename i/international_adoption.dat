25|$|Historically, the Greyhound has, {{since its}} first {{appearance}} as a hunting type and breed, enjoyed a specific degree {{of fame and}} definition in Western literature, heraldry and art as the most elegant or noble companion and hunter of the canine world. In modern times, the professional racing industry, with its large numbers of track-bred Greyhounds, as well as <b>international</b> <b>adoption</b> programs aimed at rescuing and re-homing dogs that were at a surplus to the industry. They have redefined the breed in their almost mutually dependent pursuit of its welfare- as a sporting dog that will supply friendly companionship in its retirement. Outside the racing industry and coursing community, the Kennel Clubs' registered breed still enjoys a modest following as a show dog and pet. There is an emerging pattern visible in recent years (2009–2010) of a significant decline in track betting and multiple track closures in the US, which will have consequences for the origin of future companion Greyhounds and the re-homing of current ex-racers.|$|E

25|$|International adoption: {{involves}} the placing {{of a child}} for adoption outside that child's country of birth. This can occur through {{both public and private}} agencies. In some countries, such as Sweden, these adoptions account for the majority of cases (see above Table). The U.S. example, however, indicates there is wide variation by country since adoptions from abroad account for less than 15% of its cases. More than 60,000 Russian children have been adopted in the United States since 1992, and a similar number of Chinese children were adopted from 1995 to 2005. The laws of different countries vary in their willingness to allow international adoptions. Recognizing the difficulties and challenges associated with <b>international</b> <b>adoption,</b> and in an effort to protect those involved from the corruption and exploitation which sometimes accompanies it, the Hague Conference on Private International Law developed the Hague Adoption Convention, which came into force on 1 May 1995 and has been ratified by 85 countries as of November 2011.|$|E
500|$|With {{increasing}} <b>international</b> <b>adoption</b> of the metre, the short-comings of the mètre des Archives as {{a standard}} became ever more apparent.

The meridianal definition, which had been intended to ensure international reproducibility, quickly proved so impractical that it was all but abandoned in favour of the artefact standards, but the mètre des Archives (and most of its copies) were [...] "end standards": such standards (bars which are exactly one metre in length) are prone to wear with use, and different standard bars could be expected to wear at different rates.|$|E

While the EP's Special Rapporteur for Romania's EU accession she and some others {{in the international community}} criticized <b>international</b> <b>adoptions.</b> Due partially to her pressure, the Romanian government in 2005 implemented legislation that de facto banned <b>international</b> <b>adoptions,</b> in line with practices in some of the EU member states. The measure generated controversy, mainly in the US, Israel, France, Spain and Italy, particularly from prospective parents who had filed papers for adopting a Romanian child but whose efforts were halted by the ban. International and Romanian media also called attention to poor conditions in Romanian orphanages and hospitals where abandoned children remained for prolonged periods, while acknowledging some progress made in reforming child protection. In December 2005 and July 2006, the EP passed measures requesting Romania deal with outstanding pipeline cases, despite Romania having dismissed these formally through legislation after consultation with an Independent Panel of EU Experts on Family Law. Critics claimed the Independent Panel was stacked with opponents of <b>international</b> <b>adoptions.</b> The U.S. Congress also passed repeated measures and held hearings opposing the ban.|$|R
40|$|Adoption is an {{institution}} {{as old as}} the world, created by the Roman law and present in law of almost every state. <b>International</b> <b>adoptions</b> have become popular {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century; surrogacy, although already used in ancient times – have become useful together with an artificial human reproduction methods. <b>International</b> <b>adoptions</b> and surrogacy are often regarded as wrong, associated with child trafficking and exploitation of women – hence the restrictions and prohibitions concerning them. Nevertheless, they are still serving the purpose of being a parent. That is why, despite the evil perception, they are considered useful – and therefore they are accepted and used. Will the greater popularity of surrogacy influence the number of <b>international</b> <b>adoptions?</b> Is it possible to introduce international regulation eradicating the risks associated with surrogacy?

2500|$|In addition, a {{large number}} of mixed-race [...] "G.I. babies" [...] (offspring of U.S. and other UN {{soldiers}} and Korean women) were filling up the country's orphanages. Because Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties, bloodlines, and purity of race, children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in South Korean society. <b>International</b> <b>adoption</b> of Korean children began in 1954. The U.S. Immigration Act of 1952 legalized the naturalization of non-blacks and non-whites as U.S. citizens, and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea after the Korean War. With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, which substantially changed U.S. immigration policy toward non-Europeans, Koreans became one of the fastest-growing Asian groups in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{developing}} and developed countries have forged various policies {{to try to}} increase the safety and availability of organ transplants to their citizens.

However, whilst potential recipients in developing countries may mirror their more developed counterparts in desperation, potential donors in developing countries do not. The Indian government has had difficulty tracking the flourishing organ black market in their country, but in recent times it has amended its organ transplant law to make punishment more stringent for commercial dealings in organs. It has also included new clauses in the law to support deceased organ donation, such as making it mandatory to request for organ donation in case of brain death. Other countries victimized by illegal organ trade have also implemented legislative reactions. [...] Moldova has made <b>international</b> <b>adoption</b> illegal in fear of organ traffickers. China has made selling of organs illegal as of July 2006 and claims that all prisoner organ donors have filed consent.
