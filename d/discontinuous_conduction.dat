Many researchers and engineers from the field of lighting engineering are trying to find compromise between the efficiency of LED dimming process and the ease of its implementation. This paper also presents an attempt to improve LED dimmer parameters. Comparative investigation of the operation of buck LED drivers in continuous conduction mode and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>conduction</b> mode are discussed here. The first section of paper briefly describes the controllability parameters of the converter in both of these modes. The positive impact of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>conduction</b> mode on the controllability parameters as well as the results of the analytical estimation and the results of associated experiments are summarized {{at the end of the}} first section.

40|$|This thesis {{shows the}} {{implementation}} of a novel control scheme DC-DC converter. The converter is a phase-shifted full-bridge PWM converter that is designed to operate as a front stage of a power conversion system where the input is a variable low voltage high current source. The converter is designed to step-up the low voltage input to an acceptable level that can be inverted to a 120 / 240 VAC 60 Hz voltage for residential power. A DSP based adaptive control model is developed, taking into account line variations introduced by the input source while providing very good load dynamics for the converter in both <b>discontinuous</b> and continuous <b>conduction</b> modes. The adaptive controller is implemented using two voltage sensors that read the input and the output voltages of the converter. The controller’s bandwidth is comparable to current mode control, without the need for an expensive current sensor, yet providing the noise immunity seen in voltage mode controllers. The intended input source was a fuel cell but in its absence a DC supply is utilized instead. The system is simulated for both <b>discontinuous</b> and continuous <b>conduction</b> modes and implemented and demonstrated for the continuous conduction mode. The test results are shown to match the simulation results very closely...|$|R

40|$|Slow and <b>discontinuous</b> wave <b>conduction</b> through {{nonuniform}} junctions in cardiac tissues {{is generally}} considered unsafe and proarrythmogenic. However, the relationships between tissue structure, wave conduction velocity, and safety at such junctions are unknown. We have developed a structurally and electrophysiologically detailed model of the canine Purkinje-ventricular junction (PVJ) and varied its heterogeneity parameters to determine such relationships. We show that neither very fast nor very slow conduction is safe, and there exists an optimal velocity that provides the maximum safety factor for conduction through the junction. The resultant conduction time delay across the PVJ is a natural consequence of the electrophysiological and morphological differences between the Purkinje fiber and ventricular tissue. The delay allows the PVJ to accumulate and pass sufficient charge to excite the adjacent ventricular tissue, but is not {{long enough for the}} source-to-load mismatch at the junction to be enhanced over time. The observed relationships between the conduction velocity and safety factor can provide new insights into optimal conditions for wave propagation through nonuniform junctions between various cardiac tissues...|$|R

40|$|Many {{high-performance}} {{power converters}} at CERN are implemented with thyristors, mostly in CCM (Continuous Conduction Mode) {{due to their}} better dynamic response. In DCM (<b>Discontinuous</b> <b>Conduction</b> Mode), the converter reduces its small-signal gain, producing a degraded time response {{which can lead to}} instability. Several of these converters use digital regulation, allowing the implementation of complex non- linear control techniques. Therefore, a strategy to control the converters in DCM (<b>Discontinuous</b> <b>Conduction</b> Mode) can be implemented, bearing in mind that their standard operation (sampling time, measured signals, acquisition system) can not be drastically changed. This report presents the implementation of a new method to control line-commutated converters in <b>discontinuous</b> <b>conduction</b> mode (DCM). The method is based on the modfication of the thyristor's ring angle _ using a linear approximation, yielding nearly the same dynamic performance as in continuous conduction mode.
