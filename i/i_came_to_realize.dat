500|$|Hardly {{knowing what}} I was doing... I {{sat down and}} started to work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.|$|E
500|$|The History of the Indies is a three-volume {{work begun}} in 1527 while Las Casas {{was in the}} Convent of Puerto de Plata. It found its final form in 1561, {{when he was working}} in the Colegio de San Gregorio. Originally planned as a six-volume work, each volume {{describes}} a decade {{of the history of the}} Indies from the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 to 1520, and most of it is an eye-witness account. It was in the History of the Indies that Las Casas finally regretted his advocacy for African slavery, and included a sincere apology, writing, [...] "I soon repented and judged myself guilty of ignorance. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that black slavery was as unjust as Indian slavery... and I was not sure that my ignorance and good faith would secure me in the eyes of God." [...] (Vol II, p.257) ...|$|E
500|$|... "Apollo, Apollo" [...] was generally, {{though not}} universally, well {{received}} among critics. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{wrote that the}} episode was [...] "easily the best 30 Rock of the season, {{and one of the}} series' best episodes to date". He complimented Robert Carlock for [...] " [...] in on the narcissistic worldview" [...] of the Dennis character as it [...] "cranked those qualities up to appropriately absurd 30 Rock proportions." [...] In addition, Sepinwall wrote that all of the elements featured in the episode [...] "all came together". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was similarly laudatory, writing that it was [...] "one of the most explosively hysterical and imaginative half hours of TV this season, and one of this show's best episodes ever". Time contributor James Poniewozik was favorable to the episode, observing that it was [...] "asily the funniest 30 Rock in months, and probably the whole season." [...] Poniewozik said it [...] "nailed it, from the too-many-good-jokes... to the sweet heart at the center of each character." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Adam West's cameo, but noted that Tracy's plot [...] "felt awfully shticky and sitcommy to me." [...] He opined that [...] "Apollo, Apollo" [...] was [...] "pretty great" [...] for Jane Krakowski's Jenna, and in conclusion, Rabin said [...] "I had initially pegged this episode as good but not great and essentially minor {{in the grand scheme of}} things but while writing this post <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> just how much of it I loved. 30 Rock is pretty great even when it's not that great." [...] Rick Porter, a contributor for Zap2it, said he [...] "loved" [...] the episode, writing that it made [...] "perfect sense" [...] for Kenneth to see everyone around him as muppets, and noted that Liz's commercial was a [...] "strong ending" [...] to the episode.|$|E

40|$|The {{environment}} in the preschool I work in is lacking equipment, but something more is effecting me in my professional practises. By writing, <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that it is my own child perspective that affects me. Setting up the environment, I am using my teaching experiences from England and trying to adapt my professional practise to the preschool in Sweden and the Swedish curriculum. With new found knowledge from teacher training in Sweden, I use the idyllic notion of a perfect environment I have to reassess my teaching practices. I have used an earlier study on Swedish and English preschool environments and I have discussed the influence that the Reggio Emilia approach has had at my place of work in Sweden...|$|R

2500|$|I {{arrived at}} the University of Florida on my 25th {{birthday}} in September 1957. Having completed {{four years in the}} Air Force, I was anxious to move ahead quickly with my education, and get on to a working career. [...] …I was called in to be interrogated three or four times during the next two years. Each time, it was the same setting, and the same set of questions.

[...] …At each interrogation, I refused to tell them anything. [...] Each time I was amazed that, while I was truly terrified by their tactics and their threats, I was able to stonewall their questions and refuse to give them the answers they were so desperate for. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that they, as a group, were really a very dumb bunch of redneck, illiterate people, clumsily wielding a vast amount of power over others.|$|E

5000|$|The {{idea for}} making the film Tricked came in 2010, when {{director}} Jane Wells read an article about sex traffickers coercing women into going with them to Miami, where the Super Bowl was presently being held.

60|$|As both Pierre and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize,</b> {{instead of}} grieving {{over the fact}} that this slave of Colonel Peyton's was playing the spy in the town of York, we should have rejoiced, for here was at least one person who might be able to aid us in a time of extremity.|$|E
60|$|By {{imperceptible}} degrees <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{that this}} matter of expropriation and enslavement and control, which bulks so vastly upon the modern consciousness, which the Socialists treat {{as though it}} was the comprehensive present process of mankind, is no more than one aspect of an overlife that struggles out of a massive ancient and traditional common way of living, struggles out again and again--blindly and always so far with a disorderly insuccess....|$|E
60|$|Before we {{were half}} a mile from the island <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that I was playing the part of a fool by {{allowing}} my mind to dwell upon the possibilities of the future, and, forcing thought into a different channel, I began to speak of the village which it was proposed to build {{on the bank of the}} river, little dreaming that it would one day be a great city known as Louisville, as if named for me.|$|E

His love was strong, pure, and idyllic--the ideal love of which the loftiest poets sing. It glorified his whole inner life with a strange, unfailing radiance.

Now it informs each consultation I have with faculty, upending much of what faculty traditionally believe about teaching on intellectual, social, and personal levels. By adjusting the frame through which we view teaching, SoTL has revelatory power in catalyzing change. In this article, I discuss how key precepts of SoTL enhance the day-to-day work of faculty development.  Specifically, through SoTL, faculty realize that course design is an intellectual endeavor, that students are complex individuals from whom they can learn, and that teaching is an ongoing transformational journey to be shared...|$|R
