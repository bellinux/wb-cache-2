40|$|<b>The</b> <b>closed</b> {{system is}} defined as a warehouse-like {{structure}} covered with opaque thermally insulated walls, multi-shelves with lamps, home-use air conditioners, and other equipments for water and CO_ 2 supply. Environments inside <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> system are not disturbed and thus can be controlled as desired. Ventilation is restricted at minimum to minimize resource consumption and environmental pollution, and to prevent insects and/or pathogens from entering into the system. It was estimated that the initial cost for construction of <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> system per transplant could be {{the same as that of}} the open system (i. e., greenhouse). Optimally controlled environments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> system enhanced <b>the</b> growth and development of several transplants so that <b>the</b> production period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> system was reduced by 10 to 50 %, compared with that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open system. Electric energy consumption per transplant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> system was 0. 3 - 0. 6 MJ, and its cost was 1 - 2 Japanese Yen. Water and CO_ 2 consumptions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> system were, respectively, about 1 / 15 and 1 / 5 of those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open system. Transplant quality (vigor, growth uniformity, controlled flower development, etc.) was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> system than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open system. We concluded that high quality transplants could be produced within a significantly shorter period and with less consumption of resources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> system than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open system. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> system was economically competitive over the open system for many horticultural, medicinal and other crops...|$|R

40|$|Transcription is {{initiated}} when RNA polymerase {{recognizes the}} duplex promoter DNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> complex. Due to its transient nature, <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> complex {{has not been}} well characterized. How the initial promoter recognition occurs may offer important clues to regulation of transcription initiation. In this article, we have carried out single-base pair substitution experiments on two Escherichia coli promoters belonging to two different classes, the � 35 and the extended � 10, under conditions which stabilize <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> complex. Single-base pair substitution experiments indicate modest base-specific effects on the stability of <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> complex of both promoters. Mutations of base pairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> � 10 region affect <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> complexes of two promoters differently, suggesting different modes of interaction of the RNA polymerase and <b>the</b> promoter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two <b>closed</b> complexes. Two residues on p 70 which have been suggested to play important role in promoter recognition, Q 437 and R 436, were mutated and found to have different effects on the closedcomplex stability. DNA circular dichroism (CD) and FRET suggest that <b>the</b> promoter DNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> complex is distorted. Modeling suggests two different orientations of the recognition helix of <b>the</b> RNA polymerase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> complex.
