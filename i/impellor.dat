40|$|This thesis {{describes}} how the activity of a preservative product used in food coatings can be optimized. This project is partly sponsored by the European Marie Curie Framework projects {{as part of the}} BioPowders research training network. DSM Food Specialties hosts and co finances this project. The research project focuses on food coating such as cheese coatings. A preservative additive is often incorporated to prevent microbial growth on the food products. The shelf life of the food product is defined as the time without any microbial growth. The preservative being poorly water soluble is mainly present in the form of particles and slowly dissolves and diffuses in the coating. The approach in this research is to reduce the particle size of the preservative particles in the coating. At a given concentration, the number of particles and the total surface area of product available increases with decreasing particle size. This enables to reduce the distances between the particles. The increase in specific surface area improves the product dissolution rate. At a given concentration in the food coating, the product diffuses along shorter distances when decreasing product particle size. This is shown to improve the shelf life of the food product. The smaller particles are obtained by milling and specific efforts are made to understand and characterize the milling process. The preservative product initially of a mean size of 15 ?m (d 4, 3), is ground in a stirred media mill down to sub micron sizes. Part I of the thesis presents in the first chapter how the process parameters influence the time of grinding and the level of the contamination by heavy metals. Particles in a stirred media mill can undergo different breakage mechanisms depending on the strength of the product and the forces applied by the grinding media on the particles. In the second chapter of Part I the grinding mechanisms are determined. The particles mainly break under long stresses of high intensities and shear stresses. The particles are broken by cleavage and abrasion. In the third chapter of Part I is attempted to characterize the milling of the preservative products by using a grinding time prediction by a model based on population balances. The grinding profile of the preservative product is defined as the mean particle size as function of the number of stress events or “stress number”, SN. SN represents the number of stresses that an initial particle needs to undergo during the grinding process to reach the desired fine particle size. That representation of the grinding profile is product specific. As presented in chapter 4 of Part I, no significant differences are observed between the grinding profiles measured in different tested mills. Any similar stirred media mill is therefore expected to present a similar grinding profile. A correlation is found between the mill parameters (mill rotation speed, surface area of grinding media in contact with the <b>impellors</b> and the grinding media size) and the breakage mechanism and the grinding profile. In order to fully characterize the ground particles, different techniques commercially available for particle sizing are tested. The results are presented and discussed in the first chapter of the second part of this thesis. The minimal product particle size is ca 0. 2 ?m. Different techniques point out as well the presence of larger particles. It is seen by imaging techniques such as SEM and Cryo-TEM that those larger particles are most likely aggregates of the ground particles. The stability of the ground particles is further investigated in the second chapter of Part II. The stability of the particle suspension is determined by measuring the initial sedimentation rate. This measurement technique shows differences in the aggregate size for different pH values. Changing the pH values influences the zeta-potential of the particle surface. Using the DLVO theory, the stability of ground particles shows a good correlation with the energy barrier between the particles. The higher the energy barrier the less aggregation occurs and the smaller the aggregates are. The energy barrier increases with an increase of electrostatic repulsion, i. e. the zeta-potential. The particle suspension becomes more stable when driving away the pH from the isoelectric point. The ground particles are tested in cheese coating. The use of preservative particles from different sizes is presented and discussed in Part III. Using an accelerated shelf life test, it is shown experimentally that protection against fungal growth increases when higher product concentrations are used. Also micronized product particles provide the longest protection against mould growth. A decrease in product particle size increases protection against fungal growth. A model is designed and the different aspects regulating the concentration of the product in the coating are included: the product diffusion, the product dilution, the particle distribution, the product degradation and the limit of sensitivity of the microbe to the product. The weakest point in a coating is the point where the concentration first reaches the limit of sensitivity of the microbe to the product. That point is the position in the middle of two particles. It is seen from the model that the distribution of the particles in the coating is of great importance. Reducing the particle size or increasing the concentration enables the increase of the specific number of particles. Thus the distribution of particles in the matrix changes and the distances between the particles reduce. The diffusing molecules in the coating reach the position in middle of two particles faster; this increases the shelf life of the food product. NSMApplied Science...|$|R
50|$|The {{new engine}} was {{a return to}} the {{medium-sized}} simpler and more efficient 4-cylinder type rather than the 6-cylinder engines fashionable earlier in the 1930s. It had been given an oil bath air cleaner and an automatic choke for the downdraught carburettor. The valves were mounted {{to one side of the}} block and operated by pushrods. Cooling water was circulated by an <b>impellor</b> and the amount of cooling provided by the radiator was regulated by thermostat. The design, then displacing 1669 cc, was a scaled down version of the Snipe's engine first used in Humber's Twelve of 1933 and now bored out to 75 mm.|$|E
5000|$|He {{realized}} {{that patients with}} heart failure could be rescued from acute decompensation by drugs, but for many, a lifetime on heart failure medication offers a limited existence. The advent of reliable, untethered, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), a form of artificial heart, interested him greatly and together with Stephen Westaby at Oxford he assessed a number of patients who subsequently received the Jarvic axial <b>impellor</b> pump as a life-time treatment. None of these patients were suitable for transplantation. Although the series was small {{it was published in}} the Lancet. One of these patients survived for 7 years and served as an excellent ambassador for the idea of life-time treatment with an LVAD. Of course Philip was most anxious to carry out a proper randomized controlled trial to obtain proper evidence and avoid the risk of [...] "technology creep". Unfortunately this was not achieved but eventually it will happen and when it does Philip’s pioneering efforts should be remembered.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{modifications}} {{of the basic}} HeS 8 design were also explored over the project's lifetime. The HeS 9 {{appears to be a}} modification adding a second axial compressor stage, and replacing the full centrifugal stage with a new [...] "diagonal compressor" [...] that Schelp favoured. Little is known about this design {{other than the fact that}} RLM ordered ten of them, but none was built. It appears it was this layout that was used to develop the 011. Another modification, the HeS 10, placed a complete HeS 8 engine inside a larger nacelle, and expanded the intake <b>impellor</b> to be larger than the engine. The HeS 10 appears to have been the first example of what would today be called a turbofan engine. In order to extract more power from the exhaust to drive the fan, an additional single axial-stage turbine was added behind the HeS 8's existing centrifugal one. The only real difference between the HeS 10 and a modern turbofan engine was that the fan was not powered independently of the core, although, given the separate axial turbine stage, this would not have been difficult to arrange.|$|E
5000|$|The second semi-naval {{variant of}} the Seafire {{and the first to}} be built as such, was the Seafire F Mk IIc which was based on the Spitfire Vc. The Vc had several {{refinements}} over the Spitfire Vb. Apart from the modifications included in the main batch of Seafire Ibs this version incorporated catapult spools, and a single slinging lug {{on either side of the}} fuselage, just behind the engine bulkhead. Three subtypes were produced, the F Mk IIc and FR Mk IIc (fighter reconnaissance), powered by a Merlin 46, and the L Mk IIc powered by a low altitude Merlin 32 specifically manufactured for naval use. This version of the Merlin used a [...] "cropped" [...] supercharger <b>impellor</b> to provide greater power at low altitudes than the standard engines; delivering 1,585 hp (1,182 kW) at 2,750 ft (838 m). Both engine models drove a four bladed 10 ft 9 in (3.28 m) diameter Rotol propeller. Because this version used the [...] "C" [...] wing the Hispano cannon were fed from a 120-round belt magazine, otherwise the armament was the same as that of the Ib; the FR also carried two F24 cameras. After trials of Rocket Assisted Take Off Gear (RATOG) apparatus (small solid-fuel rocket motors which could be attached to the fuselage or wings of aircraft to help shorten the take-off run) in February 1943, this equipment became a standard fitting available for all Seafires. However, many FAA pilots rarely used RATOG, in part as there was little need for it, and due to the risks posed by an instance of asymmetric ignition.|$|E

It also enables having a computer diagrams related to operation of these machines what provides consideration of possibilities for improvement of maintenance of these facilities. Also, in this way it is possible to provide continuous monitoring of sound signals and their tracking by computer. This approach and analysis of sound signals and conversion into diagrams can provide timely detection of anomalies in operation of such facilities; results can be compared with other types of diagnostics, feasibility of planned shutdowns as well as inspections, detection and maintenance. This type of diagnostics can identify critical events in some parts or complete facility.

This laboratory testing program was undertaken to support potential changes to California Building Standards regarding in-field furnace blower energy use. This technical support includes identifying suitable performance metrics and target performance levels for use in standards. Five different combinations of blowers and residential furnaces were tested for air moving performance. Three different types of blower and motor combinations were tested in two different furnace cabinets. The blowers were standard forward [...] curved impellors and a prototype impeller with reverse-inclined blades. The motors were two 6 -pole permanent split capacitor (PSC) single-phase induction motors, a brushless permanent magnet (BPM) motor and a prototype BPM designed for use with a prototype reverse-inclined <b>impellor.</b> The laboratory testing operated each blower and furnace combination over a range of air flows and pressure differences to determine air flow performance, power consumption and efficiency. Additional tests varied the clearance between the blower housing and the furnace cabinet, and the routing of air flow into the blower cabinet...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that shear force during mashing, transferring and lautering should be avoided, {{especially in the}} case of thin bed filtration, using a fine milled grist. Therefore pump rotation speed is limited up to 1000 rpm during thin bed filter operations. However, in order to achieve the targets of flow, filtration pressure and low rotation speed, the transfer pump is mostly too large and operates far from the ideal performance potential. Transferring tomatoes and milk products, where shear force directly leads to damage of the product, learned that the efficiency is much more important instead of the rotation speed. This phenomenon is tested for mash transfer during thin bed filtration on pilot and industrial scale. Mashes of 3. 5 hl were transferred with an oversized channel <b>impellor</b> pump (MWP 2 / 40 - 160 / 116 (3 K- 160) and maximum rotation speed of 1200 rpm. A smaller open impeller pump (FP/ 63 - 25 / 114 (O- 132) D 09 S 18 KEB Y 55 S 5019 [...] M 2) is used to test the hypothesis of higher rotation speed (1500 rpm). Industrial mashes (120 hl) were filtered using 4 pump types: P 1 = MCP 2 / 65 - 250 / 1104 (O- 260) ("open / semi-open impeller"-reference), P 2 = ICP 3 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (C- 220) ("closed impeller"), P 3 = IFF 2 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (VO- 220) ("vortex impeller"), P 4 = ICP 3 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (4 K- 200) ("channel impeller"). Following parameters were measured during lautering: flow, pressure, rotation speed, filtered volume, extract, β-glucan, and arabinoxylan content of first wort. At pilot scale, an increased rotation speed of 1500 rpm with the smaller new pump resulted in a somewhat improved lauter performance compared to the reference pump with a max rotation speed of 1200 rpm. However, the efficiency of this new pump is 17, 6 % vs 4 % with the reference pump. At industrial scale, no important differences in lauter performance were noticed with varying rotation speed. However higher pump efficiency resulted in a somewhat decreased extraction of β-glucans and pentosans meaning that pump efficiency is indeed more important compared to rotation speed. Higher pump efficiencies resulted in an improved lauter performance, even when rotation speed of the pump is higher. The β-glucan level in the first wort decreases with increased pump efficiency. It was generally accepted that rotation speed of transfer pumps for lautering should be below 1000 rpm to avoid shear forces. The determined factor was only the speed of rotation of the pump, efficiency was never a ‘key’ selection criterium. With these experiments, firstly proven by transferring tomatoes and milk products, pump efficiency is much more important compared to rotation speed. Decreased electricity consumption and lower investment cost is a direct result of these new findings. status: publishe...|$|E
