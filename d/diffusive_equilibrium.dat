This is a one-particle system whose dynamics is rather complex (e. g. it appears to be <b>diffusive</b> at <b>equilibrium),</b> but its Lyapunov exponents are nonpositive. For small applied field, the system exhibits a very long transient, during which the dynamics is roughly chaotic, followed by asymptotic collapse on a periodic orbit. During the transient, the dynamics is diffusive, and the fluctuations of the current are found to be in agreement with the fluctuation formula, despite the lack of real hyperbolicity. These results also constitute an example which manifests the difference between the fluctuation formula and the Evans-Searles identity.

40|$|This {{is based}} on 4 lectures given at the 13 th Australian Physics Summer School, Australia National University, Canberra, Jan 17 - 28, 2000. The main topic is the theory of {{collective}} modes in a trapped Bose gas at finite temperatures. A generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation is derived at finite temperatures, {{which is used to}} discuss a new mechanism for damping in the collisionless region arising from interactions with a static thermal cloud of non-condensate atoms. Next, introducing a kinetic equation for the thermal cloud, we derive two-fluid equations of motion for the condensate and non-condensate components in the collision-dominated hydrodynamic region. We show that these are precisely the equivalent of the Landau two-fluid equations in the limit that the two components are in <b>diffusive</b> local <b>equilibrium.</b> However, our equations also predict the existence of a new zero frequency relaxational mode, in addition to the usual Landau hydrodynamic modes (such as first and second sound). The special importance and simplicity of two-fluid hydrodynamics is stressed.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} quantum kinetic {{equation}} for the non-condensate atoms and the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the condensate, we derive the two-fluid hydrodynamic equations of a trapped Bose gas at finite temperatures. We follow the standard Chapman-Enskog procedure, starting from {{a solution of}} the kinetic equation corresponding to the complete local equilibrium between the condensate and the non-condensate components. Our hydrodynamic equations are shown to reduce to a form identical to the well-known Landau-Khalatnikov two-fluid equations, with hydrodynamic damping due to the deviation from local equilibrium. The deviation from local equilibrium within the thermal cloud gives rise to dissipation associated with shear viscosity and thermal conduction. In addition, we show that effects due to the deviation from the <b>diffusive</b> local <b>equilibrium</b> between the condensate and the non-condensate (recently considered by Zaremba, Nikuni and Griffin) can be described by four frequency-dependent second viscosity transport coefficients. We also derive explicit formulas for all the transport coefficients. These results are used to introduce two new characteristic relaxation times associated with hydrodynamic damping. These relaxation times give {{the rate at which}} local equilibrium is reached and hence determine whether one is in the two-fluid hydrodynamic region.

The solutions of the kinetic model are proved to converge exponentially as t → ∞ to this <b>diffusive</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in this distance metrizing the weak convergence of measures. Then, we prove a uniform bound in time on Sobolev norms of the solution, provided the initial data has a finite norm in the corresponding Sobolev space.

40|$|The {{geologic}} {{evidence for}} a water-rich Mars has been reviewed, {{and it has been}} concluded that it is consistent with an outgassed inventory of H 2 O equivalent to global ocean 0. 5 - 1 km deep. The most persuasive support for this conclusion comes from the martian outflow channels, whose distribution, size, and range of ages, suggests that a significant body of ground water was present on Mars throughout much of its geologic history. In this abstract, the thermodynamic implications of the outflow channels are considered. The results of this analysis suggest that if the outflow channels were carved by the discharge of ground water in <b>diffusive</b> and thermodynamic <b>equilibrium</b> with the overlying frozen crust, it implies a minimum planetary inventory of water in excess of 300 m. However, if the global inventory of ground water on Mars at the time of outflow channel formation was as high as the 500 m estimate of other researchers, then the total inventory of water on Mars could well exceed 750 m...|$|R
40|$|A Kawasaki {{dynamics}} in continuum is a dynamics of an infinite system of interacting particles in Rd which randomly hop over the space. In this paper, {{we deal with}} an equilibrium Kawasaki dynamics which has a Gibbs measure µ as invariant measure. We study a diffusive limit of such a dynamics, derived through a scaling of both the jump rate and time. Under weak assumptions on the potential of pair interaction, φ, (in particular, admitting a singularity of φ at zero), we prove that, {{on a set of}} smooth local functions, the generator of the scaled dynamics converges to the generator of an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>diffusive</b> dynamics of an infinite system of interacting particles. If the set on which the generators converge is a core for the diffusive generator, the latter result implies the weak convergence of finite-dimensional distributions of the corresponding equilibrium processes. In particular, if the potential φ is from C 3 b(Rd) and sufficiently quickly converges to zero at infinity, we conclude from a result in [Choi et al., J. Math. Phys. 39 (1998) 6509 – 6536] that the convergence of process holds when the limiting diffusion is the gradient stochastic dynamics...|$|R

If the assumption of <b>diffusive</b> <b>equilibrium</b> holds above h = 180 km for both the times of solar maximum and solar minimum, similar decreases in the plasma temperature and, consequently, the electron and ion temperatures, are inferred. If, however, <b>diffusive</b> <b>equilibrium</b> conditions do not apply at the time of solar activity minimum, perhaps due to the effects of enhanced solar wind interaction, no information on the plasma temperatures is contained in the data on the topside electron density structure...|$|E

40|$|A previously-developed hybrid particle-continuum method [J. B. Bell, A. Garcia and S. A. Williams, SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation, 6 : 1256 - 1280, 2008] is {{generalized}} to dense fluids and {{two and three}} dimensional flows. The scheme couples an explicit fluctuating compressible Navier-Stokes solver with the Isotropic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) particle method [A. Donev and A. L. Garcia and B. J. Alder, ArXiv preprint 0908. 0510]. To achieve bidirectional dynamic coupling between the particle (microscale) and continuum (macroscale) regions, the continuum solver provides state-based boundary conditions to the particle subdomain, while the particle solver provides flux-based boundary conditions for the continuum subdomain. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>diffusive</b> (Brownian) motion of a large spherical bead suspended in a particle fluid is examined, demonstrating that the hybrid method correctly reproduces the velocity autocorrelation function of the bead but only if thermal fluctuations {{are included in the}} continuum solver. Finally, the hybrid is applied to the well-known adiabatic piston problem and it is found that the hybrid correctly reproduces the slow non-equilibrium relaxation of the piston toward thermodynamic equilibrium but, again, only the continuum solver includes stochastic (white-noise) flux terms. These examples clearly demonstrate the need to include fluctuations in continuum solvers employed in hybrid multiscale methods...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} describing the energy distribution of quasi-particles in a quasi-one dimensional, normal metal wire, where the transport is <b>diffusive,</b> connected between <b>equilibrium</b> reservoirs. When an ac bias {{is applied to}} the wire by means of the reservoirs, the statistics of the charge carriers is influence by the formed non-equilibrium. The proposed model is derived from Green function formalism. The quasi-particle energy distribution is calculated with a quantum diffusion equation including a collision term accounting for inelastic scattering. The ac bias, due to high frequency irradiation, drives the wire out of equilibrium. For coherent transport the photon absorption processes create multiple photon steps in the energy distribution, where the number of steps is dependent on the relation between the amplitude of the field eV and the photon energy ω. Furthermore we observe that for the slow field regime, ωτ_D 1 this time-dependency disappears and the photon steps in the distribution have a fixed value. When the wire is extended, the transport becomes incoherent due to interaction processes, like electron-electron interaction and electron-phonon interaction. These interactions give rise to a redistribution of the quasi-particles with respect to the energy. We focused on the fast field regime and concluded that the strong interaction limit for both mechanisms gives the expected result. Strong electron-phonon interaction forces the distribution function on every position in the wire to become a Fermi function with the bath temperature, while strong electron-electron interaction causes an effective temperature profile across the wire and the distribution function on every position in the wire is a Fermi function with an effective temperature...|$|R

Melt inclusions and melts within a few 100 microns of plagioclase– melt interfaces were analyzed for comparison with melt compositions far from the crystals. Melt inclusions and melt compositions in the boundary layer close to the crystal–melt interface were similar, but both differ significantly in incompatible element concentrations from melt found greater than approximately 200 microns away from the crystals. The compositional profiles of S, Cl, P, Fe, and Al in the boundary layers were successfully reproduced by a two-step model of rapid crystal growth followed by <b>diffusive</b> relaxation toward <b>equilibrium</b> after termination of crystal growth.

Thus, the concentrations of sulfur and phosphorus in melt inclusions may over-estimate their values in the bulk melt, and other elements with similar diffusion coefficients may also be enriched in melt inclusions relative to the bulk melt...|$|R

The dependence of <b>diffusive</b> <b>equilibrium</b> concentration on pressure and temperature was investigated in the pressure range from 0. 2 to 76 bar and in the temperature range from 98 to 244 °C. The equilibrium concentration of interstitial O 2 follows Henry’s law at pressures below 13 bar whereas a departure from this model is observed at higher pressures. In particular, O 2 concentration saturates above about 60 bar, reaching a temperature-independent value for fixed particles size. The concentration of dissolved O 2, under fixed thermodynamical conditions, is size dependent, being lower in smaller particles.

40|$|The {{effects of}} wave-induced {{diffusion}} {{on the characteristics}} of plane acoustic gravity waves in the earth's thermosphere are investigated by means of a two fluid model atmosphere in <b>diffusive</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> At wave periods greater than the shortest characteristic diffusion time for the minor gas, diffusion induced by the wave is considered to act to eliminate amplitude and phase differences between the wave-induced density fluctuations of individual gases and restore the perturbed fluid to <b>diffusive</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Vertical diffusion is most important at large scale sizes, but horizontal diffusion dominates for horizontal wavelengths of less than several hundred kilometers. As a result of wave-induced diffusion, AE-C satellite measurements of neutral density fluctuations of thermospheric constituents are only compatible with relatively small scale internal gravity waves. Velocity and temperature differences for acoustic-gravity waves are greatest at periods near the mean collision time and diffusion time and lead to the dissipation of wave energy.
