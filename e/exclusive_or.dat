5|$|There are no nontrivial {{reversible}} elementary cellular automata. However, a near-miss {{is provided}} by Rule 90 and other elementary cellular automata based on the <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> function. In Rule 90, the state of each cell is the <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> of the previous states of its two neighbors. This use of the <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> makes the transition rule locally invertible, {{in the sense that}} any contiguous subsequence of states can be generated by this rule. Rule 90 is not a reversible cellular automaton rule, because in Rule 90 every assignment of states to the complete array of cells has exactly four possible predecessors, whereas reversible rules are required to have exactly one predecessor per configuration.|$|E
5|$|Rule 90 and Rule 102 {{are called}} {{additive}} cellular automata. This means that, if two initial states are combined by computing the <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> of each their states, then their subsequent configurations will be combined {{in the same}} way. More generally, one can partition any configuration of Rule 90 into two subsets with disjoint nonzero cells, evolve the two subsets separately, and compute each successive configuration of the original automaton as the <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> of the configurations on the same time steps of the two subsets.|$|E
5|$|The {{rule for}} the {{automaton}} {{within each of}} these subsets is equivalent (except for a shift by half a cell per time step) to another elementary cellular automaton, Rule 102, in which the new state of each cell is the <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> of its old state and its right neighbor. That is, the behavior of Rule 90 {{is essentially the same}} as the behavior of two interleaved copies of Rule 102.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the North American market {{accounted}} for over 10% of the company's net sales. Nokian Tyres has a tyre subsidiary based in LaVergne, Tennessee (USA). In that market, Nokian Tyres sell only to independent dealers, {{some of whom}} use the tyre products to fill in gaps in their product lines instead of an <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> majority share. This results in some dealers being knowledgeable about specific tyres but not Nokian Tyre's full tyre product range.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key {{is computed by}} using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.|$|E

Titles that were originally <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> recognized with the platform, such as Devil May Cry, Ace Combat, Virtua Fighter, and Monster Hunter, have been released on other platforms. The previous Grand Theft Auto titles were originally timed exclusives on the PlayStation 2, before making their release on other platforms, such as the Xbox, months later; however, Grand Theft Auto IV, the latest installment, was released simultaneously on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Announced exclusives titles for the PlayStation 3 such as Assassin's Creed; , and Fatal Inertia were released on Xbox 360 as well, with the latter making its release on Xbox 360 before the PlayStation 3 version.|$|E

Threefish uses no S-boxes or other table lookups in order to avoid cache timing attacks; its nonlinearity comes from alternating additions with <b>exclusive</b> <b>ORs.</b> In that respect, it is similar to Salsa20, TEA, and the SHA-3 candidates CubeHash and BLAKE.|$|R
50|$|Linear reducibility: Similar to {{positive}} reducibility {{but with the}} constraint that all atoms of the form B(n) are combined by <b>exclusive</b> <b>or's.</b> In other words, A is linear reducible to B {{if and only if}} a computable function computes for each x a finite set F(x) given as an explicit list of numbers such that x ∈ A if and only if F(x) contains an odd number of elements of B.|$|R

25|$|The second operation, x⊕y, or Jxy, {{is called}} <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> (often {{abbreviated}} as XOR) to {{distinguish it from}} disjunction as the inclusive kind. It excludes the possibility of both x and y. Defined in terms of arithmetic it is addition mod2 where 1+1 =0.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact there}} is the other {{possibility}}, that + should be read as disjunction, This other possibility extends from the disjoint union case, where <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> and non-exclusive or both give the same answer. Handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory, reflecting the modern use of both Boolean rings and Boolean algebras (which are simply different aspects of one type of structure). Boole and Jevons struggled over just this issue in 1863, {{in the form of}} the correct evaluation of x + x. Jevons argued for the result x, which is correct for + as disjunction. Boole kept the result as something undefined. He argued against the result 0, which is correct for <b>exclusive</b> <b>or,</b> because he saw the equation x + x = 0 as implying x = 0, a false analogy with ordinary algebra.|$|E

25|$|Boole {{replaced}} {{the operation of}} multiplication by the word 'and' and addition by the word 'or'. But in Boole's original system, + was a partial operation: {{in the language of}} set theory it would correspond only to disjoint union of subsets. Later authors changed the interpretation, commonly reading it as <b>exclusive</b> <b>or,</b> or in set theory terms symmetric difference; this step means that addition is always defined.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{cryptanalysis}} {{is usually}} a chosen plaintext attack, meaning that the attacker {{must be able to}} obtain ciphertexts for some set of plaintexts of their choosing. There are, however, extensions that would allow a known plaintext or even a ciphertext-only attack. The basic method uses pairs of plaintext related by a constant difference; difference can be defined in several ways, but the <b>eXclusive</b> <b>OR</b> (XOR) operation is usual. The attacker then computes the differences of the corresponding ciphertexts, hoping to detect statistical patterns in their distribution. The resulting pair of differences is called a differential. Their statistical properties depend upon the nature of the S-boxes used for encryption, so the attacker analyses differentials (ΔX, ΔY), where ΔY = S(X ⊕ ΔX) ⊕ S(X) (and ⊕ denotes <b>exclusive</b> <b>or)</b> for each such S-box S. In the basic attack, one particular ciphertext difference is expected to be especially frequent; in this way, the cipher can be distinguished from random. More sophisticated variations allow the key to be recovered faster than exhaustive search.|$|E
