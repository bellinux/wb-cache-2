5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, {{resulting}} in dramatic reddening. This {{has been estimated}} at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified. Eta Carinae <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening {{is considered to be}} largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.|$|E
5|$|Although there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> {{debate about}} the origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is {{generally}} accepted that a single rafting event, similar to the one that brought New World monkeys to South America, occurred around 50–80million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160million years ago. The resulting founder effect and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.|$|E

5|$|The NDL is a {{theoretical}} time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake and release in the body, using a model {{such as the}} Bühlmann decompression algorithm. Although the science of calculating these limits has been refined over the last century, there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave the human body. In addition, every individual's body is unique and may absorb and release inert gases at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically have a degree of safety built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.|$|E
5|$|Despite gaining {{considerable}} power {{during the}} mid twentieth-century, the governor <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> weaker {{than those of}} other states. He has no line-item veto authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fist fight during the term of Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers {{to prevent him from}} returning a bill in time. Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a supermajority. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of Administration, are {{under the control of the}} cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} Mario Vargas Llosa {{are viewed as}} both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> debate over the {{differences}} between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and Conversation in the Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta, and The Storyteller (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution {{as well as the}} workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.|$|E

25|$|The Ontario Power Authority anticipates {{that the}} {{contribution}} of cogeneration to electricity conservation will be between 47 and 265 MW depending upon how aggressively it is pursued in Ontario. However, these projections are controversial, as there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> debate about the real-life potential of widespread cogeneration projects.|$|E
25|$|While {{the power}} density {{achieved}} by the novel FeAc/Phen/ZIF-8-catalyst is promising, its durability remains inadequate for commercial application. It is reported that the best durability exhibited by this catalyst still had a 15% drop in current density over 100 hours in H2/air. Hence while the Fe-based non-PGM catalysts rival Pt-based catalysts in their electrocatalytic activity, there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> {{work to be done}} in improving their durability.|$|E

As some lineages of the 90% of species that lack a backbone or notochord might have lost these structures over time, this complicates the classification of chordates. Some chordate lineages may only be found by DNA analysis, when there is no physical trace of any chordate-like structures.|$|E

The origin of the script <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> debated, with most scholars concurring that Brahmi was derived from or at least influenced {{by one or more}} contemporary Semitic scripts, while others favor the idea of an indigenous origin or connection to the much older and as-yet undeciphered Indus script.|$|E

While this change is in line with the nationwide trend of White British people's share of the population shrinking, Worcestershire <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> more ethnically homogeneous than the national average.

25|$|In the {{richness}} of this region many animal species pass through this zone at least one season a year such as mountain goat, black-tailed deer, American black bear, elk, cougar, and many bird species. Only the whistling hoary marmot is restricted to alpine and subalpine areas. Besides {{the richness}} of mammals there is a richness of insects that are integral to the abundance of flowering plant species in this area. Another important pollinator {{in this area is}} the hummingbird. There <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> to be researched and discovered to better understand species interactions and reliance in both the alpine and subalpine ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|For limited applications, Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) can supplement or possibly replace {{the use of}} wind tunnels. For example, the experimental rocket plane SpaceShipOne was designed without any use of wind tunnels. However, on one test, flight threads were attached {{to the surface of}} the wings, performing a wind tunnel type of test during an actual flight in order to refine the computational model. Where external turbulent flow is present, CFD is not practical due to limitations in present-day computing resources. For example, an area that <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> too complex for the use of CFD is determining the effects of flow on and around structures, bridges, terrain, etc.|$|E
