5000|$|Except {{for very}} large examples, {{lubrication}} {{was almost always}} manual. Main crankshaft bearings and the connecting rod bearing on the crankshaft generally has a grease cup—a small container (cup) filled with grease and a screwed-on cover. [...] When the cover is screwed down tighter, grease is {{forced out of the}} bottom of the cup and into the bearing. Some early engines have just a hole in the bearing casting cap where an operator squirts lubricating oil while the engine is running. The piston is lubricated by a drip oiler that continuously <b>feeds</b> <b>drips</b> of <b>oil</b> onto the piston. The excess oil from the piston runs out of the cylinder onto the engine and eventually onto the ground. The drip oiler can be adjusted to drip faster or slower depending on the need for lubrication, dictated by how hard the engine is working. The rest of the moving engine components were all lubricated by oil that the engine operator would have to apply from time to time while the engine was running.|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) computer code, ICRKFLO, has been developed for flow simulation of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) riser reactors, which convert crude oil into gasoline and other valuable products. The FCC flow, especially in the entry region, is a three-phase reacting flow including hot catalyst particles, inert lift gas, and <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> droplets. The impact of the hydrodynamics processes of heat transfer, droplet evaporation, and mixing on the chemical kinetics or riser performance can be significant. ICRKFLO {{was used to evaluate}} the impact of these processes on the performance of an advanced FCC unit. The code solves for major flow properties of all three phases in an FCC riser, with models governing the transport of catalyst particles and <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> droplet, the vaporization of the <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> droplets, the cracking of the oil vapor, and the formation and deposition of coke on particles.

40|$|An {{optimal control}} {{solution}} where {{the objective is}} to determine a well-defined relationship between the vital variables (reactor temperature/riser outlet temperature, regenerator gas temperature, regenerated catalyst feed rate, and the airflow rate) through the use of Fuzzy Logic control scheme is the focus of this paper. In the catalytic cracking unit, <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> is contacted with re-circulating catalyst and reacted in a riser tube. The <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> vaporizes and is cracked as it flows up the riser, thus forming lighter hydrocarbons (the gasoline fraction). Large amounts of coke are formed as a byproduct. The coke deposits on the catalyst and reduces its activity. The lighter hydrocarbon products are separated from the spent catalyst in the ‘reactor’. Steam is supplied to strip volatile hydrocarbons from the catalyst. The catalyst is then returned to the regenerator, where the coke is burnt off in contact with air. This is usually done by partial or complete combustion. The regenerated catalyst is then re-circulated back to mix with the inlet <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> from the crude unit. [1]. The behaviour of the reactor temperature/riser outlet temperature and the regenerator gas temperature during the chemical reactions in the FCCU were simulated using MATLAB®. The problem of control, will however involve the control of two outputs (reactor temperature/riser outlet temperature and the regenerator gas temperature) by manipulating the two inputs (regenerated catalyst feed rate and the airflow rate), which are the critical and vital factors for optimization of the cracking process in th...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present studies was to determine effects of basal dietary forage source on the response of milk fatty acid composition to an oil supplement based (2 : 1, respectively, w/w) on soybean oil and marine algae biomass oil high in cis- 9, cis- 12 C 18 : 2 n − 3 and C 22 : 6 n − 3, respectively. In Study 1, Hampshire × Dorset ewes (48) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four treatments and 12 pens in a completely randomized design blocked on the basis of lambing date and number of lambs suckled. Control rations (60 : 40 forage:concentrate, dry matter (DM) basis) based on alfalfa pellets (AP) or corn silage (CS) were fed from lambing. Beginning at 22 days postpartum, three pens of ewes fed AP and three pens of ewes fed CS were supplemented with oil (30 g/kg of ration DM) in place of corn meal. Average ewe DM intake (DMI) and average daily gain (ADG) were measured weekly. Milk yield and composition were measured at 42 days postpartum. DMI was lower (P< 0. 02) for CS and for oil, but milk yield was not affected by forage source or oil supplementation. Milk fat content was higher for oil (P< 0. 10) and milk protein content was higher for AP (P< 0. 04). Total CLA concentration (g/ 100 g fatty acids) increased (P< 0. 01) with CS and oil, and the response to oil was greater for AP (P< 0. 04). Similarly, total trans-C 18 : 1 and C 22 : 6 ω− 3 concentrations were higher for CS and oil, but the response to oil was greater for CS (P< 0. 06 and P< 0. 01, respectively). In Study 2, the experiment was repeated using alfalfa haylage (AH) instead of AP. The DMI decreased (P< 0. 05) with <b>oil</b> <b>feeding,</b> but was not affected by forage source. Milk yield was decreased by <b>feeding</b> <b>oil</b> with AH, but not by <b>feeding</b> <b>oil</b> with CS (P< 0. 03). Milk fat content tended to be increased by <b>feeding</b> <b>oil</b> with AH, but tended to be decreased by <b>feeding</b> <b>oil</b> with CS (P< 0. 08). Total CLA concentration was increased (P< 0. 01) for AH versus CS and by oil, and the response to oil supplementation was greater for AH (P< 0. 01). In contrast, total trans-C 18 : 1 concentration was higher for CS versus AH, with a greater response to oil for CS (P< 0. 05). <b>Feeding</b> marine <b>oil</b> increased the C 22 : 6 ω− 3 (P< 0. 01) concentration, and the response was greater for AH (P< 0. 04). To further characterize the response of milk fat composition to dietary oil in ewes, a third study used six pens of three ewes each assigned to either the control CS diet used for Study 2 or the same diet supplemented with 45 g/kg (DM basis) of the <b>oil</b> mixture. <b>Feeding</b> <b>oil</b> had no effect on DMI, milk yield or milk fat concentration, but again increased (P< 0. 001) total trans-C 18 : 1 and C 22 : 6 ω− 3 concentrations and numerically increased (114 %) total CLA concentration. Milk fatty acid composition responses to supplemental vegetable and marine oils were affected by forage source. Milk trans-C 18 : 1 concentration was higher when CS was fed in Studies 1 and 2, but the effect of forage species on CLA concentration differed between studies, which may reflect differences in diet PUFA content and consumption, as well as amounts of dietary starch and fiber consumed. Despite large increases in trans-C 18 : 1 concentration, milk fat content was not decreased by <b>feeding</b> unsaturated <b>oils</b> to ewes, even at diet levels of 45 g/kg of ration DM...|$|R
