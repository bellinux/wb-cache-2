40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportThe mite Typhlodromus pyri can, {{where it}} is conserved, provide {{complete}} biological control of <b>European</b> <b>red</b> mite. We released T. pyri into vineyards on Long Island in 1996 and into an additional two vineyards in 1997. Typhlodromus pyri were recovered from all four release locations. Where the predators were released in 1996, T. pyri numbers were relatively high in early summer during 1997, but then declined in number. At one of these sites T. pyri apparently provided biological control of <b>European</b> <b>red</b> mite. Where T. pyri were released in 1997, the predators were moderately abundant during the entire season. At both of these locations T. pyri provided biological of <b>European</b> <b>red</b> mite. Typhlodromus pyri were also recovered from plots where the predators were not released. This suggest that T. pyri are endemic to Long Island vineyards, but are probably not as resistant to certain pesticides as those predators from Geneva, NY...|$|R

40|$|Insecticides {{commonly}} used for STLM control (methomyl, oxamyl, and pyrethroids such as esfenvalerate) are highly toxic to predatory mites. Because they greatly reduce mite predator numbers, applications of these insecticides to control STLM {{often lead to}} outbreaks of <b>European</b> <b>red</b> mite (Panonychus ulmi) (4, 7). In a typical year, however, leafminer populations in most New York orchards do not reach densities high enough to justify insecticidal control. A sampling program that would enable growers to determine the need for controlling STLM would reduce pest control costs by {{eliminating the need for}} preventive treatments, and minimizing disruption of naturally occurring biological control of <b>European</b> <b>red</b> mite.

25|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. The newborn calves are kept close to the hinds {{by a series of}} vocalizations between the two, and larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing is used with all but the most determined of predators with great effectiveness. Aside from humans and domestic dogs, the gray wolf is probably the most dangerous predator <b>European</b> <b>red</b> deer encounter. Occasionally, the brown bear will prey on <b>European</b> <b>red</b> deer. Eurasian lynx and wild boars sometimes prey on the calves. The leopard in Asia Minor (now extinct) probably preyed on eastern <b>European</b> <b>red</b> deer. Both the Barbary lion and the Barbary leopard probably once preyed on Atlas stags in the Atlas Mountains, although the Barbary lion is now extinct in the wild, and the Barbary leopard is either very rare or extinct. In the past they were also hunted by the now extinct Caspian tiger.|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} of Pacific coast band-tailed pigeons (Columba fasciata monilis) has declined; this decline {{is thought to}} be due, in part, to habitat alteration associated with current forestry practices which replace diverse forest stands with even-aged conifer monocultures and control understorey shrubs and food availability. We examined distribution of Pacific coast band-tailed pigeons and availability of habitat components (known mineral sites and potential nesting and feeding areas) in the central Coast Range of Oregon, USA. Also, we evaluated associations of relative pigeon abundance at 323 randomly selected sample points and 97 known nest sites with adjacent habitat component availability. In Oregon, the pigeons nest primarily in Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees in closed-canopy conifer or mixed forests and feed on berries of <b>red</b> <b>elder</b> (Sambucus racemosa), blue elder (S. cerulea) and cascara (Rhamnus purshiana). We detected 1 - 8 pigeons during a 1 -hour point count at 83 % of sample points from mid-June to July 1996 - 98. Eighty-four percent of the study area was classified as potential nesting (66 %) and feeding (18 %) areas. The maximum distance to the closest known mineral site was 37 km, but 91 % of the study area was within 25 km of the nearest known mineral site. Availability of habitat components around known nest sites was similar to that at sample points and reflected availability within the study area. Relative pigeon abundance was not associated with availability of known mineral sites, or potential nesting and feeding areas. Pigeons were 62 % more abundant along the western one-third of the Coast Range than along the eastern one-third, however, and this pattern was correlated with the apparent availability of <b>red</b> <b>elder</b> and cascara. Possibly the availability of <b>red</b> <b>elder</b> and cascara imposed a constraint on band-tailed pigeon distribution and abundance.
