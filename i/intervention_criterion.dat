40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to remain {{critical}} of emerging ethical norms and to review them in the light of their practical consequences. For this reason, ‘last resort’ as a just <b>intervention</b> <b>criterion</b> was assessed in the light of its effect on human security. In order to do this, a most-similar case comparison was set out between Darfur and Libya. Darfur as a case where ‘last resort’ was abided by and which had a negative outcome in terms of human security and Libya as a case where ‘last resort’ was not abided by and which had a positive outcome in terms of human security. It was found that ‘last resort’ mainly has a negative effect on human security in terms of an untimely response to a crisis. However abiding by ‘last resort’ can in some ways make it more difficult for a response to be decisive as well...|$|E
40|$|Investigated in {{this paper}} is the {{earthquake}} response of typical unreinforced masonry facades of the historical centre of Gaeta, a town in Central Italy. The facades are assumed to undergo one-sided rocking, due {{to the presence of}} internal restraints, such as transverse walls and horizontal structural elements. The dynamic model accounts, in a simplified way, for geometrical imperfections. Two sets of excitations are considered, one developed from considerations of the actual seismic hazard of the area, the other based on code provisions. The overturning frequencies are compared against different parameters, such as aspect ratio, imperfection level, energy damped due to impact against vertical restraint, ground motion variability and direction of the rotation. Surprisingly, if no additional energy damping is assumed, one-sided rocking proves more dangerous than two-sided rocking. Results of dynamic analyses are compared to those of code-suggested static responses. It is established that static results can be overly conservative, thus requiring unnecessary retrofitting, against architectural heritage minimum <b>intervention</b> <b>criterion.</b> It is further determined {{that it is possible to}} transfer the results of dynamic analyses into existing static procedures, by means of simplified corrective coefficients, accounting for one-sided rocking and expected increased energy damping...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The current {{surgical}} <b>intervention</b> <b>criterion</b> for abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}} {{is based on}} the maximum transverse diameter of the aorta. Recent research advances indicate that a better rupture predictor may be derived from the wall stress, which can be computed with the finite element method. An essential prerequisite for this modelling is an accurate description of the geometry of the aneurysm. We developed an automatic method to derive the dynamic patient-specific aneurysm geometry from non-contrast enhanced MRA balanced turbo field images. The slices of our 2 D-scanned volumes are registered onto 3 D-scanned volumes to restore spatial coherence. The resulting images are noise-filtered and the enddiastolic volume is segmented with an active objects technique (deformable models). The resulting geometrical model is propagated to the remaining phases using the correlation between grey value profiles on the surface as an external force for the active object. From our segmentations we derived tetrahedral finite element meshes which were used as the input for finite element wall stress simulations. D 2005 CARS & Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|AbstractAlthough many {{articles}} have described techniques for resection of thoracic aortic aneurysms, limited {{information on the}} natural history of this disorder is available to aid in defining criteria for surgical intervention. Data on 230 patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms treated at Yale University School of Medicine from 1985 to 1996 were analyzed. This computerized database included 714 imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, echocardiography). Mean size of the thoracic aorta in these patients at initial presentation was 5. 2 cm (range 3. 5 to 10 cm). The mean growth rate was 0. 12 cm/yr. Overall survivals at 1 and 5 years were 85 % and 64 %, respectively. Patients having aortic dissection had lower survival (83 % 1 year; 46 % 5 year) than the cohort without dissection (89 % 1 year; 71 % 5 year). One hundred thirty-six patients underwent surgery for their thoracic aortic aneurysms. For elective operations, the mortality was 9. 0 %; for emergency operations, 21. 7 %. Median size at time of rupture or dissection was 6. 0 cm for ascending aneurysms and 7. 2 cm for descending aneurysms. The incidence of dissection or rupture increased with aneurysm size. Multivariable regression analysis to isolate risk factors for acute dissection or rupture revealed that size larger than 6. 0 cm increased the probability by 32. 1 percentage points for ascending aneurysms (p = 0. 005). For descending aneurysms, this probability increased by 43. 0 percentage points at a size greater than 7. 0 cm (p = 0. 006). If the median size at the time of dissection or rupture were used as the <b>intervention</b> <b>criterion,</b> half of the patients would suffer a devastating complication before the operation. Accordingly, a criterion lower than the median is appropriate. We recommend 5. 5 cm as an acceptable size for elective resection of ascending aortic aneurysms, because resection can be performed with relatively low mortality. For aneurysms of the descending aorta, in which perioperative complications are greater and the median size at the time of complication is larger, we recommend intervention at 6. 5 cm.

40|$|The {{architectural}} heritage was seriously {{affected by the}} April 6 th 2009 earthquake in the Abruzzo region, especially considering the effects on a city with the size and with historical and strategic importance as a capital of a region, such as L’Aquila. The emergency activities that were carried out immediately after the earthquake, to protect the existing Cultural Herit-age (C. H.) structures, were conducted on two parallel levels: (i) damage surveys and design and (ii) implementation of temporary safety measures. The overall organization was central-ized in the structure “Protection of Cultural Heritage” at Di. Coma. C., managed by the Civil Protection Department. This allowed the cooperation among different involved subjects (Min-istry of Cultural Heritage officers, experts on structural engineering from Universities and Fire Brigade teams), with their own specific knowledge. Keystone of the operating process was the standardization of the damage survey and of its immediate and correct interpretation, through dedicated survey forms for churches and palaces, developed by the G. La. Be. C. (Working group {{for the protection of}} C. H. from natural risks). The experience in the field of temporary safety measures was extremely interesting: ideas for engineering the process were developed, in cooperation with the work of the fire brigade men, which are highly experi-enced technicians in the “emergency” field. After the emergency period, it’s necessary to pass to the rehabilitation phase, this process will, among many other activities, also involve the seismic upgrade of the C. H. structures, in order to minimize damage in case other equally devastating earthquakes. As so, some “con-servative” <b>intervention</b> <b>criteria,</b> capable of seismically upgrade this type of constructions and ensuring acceptable structural safety conditions, under seismic and static loads, are presented. Special attention was paid to the possibilities offered by the traditional solutions and to their possible combinations with innovative ones. These <b>intervention</b> <b>criteria</b> were developed based on the University of Padua (UNIPD) re-search experience in similar seismic events, as the observation of the damages resulting from this type of event are essential for: (i) the definition of new interpretative models, adjusted on the effective damage patterns experienced by the structures, and (ii) for the validation (or re-jection) of intervention techniques that demonstrated different performances during seismic events; which will aid on the development of new <b>intervention</b> <b>criteria.</b> As the presented <b>intervention</b> <b>criteria</b> will be very useful on the seismic improvement of the C.

40|$|The {{selection}} of the most appropriate <b>intervention</b> <b>criteria</b> and treatment for individual road sections during pavement lifecycle analyses is {{an important aspect of}} pavement management. The analyst’s task in deciding which interventions and treatments should be considered often results in a trade-off between adequate coverage of treatment options and the practicality of testing all possible alternatives. This paper describes the application and use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine optimum intervention levels and treatments as implemented in PLATO (Roberts, Roper and Loizos, 2003), a modern Pavement Lifecycle Analysis and Treatment Optimisation package. The analyst only need define the range of several intervention and treatment parameters and the GA will determine the optimum combination of these parameters for each road section either as an individual project or from a network level strategic viewpoint. The GA can take into consideration a range of user defined condition and budgetary constraints when determining the optimum solution. Optimisation can be targeted towards any combination of total transport cost, agency cost or network condition. The GA optimisation approach mimics evolution theory by discarding weaker solutions and combining better solutions to eventually create an optimum solution. The effect of mutation rate and population size on the efficiency of the optimisation process is examined. The study uses a variety of road networks to illustrate th...|$|R
