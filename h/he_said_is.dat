Medrano also said that they knew Pandora had to be young and reminiscent of Kratos' daughter, Calliope, and that [...] " [...] had to be pretty without being sexy and spunky without being saucy." [...] Medrano said the character's final attire was a [...] "Greek Punk" [...] fashion style.|$|E

Tsamere's favourite television programme is the Belgian documentary series Strip-Tease, and he {{describes himself as}} [...] "a real TV addict". He also likes Grey's Anatomy, and Hero Corp, in which he appears—he says he is [...] "not ashamed" [...] to watch himself. He has read Une Vie by Guy de Maupassant, which he described as [...] "so beautiful", and the biography of Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the story of an incredible life".|$|E

She's the strongest, smartest punching bag in the world." [...] Raul says his city is also a sister city to Kaesong, North Korea, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> [...] "far nicer" [...] than Pawnee.|$|E
500|$|On 2 October 2011 Radio Netherlands Worldwide {{reported}} that a retired Dutch politician of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) Frits Bolkestein, who is sometime called the 'mentor' of Geert Wilders, [...] "does not share his views". He reportedly said that [...] "Wilders says things that are just not right and I think he totally exaggerates." [...] While giving his opinion on burqa ban Mr Bolkestein said that he [...] "disagrees with the recent introduction of a burqa ban, an idea championed by Geert Wilders." [...] The Netherlands, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> the third European country to introduce such a ban after France and Belgium. [...] "A ban makes martyrs of the few burqa wearers {{there are in the}} Netherlands", he said.|$|E

500|$|Their second studio album, Take Me Home (2012), is characterised by rock-inherited pop, {{prominent}} {{electric guitar}} riffs, bright synthesisers, a homogeneous sound and message, and the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian interpreted its signature sound as a [...] "peppy, synth-bolstered take on early-80s new-wave pop, heavy on clipped rhythms and chugging guitars," [...] which, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> {{at least an}} improvement on the substitute contemporary R [...] "that was once the grim lot of the boyband." [...] Jon Caramanica, writing in The New York Times, considered the album [...] "far more mechanical" [...] than their debut album, although noted that it is sonically and lyrically similar. The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
500|$|O'Donnell {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he feels that one problem with games is those that play music non-stop, which he feels detracts from the overall impact. Composers are forced to either write ambient music, he says, or very light music that is not emotionally driven, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> a detriment. O'Donnell prefers to write music towards the end of the development cycle, because he would rather score the final timing for things like cinematics and gameplay changes. O'Donnell credits part of the success of the Halo theme to his background writing jingles. For that music, O'Donnell had to make sure he could write music that would [...] "get in people's heads" [...] after 15 to 30seconds. O'Donnell pushed Bungie to spend money on hiring singers and musicians to record the theme before Macworld as a way to present a strong showing.|$|E
500|$|Pratchett {{believed}} he owed [...] "a {{debt to the}} science fiction/fantasy genre which he grew up out of" [...] and disliked the term [...] "magical realism" [...] which, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> [...] "like a polite way of saying you write fantasy and is more acceptable to certain people ... who, on the whole, do not care that much." [...] He expressed annoyance that fantasy is [...] "unregarded as a literary form", arguing that it [...] "is the oldest form of fiction"; he described himself as [...] "infuriated" [...] when novels containing science fiction or fantasy ideas were not regarded as part of those genres. He debated this issue with novelist A. S. Byatt and critic Terry Eagleton, arguing that fantasy is fundamental {{to the way we}} understand the world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction.|$|E

500|$|Alexis Petridis, a music journalist, {{interpreted}} its signature {{sound as}} a [...] "peppy, synth-bolstered take on early-80s new-wave pop, heavy on clipped rhythms and chugging guitars," [...] which, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> {{at least an}} improvement on the substitute R [...] "that was once the grim lot of the boyband." [...] The opening guitar riff of [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] has been noted as {{similar to that of}} The Clash's 1982 single, [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go", by some critics. According to Petridis, the guitar is played thrice between the riff with the plectrum stroking the strings, while it is pressed. One note in the chord is changed, which Petridis surmised was probably to avoid paying any royalty to the Clash. [...] "Rock Me" [...] has a clapping, mid-tempo beat that has been likened to that [...] "We Will Rock You", a 1977 single by Queen.|$|E
500|$|Box-office {{analysts and}} critics debated the film's underperformance. Analyst Jeff Bock, of Exhibitor Relations, {{reasoned}} the film underperformed {{at the box}} office due to two reasons; the first, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> the genre. Bock stated that Americans get horror and comedy, but with the idea [...] "of those two things together in one place, people suddenly get very dumb". [...] "The horror-comedy genre is the toughest sell in Hollywood", he said. He noted films Tremors, Slither, Shaun of the Dead, Eight Legged Freaks and The Evil Dead series, and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, [...] "none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can." [...] In addition, he labeled the Scream franchise as more [...] "straight-up horror" [...] than comedy and stated Zombielands box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.|$|E
500|$|Sell said God of War {{has very}} few flaws {{and that the}} only one worth {{mentioning}} is the camera system: he said that although the cameras do a great job of following Kratos, [...] "there are a fair few annoying moments when you're attacked by something off-screen, or you fail to make a jump because you couldn't really see the jump properly". Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a little disappointing". Reed wrote that in a few notable occasions, he found some of the platforming balancing acts [...] "a little bothersome". He said players may be overwhelmed by the number of enemies, but they will eventually get their [...] "brain and reactions in gear and move onto the next gripping section and feel hugely satisfied".|$|E

500|$|Medical {{professionals}} characterize refractive errors such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia (the age-related {{blurring of}} near-point vision) as {{consequences of the}} eye's shape and other basic anatomy, {{which there is no}} evidence that any exercise can alter. Bates, however, believed that these conditions are caused by tension of the muscles surrounding the eyeball, which he believed prevents the eyeball from sufficiently changing shape (per his explanation of accommodation) when gaze is shifted nearer or farther. Bates characterized this supposed muscular tension as the consequence of a [...] "mental strain" [...] to see, the relief of which he claimed would instantly improve sight. He also linked disturbances in the circulation of blood, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> [...] "very largely influenced by thought", not only to refractive errors but also to double vision, crossed-eye, lazy eye, and to more serious eye conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma. His therapies were based on these assumptions.|$|E
500|$|Crowds of {{citizens}} had gathered outside {{the steps and}} gates of ʻIolani Palace expecting the announcement of a new constitution. Among them were White and members of Hui Kālaiʻāina who had presented a sealed package containing the constitution. After the ministers' refusal to sign the new constitution, the queen {{stepped out onto the}} balcony and asked the assembled people to return home, declaring [...] "their wishes for a new constitution could not be granted just then, but will be some future day". Representative White also gave a speech to this crowd on the palace steps although the exact nature of what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> disputed. Opponents of the monarchy, especially the conservatives in the Reform Party, later claimed he gave an inflammatory and violent speech inciting the crowd to storm the palace and [...] "go in and kill and bury" [...] either the queen or her cabinet ministers. The speech may have been in Hawaiian and was only paraphrased in the English press. On January16, The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, an English newspaper in Honolulu, sympathetic to the Reform Party, reported: ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode was [...] "boring" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and was particularly disappointing following the episode [...] "Fishsticks" [...] the previous week. Modell said, [...] "South Park episodes don't get much lazier or uninspired than this one. It was like half an idea stretched out forever and ever, and {{with very little}} payoff." [...] Carlos Delgado of If Magazine said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: [...] "All in all, I was left feeling a little cheated. [...] "Pinewood Derby" [...] wasn’t funny, it was just weird." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was told with [...] "the warp-speed storytelling style that is making this season one of South Parks best". Travis Fickett of IGN said {{he was happy to}} see an episode centered on Randy Marsh, who <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> an excellent character; Fickett said of [...] "Pinewood Derby", [...] "This isn't a great episode but its fast-paced lunacy in the South Park tradition and most of the genre tropes it riffs on are dead on." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite other R-rated horror films having {{centered}} around teenagers, {{some such as}} Scream having been successful, Bock said the second reason Jennifer's Body under-performed {{at the box office}} is the R-rating, which he described as a [...] "killer" [...] for the film. He said the film is set in high school and [...] "sounds like the perfect package for teens" [...] but that [...] "the R rating banned many teens from the theaters" [...] and the studio was left with [...] "an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?" [...] Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the Matt Damon film The Informant! and Jennifer Aniston film Love Happens, she concluded that this may support [...] "the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter" [...] and that it takes more than a name to open a film. S.T. VanAirsdale of Movieline echoed Sperling's sentiment about the weekend, as [...] "some of the stinkiest high-profile openings in recent memory". He concluded five reasons for Jennifer's Bodys underperformance at the box office. The first, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> the distributor. [...] "20th Century Fox's genre wing, Fox Atomic, had Jennifer's Body in the can by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring", he said. [...] "Instead of offloading the film to Fox Searchlight, which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild Juno to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory" [...] and [...] "post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried". VanAirsdale classified this as a [...] "ig mistake" [...] and that [...] "ou'd {{have to go back to}} The Devil Wears Prada to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you’d probably have to go back to Aliens to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully." [...] He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} [...] "a {{dictatorship}} of relativism" [...] was the core challenge facing {{the church and}} humanity. At the root of this problem, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> Kant's [...] "self-limitation of reason". This, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> contradictory to the modern acclamation of science whose excellence {{is based on the}} power of reason to know the truth. He said that this self-amputation of reason leads to pathologies of religion such as terrorism and pathologies of science such as ecological disasters. Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides. He said [...] "Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism." ...|$|E
