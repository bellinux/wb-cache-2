40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the effects of age groups and players’ role (blocker vs. defender specialist) in beach volleyball in {{relation}} to physical and temporal variables, considering quality of opposition. 1101 rallies from Under 19 (U 19), 933 rallies from Under 21 (U 21), and 1480 rallies from senior (senior) (Men’s Swatch World Championships, 2010 - 2011) were observed using video match analysis. Cluster {{analysis was used to}} set teams’ competitive levels and establish quality of opposition as “balanced”, “moderate balanced” and “unbalanced” games. The analyzed variables were: temporal (<b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>set,</b> total rest time, total work time, duration of rallies, rest time between rallies) and physical (number of jumps and number of hits done by defenders and blockers) characteristics. A one-way ANOVA, independent samples t-test and multinomial logistic regression were performed to analyze the variables studied. The analysis of temporal and physical characteristics showed differences considering age group, player’s role and quality of opposition. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>set,</b> total rest time, and number of jumps done by defenders significantly increased from the U 19 to senior category. Multinomial logistic regression showed that in: a) balanced games, rest time between rallies was higher in seniors than in U 19 or U 21; number of jumps done by defenders was higher in seniors than in U 19) and U 21; b) moderate balanced games, number of jumps done by defenders was higher in seniors than in U 21 and number of jumps done by blockers was smaller in U 19 than U 21 or seniors; c) unbalanced games, no significant findings were shown. This study suggests differences in players’ performances according to age group and players’ role in different qualities of opposition. The article provides reference values that can be useful to guide training and create scenarios that resemble a competition, taking into account physical and temporal characteristics...|$|E

50|$|Vibration {{training}} is purely eccentric and anaerobic in traction which {{can take the}} targeted muscles to complete fatigue over {{a short period of}} time (approximately 60 seconds). The reason for the short <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sets</b> is that the muscle can respond in an eccentric fashion down to approximately 40 m/s (40 contractions per second), as opposed to concentric contractions that are much slower and less powerful. The reason the eccentric phase is sought after for physiotherapy or training purposes is heavy eccentric loading taking the muscle to complete fatigue does not induce the same amount of tissue damage or inflammation markers as concentric phases do, but exert the same amount of force and energy from the body.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to design a {{high-speed}} control system for programmable DC electronic loads by combining an FPGA chip and a MCU (Microcontroller Unit). VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) is used to devise a configurable control mechanism for a DCS (Dynamic Control System). By means of simulation and verification using the FPGA chip as our development tool we carry out experiments with the dynamic control system for programmable DC electronic loads. Our design provides the advantage of speeding the process of the hardware carrying out the concurrent output control for many peripheral circuits, allowing the <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> the programmable parameters <b>of</b> 100 <b>sets</b> to send out each datum synchronously when the Run Program Mode is in high data rate. This high data rate provides the timing demand of many peripheral circuits which are controlled by a time-sharing process. The shortest <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> each <b>set</b> reaches 25 µS, using our design which provides a constant current to sink stably under the Constant Load Mode with an error rate of under 1 %.
