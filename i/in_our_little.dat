They are used by The Smeezingtons and have been {{described}} as a [...] "tiny Hollywood studio" [...] with a [...] "whiteboard hanging on the wall". It is adorned with many [...] "doodles", including a picture of Alf and a joking note that producer-engineer Ari Levine [...] "hangs out with Jamaican drug lords on the reg." [...] Lawrence says [...] "we always find that we still do our best work <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>little</b> shack of a studio... That’s where we find our magic." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>little</b> booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the other room going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Life" [...] {{was written}} in two stages. According to bassist Guto Pryce the [...] "electronic part" [...] was {{composed}} by keyboard player Cian Ciaran [...] "quite a few years" [...] before its eventual release. The band had tried to fit this early, purely electronic, version on previous albums but had [...] "never got 'round to it". By the time the group came to record Phantom Power they were anxious to release the song, however Ciaran was reluctant to leave it in its original form and encouraged {{the rest of the}} band to jam over his original track. According to singer Gruff Rhys the instrumentation was recorded [...] "pretty much live" [...] after which lyrics were written and the band's 10-minute jam session was [...] "chopped ... up and made into a composed song" [...] with the electronic section intact. Strings were later added by Sean O'Hagan. Rhys has stated that renting their own studio in Cardiff has given the band the ability to work on tracks such as [...] "Slow Life" [...] over a period of years—the group visit the studio almost every day and play: [...] "the best parts on any of our records, I think, come out of a couple of us being <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>little</b> room in Cardiff at three in the morning, just wigging out and being ecstatic in the music." ...|$|E
