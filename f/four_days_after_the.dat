40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} on differrent {{concentrations}} (20, 40, 80 µM ve 100 µM CdCl 2) of cadmium (CdCl 2) on the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and lipid peroxidation amount in leaf and stem of Kahramanmaraş- Hot (Capsicum annum L.) pepper seedlings were researched. Activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), the first enzyme in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, was increased at 2 and 4 days in KM-Hot plants exposed to CdCl 2 stress. The highest PAL activity was detected in 20 μM CdCl 2 application, on <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> application in the leaves of KM-Hot pepper. Moreover, {{it was observed that}} treatment of pepper with Cd led to an increased the rate of lipid peroxidation (which is indicated by increasing MDA content) in the leaf and stem tissues. The highest MDA content was detected in 80 μM CdCl 2 application, on <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> application in the leaf tissues. These results suggest that the activation of PAL may be associated with increased production of MD...|$|R

5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days.
