5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, the reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> was probably simply {{that neither the}} Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially.

5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{released}} in Europe on November 14, 2008. It {{was published in the}} region by Rising Star Games. The game was also released in Australia on January 15, 2009. In North America, the title was published by Marvelous Entertainment USA in partnership with Xseed Games. The North American version used a different localization to the European version with further polishing performed by Xseed Games, which contributed the delay in releasing the game. Another reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> was the game's unique nature, which made it a hard sell for the company, in addition to the flagging popularity of the DS at the time. Xseed Games spent an unspecified time deliberating over whether to release it in North America at all before approving the decision. Initially scheduled for March 2009, the game eventually released in North America on June 16. In English territories, the subtitle was changed to Murder and Mystery in Paradise, while the game's original title remained intact.|$|E
5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by {{signals from the}} guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning of}} 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt to make up <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella Maris, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.|$|E

40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> choice task {{subjects}} {{are presented with}} the choice between a smaller immediate option and a larger delayed option. Although a preference <b>for</b> <b>the</b> large <b>delayed</b> option is commonly interpreted {{as an indication of}} inhibitory control, it may possible that this option is instead the target of an impulsive response based on quantity. To disentangle this issue, we compared the performance of 10 capuchin monkeys, 101 preschool children, and 88 adult humans in a delay choice task with food, low-symbolic tokens (objects that can be exchanged with food and have a one-to-one correspondence with food items), and high-symbolic tokens (objects that can be exchanged with food and have a one-to-many correspondence with food items). Previous findings suggests that performance in self-control tasks improves when the problem is framed in a symbolic context. Here, we aimed to test two hypotheses: (i) Failure at inhibition: if choices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> reward are due to a failure at inhibiting <b>the</b> prepotent response <b>for</b> <b>the</b> larger quantity, then high-symbolic stimuli should reduce <b>the</b> preference <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> reward, whereas low-symbolic stimuli should have no effect; (ii) Tolerance for delay: if choices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> reward reflect temporal preferences, then symbolic stimuli should increase <b>the</b> preference <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> reward, with high symbolic stimuli having a greater impact than low symbolic ones. Our findings fit the ‘Failure at inhibition hypothesis’ since capuchins, children and – with some limitations – adult humans chose <b>the</b> larger <b>delayed</b> option more when presented with food than when presented with high-symbolic tokens. Thus, preferring <b>the</b> larger <b>delayed</b> option in <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> choice task seems to result from an impulsive preference for quantity, rather than from a sustained <b>delay</b> tolerance. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> choice task does not seem to provide a reliable measure of self-control...|$|R
5|$|The concerto {{took another}} {{six years to}} complete. There are many {{possible}} reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay,</b> including self-doubt, his third symphony and an unhappy period in Berlin after a request from King Frederick William IV of Prussia. Nevertheless, Mendelssohn and David kept up a regular correspondence during this time, with Mendelssohn seeking technical and compositional advice. Indeed, this violin concerto {{was the first of}} many to have been composed with the input of a professional violinist, and would influence many future collaborations. The autographed score is dated 16 September 1844, but Mendelssohn was still seeking advice from David until its premiere. The concerto was first performed in Leipzig on 13 March 1845 with Ferdinand David as soloist. Mendelssohn was unable to conduct due to illness and the premiere was conducted by the Danish composer Niels Gade. Mendelssohn first conducted the concerto on 23 October 1845 again with Ferdinand David as soloist.|$|E
5|$|Universal Pictures {{reported}} that it greenlit American Gangster with a budget of $80million, which escalated to $93million, with $10million for development costs and $3million <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> of the production start date. Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93million from the beginning. The studio also sought for American Gangster to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company General Electric received tax credits in New York City, so production {{was moved to the}} city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as Ray Liotta and John C. Reilly in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} phase of the {{operation}} had been scheduled for 8 May, no word was received from the 'Heralds' and so Doomsday was postponed by twenty-four hours. Contact was successfully established on 9 May and the first units of Force 134 arrived in Norway to begin their occupation, including the first elements of 1st Airborne Division and the Norwegian Parachute Company. All but one of the transport aircraft belonging to {{the first phase}} took off and landed in Norway without incident. Phase II was accelerated to compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay,</b> with aircraft scheduled to leave Britain between 02:00 and 13:30. Unfortunately, after approximately 07:00 poor weather over Oslo caused many transport aircraft heading for the airfield there to return to Britain, although all of those destined for Stavanger landed successfully. Several crash-landed, and one was reported missing. The remaining aircraft took off again on 11 May, with one crashing on takeoff and another going missing; of the two missing aircraft, one landed at another airfield in Norway, but the other had crashed killing all of its occupants, including Air Vice-Marshal Scarlett-Streatfeild. The aircraft belonging to the next two phases suffered no more casualties, although a number of them were again delayed by inclement weather over the Norwegian airfields. 1st Airborne Division suffered one officer and thirty-three other ranks killed, and one other rank wounded, and the Royal Air Force six killed and seven injured. All of these losses had occurred after the general surrender had been declared.|$|E

5|$|In 1595, the Stationers' Company fined Barley 40 shillings for illicitly {{publishing}} {{a number of}} works. Three years later, the organisation sued him and a fellow draper, Simon Stafford, for allegedly publishing privileged books. A raid on Barley's former premises found 4,000 copies of the Accidence, a Latin grammar book protected by monopoly. Despite pleading his innocence in court, Barley, along with Stafford, Edward Venge, and Thomas Pavier (who was Barley's apprentice), was found guilty and sentenced to prison. The lawsuit affirmed the Stationers' Company's control over the Elizabethan book trade. Stafford, Pavier, and other draper-booksellers joined the company {{within a few years}} so that they could continue their trade. Curiously, Barley did not join them until 1606. The reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> are debated among scholars. Bibliographer J. A. Lavin suggests that the Stationers' Company rejected Barley because he had no experience in the printing business. Gerald D. Johnson believes that his partnership with Thomas Morley, who held a royal patent on music publishing, allowed him to circumvent any legal obstacles. The Stationers' Company could not interfere with the publication of works under royal grant.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{with the}} project still unfinished, the museum {{published}} a report examining the reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> and additional cost. It found that the museum had greatly underestimated the work required due to the poor condition of the locomotive, much {{of which had been}} missed by a rushed inspection, which produced an overly optimistic assessment which was not based on engineering realities. It also found that once the project was underway, management lacked the experience, continuity or resources to undertake such a complex task, which was also hampered by illness and recruitment issues. Although the museum had a formal contract system to manage suppliers, managers failed to implement it properly, and it was ill-suited to the cottage industry nature of the heritage railway sector which the suppliers were largely drawn from, many of whom had failed to meet their contractual targets. Problems were also caused by the conflicting objectives of producing a certified main line locomotive while retaining as many original components and assemblies as possible, and between the need to overhaul the locomotive {{and use it as a}} marketing tool for the museum. The report recommended that the NRM consider the scope, size and responsibilities of their project management and engineering functions, and their contracting policy.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{questions}} on the later years of Cairano's career {{is that of the}} completion of the Martinengo mausoleum, the largest funereal monument of the Brescian renaissance. The commission to the jeweller and sculptor Bernardino delle Croci by the brothers Francesco and Antonio Il Martinengo of Padernello dated to 1503, with a term of three years for completion. The tomb was to house the remains of Bernardino Martinengo, the father of the two, who had left a bequest towards the work on his death in 1501 or 1502. However, it was still unfinished in 1516, when delle Croci was commissioned per a new contract to finish it by January 1518. The causes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> appear to have been, firstly, a commercial dispute between the jeweller and the clients, and secondly the war of 1512, which surely slowed the work, even if not entirely stopping it. It was not until 1516, following the reconquest of Brescia by the Venetian republic, that a new definitive agreement was made. The documents are incomplete but in fact the monument was completed and installed within the Corpus Christi church, probably within the terms of the contract.|$|E

5|$|The Liber Eliensis {{was written}} at Ely Abbey, which became Ely Cathedral upon {{conversion}} into a bishopric in 1109. The historian Elisabeth van Houts {{believes that it}} was written in two stages: first under Bishop Hervey le Breton, in office from 1109 to 1133; and continued under Bishop Geoffrey Ridel, who served from 1173 to 1189. For van Houts, the first stage was the translation of an Old English work into Latin, commissioned by Bishop Hervey. The rest of the work, van Houts argues, was composed in the 1170s. However, E. O. Blake, who edited the first Latin printing of the work, concludes that the Liber was probably composed in three parts, based on its contents; the first book of the Liber was begun after 1131, when one of the sources used in the Liber was completed. The second has a preface apologising <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> in its completion, and could not have been started before 1154, as it records events from that year. The third and final book was completed between 1169, when Bishop Nigel died and whose death is mentioned in the book, and 1174, when a new bishop was appointed. As {{there is no mention of}} Nigel's replacement, Blake states that this suggests that book three was finished before the new bishop took office.|$|E
5|$|The first coroner's inquest into Smith's suicide {{began in}} May 2011. The inquest, {{initially}} led by deputy chief coroner Dr. Bonita Porter, was controversial; {{it was originally}} scheduled to begin in November 2010, but was delayed by a legal challenge by the Smith family. As {{a result of this}} challenge, the scope of the inquest was broadened to cover the entire 11-month period of Smith's incarceration under the federal Correctional Service. Further, a panel of judges with the Ontario Divisional Court ruled in May 2011 that Dr. Porter should not have excluded video evidence of Smith's forced sedation at the Joliette Institution in Quebec. On 21 June 2011, the proceedings of the inquest were suspended until 12 September; the reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> was apparently to allow the proceedings to be webcast. In late June 2011, Dr. Porter was replaced as the presiding coroner, apparently due to her impending retirement in November 2011; the replacement presiding coroner was Dr. John R. Carlisle. The sudden and unexpected replacement led Smith's family to formally accuse the chief coroner of interfering in the inquest with no legal basis; Dr. Porter had apparently indicated that she would deliver three outstanding rulings in July, days before the announcement of her replacement. The inquest resumed briefly on 12 September, only to be suspended once again until 19 September, when the Smith family lawyer challenged the right of the new coroner to continue the inquest, and called for a mistrial. On 30 September 2011, the Ontario Coroner's Office formally terminated the inquest and dismissed the jury.|$|E
5|$|Throughout late 1796, {{progress}} on the expedition faltered. Hoche publicly blamed the naval command and specifically Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>delay,</b> whom he accused of being {{more interested in the}} planning of a proposed invasion of India. In October, Villaret was replaced by Vice-amiral Morard de Galles and the India plans were cancelled, while Hoche was placed in direct command of discipline within the fleet. By the second week of December the fleet was ready, consisting of 17 ships of the line, 13 frigates and 14 other vessels, including several large transports created made by removing the cannon from old frigates to maximise cargo space. Each ship of the line carried 600 soldiers, the frigates 250 and the transports approximately 400. Included were cavalry units, field artillery and substantial military stores with which to arm the thousands of anticipated Irish volunteers. Hoche was still dissatisfied, announcing to the Directory on 8 December that he would rather lead his men in any other operation than the planned attack on Ireland. He was supported by Morard de Galles, who admitted that his men were so inexperienced at sea that encounters with the enemy should be avoided wherever possible.|$|E
