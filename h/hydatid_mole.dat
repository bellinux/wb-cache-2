50|$|Grossly, a red hemorrhagic mass {{is seen in}} the uterus, {{though it}} may vary in size. Often, {{diagnosis}} is presumptive, and based on clinical findings and the identification of a malignant trophoblast. One prevalent symptom is vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy, abortion, or <b>hydatid</b> <b>mole.</b> A pregnancy test will be positive even if there is no embryo/fetus.|$|E
50|$|Molar {{pregnancy}} is an abnormal form of pregnancy {{in which a}} non-viable fertilized egg implants in the uterus and will fail to come to term.A molar {{pregnancy is}} a gestational trophoblastic disease which grows into a mass in the uterus that has swollen chorionic villi. These villi grow in clusters that resemble grapes. A molar pregnancy can develop when a fertilized egg does not contain an original maternal nucleus. The products of conception {{may or may not}} contain fetal tissue. It is characterized by the presence of a hydatidiform mole (or <b>hydatid</b> <b>mole,</b> mola hydatidosa). Molar pregnancies are categorized as partial moles or complete moles, with the word mole being used to denote simply a clump of growing tissue, or a growth.|$|E
40|$|Hydatidiform mole {{also known}} as <b>hydatid</b> <b>mole,</b> molar pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease {{is a type of}} {{fertilization}} abnormality, when only the conceptus trophoblast layers proliferates and not the embryoblast, no embryo develops, this is called a â€œHydatidiform mole". Due to the continuing presence of the trophoblastic layer, this abnormal conceptus can also implant in the uterus or ectopically. The trophoblast cells will secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), as in a normal pregnancy, and may appear maternally and by pregnancy test to be "normal". Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound analysis demonstrates the absence of an embryo...|$|E
