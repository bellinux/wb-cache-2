25|$|The MCC is the {{software}} intensive {{system of the}} ballistic missile defence system. It receives information from various sources such as radars and satellites which is then processed by ten computers which run simultaneously. The MCC is connected to all {{other elements of the}} defence through a WAN. MCC performs target classification, target assignment and kill assessment. It also acts as a decision support system for the commander. It can also decide the number of interceptors required for the target for an assured <b>kill</b> <b>probability.</b> After performing all these functions, the MCC assigns the target to the LCC of a launch battery. The LCC starts computing the time to launch the interceptor based upon information received from a radar based on the speed, altitude and flight path of the target. LCC prepares the missile for launch in real time and carries out ground guidance computation.|$|E
25|$|Guidance is {{performed}} by the target tracking radar, it constantly relays target range, elevation and bearing to the fire-control computer, and {{on the basis of}} this data the computer generates the laying commands for the guns or the trajectory corrections for the missiles. A back-up tracking method can be used by the gunner, who uses the 8× magnification (8 degree field of view) 1A29 stabilized sight of the Tunguska to track the target in elevation and azimuth, the altitude or range of the target being set manually. The gunner is initially cued towards the target by the system's search radar. Once the missile is steered to within 5 m of the target, an active laser or radio fuse (9M311-M1) is triggered. A contact fuse is also fitted. The warhead weighs about 9kg, and is a continuous-rod system, consisting of 600mm long, 6 to 9mm diameter rods with a flower-like cross section. The cross section ensures the rods break into fragments weighing 2–3grams. The rods form a complete ring about 5 m from the missile. Outside the rods is a fragmentation layer of steel cubes weighing 2–3grams. The 9K22 is reported to have a <b>kill</b> <b>probability</b> of 0.6 with missiles (9M311).|$|E

2500|$|Although this variant {{matched the}} {{original}} Improved Kiloton Weapon concept with an added nuclear depth bomb function, and {{was identified as}} the A model, {{it was not the}} first to be deployed, due to the more pressing needs for the strategic B models. [...] At least forty-three were deployed aboard Royal Navy surface vessels of frigate size and larger; for use by embarked helicopters and Ikara systems (where fitted) as an anti-submarine nuclear depth bomb, starting in 1971. [...] Ikara performed a similar function to the U.S. Navy's ASROC missile, which could also carry a nuclear warhead. [...] The addition of a nuclear option to Ikara was intended to significantly improve its <b>kill</b> <b>probability,</b> while providing the escort commander with an instant-response, all-weather, all-conditions weapon to deploy against time-urgent targets.

Studies were conducted and demonstrated that a 30mm cannon would require from a third to a half of the number of [...] shells that the 23mm cannon of the ZSU-23-4 would need to destroy a given target, and that firing at a MiG-17 (or similarly at, in case of war, NATO's Hawker Hunter or Fiat G.91) flying at 300m/s, with an identical mass of 30mm projectiles would result in a <b>kill</b> <b>probability</b> 1.5 times greater than with 23mm projectiles.

2500|$|The dual 2 [...] 30mm cannons (as well as {{the later}} 2A38M) were {{designed}} by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau and manufactured by the Tulamashzavod Joint Stock Company. The cannons are fired alternatively with a combined rate of fire of between 3,900 and 5,000 rounds per minute (1,950 to 2,500 rpm for each gun), and have a muzzle velocity of 960m/s. Bursts of between 83 and 250 rounds are fired {{as determined by the}} target type, with an engagement range between 0.2 and 4.0km and to an altitude of about 3km. HE-T and HE-I shells are used and fitted with a A-670 time and impact fuze which includes an arming delay and self destruct mechanism. Sources vary on elevation capabilities (one estimate gives +85 to −9 degrees, while another +87 to −10 degrees), though this range allows the system to engage ground as well as aerial targets. The 2K22 can fire its cannons in two primary modes of operation, radar and optical. In radar mode, the target tracking is fully automatic, with the guns aimed using data from the radar. In optical mode, the gunner tracks the target through the 1A29 stabilized sight, with the radar providing range data. The 2K22 is reported to have a <b>kill</b> <b>probability</b> of 0.8 with cannon. The height of defeat for guns is 0–2000 meters—for missiles 10–3500 meters.|$|E

40|$|The model derived {{for nuclear}} missile exchanges {{is used to}} {{describe}} the interaction between two forces, of which one has nuclear weapons and the other has weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The model equations are solved analytically for exchanges, costs, and stability indices by analytically minimizing the cost of first strikes. The analysis is restricted to theater operations, as WMD are inferior to nuclear weapons in strategic counter force operations, but quite adequate for theater operations against exposed forces. The analysis treats only in-theater forces as companion papers show that ex-theater forces, which enter as survivable forces, cancel out of the theater balances treated here. Optimal nuclear weapon and WMD allocations are proportional to the opponent`s carriers and inversely proportional to one`s own weapons. Thus, as WMD increase, WMD allocations to nuclear forces fall, reflecting a shift from damage limiting to inflicting damage with surviving forces. Nuclear weapon <b>kill</b> <b>probabilities</b> degrade rapidly against dispersed forces. As they fall, their allocation to WMD falls sharply as they become ineffective and are reallocated to value. Thus, damage limiting is primarily effective for undispersed forces, which produces an incentive for the nuclear side to use his weapons while they are still effective...|$|R
