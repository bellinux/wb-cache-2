40|$|Abstract: Green malt is a semiindustrialized product {{obtained}} from barley and it represents a natural product, rich in enzymes and vitamins. In this paper were conducted laboratory researches to determine the optimum working regime for obtaining malt from barley. The research was conducted in the laboratory, which {{is equipped with a}} Jacobsen <b>germination</b> <b>machine,</b> which helped in projecting and realizing different work methods in obtaining green malt. In the experiments performed were considered different working conditions for germination of barley, such as measurement and monitoring of time, water level and water temperature in the tank for soaking and germination of barley. Thus, barley germination humidity ranged from 14 % to 52 % and temperature of 14 o C to 25 o C, which allowed the establishment of working diagram families, and under their influence were obtained different times for germination of barley. Barley varieties used in these experiments were Andreea and Mădălin which were grown on an agricultural land in the county of Iasi, area of Trifeşti and the Mădălin variety cultivated in the area of Peceneaga, Tulcea country. Following the experiences made with this machine was able to increase and to decrease willingly the speed of barley germination. By altering the speed of germination of barley were obtained several types of malt, which differ depending on the content of enzymes, fermentable sugar content, protein content and gums...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT:- The NRCRI {{developed}} cassava stem {{cutting machine}} was evaluated. It has the overall dimension of 101. 5 x 51 x 120 cm. A performance test {{was carried out}} on the machine using three different cassava varieties of varying sizes. Also, two different cutting velocities of 1. 23 and 1. 32 m/s {{were used for the}} evaluation. The cassava stems were fed manually into hopper while the cam mechanism controls the dropping rates of the cassava stems to the cutting unit. Test results showed that the highest cutting efficiency of 99. 15 % was obtained for the TME 419 cassava variety with stem size of 2. 0 cm and machine cutting velocity of 1. 23 m/s, while the lowest cutting efficiency of 94. 11 % was obtained for TMS 30572 with stem size of 2. 6 cm and machine cutting velocity of 1. 32 m/s. The output capacities of the machine were 944 and 984 stakes/min for the cutting velocities of 1. 23 and 1. 32 respectively. The quality of the produced stakes was very good and showed satisfactory <b>germination</b> performance. The <b>machine</b> should be recommended for maximum production of cassava stakes to encourage mechanization of cassava production...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{placement}} and establishment {{is probably the}} most crucial phase {{in the life of a}} vegetable crop, therefore, the role of the planter or seeder is of vital importance. The objective of this study was to assess the demand of a vegetable planter/seeder and to collect information from farmers, machinery manufacturers and stakeholders to design a new planter for vegetables, initially for pea crop. To achieve the objective of this study, a survey was conducted in three provinces (Punjab, Sindh and Baluchistan) of the country and 34 farmers, 21 officers from the concerned institutions and 14 manufactures were interviewed. Furthermore, three existing planters/drills used for sowing different crops were picked from different sources for evaluating their comparative performance for planting pea. The status of vegetable planting or sowing as a whole was not found encouraging in the country and most vegetables are grown manually that are time consuming and labour intensive practices. Farmers are vigorously demanding a planter or seeder for vegetables. From the evaluation of existing machines, it was concluded that a pneumatic planter for sowing vegetables on beds is the most precise method that drops 10 to 20 seeds per meter length at recommended forward speed with single seed placement per hill. This ensures not only the optimum seed rate, but also eliminates the need for thinning after <b>germination.</b> Using this <b>machine</b> farmers may be able to save two third of the seed quantity for pea crop together with achieving additional benefits of vegetables mechanisation. Therefore, a vegetable planter, initially for pea, should be developed locally to enhance productivity of vegetables, because root establishment of vegetable crops is very critical factor that affects ultimate yield...|$|R
