5|$|HD is one {{of several}} trinucleotide repeat {{disorders}} which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The HTT gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.... CAGCAGCAG...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid <b>glutamine,</b> so a series of them results in the production of a chain of <b>glutamine</b> known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region.|$|E

Bovine α-lactalbumin (α-LA) is a globular 123 amino acid Ca 2 + binding milk protein. Modification with microbial Ca 2 + independent transglutaminase (MTGase) was used to modify lysines and <b>glutamines</b> in holo and apo α-LA. At 30 °C no lysines or <b>glutamines</b> are modified in holo α-LA, whereas in apo α-LA lysines 13, 16, 108, and 114, and <b>glutamines</b> 39 and 43, are modified.

40|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} the result of a long polyglutamine tract in the gene {{encoding}} huntingtin protein, which in turn causes a large number of cellular changes and ultimately results in neurodegeneration of striatal neurons. Although many theories have been proposed, the precise mechanism by which the polyglutamine expansion causes cellular changes is not certain. Some evidence supports the hypothesis that the long polyglutamine tract inhibits the proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in protein degradation. However, other studies report normal proteasome function in cells expressing long polyglutamine tracts. The controversy may be due to the methods used to examine proteasome activity in each of the previous studies. In the present study, we measured proteasome function by examining levels of endogenous peptides that are products of proteasome cleavage. Peptide levels were compared among mouse striatal cell lines expressing either 7 <b>glutamines</b> (STHdhQ 7 /Q 7) or 111 <b>glutamines</b> in the huntingtin protein, either heterozygous (STHdhQ 7 /Q 111) or homozygous (STHdhQ 111 /Q 111). Both of the cell lines expressing huntingtin with 111 <b>glutamines</b> showed a large reduction in nearly all of the peptides detected in the cells, relative to levels of these peptides in cells homozygous for 7 <b>glutamines.</b> Treatment of STHdhQ 7 /Q 7 cells with proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin or bortezomib also caused a large reduction in most of these peptides, suggesting that they are products of proteasome-mediated cleavage of cellular proteins. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that proteasome function is impaired by the expression of huntingtin protein containing long polyglutamine tracts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is {{a member}} of a family of {{progressive}} neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine repeat expansion. Transgenic mice expressing full-length human atrophin- 1 with 65 consecutive <b>glutamines</b> exhibit ataxia, tremors, abnormal movements, seizures, and premature death. These mice accumulate atrophin- 1 immunoreactivity and inclusion bodies in the nuclei of multiple populations of neurons. Subcellular fractionation revealed 120 kDa nuclear fragments of mutant atrophin- 1, whose abundance increased with age and phenotypic severity. Brains of DRPLA patients contained apparently identical 120 kDa nuclear fragments. By contrast, mice overexpressing atrophin- 1 with 26 <b>glutamines</b> were phenotypically normal and did not accumulate the 120 kDa fragments. We conclude that the evolution of neuropathology in DRPLA involves proteolytic processing of mutant atrophin- 1 and nuclear accumulation of truncated fragments...|$|R
40|$|The human {{androgen}} receptor (hAR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, and like other nuclear receptors, {{consists of a}} N-terminal modulatory domain, a central DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Several missense mutations in the LBD cause androgen insensitivity syndrome (AI), a condition in XY individuals with absent or subnormal male primary and secondary sexual characteristics. On the other hand, abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the N-terminal domain of the hAR causes spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) which also affects males and causes milder forms of AI, in addition to adult-onset motor neuron degeneration and gradual wasting and weakening of {{the muscles of the}} limbs, face, throat, and tongue. However, it was not clear how and to what extent these mutations contribute to the clinical phenotype of the affected individuals. In order to investigate this matter, I used PCR site-directed mutagenesis to create plasmids expressing hARs with two pairs of missense mutations in the LBD (Val 865 Leu and Val 865 Met, and Arg 839 His and Arg 839 Cys), discovered in AI individuals with varying severity of the phenotype, and two abnormal expansions of the polyglutamine repeat discovered in SBMA patients (40 and 50 <b>glutamines).</b> I also synthesized plasmids expressing no <b>glutamines</b> (0 <b>glutamines),</b> 12 <b>glutamines,</b> or 20 <b>glutamines</b> in the same N-terminal region of the hAR. These plasmids were transiently expressed in heterologous cells (COS- 1 and PC- 3), and the mutant hARs were assayed for ligand binding, stability, and transactivational capacity. In contrast to the findings by others (McPhaul et al., 1992; Marcelli et al., 1994), in some instances involving identical mutations, I consistently observed a correlation between the biochemical phenotype of the mutant hARs and the clinical phenotype of AI individuals; that is, the more severe receptor phenotype was associated with the more severe AI. These results support the hypothesis that hAR phenotype is the dominant factor {{in the development of the}} secondary sexual characteristics in normal and affected individuals. I also observed a tight negative correlation between polyglutamine tract length and transactivational capacity. This suggests that polyglutamine modulates the activity of the hAR, and that hAR activity might be suppressed in various androgen-sensitive tissues (including motor neurons) in SBMA individuals, thereby contributing to the age of onset and/or progression of the disease, even if it cannot be the primary pathogenic agent of the disease...|$|R

40|$|Huntington’s {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine [poly(Q) ] repeat expansion in the first exon of the huntingtin protein. Previously, we showed that N-terminal huntingtin peptides with poly(Q) tracts in the pathological range (51 – 122 <b>glutamines),</b> but not with poly(Q) tracts in the normal range (20 and 30 <b>glutamines),</b> form high molecular weight protein aggregates with a fibrillar or ribbon-like morphology, reminiscent of scrapie prion rods and β-amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer’s disease. Here we report that the formation of amyloid-like huntingtin aggregates in vitro not only depends on poly(Q) repeat length but also critically depends on protein concentration and time. Furthermore, the in vitro aggregation of huntingtin can be seeded by preformed fibrils.

40|$|Huntington {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} dominant neurodegenerative disorder {{caused by the}} pathological expansion of a polyglutamine tract. In this study we directly assess the influence of protein size on the formation and subcellular localization of huntingtin aggregates. We have created numerous deletion constructs expressing successively smaller fragments of huntingtin and show that these smaller proteins containing 128 <b>glutamines</b> form both intranuclear and perinuclear aggregates. In contrast, larger NH 2 -terminal fragments of huntingtin proteins with 128 <b>glutamines</b> form exclusively perinuclear aggregates. These aggregates can form {{in the absence of}} endogenous huntingtin. Furthermore, expression of mutant huntingtin results in increased susceptibility to apoptotic stress that is greater with decreasing protein length and increasing polyglutamine size. As both intranuclear and perinuclear aggregates are clearly associated with increased cellular toxicity, this supports an important role for toxic polyglutamine-containing fragments forming aggregates and playing {{a key role in the}} pathogenesis of Huntington disease...|$|R
5|$|During winter, {{asparagine}} is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, especially phosphates and <b>glutamine,</b> {{are removed from}} the xylem sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the xylem just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When <b>glutamine</b> eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as aspartate, threonine, serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and cystine. Together with sucrose and other solutes, these are then circulated in the phloem. The phloem sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining turgor pressure; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids.

All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway.

40|$|Chemotactic {{transducer}} proteins of Escherichia coli contain {{four or five}} methyl-accepting glutamates {{that are}} crucial for sensory adaptation and gradient sensing. Two residues arise from posttranslational deamidation of <b>glutamines</b> to yield methyl-accepting glutamates. We addressed {{the significance of this}} arrangement by creating two mutated trg genes: trg(5 E), coding for a transducer in which all five modification sites were synthesized as glutamates, and trg(5 Q), in which all five were <b>glutamines.</b> We found that the normal (3 E, 2 Q) configuration was not an absolute requirement for synthesis, assembly, or stable maintenance of transducers. Both mutant proteins were methylated, although Trg(5 Q) had a reduced number of methyl-accepting sites because two <b>glutamines</b> at adjacent residues were blocked for deamidation and thus could not become methyl-accepting glutamates. The glutamine-glutamate balance had striking effects on signaling state. Trg(5 E) was in a strong counterclockwise signaling configuration, and Trg(5 Q) was in a strong clockwise signaling induced by ligand binding, and alanines substituted at modification sites had an intermediate effect. Chemotactic migration by growing cells containing trg(5 E) or trg(5 Q) exhibited reduced effectiveness, probably reflecting perturbations of the counterclockwise/clockwise ratio caused by newly synthesized transducers not modified rapidly enough to produce a balanced signaling state during growth. These defects were evident for cells in which other transducers were not available to contribute to balanced signaling or were present at lower levels than the mutant proteins...|$|R
40|$|Transducer {{proteins}} {{are central}} to chemotaxis in Escherichia coli. Three transducer genes comprise a homologous gene family, while a fourth gene, trg, is more distantly related. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of trg. The deduced sequence of the Trg protein has features in common with other transducers as well as regions of significant divergence. The protein sequence suggests the same transmembrane structure postulated for other transducers: an extra cytoplasmic NH 2 -terminal domain connected by a membrane-spanning region to an intracellular COOH-terminal domain. The COOH-terminal domain of Trg exhibits substantial sequence identity with the corresponding domains of the other transducers, particularly near the sites of covalent modification. Trg appears {{to have the same}} five methyl-accepting sites identified in the Tsr protein. Two of those sites are <b>glutamines</b> that are deamidated to yield methyl-accepting glutamates, while the remainder are synthesized as glutamates. Conservation in number but not in position of modified <b>glutamines</b> in Trg compared to the other transducers is consistent with the notion that uncharged <b>glutamines</b> at a specific number of modification sites serve to balance the signaling state of newly synthesized transducers. The NH 2 -terminal domain of Trg exhibits no significant homology with other transducers, implying that trg may be a fusion of the common COOH-terminal transducer sequence with an unrelated NH 2 -terminal sequence. The location of specific mutations within trg provides support for the suggestion that ligand-binding sites are in the NH 2 -terminal domains...|$|R

5|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} genetic disorder {{that is associated with}} protein misfolding and aggregation. Excessive repeats of the <b>glutamine</b> amino acid at the N-terminus of the Huntingtin protein cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease. As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure. Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the Huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with rational drug design methods to stop the aggregate formation. The N17 fragment of the Huntingtin protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown. Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease. Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of a prion-like domain arises {{from the study of}} fungal prions. In yeast, prionogenic proteins have a portable prion domain that is both necessary and sufficient for self-templating and protein aggregation. This has been shown by attaching the prion domain to a reporter protein, which then aggregates like a known prion. Similarly, removing the prion domain from a fungal prion protein inhibits prionogenesis. This modular view of prion behaviour has led to the hypothesis that similar prion domains are present in animal proteins, in addition to PrP. These fungal prion domains have several characteristic sequence features. They are typically enriched in asparagine, <b>glutamine,</b> tyrosine and glycine residues, with an asparagine bias being particularly conducive to the aggregative property of prions. Historically, prionogenesis has been seen as independent of sequence and only dependent on relative residue content. However, this {{has been shown to be}} false, with the spacing of prolines and charged residues having been shown to be critical in amyloid formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the three domains is of central importance for understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways, which are {{the object of the}} majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of gram-positive bacteria, largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus (exoskeleton) of varying chemical composition. In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and gram-positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and <b>glutamine</b> synthetaseI; however, the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal interdomain gene transfer, and might not reflect the organismal relationship(s).|$|E

N-terminal Htt peptides with polyglutamine tracts in the pathological range (51 – 122 <b>glutamines)</b> form high-molecular-weight protein aggregates with fibrillar morphology in vitro, and they form discrete inclusion bodies in a cell-culture model. However, in some studies, formation of discrete Htt inclusions does not correlate well with cell death. We coexpressed N-terminal Htt fragments containing 91 <b>glutamines</b> fused to different affinity tags in HEK 293 cells, and we isolated small aggregates by double sequential-affinity chromatography to assure the isolation of multimeric molecules. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed the isolated aggregates as globules or clusters of globules 4 – 50 nm in diameter without any detectable fibrillar species.

40|$|Nuclear {{respiratory}} factors 1 and 2 (NRF- 1 and NRF- 2) are ubiquitous transcription {{factors that}} have been implicated in the control of nuclear genes required for respiration, heme biosynthesis, and mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication. Recently, both factors {{have been found to}} be major transcriptional determinants for a subset of these genes that define a class of simple promoters involved in respiratory chain expression. Here, functional domains required for transactivation by NRF- 1 have been defined. An atypical nuclear localization signal resides in a conserved amino-terminal region adjacent to the DNA binding domain and consists of functionally redundant clusters of basic residues. A second domain in the carboxy-terminal half of the molecule is necessary for transcriptional activation. The activation domains of both NRF- 1 and NRF- 2 were extensively characterized by both deletion and alanine substitution mutagenesis. The results show that these domains do not fall into known classes defined by a preponderance of amino acid residues, including <b>glutamines,</b> prolines, or isoleucines, as found in other eukaryotic activators. Rather, in both factors, a series of tandemly arranged clusters of hydrophobic amino acids were required for activation. Although all of the functional clusters contain <b>glutamines,</b> the <b>glutamines</b> differ from the hydrophobic residues in that they are inconsequential for activation. Unlike the NRF- 2 domain, which contains its essential hydrophobic motifs within 40 residues, the NRF- 1 domain spans about 40 % of the molecule and appears to have a bipartite structure.

The management of B. oleae {{has been based on}} the use of organophosphate (OP) insecticides, a practice that induced resistance. OP-resistance in the olive fly was previously shown to be associated with two mutations in the acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) enzyme that, apparently, hinder the entrance of the OP into the active site. The search for additional mutations in the ace gene that encodes AChE revealed a short deletion of three <b>glutamines</b> (Delta 3 Q) from a stretch of five <b>glutamines,</b> in the C-terminal peptide that is normally cleaved and substituted by a GPI anchor. We verified that AChEs from B. oleae and other Dipterans are actually GPI-anchored, although this is not predicted by the "big-PI" algorithm. The Delta 3 Q mutation shortens the unusually long hydrophilic spacer that follows the predicted GPI attachment site and may thus improve the efficiency of GPI anchor addition. We expressed the wild type B. oleae AChE, the natural mutant Delta 3 Q and a constructed mutant lacking all 5 consecutive <b>glutamines</b> (Delta 5 Q) in COS cells and compared their kinetic properties. All constructs presented identical K-m and k(cat) values, in agreement {{with the fact that the}} mutations did not affect the catalytic domain of the enzyme. In contrast, the mutants produced higher AChE activity, suggesting that a higher proportion of the precursor protein becomes GPI-anchored. An increase in the number of GPI-anchored molecules in the synaptic cleft may reduce the sensitivity to insecticides. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
