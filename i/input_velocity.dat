In 2001-2005 the glacier retreated 7 km and accelerated from 20 to 33 m/day, while thinning up to 130 m in the terminus region. Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, East Greenland had a stable terminus history from 1960 to 2002. The glacier velocity was 13 m/day in the 1990s. In 2004-2005 it accelerated to 36 m/day and thinned by up to 100 m in the lower reach of the glacier. On Sermeq Kujalleq the acceleration began at the calving front and spread up-glacier 20 km in 1997 and up to 55 km inland by 2003. On Helheim the thinning and velocity propagated up-glacier from the calving front. In each case the major outlet glaciers accelerated by at least 50%, much larger than the impact noted due to summer meltwater increase. On each glacier the acceleration was not restricted to the summer, persisting through the winter when surface meltwater is absent.|$|E

In this paper we illustrate an application of prestack time migration, which does not require an <b>input</b> <b>velocity</b> model, to hard rock conditions, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic data. This approach is based on an estimation of local event slopes (horizontal slownesses) in common-shot and common-receiver gathers and a subsequent calculation of the migration attributes (migration velocity, vertical traveltime and horizontal coordinates of the migrated reflection point). These attributes allow us to derive all the information needed to construct a time migrated image. We also use the obtained migration velocities as an <b>input</b> <b>velocity</b> model for Kirchhoff prestack time migration (PSTM) and compare the results of the proposed approach with a conventional Kirchhoff migration using as an input the pickedNMOvelocity model.

At present, there exists deficiency in the study of core enhanced channels. Two different fins arrangements of the enhanced channels are designed in present paper, which are long-strip fins and equal-distance short fins.

A variety of domain and canopy configurations were examined along with processor settings. Validation of the CFD program produced excellent results for horizontal wind velocity. Conifer shaped tree elements for the forest stands performed well and similar to the more traditional way of representing forest canopies. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) values output by the program seem to over predict the values calculated by using wind tunnel statistics. Various sizes of forest clearings were simulated to determine the stress that would be experienced by a forest edge immediately downwind of a clearing. Shorter gaps (60 tree heights) saw higher stress values but TKE values no larger than those reported upwind of the clearing.

The nonlinear terms in agents' dynamics are heterogeneous, satisfying a Lipschitz-like condition that will be defined later and is more general than the Lipschitz condition. In the proposed algorithm, a control input and a filter are designed for each agent. Each agent's filter has two outputs and the idea is that the first output estimates the average of the input signals and the second output estimates the average of the <b>input</b> <b>velocities</b> asymptotically. In parallel, each agent's position and velocity are driven to track, respectively, the first and the second outputs. Having heterogeneous nonlinear terms in agents' dynamics necessitates designing the filters for agents. Since the nonlinear terms in agents' dynamics can be unbounded and the input signals are arbitrary, novel state-dependent time-varying gains are employed in agents' filters and control inputs to overcome these unboundedness effects. Finally the results are improved to achieve the distributed average tracking for a group of double-integrator agents, {{where there is no}} constraint on input signals and the filter is not required anymore.
