The paper purported to have discovered that basophils, a type of white blood cell, released histamine when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin <b>E</b> <b>antibody.</b> The journal editors, sceptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, Nature assembled an independent investigative team to determine {{the accuracy of the}} research, consisting of Nature editor and physicist Sir John Maddox, American scientific fraud investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic James Randi. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were [...] "statistically ill-controlled", [...] "interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim", and concluded, [...] "We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported." [...] James Randi stated that he doubted that there had been any conscious fraud, but that the researchers had allowed [...] "wishful thinking" [...] to influence their interpretation of the data.|$|E

A PG isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes, PG subunit polymer and dimer obtained from Staphylococcus epidermidis, and water-soluble fragments of cell walls or PG prepared from Nocardia corynebacteriodes and Streptomyces gardneri were found to enhance both the primary and secondary responses of anti-OA immunoglobulin <b>E</b> <b>antibody</b> production. It was suggested that the PG portion, either intact or highly degraded, was capable of enhancing the immunoglobulin <b>E</b> <b>antibody</b> production, and {{there was no need for}} the non-PG moiety or intactness of PG structure for the adjuvant activity. This finding was confirmed and extended by the use of synthetic MurNAc dipeptides. Among eight MurNAc dipeptides tested, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Gln, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu, and MurNAc-l-Ser-d-isoGln were found active as an adjuvant in the stimulation of the primary and secondary reaginic anti-OA antibody production in a similar way to the cell wall PG and their fragments.

40|$|Five hundred twelve (373 men, 139 women) patients, aged 1 - 75 yr, {{with chronic}} {{hepatitis}} B virus infection seen during a 5 -yr period were analyzed. Of these, 43. 8 % were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) -positive, 49. 2 % were positive for hepatitis B <b>e</b> <b>antibody,</b> and 7 % were negative for both HBeAg and hepatitis B <b>e</b> <b>antibody</b> at presentation. The cumulative probability of clearing HBeAg {{at the end}} of the first, second, and third years was 17 %, 30 % and 34 %, respectively. The probability of clearing HBeAg increased with the age of the patients. Reversion to HBeAg occurred in 7. 8 % of patients who were HBeAg-negative at presentation and 32. 3 % of HBeAg-positive patients who cleared HBeAg. In 70. 6 % of these patients, serum hepatitis B virus-deoxyribonucleic acid was persistently positive or became detectable at the time of HBeAg reversion. Most reversions occurred during the 'e-window' phase. The reversions were transient in 31. 8 % of the cases. Recognition of the dynamics of these serologic changes is important in the evaluation of therapeutic regimens aimed at suppression of HBV replication and call for controlled trials with adequate duration of follow-up. Biochemical exacerbation of liver disease accompanied 38. 7 % of HBeAg to hepatitis B <b>e</b> <b>antibody</b> seroconversions and 34. 8 % of reversions.

40|$|Vaccination {{for control}} of H 9 N 2 low-pathogenicity avian {{influenza}} (LPAI) in chickens began in 2007 in South Korea where the H 9 N 2 virus is prevalent. Recently, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the extracellular domain of the M 2 protein (M 2 e ELISA) was developed as another strategy to differentiate between vaccinated and infected chickens. Here, an ELISA using the extracellular domain of the M 2 protein of H 9 N 2 LPAI virus (H 9 M 2 e ELISA) was applied to differentiate infected from vaccinated chickens using the H 9 N 2 LPAI virus M 2 peptide. The specificity and sensitivity of the optimized H 9 M 2 e ELISA were 96. 1 % and 83. 8 % (the absorbance of the sample to the absorbance for the positive control [S/P ratio] ≥ 0. 6), respectively, with the cutoff value (S/P ratio = 0. 6), and the criterion of avian influenza (AI) infection in a chicken house was established as > 20 % reactivity of anti-M 2 <b>e</b> <b>antibody</b> per house with this cutoff value. After infection in naïve chickens and once-vaccinated chickens with a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay titer of 9. 25 ± 0. 75 log 2 units, the sera from infected chickens were confirmed as AI infected when the chickens were 1 week old in both groups, and AI infection lasted for 24 weeks and 9 weeks in naïve and once-vaccinated chickens, respectively, although in twice-vaccinated chickens with a higher HI titer of 11. 17 ± 0. 37 log 2 units, anti-M 2 <b>e</b> <b>antibody</b> in infected sera did not reach a level indicating AI infection. In field application, anti-M 2 <b>e</b> <b>antibody</b> produced in infected chickens after vaccination or in reinfected chickens could be identified as AI infection, although HI test could not distinguish infected from vaccinated sera.

Distinguishing vaccinated from naturally infected birds (DIVA) in such situations however, has become a major challenge. Recently, we introduced the recombinant ectodomain of the M 2 protein (M 2 e) of H 5 N 1 subtype as a novel tool for an ELISA based DIVA test. Despite being antigenic in natural infection the monomer form of the M 2 e used in ELISA had limited antigenicity and consequently poor diagnostic capability. To address this shortcoming, we evaluated the use of four tandem copies of M 2 e (tM 2 e) for increased efficiency of M 2 <b>e</b> <b>antibody</b> detection. The tM 2 e gene of H 5 N 1 strain from Indonesia (A/ Indonesia/CDC 540 / 2006) was cloned into a pMAL- p 4 x expression vector and expressed in E. coli as a recombinant tM 2 e-MBP or M 2 e-MBP proteins. Both of these, M 2 e and tM 2 e antigens reacted with sera obtained from chickens following live H 5 N 1 infection but not with sera from vaccinated birds. A significantly stronger M 2 <b>e</b> <b>antibody</b> reaction was observed with the tM 2 e compared to M 2 e antigen.

Immunoglobulin E binding occurred only with cell walls from Staphylococcus aureus strains, including walls from a teichoic acid-deficient mutant.

Since the glycan backbone and the tetrapeptide (pentapeptide) subunit of the peptidoglycan of all staphylococcal strains tested {{are believed to be}} identical, it is suggested that IgE binding is related to either the peptidoglycan interpeptide bridge or an unknown antigenic structure within the cell wall of S. aureus.

The development of LAA isdue to the presence of immunoglobulin <b>E</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed against animal proteins. The process of sensitiza-tion (development of immunoglobulin <b>E</b> <b>antibodies)</b> is a com-plex process that involves interaction of antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes of the Th- 2 cell type. These cells generate a host of cytokines and other factors that lead to immediate hypersensitivity reactions and the generation of allergic inflammation. Typical symptoms of LAA include nasal symptoms (e. g., sneezing, watery discharge, and con-gestion) and skin rashes. Asthma, which produces symptoms of cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath, may affect 20 to 38 % of workers who are sensitized to laboratory animal allergens. Rarely, a generalized, life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) may occur. The estimated prevalence of LAA is variable, depending on the method used for diag-nosis, but nonetheless may affect exposed workers. The presence of pre-existing allergies to nonworkplace allergens (e. g., dust mite, pollens, molds), exposure to laboratory animal allergens, and possibly tobacco smoking are risk factors for the development of LAA. Progress in the under-standing of the mechanism and epidemiology of LAA will lead to improved methods for its prevention.
