5|$|One such {{incident}} occurred in 2004 when a stray bullet {{shot by a}} member of the Ghetto Boys hit the narrow metal wire in Helen Kelly's bra and was deflected away from her heart. In 2008, a robbery victim was saved from being stabbed in the chest when the attacker's knife was caught and deflected by the underwire of <b>her</b> <b>bra.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the underwire of a girl's bra {{helped save}} her life when she was impaled on a railing and, {{according}} to hospital personnel, the underwire from <b>her</b> <b>bra</b> probably helped deflect the spike from her heart. There have been multiple incidents where bullets were deflected by the underwire of a woman's bra, either keeping her entirely from harm, or directing the bullet away from the heart {{to another part of}} the body.|$|E
50|$|Although {{most famous}} for <b>her</b> <b>bras,</b> girdles and undergarments, her line of Spandex Blend nightgowns were quite {{successful}} for many years, but sadly for some, {{did not seem}} to continue to be produced much after the Warnaco takeover.|$|R

5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into <b>her</b> <b>bra,</b> removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{is almost}} {{six and a}} half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen {{crashing}} on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyoncé appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals <b>her</b> <b>bra</b> and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against a backdrop of smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap. He raps with his eyes down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyoncé mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyoncé dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes <b>her</b> <b>bra,</b> as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E

5|$|When WCW was {{purchased}} by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001, Keibler's contract was bought by the WWF. She portrayed a heel character in The Alliance. She made her WWF television debut on the June 14, 2001 episode of SmackDown! when then-face, Shane McMahon {{brought her to the}} ring to distract then-heel, Rhyno, causing him to lose a match. Keibler originally teamed up with real-life friend, then-heel, Torrie Wilson, and the pair feuded with Trish Stratus and Lita. During this feud the four wrestlers competed in the first-ever tag team Bra and Panties Match at the Invasion pay-per-view, which Trish and Lita won by stripping Stacy down to <b>her</b> yellow <b>bra</b> & panties and Torrie Wilson to <b>her</b> white <b>bra</b> & panties.|$|R

He struck Rytka {{on the head}} five times as she exited his vehicle, before {{stripping}} many of her clothes from her body (although <b>her</b> <b>bra</b> and polo-neck jumper were positioned above her breasts), before repeatedly stabbing her in the chest. Her body was found beneath railway arches in the timber-yard {{to which he had}} driven her three days later.|$|E
25|$|In {{the privacy}} of their own homes, people are more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in {{the privacy of}} their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove <b>her</b> <b>bra</b> or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E
25|$|In the Dunphy family, while Phil (Ty Burrell) is at work, {{his father}} Frank (Fred Willard) {{comes to his}} house to visit with his RV and a dog named Scout without telling Claire (Julie Bowen) that the dog is for them. Claire as {{expected}} is angry at this as she expects the family not {{to help with the}} dog and she will do all the work. While taking the trash out Claire overhears Frank crying in his RV. Claire tells Phil, but Phil does not believe this. Claire finally convinces Phil to ask his father what is wrong, though when he gets ready to ask, Phil instead avoids it with another question. Claire continues to be bothered by the dog, though it becomes clear she begins bonding with it. Finally, Phil asks Frank what is wrong and Frank tells Phil he fell in love, making Phil think his parents are divorcing. Then he says {{he fell in love with}} a he...Scout. Phil tells him he can take Scout home and Claire, who ends up being the most upset that Scout is leaving, gives Scout <b>her</b> <b>bra.</b> Frank then leaves with Luke (Nolan Gould) chasing the RV like a dog.|$|E
50|$|An {{alluring}} {{woman who}} sold real estate, Laura {{would do anything}} to close a deal, including using her appeal to seduce the buyer, which is exactly what she does in the pilot when she strips down to <b>her</b> navy blue <b>bra</b> and panties and offers herself to entice her buyer. Later in the pilot, after new resident Nick Hadley (Jarrod Emick) has caught her eye moving in next door to her, she tries to entice him away from his red haired wife Joanne (Michelle Stafford) by giving him a striptease, stripping away her red dress down to <b>her</b> black <b>bra</b> and panties.|$|R

500|$|On Sunday, 24 August 2008, {{film maker}} Nancy Kates {{set off a}} metal {{detector}} during security screening. She objected when the agent attempted to pat-down her breasts. She said she told the agent, [...] "'You can't treat me as a criminal for wearing a bra." [...] A TSA supervisor {{told her she had}} to either submit to the pat-down search in a private room or not fly. Kates offered to take off <b>her</b> <b>bra,</b> which the TSA accepted. She went to the restroom, removed <b>her</b> <b>bra,</b> and walked through the airport and security screening braless. She said that a supervisor told her that underwire bras were the leading cause of metal detector false alarms.|$|E
500|$|Leigh {{was found}} naked {{except for her}} socks and shoes, with her {{knickers}} and shorts around her right ankle. She was on her back with her legs apart. <b>Her</b> <b>bra,</b> which had its securing hook bent, was found nearby, as was her shirt and jumper, which were intertwined, inside out and stained with liquor.

During the murder investigation, police found images of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Yeates. In one scene she was shown pulling up a pink top to expose <b>her</b> <b>bra</b> and breasts. When Yeates was discovered, she was wearing a similarly arranged pink top.|$|E

500|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Melina and Torrie Wilson (managed by Candice Michelle, {{who was also}} the guest referee), in a Bra and Panties match. The only way to win a [...] "Bra and Panties" [...] match is for a wrestler to strip her {{opponent}} down to her underwear. At {{the start of the}} match, Melina pulled off Wilson's shirt to reveal <b>her</b> <b>bra,</b> but Wilson retaliated and pulled off Melina's shirt. Wilson then lifted Melina to her shoulders and dropped her to the mat, while she attempted to pull off her pants, but Melina countered the attack by pulling Wilson's pants off to win the match. Afterward, Michelle stripped Melina and then removed her own clothes, as well.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that an episode of Home and Away featuring Martha and Liam had been was deemed too [...] "raunchy" [...] for New Zealand television. The Broadcasting Standards Authority decided to uphold a complaint about a scene between the characters, which saw them sharing a passionate kiss before Martha showed <b>her</b> <b>bra.</b> The scene was said to be too [...] "sexually charged" [...] for its G rating. This {{was the first time that}} a complaint about Home and Away's sexual content had been upheld. Ray Meagher later defended the scenes stating he didn't understand what all the fuss was about, branding it as tame compared to the scenes involving guns that aired previously.|$|E

500|$|Although Ginsburg did not author the {{majority}} opinion, she {{was credited with}} influencing her colleagues on the case Safford Unified School District v. Redding, [...] The Court ruled that a school went too far in ordering a 13-year-old female student to strip to <b>her</b> <b>bra</b> and underpants so that female officials could search for drugs. In an interview published prior to the Court's decision, Ginsburg shared her view that some of her colleagues did not fully appreciate {{the effect of a}} strip search on a 13-year-old girl. As she pointed out, [...] "They have never been a 13-year-old girl." [...] In an 8–1 decision, the Court agreed that the school's search went too far and violated the Fourth Amendment and allowed the student's lawsuit against the school to go forward. Only Ginsburg and Justice Stevens would have allowed the student to sue individual school officials as well.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, {{attorney}} Britney Horstman {{was barred}} from visiting her client in the Federal Detention Center at Miami, Florida [...] when her underwire bra {{set off the}} metal detector. Although she reminded guards of a detention center memo that permitted female attorneys visiting clients to wear an underwire bra, the guard refused her entry. That memo existed {{as a result of}} an agreement negotiated by the Federal Public Defender's Office, which represents inmates held at the institution before trial. That agreement allows female lawyers entry if her underwire bra is detected by a metal-detecting wand. Horstman removed <b>her</b> <b>bra</b> in a bathroom and returned to the security checkpoint braless, but was then turned away because she did not meet the facility's dress code. Horstman had previously worn an underwire bra into the facility without problems. Warden Linda McGrew later promised the incident would not happen again.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] {{was at the}} Teen Choice Awards held on August 10, 2009. Clothed in a tank top that revealed a portion of <b>her</b> <b>bra,</b> black hot pants, and leather boots, Cyrus and her backup dancers appeared from a trailer. Midway through the performance, Cyrus danced atop an ice cream cart with a pole (which was suggested to be a dance pole by numerous critics) for approximately forty seconds. The performance was met with a media uproar, with some critics suggesting that her dancing was too suggestive and sexual for a teen-oriented event, which caused The Walt Disney Company to issue a statement distancing themselves from the performance. Other critics came to Cyrus' defense, stating that viewers should have fixated on her accomplishments that night, winning six awards, rather than the sexuality of the performance. In continuation, Cyrus promoted the EP on The Today Show and VH1 Divas in the United States. In December, Cyrus undertook promotion in the United Kingdom at 95.8 Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball, the Royal Variety Performance—the annual gala for the British Royal Family— and various other venues.|$|E

30|$|Bivariate {{correlation}} analyses {{between the}} SAM subscales revealed a {{negative correlation between}} Arousal and Valence (r[*]=[*]−[*]. 64, p[*]<[*]. 001), which means that both variables move in opposite directions: the more relaxed the participant feels wearing <b>her</b> favorite <b>bra</b> (low mark in the Arousal subscale), the more pleasant is the sensation of using it (high mark in the Valence subscale). Therefore, pleasant experiences with the bra seem to be often relaxing, not stimulating.|$|R
