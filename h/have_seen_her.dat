Nan's father uses the symbol of the oyster, what he calls a [...] "real queer fish" [...] that exhibits both male and female characteristics, and compares it to Kitty who sits before them in feminine attire though they <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> on stage dressed as a man. The landlady of the boarding house where Kitty and Nan are staying appraises Nan's first male costume, and is troubled by the [...] "queerness" [...] of it because she looks too much like a man, instead of a woman pretending to be a man. Donna Allegra suggests that by using the contemporary term for prostitutes, [...] "gay girls", Waters is winking at her readers.|$|E
