5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. The songs are {{similar to that of}} the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{works of}} Constantin Brâncuși differ {{considerably}} from others through lack of severe planar faceting {{often associated with}} those of prototypical Cubists such as Archipenko, Csaky and Duchamp-Villon (themselves already very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another).</b> However, in common is the tendency toward simplification and abstract representation.|$|E
25|$|The debate focused {{primarily}} {{on the nature of}} the relationship between the civilian and military worlds.

25|$|A few sociologists {{studying}} TCKs, however, {{argue that}} the commonality found in international TCKs is {{not the result of}} true commonality, but rather the researcher's bias projecting expectations upon the studied subculture. They believe that some of the superficial attributes may mirror each other, but that TCKs from different countries are really <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The exteriors may be the same, but that the understanding of the world around them differs.|$|E
25|$|And finally {{when looking}} at the three most {{primitive}} insects with aquatic nymphs (called naiads: Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Plecoptera), each order has its own kind of tracheal gills that are so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> that they must have separate origins. This would be expected if they evolved from land-dwelling species. This means {{that one of the most}} interesting parts of insect evolution is what happened between the Thysanura-Pterygota split and the first flight.|$|E
25|$|Because some {{traits are}} dominant, crossbreed dogs tend to {{manifest}} some physical characteristics {{more frequently than}} others. Border Collies and some Spaniels, for example, often produce crossbreed offspring with similar coats and ears. The crossbreed offspring of German Shepherds often have characteristic Shepherd faces. But all crossbred dogs will vary in which characteristics of their purebred parents that they inherit, and may look very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> even within the same litter of puppies.|$|E

25|$|The Dickman Impulsivity Inventory {{was first}} {{developed}} in 1990 by Scott J. Dickman. This scale {{is based on}} Dickman's proposal {{that there are two}} types of impulsivity that are significantly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> This includes functional impulsivity which is characterized by quick decision making when it is optimal, a trait that is often considered to be a source of pride. The scale also includes dysfunctional impulsivity which is characterized by making quick decisions when it is not optimal. This type of impulsivity is most often associated with life difficulties including substance abuse problems and other negative outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Myers paired ESTJs with ENTJs, ISFPs with INFPs, INTPs with ISTPs, and ENFJs with ESFJs {{because they}} share the same {{dominant}} function attitude. ESTJs and ENTJs are both extraverted thinkers, ISFPs and INFPs are both introverted feelers, INTPs and ISTPs are both introverted thinkers, and ENFJs and ESFJs are both extraverted feelers. Keirsey holds that these same groupings are very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> because they are of different temperaments. ESTJs are Guardians whereas ENTJs are Rationals; ISFPs are Artisans whereas INFPs are Idealists; INTPs are Rationals whereas ISTPs are Artisans; and ENFJs are Idealists whereas ESFJs are Guardians.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the 1977 model year that demand {{exceeded}} production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, {{and as a result}} Oldsmobile began equipping most full size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether there was a difference in quality or performance between the two engines, there was no question that the engines were <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a public relations nightmare for GM.|$|E

500|$|Young did so, {{with two}} results that {{together}} {{paved the way}} for the final decipherment. In the hieroglyphic text, he discovered the phonetic characters [...] "p t o l m e s" [...] (in today's transliteration [...] "p t w l m y s") that were used to write the Greek name [...] "Ptolemaios". He also noticed that these characters resembled the equivalent ones in the Demotic script, and went on to note as many as 80 similarities between the hieroglyphic and Demotic texts on the stone, an important discovery because the two scripts were previously thought to be entirely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> This led him to deduce correctly that the Demotic script was only partly phonetic, also consisting of ideographic characters imitated from hieroglyphs. Young's new insights were prominent in the long article [...] "Egypt" [...] that he contributed to the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1819. He could make no further progress, however.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Baradwaj Rangan {{finds the}} {{sequence}} where Haasan's character, Cheenu, narrates {{the story of}} The Blue Jackal to Sridevi's character, Bhagyalakshmi, to be a distant echo of the arc negotiated by Cheenu: [...] "He is, after all, a nobody [...] who, through a salubrious twist of fate, becomes the ruler of a woman's life, until he is restored, at the end, to the nobody he was, a fraudulent claimant to her emotions." [...] In his book Dispatches from the wall corner: A journey through Indian cinema, Rangan says that although Haasan is inspired by Marlon Brando, the scene where Haasan burns himself while cooking and vents his anger on Sridevi, {{is reminiscent of the}} acting style of Marcel Marceau. In another book of Rangan, Conversations with Mani Ratnam, he states that in the scene where Cheenu enters Bhagyalakshmi's room in the brothel, there was fumbling and embarrassment, whereas in another Haasan film Nayakan (1987), Haasan's character, Velu Nayakar, behaves as if he has visited a brothel before. Nayakans director Mani Ratnam replied by saying that the two scenes are very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and that it [...] "can't be played the same way".|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The {{main point}} of this chapter {{is to show that}} the {{different}} indices used in the mobility literature are not measures of the same underlying conceptual entity. In elementary statistics, students are taught that the mean and median are both measures of central tendency but they are different measures of central tendency; the variance and Gini coefficient are measures of dispersion but they are different measures of dispersion; and central tendency and dispersion are fundamentally <b>different</b> concepts <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> In much the same way, this chapter maintains that the different mobility indices in common use are measuring fundamentally <b>different</b> mobility concepts <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> It is in this sense that mobility really is multifaceted...|$|R
