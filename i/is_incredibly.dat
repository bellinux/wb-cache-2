5|$|A mutant {{criminal}} {{recruited by}} the Brotherhood in a prison truck, Juggernaut <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> strong, fast and, once he gains momentum, he is nearly unstoppable. The film's version of Juggernaut is depicted as a mutant and his relation to Charles Xavier was never mentioned. Matthew Vaughn cast Jones, who he met producing the Guy Ritchie gangster movies where Jones begun his acting career. The actor {{had to go through}} a four-hour make-up process to portray Juggernaut, which included a muscle suit and a prostethic chin. The costume tried to retain the bullet-shaped helmet of the comics without going excessively over the top.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Andromeda Galaxy and its companions, the {{constellation}} also features NGC 891 (Caldwell 23), a smaller galaxy {{just east of}} Almach. It is a barred spiral galaxy seen edge-on, with a dark dust lane visible down the middle. NGC 891 <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> faint and small despite its magnitude of 9.9, as its surface brightness of 14.6 indicates; it is 13.5 by 2.8 arcminutes in size. NGC 891 was discovered by the brother-and-sister team of William and Caroline Herschel in August 1783. This galaxy is at an approximate distance of 30 million light-years from Earth, calculated from its redshift of 0.002.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is growing}} {{increasingly}} jealous of Gabe's relationship with Erin. While observing Gabe's room, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{tells him that}} a Chinese virility supplement that Gabe keeps in his room <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> potent. Once alone Andy drinks the entire bottle of the supplement, which makes him intoxicated, prompting him to admit his jealousy to Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith). Phyllis volunteers to talk to Erin and find out if she is having sex with Gabe, but as Phyllis is fairly intoxicated herself, her inquiries segue into an explicit account of her sexual experiences with her husband Bob, which mortifies Erin. Andy's intoxication turns into sickness, and he ultimately retreats to Gabe's room and vomits on the bed.|$|E
5|$|In Half-Life 2, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of Dr. Gordon Freeman. Throughout the game, the player follows the story of a dark, dystopian future in which mankind has been enslaved by the Combine, a mysterious alien enemy. In contrast, Concerned follows the same general path through the story {{established}} by Half-Life 2, but instead follows the adventures of Gordon Frohman, a hapless, lethally clumsy oaf who arrives in City 17 a few weeks before Freeman. Frohman <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> naïve and, unlike the other citizens, seems to enjoy living under the rule of the totalitarian administrator, Dr. Breen, and the Combine. He holds an insane reverence for the latter, even going to the point of having a plush doll of a Combine soldier.|$|E

50|$|The stories {{tell the}} adventures of the two Big Knights, Sir Boris and Sir Morris, who <b>are</b> <b>incredibly</b> strong and brave, but <b>are</b> also <b>incredibly</b> stupid.

5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots {{who live on}} the planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots who seek to kill one another for no apparent reason. Slightly less horrific than their peers, the duo seek to make it through high school, and navigate their lives with mixed results. Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest to be cool, however, he <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E

25|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> {{defensive}} and, as {{with most}} tarantulas, should not be held. The bite of this species, while not serious, is extremely painful. Moreover, the species is {{more than willing to}} inflict such a bite before presenting the typical threat display. Caution when dealing with this species is advised.|$|E

25|$|Ythogtha is {{the second}} son of Cthulhu and resembles a gigantic, {{humanoid}} frog, or Deep One, with only a single-eye {{in the center of}} his forehead, like a cyclops. A dense mane and a beard of writhing tentacles grows from his head. Although never fully described in Carter's own stories, Ythogtha <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> large; when the sorcerer-priest Zanthu attempts to free Ythogtha from his prison, he mistakes his god's clawed, slimy fingertips for mountainous heads.|$|E

Before them is the entire eccentric spectacle. Apparently, Tony has forgotten for which night dinner was planned, and Alice <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> embarrassed.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} has a chromatic harmony that <b>is</b> <b>incredibly</b> rich, expressive and radiant. On {{the black}} mourning garments of the nobles are projected the gold-embroidered vestments, thus creating an intense ceremonial character. In the heavenly space {{there is a}} predominance of transparent harmonies of iridescence and ivoried greys, which harmonize with the gilded ochres, while in the Madonna's maforium (mantle) deep blue is closely combined with bright red. The rhetoric of the expressions, the glances and the gestural translation make the scene very moving.|$|E
