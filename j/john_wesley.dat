5|$|A form of Protestantism {{known as}} Methodism {{is the third}} largest Christian {{practice}} and grew out of Anglicanism through <b>John</b> <b>Wesley.</b> It gained popularity in the mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and amongst tin miners in Cornwall. There are other non-conformist minorities, such as Baptists, Quakers, Congregationalists, Unitarians and The Salvation Army.|$|E
5|$|In 1739 <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> {{founded the}} first Methodist chapel, the New Room, in Bristol. Wesley, {{along with his}} brother Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, preached to large congregations in Bristol and the {{neighbouring}} village of Kingswood, often in the open air.|$|E

5|$|St Botolph's Aldersgate was {{a wealthy}} parish, having been granted {{the assets of}} the nearby Cluniac priory and {{hospital}} during the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries. The parish was historically a significant place of worship, possibly best known as the site of the evangelical conversions of <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> and Charles Wesley.|$|E
5|$|American {{inventor}} <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
5|$|Anti-slavery campaigners, {{inspired}} by Non-conformist preachers such as <b>John</b> <b>Wesley,</b> started {{some of the}} earliest campaigns against the practice. Prominent local opponents of both the trade and the institution of slavery itself included Anne Yearsley, Hannah More, Harry Gandey, Mary Carpenter, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge. The campaign itself proved to be the beginning of movements for reform and women's emancipation.|$|E

5|$|As {{with much}} of England, Chesham {{suffered}} serious religious unrest in the 16th and 17th centuries, and in 1532 Lollard radical Thomas Harding was burnt at the stake in the town for heresy. From the 17th century Chesham was a focus for dissenters. The first Baptist chapel in the town opened in 1701, Quakers have met in Chesham since the late 17th century, and <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> preached in Chesham in the 1760s.|$|E
5|$|In 1852 she put {{her ideas}} into practice, {{establishing}} a reformatory school at Bristol in 1852, in Kingswood in the premises of a school which had originally been set by <b>John</b> <b>Wesley.</b> Originally this was for boys and girls, but she soon decided to separate the sexes {{and set up a}} girls' reformatory in what is now the Red Lodge Museum in 1854, initially funded by Lady Byron.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{scientific}} {{expedition to the}} area was led by U.S. Army Major <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> Powell in 1872. Powell, along {{with a team of}} mapmakers and geologists, surveyed the Sevier and Virgin River area {{as part of a larger}} survey of the Colorado Plateaus. His mapmakers kept many of the Paiute place names.|$|E

5|$|Although quick {{draw and}} hip {{shooting}} {{was an important}} skill in the West, {{only a handful of}} historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> Hardin, Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid. Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Stackpole {{received}} {{a commission to}} sculpt his interpretation of Colorado River explorer <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> Powell, for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior. It {{was to be a}} companion piece to Heinz Warneke's portrayal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of Lewis and Clark {{to be one of them}} on land. Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building's auditorium.|$|E
5|$|<b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> preached in Shakerley four times, between 1748 and 1752, {{laying the}} {{foundations}} for a place of worship. In the 1780s George Whitfield who worked with Wesley early in his ministry also preached there. Tyldesley's first place of worship, Top Chapel {{was built in the}} Square in 1789 for the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion which had broken from the Church of England. Thomas Johnson, gifted the site on the highest point of Tyldesley and Lady Huntingdon, a supporter of Wesley supplied money for building materials. The chapel became known as Top Chapel from its geographical location.|$|E

5|$|Nailsea Methodist Church {{was founded}} in 1789; the first {{building}} opened three years later. In 1914 a new chapel was opened on Silver Street, and a youth club was added in the 1960s. In early 1992 the old church was replaced with a larger, flexible, multi-purpose building and the youth club was refurbished and renamed the Wesley Centre after Methodism’s founder, <b>John</b> <b>Wesley.</b> There is also Nailsea Baptist Church, the Catholic Church of St Francis of Assisi, Southfield Church, the United Reformed Church and the Community Church.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol Corporation of the Poor was {{established}} {{at the end of}} the 17th century and a workhouse, to provide work for the poor and shelter for those needing charity, {{was established}}, adjacent to the Bridewell. <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> founded the very first Methodist Chapel, The New Room in Broadmead in 1739, which is still in use in the 21st century. Wesley had come to Bristol at the invitation of George Whitfield. He preached in the open air to miners and brickworkers in Kingswood and Hanham.|$|E
5|$|After {{most of the}} Colorado River basin {{became part}} of the U.S. in 1846, the bulk of the river's course was still the subject of myths and speculation. Several expeditions charted the Colorado in the mid-19thcentury – one of which, led by <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> Powell, was the first to run the rapids of the Grand Canyon. American explorers {{collected}} valuable information that was later used to develop the river for navigation and water supply. Large-scale settlement of the lower basin began in the mid- to late-19thcentury, with steamboats providing transportation from the Gulf of California to landings along the river that linked to wagon roads to the interior. Lesser numbers settled in the upper basin, which was the scene of major gold strikes in the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E

5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
5|$|By war's end, Black Hawk and {{nineteen}} {{other leaders}} of the British Band were incarcerated at Jefferson Barracks. Most of the prisoners were released in the succeeding months, but in April 1833, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, Neapope, and three others were transferred to Fort Monroe in Virginia, which was better equipped to hold prisoners. The American public was eager {{to catch a glimpse}} of the captured Indians. Large crowds gathered in Louisville and Cincinnati to watch them pass. On April 26, the prisoners met briefly with President Jackson in Washington, D.C., before being taken to Fort Monroe. Even in prison they were treated as celebrities: they posed for portraits by artists such as Charles Bird King and <b>John</b> <b>Wesley</b> Jarvis, and a dinner was held in their honor before they left.|$|E
5|$|Later, in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the likes}} of <b>John</b> <b>Wesley,</b> Thomas de Quincey and Benjamin Disraeli the latter of which was MP for Shrewsbury 1841–47, would visit the town. Charles Dickens once also visited to present a series of lectures at the Music Hall, staying at the Lion Hotel. However, in this period the town's most {{prolific}} literary figure and famous son was born – Charles Darwin. Darwin was educated at Shrewsbury School and later, {{with the development of}} his 1859 work On the Origin of Species became the preeminent naturalist of the 19th century. Although Darwin's work was both revolutionary and highly controversial at the time, his teachings and beliefs have become ever more globalised and he is today widely recognised as the father of the modern theory of evolution.|$|E
