5|$|The rank of {{a matrix}} A is {{the maximum number}} of linearly {{independent}} row vectors of the matrix, which is the same as {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent column vectors. Equivalently it is the <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image of the linear map represented by A. The rank–nullity theorem states that the <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns of the matrix.|$|E

The four Links learn that not only have the knights of Hyrule mysteriously disappeared, but evil versions of them have been creating havoc.

5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one {{can think of}} a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E

5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
