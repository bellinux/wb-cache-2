5|$|A {{fresh look}} at this concept started at ARPA around 1963â€“64 under the name <b>Hardpoint.</b> This led to the {{construction}} of the <b>Hardpoint</b> Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Singaporean Hunter fleet was {{upgraded}} and modified by Lockheed Aircraft Services Singapore (LASS) {{with an additional}} <b>hardpoint</b> under the forward fuselage and another two inboard pylons (wired only for AIM-9 Sidewinders) before the main gears, bringing {{to a total of}} seven hardpoints for external stores and weapons delivery. As a result of these upgrades, they were redesignated as FGA.74S, FR.74S and T.75S. The RSAF Black Knights, Singapore Air Force's aerobatic team, flew Hunters from 1973 until 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} performing dive bombing, and could be fitted with a single bomb or depth charge on a <b>hardpoint</b> under each wing for the mission, or for anti-submarine warfare. Gun armament consisted of two M2 Browning machine guns, one mounted in a fixed position firing forwards through the propeller using synchronizer gear, while the other was in a flexible position in the observer's cockpit for rear defense.|$|E
50|$|At {{least one}} aircraft, the SEPECAT Jaguar, had some {{versions}} fitted with overwing <b>hardpoints</b> for air-to-air missiles, {{instead of putting}} them on the wingtips. These overwing <b>hardpoints</b> were the same lateral from the aircraft's centerline as the innermost pair of underwing <b>hardpoints.</b>|$|R
5|$|Six {{external}} <b>hardpoints</b> {{were located}} {{along the bottom}} of the helicopter, with two under each wing and two on the fuselage under the sponsons. The two inner wing <b>hardpoints</b> could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing <b>hardpoints.</b> The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing <b>hardpoints</b> were also plumbed to allow the carriage of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} change in the F-16, the Block 15 {{aircraft}} featured larger horizontal stabilizers, the addition of two <b>hardpoints</b> to the chin inlet, an improved AN/APG-66(V)2 radar, and increased capacity for the underwing <b>hardpoints.</b> The Block 15 also gained the Have Quick II secure UHF radio. To counter the additional weight of the new <b>hardpoints,</b> the horizontal stabilizers were enlarged by 30%. Block 15 is the most numerous variant of the F-16, with 983 produced. The last one was delivered in 1996 to Thailand.|$|R
5|$|Five Vulcans were {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} operation. In order to do so, each aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an ECM pod and Shrike anti-radar missiles at wing <b>hardpoint</b> locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work to retrofit these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.|$|E
5|$|The JF-17 has a {{defensive}} aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite {{housed in a}} fairing {{at the tip of}} the tail fin interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors of missiles across a 360-degree coverage. Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A countermeasures dispensing system releases decoy flares and chaff to help evade hostile radar and missiles. The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a <b>hardpoint.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra <b>hardpoint</b> may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.|$|E

50|$|JH-7A - Later {{production}} utilising {{composite structure}} to reduce weight, improved flying control system and improved avionics including the JL10A Shan Ying J-band Pulse-Doppler radar. Weapon loads increased {{by the addition}} of two more wing <b>hardpoints</b> and two <b>hardpoints</b> under the intake trunking for mission pods such as targeting pods.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the UK, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra <b>hardpoint</b> per wing, and other structural and aerodynamic refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before {{ordering}} the XF11C-1, the Navy {{had bought a}} company-owned Model 64A demonstrator. This had a Wright R-1820-78 Cyclone engine, slightly longer main landing-gear legs carrying wheels with low-pressure tires, a tailwheel {{in place of the}} tailskid, fabric-covered control surfaces on the tail, and external provision for underwing racks for light bombs as well as an under-fuselage <b>hardpoint</b> for either a 50gal (189l) fuel tank or the crutch that would swing a bomb clear of the propeller disc before release in a dive-bombing attack.|$|E
25|$|Even {{within the}} {{development}} stages, a Hawk variant {{was intended to}} {{also serve as a}} single-seat ground-attack fighter; both the trainer and fighter models were developed with the export market in mind. On single seat models, the forward cockpit area which normally houses a pilot is replaced by an electronics bay for avionics and onboard systems, including a fire control computer, multi-mode radar, laser rangefinder and forward-looking infrared (FLIR). Some export customers, such as Malaysia, have extensive modifications to their aircraft, including the addition of wingtip <b>hardpoint</b> stations and a fittable inflight refuelling probe.|$|E

50|$|The SAAF's Bosboks {{had four}} underwing <b>hardpoints</b> {{from which a}} variety of {{ordnance}} could be hung, including machine gun pods, light bombs and smoke-rocket pods. Each of the two inner <b>hardpoints</b> was stressed for a 170 kg (375 lb) load, with the two outer points being stressed for a 91 kg (200 lb) load.|$|R
50|$|An armed {{advanced}} trainer with light-attack {{and forward}} air control capabilities. Several new features {{unique to the}} KA-1 are a head-up display and up-front control panel, MFD panels, and five <b>hardpoints,</b> two under each wing and one under the fuselage. The <b>hardpoints</b> may be equipped with rocket launchers, gun pods or AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles.|$|R
25|$|ARPA {{released}} its <b>Hardpoint</b> study in 1965. It presented {{a way for}} the Army to offer an effective ABM system at a reasonable cost. At the same time, it would ensure that the Air Force's missiles would survive any sort of small-scale attack envisioned by the military planners. This led to a series of Army-Air Force studies under the name Hardsite. Hardsite initially considered the idea of using the existing Nike-X hardware being proposed around large cities to deliberately offer additional protection to Air Force and other military bases in the area. A second series of studies considered cut-down deployments to protect remote bases, like the missile fields. This later concept quickly captured the majority of follow-up work.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and reinstallation of the tool or jig is desirable, screwing into the wood of the benchtop with woodscrews or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a <b>hardpoint.</b> Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|E
25|$|Various munitions {{could be}} {{mounted on the}} one {{centerline}} and four under-wing hardpoints, including bombs, missiles and rockets; payloads of up to 2,000 lb may be carried upon the centerline and the two innermost under-wing pylons, while the outer pylons can carry up to 1,000 lb. All four of the under-wing hardpoints are plumbed for drop tanks to extend the aircraft's range, Italian aircraft are also fitted with a fixed aerial refueling probe. Optical reconnaissance pods can be carried externally on the centerline <b>hardpoint.</b> Wingtip rails are provided for infrared guided air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and MAA-1 Piranha. Italian aircraft are fitted with a M61 Vulcan 20mm rotary cannon {{on the port side}} of the lower fuselage. The United States denied the sale of the M61 to Brazil, thus its AMXs are instead fitted with two 30mm DEFA 554 revolver cannons.|$|E

25|$|The Alpha Jet was {{designed}} to perform a diverse range of roles. The principal users of the type, Germany and France, operated their Alpha Jets in different capacities, the former as a ground attack platform and the latter as a trainer aircraft. Beyond performing different roles, the Alpha Jet fleets of France and Germany noticeably differed in their specification and equipment; German aircraft were fitted with a more extensive weapon-aiming system, a different fuel system, a yaw damper, different brakes, nosewheel steering, an arrester hook, and Stencel ejector seats in place of Martin-Baker. According to aerospace publication Flight International, {{the majority of the}} specialised equipment used on the ground attack-orientated variant of the Alpha Jet was provided by German firms. In addition to the ground attack role, the Luftwaffe also employed the Alpha Jet in the electronic countermeasures (ECM) and aerial reconnaissance roles; for the latter purpose, a reconnaissance pod could be fitted upon the port <b>hardpoint.</b>|$|E
25|$|P-63A-8, SN 269261, was {{extensively}} {{tested at}} TsAGI {{in what was}} then the world's largest wind tunnel. Soviet input was significant. With the Soviet Union being the largest buyer of the aircraft, Bell was quick to implement their suggestions. The vast majority of the changes in the A sub-variants were a direct result of Soviet input, e.g. increased pilot armor and fuselage <b>hardpoint</b> on the A-5, underwing hardpoints and extra fuel tanks on the A-6, etc. The Soviet Union even experimented with ski landing gear for the P-63A-6, but this never reached production. Most significantly, Soviet input resulted in moving the main cannon forward, favorably changing the center of gravity, and increasing its ammo load from 30 to 58 rounds for the A-9 variant. The P-63 had an impressive roll rate, besting the Americans' P-47, P-40, and P-51â€”and the Japanese Navy's Kawanishi N1K2 Shiden-Kai fighterâ€”with a rate of 110Â° per second at 275mph (443km/h).|$|E
25|$|Essentially {{similar to}} the P-47B, the initial P-47C {{featured}} strengthened all-metal control surfaces, an upgraded GE turbosupercharger regulator, and a short vertical radio mast. After the initial manufacture of a block of 57 P-47Cs, production moved to the P-47C-1, which had an 8in (20cm) fuselage extension forward of the cockpit at the firewall to correct center of gravity problems, ease engine maintenance and allow installation of a new engine mount. There {{were a number of}} other changes, such as revised exhausts for the oil coolers, and fixes to brakes, undercarriage and electrical systems, as well as a redesigned rudder and elevator balance. The 55 P-47C-1s were followed by 128 P-47C-2s which introduced a centerline <b>hardpoint</b> with under-fuselage shackles for either a 500lb (227kg) bomb or a 200U.S. gal (758l, 167Imp gal) fuel tank that conformed to the underside of the fuselage. The main production P-47C sub-variant was the P-47C-5 which introduced a new whip antenna. With the use of pressurized drop tanks, the P-47C was able to extend its range on missions beginning 30 July 1943.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, the Sniper XR {{targeting}} pod was integrated on the B-1 fleet. The pod {{is mounted}} on an external <b>hardpoint</b> at the aircraft's chin near the forward bomb bay. Following accelerated testing, the Sniper pod was fielded in summer 2008. Future precision munitions include the Small Diameter Bomb. [...] In 2011, the Air Force was considering upgrading B-1s with multiple ejector racks {{so that they can}} carry three times as many smaller JDAMs than previously.|$|E
500|$|While the F-22 {{typically}} carries weapons internally, {{the wings}} include four hardpoints, each rated to handle [...] Each <b>hardpoint</b> can accommodate a pylon that {{can carry a}} detachable 600-gallon (2,270 L) external fuel tank or a launcher holding two air-to-air missiles; the two inboard hardpoints are [...] "plumbed" [...] for external fuel tanks. The use of external stores degrades the aircraft's stealth and kinematic performance; after releasing stores the external attachments can be jettisoned to restore those characteristics. A stealthy ordnance pod and pylon was being developed to carry additional weapons in the mid-2000s.|$|E
500|$|The JF-17 can {{be armed}} {{with up to}} [...] of air-to-air and {{air-to-ground}} weaponry, and other equipment mounted externally on the aircraft's seven hardpoints.
