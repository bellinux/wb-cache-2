5|$|<b>Jerusalem</b> is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention <b>Jerusalem</b> by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to <b>Jerusalem.</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of <b>Jerusalem</b> to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of <b>Jerusalem</b> inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of <b>Jerusalem</b> in Islam.|$|E

5|$|A seventh-century Armenian chronicler {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} seventy Armenian monasteries in Palestine, {{some of which have}} been revealed in excavations. The Byzantines ceded <b>Jerusalem</b> to the Rashidun Caliphate after a siege in 637. Until this point, <b>Jerusalem</b> had a single Christian bishop. In 638, Armenians established their own archbishop, Abraham I. He was officially recognized by Rashidun Caliph Umar. The foundation of the Armenian migration to <b>Jerusalem</b> thus solidified. In the 12th century, around one thousand Armenians moved to <b>Jerusalem</b> with the Crusaders, presumably mainly from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.|$|E

5|$|After the First Crusade's {{capture of}} <b>Jerusalem</b> and victory at Ascalon the {{majority}} of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe. Godfrey was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only Tancred of the crusader princes remained with the aim of establishing his own lordship. At this point the Franks held only <b>Jerusalem</b> and two great Syrian cities; Antioch and Edessa but not the surrounding country. <b>Jerusalem</b> remained economically sterile despite the advantages of being the centre of administration of church and state and benefitting from streams of pilgrims.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of {{widespread}} and determined Turkish counterattacks fought from 27 November to 1 December by the 7th Turkish Army they evacuated <b>Jerusalem.</b> Troops from the Australian Mounted Division were the first mounted troops to enter <b>Jerusalem</b> in December 1917. Towards the end of December the British Empire forces at the Battle of Jaffa and the Defence of <b>Jerusalem</b> succeeded in pushing the Turkish armies north. A strong British defensive line was established which remained in place until mid September 1918. The line stretched across from well north of the Nahr el Auja on the Mediterranean coast {{in the west to}} north and east of <b>Jerusalem.</b> It was extended during the middle of February 1918 when Jericho in the Jordan Valley was captured and the eastern end of the line was secured on the Dead Sea.|$|E

5|$|British General Edmund Allenby, Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), had won {{a decisive}} victory against the German General Erich von Falkenhayn, {{commander}} of Ottoman forces in Palestine, at the Battle of Mughar Ridge on 13 November. The British Empire victory forced von Falkenhayn to withdraw his Seventh and Eighth Armies (commanded by Fevzi Pasha and Kress von Kressenstein respectively) and move his headquarters from <b>Jerusalem</b> to Nablus on 14 November. As the Ottoman III Corps (Seventh Army) reached <b>Jerusalem</b> via the Hebron road after its defeat at Beersheba, it was ordered to develop defences around <b>Jerusalem.</b> This corps held the city while the XX Corps retreated from Junction Station into the Judean Hills towards <b>Jerusalem.</b> As they retired the XX Corps left strong rearguards to stop or slow the British advance. Time was needed to construct defences and for reorganisation of the depleted and disorganised Seventh Army. When they arrived in the city XX Corps took over responsibility for Jerusalem's defences, while III Corps continued to move northwards from <b>Jerusalem</b> along the Nablus road.|$|E

5|$|Having {{captured}} <b>Jerusalem</b> and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} many who had gone home before reaching <b>Jerusalem,</b> and many who had never left Europe at all.

Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to <b>Jerusalem</b> also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, {{there were only a few}} hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of <b>Jerusalem.</b>|$|E
