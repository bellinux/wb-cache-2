Parker cast Bonet based on the strength of her audition and was unaware of her role on The Cosby Show. On preparing {{for the role}}, Bonet said, [...] "I did a lot of meditation and a lot of self-inquiry. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> research on voodoo.

[...] Parker had difficulty finding an actress {{for the role of}} Margaret Krusemark, until Rourke suggested English actress Charlotte Rampling.

2500|$|He [...] had {{a little}} Wild West {{aggregation}} that visited the camps and did a tremendous business. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> roping and riding, and Jack, {{who was one of}} the smartest showmen I ever knew, took a great interest in me. It was he who gave me the idea for my original stage act with my pony. I learned a lot about the show business from him. He could do a bum act with a rope that an ordinary man couldn't get away with, and make the audience think it was great, so I used to study him by the hour, and from him I learned the great secret of the show business—knowing when to get off. It's the fellow who knows when to quit that the audience wants more of.|$|E
2500|$|Brando cited Burn! (1969) as his {{personal}} {{favorite of the}} films he had made, writing in his autobiography, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> of the best acting I've ever done in that picture, but few people came to see it." [...] Brando dedicated a full chapter to the film in his memoir, stating that the director, Gillo Pontecorvo, was the best director he had ever worked with next to Kazan and Bernardo Bertolucci. Brando also detailed his clashes with Pontecorvo on the set and how [...] "we nearly killed each other."

In 1971, Michael Winner directed him in the British horror film The Nightcomers with Stephanie Beacham, Thora Hird, Harry Andrews and Anna Palk. It is a prequel to The Turn of the Screw, which later became the 1961 film The Innocents. Brando's performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor BAFTA, but the film bombed at the box office.|$|E

This is not how you should approach somebody whos been showing you guys free love". Hamilton also talked about how mental illness and drug use didn't {{have anything to do with}} him taking a step back from music stating [...] "People were blaming insanity because certain details didn't hit the surface, but it had nothing to do with drugs, it had nothing to do with alcohol". Hamilton also discussed about his former deal with Interscope Records stating [...] "MC Lyte said it best it was a fight to get me off Interscope. I put out more projects than the entire Interscope roster from 2008 to 2010, and it took Eminem to come out and trump that, as far as getting physical sales numbers. Interscope had to choose between traditional and the new wave, and I said this new wave costs yall less money and less compromise but it took people on the inside to say to Interscope yall don't know what you're doing with this kid. A lot of the inner workings weren't made clear to me, and I took it very personally". On December 21, 2012 Hamilton released his extended play entitled The Come Down.|$|E
