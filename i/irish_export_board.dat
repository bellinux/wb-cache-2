Walsh was {{the founder}} of KDW and Chief Executive of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta (CTT) or <b>Irish</b> <b>Export</b> <b>Board.</b> He had a vision for {{improving}} standards of design in industry to encourage commerce, trade and export. Walsh also realised the importance of design for the Irish market and how the existing situation in Ireland in the early 1960s (including protective tariffs) meant that a strategy {{would be required to}} encourage appreciation and promotion of good design.|$|E
40|$|The {{publication}} of Design in Ireland: Report of the Scandinavian Design Group in Ireland in 1962 {{has been described}} as providing the catalyst for change in the approach to design in Ireland. The Report was commissioned by the <b>Irish</b> <b>Export</b> <b>Board</b> and the Scandinavian Design Group was formed for this purpose. It stimulating protracted debate on design education in Ireland, and also afforded a reason for the establishment of the Kilkenny Design Workshops. This paper, which draws on unpublished material from a number of archives, will provide a brief overview of the Report and the rational for commissioning it, followed by an examination of government interventions to improve design standards in Ireland from the founding of the State until the 1960 s. It will examine the origins of Scandinavian influence on the evolution of public policy on design in Ireland, question if the Report expanded the discourse on design in industry in Ireland and assess its influence {{during the early years of}} the Workshops...|$|E

40|$|We analyse {{the long-run}} and short-run {{relationship}} between merchandise export volume and its determinants, foreign income, relative prices and exchange rate volatility. The <b>Irish</b> <b>export</b> sector is dualistic, with relatively smaller indigenous firms dominating the more low technology production sectors, while larger subsidiaries of foreign owned multinationals tend {{to dominate the}} more high technology sectors. Given the dualistic nature of the <b>Irish</b> <b>export</b> sector, it was considered appropriate to estimate, {{in addition to a}} general export function, a separate function for sectors. This allows to draw conclusions about the effect of volatility on different types of enterprises. The model was estimated for <b>Irish</b> <b>exports</b> and sectoral exports SITC 0 - 4 and SITC 5 - 8 to the EU using quarterly data for the period 1979 - 1992. The sectoral classification corresponds to the exports of mainly indigenous Irish firms and multinationals, respectively. We find that the exchange rate volatility has no effect on the volume of trade in the short-run but a significant positive effect in the long run. This is true in the aggregate and for our sectoral classifications. Our results have important policy implications arising from Ireland’s participation in the EMU since the launch of the single European currency on 1 January, 1999. They allow us to tentatively conclude that the decline in intra-EU exchange rate volatility associated with the single currency may lead to a long-run fall in <b>Irish</b> <b>exports</b> to the EU. ...|$|R

5000|$|Ireland's {{new right}} to free trade led to a dispute with Portugal in 1780-87; <b>Irish</b> <b>exports</b> were embargoed while English exports were not.

40|$|This paper uses a {{gravity model}} {{approach}} {{in order to}} analyse the geographical patterns of <b>Irish</b> <b>exports.</b> The gravity model in international trade has been demonstrated to be an extremely robust empirical method. The gravity model is first applied to aggregate <b>Irish</b> <b>exports</b> from 1980 to 2007. Distance is {{found to have a}} strong negative effect on exports. On the other hand, exports are positively related to sharing a common language and when communications infrastructure is well developed. The gravity model is shown to fit the data extremely well. We then use firm-level data on indigenous Irish exporters to divide the effects of trade costs into how they influence the number of firms exporting to each market and the average exports per firm. Finally the firm data is divided into four broad sectors to examine if there is any sectoral variation in the standard results. ...|$|R

British banknotes (British Treasury notes, Bank of England notes), and notes issued by Irish banks circulated (but only the first were legal tender) and coins remained in circulation.|$|R
