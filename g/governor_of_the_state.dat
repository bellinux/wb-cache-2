5|$|Eleven {{people have}} served as <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> of Alaska over 13 {{distinct}} terms, though Alaska had over 30 civilian and military governors during its long history as a United States territory. Only two governors, William Allen Egan and Bill Walker, were born in Alaska. Two people, Egan and Wally Hickel, have been elected to multiple non-consecutive terms as governor. Hickel is also noted for a rare third party win in American politics, having been elected to a term in 1990 representing the Alaskan Independence Party. The longest-serving <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> was Egan, who was elected three times and served nearly 12 years. The longest-serving territorial governor was Ernest Gruening, who served 13½ years.|$|E
5|$|By November 15, the Gazette claimed {{victory for}} Brooks. By the next day, {{because of the}} {{irregularities}} and votes that would be thrown out, the projected winner was Baxter, by only 3,000 votes. The General Assembly met on January6 for a special joint session to declare Baxter, who by their count had received the most votes, the legal winner of the election. After a short address he was sworn in by Chief Justice John McClure. He then assumed the duties of <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{traveled}} to Blue Lick Springs for his health {{soon after the}} election, but {{was too weak to}} return to Frankfort for the inauguration. A Bourbon County justice of the peace administered the oath of office on September 5, 1816 at the springs. Madison's only official act of office was the appointment of Colonel Charles S. Todd as secretary of state. He died on October 14, 1816, just weeks into his term, the first <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> to die in office. He is buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Miguel's brother José Treviño Morales {{was arrested}} on 12 June 2012 by a {{combined}} U.S. federal task force. He has been indicted {{as one of the}} money launderers for the Zetas through an Oklahoma-based American Quarter Horse racing operation. His nephew Alejandro Treviño Chávez was killed during a shootout in the state of Coahuila on 5 October 2012 by a law enforcement group; in response, Miguel ordered the murder of José Eduardo Moreira, nephew of governor of Coahuila Rubén Moreira, and son of Humberto Moreira (<b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> of Coahuila from 2005 to 2011).|$|E
5|$|Orozco, who {{saw himself}} as being {{instrumental}} in Madero's victory over Díaz, was merely appointed as a commander of the rurales in Chihuahua, which increased his resentment. When he tried to run for <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> Madero supported his opponent, Abraham González and eventually pressured Orozco {{to drop out of}} the race. When, in the aftermath of the Plan of Ayala, Madero ordered Orozco to lead federal troops to suppress Zapata, Orozco refused. In March 1912, Orozco issued his Plan of Empacadora and formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero.|$|E
5|$|After Indian Independence, Mysore city {{remained}} {{as part of}} the Mysore State, now known as Karnataka. Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, then king of Mysore, was allowed to retain his titles and was nominated as the Rajapramukh (appointed <b>governor)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> He died in September 1974 and was cremated in Mysore city. Over the years, Mysore became well known as a centre for tourism; the city remained largely peaceful, except for occasional riots related to the Kaveri river water dispute. Among the events that took place in Mysore and made national headlines were a fire at a television studio that claimed 62 lives in 1989, and the sudden deaths of many animals at the Mysore Zoo.|$|E

The Chief Justices are ranked fourteenth (in their state) and seventeenth (outside their state) in the Indian order of precedence.

5|$|President Roosevelt {{personally}} visited Kentucky {{to campaign}} on Barkley's behalf on July 8, 1938. As <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> Chandler {{was on hand}} to greet Roosevelt on his arrival in Covington. Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley {{in the back seat}} of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to Latonia Race Track, the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks.|$|E

Traditionally, the governor always selects the candidate with the largest number of votes, but it retains the power to choose a different one should it decide to do so. The rector serves for a term of 4 years before a new election is held, and can not be reelected in the following term. Zeferino Vaz was the first rector and held the position for 12 years until his mandatory retirement.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time the attack on the city would mark {{the first time that the}} revolutionary army would confront federal forces in a regular battle rather than relying on guerrilla tactics. While the fusion of Madero's, Villa's and Orozco's men did result in a number of troops {{sufficient}} to form a force capable of fighting professional soldiers in pitched encounters, the federal troops still had the advantage in terms of training and discipline. The government, in fact, had a good chance of squashing the rebels by moving troops down from the state capital of Ciudad Chihuahua and capturing Madero in a pincer movement. However, the Díaz-appointed <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> Miguel Ahumada, was worried that if the soldiers abandoned the capital unrest would break out and the insurrection would spread. As a further sign of the apparent demoralization of federal rank-and-file soldiers (many of whom had been forcibly conscripted and actually sympathized with the revolutionaries), the troops in Ciudad Chihuahua decided to stay put.|$|E
5|$|Louisville's Courier-Journal {{carried an}} {{announcement}} of Blackburn's candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Kentucky on February 11, 1878. It {{is not clear}} why, with only meager prior political experience, he decided to seek the office. He may {{have been influenced by}} the members of his family who were involved in politics. His brother Joseph was, at the time, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and another brother, James, had served in the Kentucky Senate. Two of his wife's brothers also held political office; Samuel Churchill was Secretary of State under Governors John L. Helm, John W. Stevenson, and Preston Leslie, and Thomas Churchill served as treasurer and later <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of Arkansas. Whatever the reason, even his friends did not believe his announcement was wise due to his political inexperience. He opened his campaign with a speech in Owen County on March 29, 1878.|$|E
5|$|After India gained independence, the Nizam {{declared}} {{his intention to}} remain independent rather than {{become part of the}} Indian Union. The Hyderabad State Congress, {{with the support of the}} Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India, began agitating against Nizam VII in 1948. On 17 September that year, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed Operation Polo. With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing an Instrument of Accession, which made him the Rajpramukh (Princely <b>Governor)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> until 31 October 1956. Between 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the Telangana uprising against the feudal lords of the Telangana region. The Constitution of India, which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the part B states of India, with Hyderabad city continuing to be the capital. In his 1955 report Thoughts on Linguistic States, B. R. Ambedkar, then chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution, proposed designating the city of Hyderabad as the second capital of India because of its amenities and strategic central location. Since 1956, the Rashtrapati Nilayam in Hyderabad has been the second official residence and business office of the President of India; the President stays once a year in winter and conducts official business particularly relating to Southern India.|$|E
