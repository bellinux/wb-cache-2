5000|$|... #Caption: Chain {{tensioner}} for {{a bicycle}} with an <b>internal</b> <b>gearbox</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Examples {{of common}} <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> used are 20, 40, 116, 130, and 140:1.|$|R
5000|$|Honda was {{protective}} of the <b>internal</b> <b>gearbox</b> technology, often requiring mechanics {{to remove the}} gearbox from the bicycle after use.|$|R
50|$|Downhill bikes {{usually have}} a chain guide to prevent {{accidental}} chain deraillment. Some manufacturers are experimenting with <b>internal</b> <b>gearboxes</b> for improved reliability.|$|R
50|$|Currently BlueMotion in Brazil {{focuses on}} reduced rolling {{resistance}} and taller <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios,</b> among other changes.|$|R
5000|$|Single rotor, , (max) [...] at 7800 rpm, (cruise) [...] at 6900 rpm, <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> 3.23:1, 33 kg {{dry weight}} {{including}} all attached ancillaries, but excluding the exhaust ...|$|R
50|$|Power for the {{accessory}} drive {{is taken from}} the central shaft linking the turbine and compressor sections of the engine. This requires an <b>internal</b> <b>gearbox</b> that couples the drive to a radial driveshaft or towershaft that drives an external gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. - the Virgins of Timo Glock and Lucas di Grassi {{were both}} given {{five-place}} penalties after the team failed {{to notify the}} FIA of changes to their <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> before the deadline for doing so.|$|R
25|$|To make {{best use}} of the limited space for the {{driveshaft}} and <b>internal</b> <b>gearbox,</b> the driveshaft runs at high speed, thus allowing it to be of small diameter. This reduces the disruption to the airflow {{and the size of}} the hollow fairing that encloses it.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the <b>internal</b> <b>gearbox</b> is {{complicated}} by the heat and small space available in which to connect the driveshaft. It is usually placed between the compressor outlet and the combustor. In turboprops or designs with centrifugal compressors, it may be placed ahead of the compressor.|$|R
5000|$|... 1980: July: The CX 2400 engine {{receives}} a horsepower and torque performance increase. 5-speed gearboxes are standard fitting on the Athena and CX Diesel, Super and Pallas. New <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> for the CX Estate, GTi and Prestige. Rear aerodynamic spoiler fitted to the CX GTi.|$|R
50|$|Sally Baldwin died 28 October 2003 at Tiburtina Station, Rome, Italy. The {{moving walkway}} she was {{travelling}} along {{at the station}} collapsed and she was crushed in the <b>internal</b> <b>gearbox.</b> It is believed that maintenance work on the walkway had resulted in several panels not being replaced properly, resulting in the accident.|$|R
5000|$|In {{aircraft}} applications, such {{an accessory}} drive {{may be used}} in conjunction with a constant speed drive. Jet aircraft have four types of PTO units: <b>internal</b> <b>gearbox,</b> external gearbox, radial drive shaft, and bleed air, which are used to power engine accessories. In some cases, aircraft power take-off systems also provide for putting power into the engine during engine start. See also Coffman starter ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} a modern {{multi-valve}} piston-engine for small aircraft is the Austro Engine AE300. This liquid-cooled turbocharged 2.0-liter (1,991 cc) DOHC 16-valve straight-4 diesel engine uses common rail direct fuel injection and delivers [...] at 3,880 rpm (62.0 kW/liter). The propeller is driven by an integrated <b>gearbox</b> (<b>ratio</b> 1.69:1) with torsional vibration damper. Total power unit weight is 185 kg.|$|R
5000|$|The car has a four-cylinder [...] engine {{from the}} saloon, {{but with a}} raised {{compression}} ratio. However, since it was developed from the saloon platform, it suffered from rigidity compromises despite extra side members in the chassis. The <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> were changed, and from 1954 an overdrive unit became standard. The gearchange lever was column-mounted. A true open 2-seater there were no external door handles or wind-up windows.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the use of}} {{front-wheel drive}} layouts, the gearbox and final drive are {{combined}} into a single transaxle. There {{is no longer a}} drive shaft between them and so the notion of [...] "direct drive" [...] isn't applicable. Although [...] "overdrive" [...] is still referred to, this is now mostly a marketing term to refer to any extra-high ratio for efficient cruising, whether it is achieved through the <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios,</b> or by an unusually high final drive.|$|R
50|$|Tokyo Marui's airsoft replicas {{were made}} {{primarily}} from ABS plastic bodies, but also used metal parts where needed. Their more recent models, {{such as the}} Type 89 rifle and AK-74M have had full metal externals. The <b>internal</b> <b>gearboxes</b> of these guns are primarily powered by rechargeable batteries. A standard, unmodified Tokyo Marui gearbox will fire 0.2 g Airsoft pellets at around 240 to 300 ft/s (around 0.8-0.9 J) depending on the model. These gearboxes may be modified for higher performance by the installation of aftermarket parts, but Japanese law limits their power to 0.98 J.|$|R
40|$|Abstract：Based on a {{technique}} of mixed programming with MATLAB and C#, the transmission parameters optimization software {{was developed to}} improve the power performance of off-road vehicle. The power loss rate and the starting acceleration time were chosen as objective function, and {{the requirements of the}} vehicle performance and the <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> interval was used as constraint conditions. The result of verification example showed that both objective function values are reduced after optimization and the effect of optimization with power loss rate is more significant...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Sherco {{modified}} the tuning of the 2.9, 272cc, model; making a more mellow throttle response for better grip in wet conditions. This {{was done by}} increasing {{the volume of the}} cylinder head combustion chamber (lowering the compression ratio) and reducing the cross section area of the transfer ports. Other changes including the new chassis (now painted black rather than chrome plated), new <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> and a new front fork manufacturer. All these changes made the 2006 Sherco more usable for more riders. 2006 also saw the introduction of a Cabestany replica 2.9 model with limited edition graphics.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} needs for a {{transmission}} is to match {{the speed of the}} engine to the speed of the locomotive, so that the engine can work in its useful operating speed range. All locomotives need to deliver high torque from zero rail speed for startup. The overall range of gear ratios required from the transmission thus depends on the maximum speed of the train. The narrower the power band of the engine, the more precise control of <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> is required, either by using a continuously variable transmission or a discrete ratio transmission with more ratios.|$|R

2500|$|In 2004 the Fabia {{received}} a facelift, with changed {{front fog lights}} and grille, slightly different rear lights, new steering wheel and revised specification levels. The RS also had its final <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> changed. Most importantly, the Sport model was added, with the [...] 1.4 petrol being offered with a manual transmission. This engine was quickly dropped for the 1.2 HTP, which while not as powerful, was a much more free revving engine giving a more sporty feel and flexible drive. The Sport also had its specification changed to include red seat belts and sunset privacy glass from the B pillar to the rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of the drivetrain is to couple the engine that produces the power to the driving wheels that use this mechanical power to rotate the axle. This connection involves physically linking the two components, which may be {{at opposite ends of}} the vehicle and so requiring a long propeller shaft or drive shaft. The operating speed of the engine and wheels are also different and must be matched by the correct gear ratio. As the vehicle speed changes, the ideal engine speed must remain approximately constant for efficient operation and so this <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> must also be changed, either manually, automatically or by an automatic continuous variation.|$|R
50|$|The A35 is {{very similar}} in {{appearance}} to the A30, except for a larger rear window aperture and a painted front grille, with chrome horse-shoe surround, instead of the chrome grille on the A30. Both have 13 in wheels. The semaphore turn-signal indicators were replaced with modern front- and rear-mounted flashing lights. A slightly easier to operate remote-control gear-change was provided. Much of the improved performance {{is a result of}} different <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios.</b> The A30 has the first three ratios close together then a big gap to top (fourth gear). The A35's ratios are better spaced and give a higher speed in third gear.|$|R

5000|$|Introduced to {{the market}} in 2003, the Peugeot 206 GTi180 and 206 RC brought high {{performance}} to the product range. The range topping GTi180 {{was brought to the}} UK market, while the 206 RC was introduced to the rest of Europe. The new 'hot hatch' used the 2 litre EW10J4S engine, which produced [...] thanks to variable valve timing and modified inlet and exhaust manifolds. Other features on the 206 GTi180 and 206 RC include 17 inch alloy wheels, racing bucket front seats, a short shift gear linkage and altered <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> (1st & 2nd gears). The new car was capable of reaching 62 mi/h km/h in 7.4 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the early}} {{development}} {{of cars and}} the almost universal rear-wheel drive layout, the final drive (i.e. rear axle) ratio for fast cars was chosen to give the ratio for maximum speed. The gearbox was designed so that, for efficiency, the fastest ratio would be a [...] "direct-drive" [...] or [...] "straight-through" [...] 1:1 ratio, avoiding frictional losses in the gears. Achieving an overdriven ratio for cruising thus required a <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> even higher than this, i.e. the gearbox output shaft rotating faster than the engine. The propeller shaft linking gearbox and rear axle is thus overdriven, and a transmission capable of doing this became termed an [...] "overdrive" [...] transmission.|$|R
50|$|The 604 was {{launched}} in March 1975, at the Geneva Motor Show. It was originally available in a single specification, as the 604 SL. In 1977, the 604 {{was launched}} in the US in carbureted V6 SL trim, with twin rectangular headlights and larger bumpers. In September, the somewhat quicker 604 TI model with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a five-speed manual transmission was added. In late 1978, for the 1979 model year, the 80 horsepower 604 D turbo turbodiesel model was introduced; it entered production in February 1979. The diesel could be ordered with either a four- or a five-speed manual transmission, {{as well as the}} GM-sourced three-speed automatic. The six-cylinder 604's received modified <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R
5000|$|What sets {{it apart}} from most other {{bicycles}} {{is the fact}} that it was developed specifically for race use by the Honda team using many purpose made components not commercially available. It is also different in that it uses an <b>internal</b> <b>gearbox</b> instead of external (derailleur) gearing system, which although not unique to this bicycle, is quite rare. The gearbox on the RN-01 is specific because it is not a classic gearbox like the Rohloff Speedhub for instance. Inside the gearbox there is a classic derailleur, a cassette and a chainring. The freewheel is not placed on the rear wheel but in the bottom bracket so the chain is constantly moving when the back wheel is spinning, a [...] "front freewheel" [...] system. This allows the rider to shift gears without pedaling.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to improve the}} {{performance}} of a racing motorcycle by means of gearbox tuning. The Optimal Maneuver Method, which essentially simulates an ideal driver and computes the minimum Lap Time for a given motorcycle and a given circuit, is applied. A 1000 cc SuperBike motorcycle and two very different racetracks, i. e. a fast one and a slow one, are considered. First the agreement between the Optimal Maneuver Method results and the logged telemetry data is proven, in order to fully justify its application. Next the relationship between <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio,</b> lap performance and circuit characteristics is investigated and potential improvements are highlighted. Finally gearbox tuning is achieved by a Lap Time optimization procedure, and subsequent performance improvements are discussed...|$|R

Shift times for Formula One cars are {{in the region of}} 0.05 seconds. In order to keep costs low in Formula One, gearboxes must last five consecutive events and since 2015, <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> will be fixed for each season (for 2014 they could be changed only once). Changing a gearbox before the allowed time will cause a penalty of five places drop on the starting grid for the first event that the new gearbox is used.|$|R

25|$|The C11 used a C10 motor {{fitted with}} an {{overhead}} valve cylinder head. The C11 frame was almost unchanged until 1951 when BSA added plunger rear suspension. Early gearboxes were weak and unreliable. The C11G was available with a three <b>ratio</b> <b>gearbox</b> and rigid frame or a four <b>ratio</b> <b>gearbox</b> and a plunger frame. Both models had better front brakes than earlier models. This model {{was a common}} commuter motorcycle, and many survive today.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{proposes a}} method to {{optimize}} {{the design of a}} small fixed-voltage wind energy conversion system (WECS). The system is composed of commercially available elements which are: a small horizontal axe wind turbine, a onestage gearbox, a permanent magnet synchronous generator, a diode bridge and a battery bank. As there are no controlled devices on the system, the design must be carefully done to find the configuration that maximizes both, the system utilization and the system’s output power. Using the mechanical and the electrical power equations, an optimization problem is proposed. This problem is aimed to find the optimal combination of the <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> and the battery voltage in order to extract the maximum amount of energy form the WECS. The mechanical power is modelled using a new proposed power coefficient function approximation. Th...|$|R
