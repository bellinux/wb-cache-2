5000|$|On November 10, 1983, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of U.S. District Court in San Francisco {{formally}} vacated the conviction.

[...] He also said, [...] "If anyone should do any pardoning, I should be the one pardoning the government for what they did to the Japanese-American people." [...] Peter Irons described Korematsu's ending statement during the case as the most powerful statement he'd ever heard from anyone. He found the statement as empowering as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech. Judge Patel's ruling cleared Korematsu's name, but was incapable of overturning the Supreme Court's decision.|$|R

[...] The Sunday Express claimed, quoting [...] "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" [...] and other [...] "Royal insiders", that because of the book's contents, ElizabethII would withhold granting Blair the Order of the Thistle, an honour which is bestowed at the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office. Gordon Brown was said to be [...] "seething" [...] and [...] "dismayed" [...] over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it. Ed Balls, a Brown ally who served in his government as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, [...] "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations. In that sense I thought it was all a bit sad. It was so one-sided. I didn't think it was comradely." ...|$|E

For there are three events which must precede any such blessing: First, a liberty of trade; secondly, a share of preferments in all kinds, to the British natives; and thirdly, a return of those absentees, who take almost one half of the kingdom's revenues. As to the first, there is nothing left us but despair; and for the third, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>happen</b> till the kingdom hath no money to send them; for which, in my own particular, I should not be sorry.|$|E

Jorgenson is perfectly right in being angry with you for having taken a woman in tow."--"He didn't mean to be rude," [...] protested Lingard, earnestly. Mrs. Travers didn't even smile at this intrusion of a point of manners into the atmosphere of anguish and suspense that seemed always to arise between her and this man who, sitting on the sea-chest, had raised his eyes to her with an air of extreme candour and seemed unable to take them off again. She continued to look at him sternly by a tremendous effort of will.|$|E
