60|$|As Mrs. Warburton sat silent a moment, {{the girls}} all looked with {{interest}} at the quaint pin which clasped the soft folds of muslin over the black silk dress {{which was as}} becoming to the still handsome woman as the cap on her white hair and the winter roses in her cheeks. The ornament was {{in the shape of}} a pansy; its purple leaves were of amethyst, the yellow of topaz, and in the middle lay a diamond drop of dew. Several letters were delicately cut on its golden stem, and a <b>guard</b> <b>pin</b> showed how much its wearer valued it.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the fork}} {{there is a}} {{projecting}} <b>guard</b> <b>pin</b> which passes through a notch in a separate safety roller disk on the balance shaft. In normal operation it doesn't have a function. Its purpose {{is to make sure}} the fork is in the right position to receive the impulse pin if a jar to the watch prematurely 'unlocks' the lever from the escape wheel.|$|E

60|$|Beppo hurtled {{against the}} logs with a sickening crash, and a {{thousand}} sparks leapt up and vanished in the cavern of the chimney. Ramiro wheeled sharply about, and snatching the pike {{from the hands of}} one of my <b>guards,</b> he <b>pinned</b> down the poor body of the boy to make sure of his victim's entire destruction.|$|R
2500|$|The {{match for}} the vacant Mexican National Welterweight Championship was {{originally}} planned {{to be the main}} event and last match of the night, but was moved down to the fifth match instead with no official explanation given. Averno had long time tag team partner Mephisto in his corner while Místico was accompanied by La Sombra for the biggest match of his young career. Místico started out strong, showing off his high flying moves to the delight of {{a large part of the}} crowd, but ultimately the experienced Averno took the first fall after catching Místico off <b>guard,</b> <b>pinning</b> him following Averno's signature [...] "Devil's Wings" [...] move. In the second fall Místico managed to trap Averno in an armbar submission hold, often referred to as La Mistica II, forcing the leader of Los Hijos del Averno to submit. The third fall saw Místico control most of the match, displaying his wrestling skills and winning the approval of some of the crowd that had been hesitant to support the second Místico up until that point. The crowd boo'ed Místico when he applied La Mística, the finishing move of the original Místico to Averno. At that point in time Mephisto jumped in the ring to distract the referee and save Averno from being forced to submit. With the referee's back turned Averno landed a kick to Místico's groin and then pinned him to win the match and the championship. With the victory he became the 71st Mexican National Welterweight Champion, a division described as one of the most important divisions in Mexico.|$|R
30|$|Heat {{generation}} must be <b>guarded</b> against during <b>pin</b> or wire insertion, as {{this could}} lead to thermal necrosis of the surrounding bone, ring sequestra and pin loosening. For this reason, the anterior tibial crest must be avoided, as drilling through the thick cortical bone can generate excessive heat [2]. In order to prevent heat generation during wire insertion, cortices are breeched via drilling and the wire is then advanced through the distal soft tissues with a mallet [5].|$|R
2500|$|Free-fall 5-pin pinsetters [...] {{to their}} ten-pin counterparts, and {{requires}} initiation by the bowler pressing a [...] "reset" [...] button as a candlepin unit does to [...] "cycle" [...] it, when a ball is bowled or pin knocked down. [...] When the player pushes their [...] "Reset" [...] button, the machine lowers a <b>guard,</b> lifts standing <b>pins</b> and sweeps away the downed pins. [...] If {{it does not}} recognize any standing pins, it will {{set up a new}} set for the next frame. [...] Unlike tenpin, balls and pins are picked up in the same elevator or conveyor and are separated {{at the top of the}} machine.|$|R
50|$|The cutterman {{insignia}} is {{a device}} awarded by the United States Coast Guard to represent service aboard a Coast <b>Guard</b> cutter. The <b>pin</b> is awarded {{on a temporary}} basis {{after six months of}} sea time, qualification in required watch stations, successful completion of an oral or written board, and receiving a recommendation from their unit's commanding officer. Temporary insignias may be worn while attached to a cutter, but must be removed upon permanently transferring to a non-afloat unit. The award becomes permanent after 5 years of cumulative sea time in the Coast Guard (prior service sea time counts for pay purposes, but not for qualification as a cutterman).|$|R

25|$|Collyer {{returned}} to TNA on June 16, 2004 as one-third of The Elite Guard, a stable consisting of Collyer, Hotstuff Hernandez and Onyx. The Elite Guard were {{portrayed as a}} militant and superior antithesis to the 3Live Kru, who were feuding with Jeff Jarrett and assisted Jarrett in his feud with the Kru. The 3Live Kru and The Elite Guard feuded over the following weeks, culminating in a ten-man Guitar on a Pole match on July 14, 2004 that saw Dusty Rhodes, Larry Zbyszko and the 3Live Kru defeat Jarrett, Ken Shamrock and The Elite <b>Guard</b> when Rhodes <b>pinned</b> Onyx. Following the loss, The Elite Guard was removed from TNA television. In Collyer's final TNA match on July 30, 2004, he and Hernandez were defeated by America's Most Wanted in a dark match.|$|R
50|$|By 16:50, {{with the}} Prussian {{southern}} attacks {{in danger of}} breaking up, the Prussian 3rd Guards Infantry Brigade of the Second Army opened an attack against the French positions at St. Privat which were commanded by General Canrobert. At 17:15, the Prussian 4th Guards Infantry Brigade joined the advance followed at 17:45 by the Prussian 1st Guards Infantry Brigade. All of the Prussian <b>Guard</b> attacks were <b>pinned</b> down by lethal French gunfire from the rifle pits and trenches. At 18:15 the Prussian 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade, {{the last of the}} 1st Guards Infantry Division, was committed to the attack on St. Privat while Steinmetz committed the last of the reserves of the First Army across the Mance Ravine. By 18:30, a considerable portion of the VII and VIII Corps disengaged from the fighting and withdrew towards the Prussian positions at Rezonville.|$|R
5000|$|All Altima models used Nissan's [...] KA24DE straight-4 DOHC engine mated to a 5-speed manual or 4-speed {{automatic}} (acceleration performance: 9.4 seconds 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) {{with automatic}} and 8.2 with manual). (By contrast, the Japanese Bluebird SSS could be had with Nissan's SR20DET engine and all-wheel-drive.) Suspension {{was composed of}} struts with stabilizer bars at both ends and was noted for providing sporty, satisfying handling (plus a firm ride and moderate road noise); all wheels were 15-inches. Being one of the bigger compact cars, the Altima could seat four adults fairly comfortably, though its body was too narrow for five. Trim lines consisted of the stripped XE, mid-line GXE, sporty SE, and luxury GLE. Some options included a gold emblem package, molded mud <b>guards,</b> and a <b>pin</b> stripe. All models had small cup holders under the radio and a small glovebox which were improved in the 1998 redesign.|$|R
50|$|It {{tells her}} {{that it has been}} {{stealing}} her creativity to grow a real body and become stronger by the second, however with Devi quitting her job, it forced Sickness to accelerate its plans. Sickness then tries to make a deal with her offering powers similar to Johnny's such as the ability to almost never get hurt, and given the ability to do anything within reason without getting caught including murder. Devi at first appears to accept the deal, but when Sickness puts its <b>guard</b> down, Devi <b>pins</b> it to an art canvas with a paintbrush and removes its eyeballs. Devi informs Sickness that she won and has full control over her mind again, and with her in possession of Sickness's eyes it will see what ever she wants it to see as a tortured audience to her life. The series ends with Devi and Tenna overlooking the town and enjoying a plane crash that hit their apartment building.|$|R
