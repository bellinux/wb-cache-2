500|$|Soon after midnight, Charlotte began {{vomiting}} violently {{and complaining}} of pains in her stomach. [...] Sir Richard was called, and was alarmed {{to find his}} patient cold to the touch, breathing with difficulty, and bleeding. [...] He placed hot compresses on her, the accepted treatment at the time for postpartum bleeding, but the blood did not stop. [...] He called in Stockmar and urged him to bring Leopold. [...] Stockmar found Leopold difficult to rouse, and {{went to see the}} Princess, who grabbed his hand and told him, [...] "They <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> tipsy." [...] Stockmar left the room, planning to try again to rouse the Prince, but was called back by Charlotte's voice, [...] "Stocky! [...] Stocky!" [...] He entered the room to find her dead.|$|E
500|$|McGovern {{had made}} several real estate {{investments}} in the D.C.area and became interested in hotel operations. In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, {{with the goal of}} providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a better U.S.senator and a more understanding presidential contender." [...] His statement would still be resonating with American conservatives two decades later.|$|E

500|$|Lohan {{had planned}} on {{releasing}} an album {{in the summer}} of 2001, according to her official website, llrocks.com. No album was released in 2001, but Lohan had begun recording demo tracks with Emilio Estefan, Jr.. He and his wife, Gloria Estefan, signed Lohan to a five-album production deal in September 2002. [...] "I am extremely excited to be working with Emilio. I am surrounded by a group of very talented people whom <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel like part of their family," [...] Lohan said to the press. Also in September, Lohan landed the role as the daughter in Disney's remake, Freaky Friday, which required her to learn how to play the guitar and to sing. Lohan recorded a song for the film, [...] "Ultimate," [...] which was released to Radio Disney to help promote the film. The song peaked at #18 on Radio Disney's Top 30. Lohan announced that the song was separate from her singing career, since many teen idols such as Hilary Duff and Raven-Symoné were expanding their careers from acting to singing. In 2003, Lohan recorded four songs including a Radio Disney hit, [...] "Drama Queen (That Girl)," [...] that were released for the soundtrack to Lohan's film, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the NBA, Javie developed a reputation early for having a [...] "quick trigger finger", and he {{was believed to be}} one of the league leaders in calling technical fouls during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, [...] "I'd get so mad I'd lose control for two or three minutes, and that's when I would miss calls." [...] Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. [...] Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. [...] While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. [...] As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. [...] In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. [...] Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, [...] "My mentors <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> what I am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Three years later, {{at the age}} of 22, LaMarche moved {{straight}} to Los Angeles to further his stand-up career. This move, LaMarche says, would always be something he regretted doing instead of moving to New York: [...] "... in retrospect, I thought it was a mistake. [...] I think that a couple of years in New York would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a stronger comedian." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kidd {{killed one}} of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. Kidd's gunner William Moore was on deck {{sharpening}} a chisel when a Dutch ship appeared. Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger Dutch-born King William. Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, [...] "If I am a lousy dog, you <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> so; you have brought me to ruin and many more." [...] Kidd snatched up and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a fractured skull and died the following day.|$|E

2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E
2500|$|The room then {{fills with}} supplicants to the Princess ("Drei arme adelige Waisen"). An Italian tenor {{sent by the}} Portuguese {{ambassador}} serenades the Marschallin ("Di rigori armato"), while Ochs works out the marriage contract with the Marschallin's notary. Two Italian intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, try to sell the Princess the latest scandal sheets, but she coldly declines. Rudely interrupting the tenor's song, Ochs tells the notary to demand a dower from Sophie's family (having confused dower with dowry). The notary attempts to explain that such is impossible under the law. Valzacchi and Annina now offer their services to Ochs. He asks whether they {{know anything about the}} Princess's [...] "maid". They don't, but they assure him that they do. Amidst all the activity, the Marschallin remarks to her hairdresser: [...] "My dear Hippolyte, today you <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> look like an old woman." [...] ("Mein lieber Hippolyte").|$|E
2500|$|Tibbits {{himself was}} {{described}} by one later owner of Tibbits, Dennis Vanes, as [...] "the greatest 'pusher' in Michigan." [...] He added, [...] "Mr. Tibbits was a hustler by nature, broad minded and liberal and always ready to help the needy and suffering. [...] He was outspoken in his sentiments and sometimes gave offense where none was intended." [...] Barton {{was the son of}} Allen Tibbits, one of Coldwater's founders. [...] After returning to Coldwater after the Civil War to start his tobacco and cigar business, Tibbits found himself involved in a variety of local projects and buildings [...] "including the skating rink, cart factory, and oil stove industry. He even purchased a number of steamboats to navigate the local lakes." [...] According to Tibbits himself, the opera house was one of the costliest projects of his career. [...] He stated, [...] "I attribute to this enterprise the Opera House my downfall, and the sacrifice of a business, which had I been selfish, would today <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a millionaire." [...] Indeed, the venture broke Tibbits financially {{by the end of his}} life.|$|E

2500|$|Four {{weeks after}} marrying his girlfriend, Hughes left for England {{as a member}} of the 1977 Australian team. The tour was an unhappy one for the Australian team, losing the series three Tests to nil to England and the {{embryonic}} World Series Cricket concept caused rifts between the team members. Hughes did not play much cricket early in the tour; Wisden Cricketers' Almanack saying that he was [...] "kept in such idleness that [...] might have claimed restraint of trade." [...] He was selected to make his Test debut in the fifth Test, after the series had already been decided. Hughes, bitter about his treatment by the tour selectors, was unhappy. Hughes told a reporter congratulating him about his upcoming Test debut [...] "Those pricks, know they <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> part of their failure". In an uncharacteristic performance, Hughes faced thirty four deliveries before he made his first run. It was the only run he made that innings, before he was dismissed by Mike Hendrick. Hughes' teammate Geoff Dymock later said, [...] "They threw [...] to the wolves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blache was {{introduced}} to the idea of painting Leah Chase by his art representative at the time Eugene C. Daymude in the summer of 2009. The 20 small oil paintings that comprised the series detailed the day-to-day activities 92-year-old Chef Leah Chase encounters from early morning prep work to greeting guests in the dining room. [...] Blache was heralded for his depiction of the culinary icon for his accuracy and delicate handling of paint, color, and texture. [...] “Asked whether she thought the rendering was accurate, Chase, 89, said the young artist had gotten it right. [...] “I told him, ‘You could <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> look like Halle Berry or Lena Horne, but you made it look like me,’” she said. [...] The painting Cutting Squash was acquired for its permanent collection by the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in 2011. [...] “We are always looking for portraits of nationally prominent figures,” National Portrait Gallery chief curator Brandon Fortune said. [...] “It is a very interesting image of a woman at work, doing a very simple task, cutting squash,” [...] [...] [...] “But in some ways it transcends the everyday and becomes something of national significance.” [...] This series reinforces Blache's commitment to documenting everyday labor and showcasing these intimate processes to the public. [...] Another one of the Smithsonian Institution Museums, National Museum of African History and Culture, came calling for another painting of Chase from the Blache series in 2013 and acquired Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch) in 2013, making it the third painting from Blache {{to be included in the}} permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
