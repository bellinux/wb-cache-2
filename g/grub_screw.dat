25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} a metal split pin or threaded <b>grub</b> <b>screw</b> and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|E

5000|$|Shank: The shank is the {{cylindrical}} (non-fluted) part of {{the tool}} {{which is used to}} hold and locate it in the tool holder. A shank may be perfectly round, and held by friction, or it may have a Weldon Flat, where a set screw, also known as a <b>grub</b> <b>screw,</b> makes contact for increased torque without the tool slipping. The diameter may be different from the diameter of the cutting {{part of the}} tool, {{so that it can be}} held by a standard tool holder.§ ...|$|E
30|$|In {{the second}} part of the experiment, we {{demonstrated}} that, under such mounting conditions, significantly higher axial loading forces are required for loosening to occur at the half pin–Rancho cube interface when bolts are used instead of <b>grub</b> <b>screws.</b> Failure in our experiments was defined as mechanical failure on the load deformation curve, and this was associated with loosening at the half pin–Rancho cube interface. Based on these results, we can demonstrate that bolts hold the half pins equally or better than <b>grub</b> <b>screws</b> in experimental conditions of loading to failure.|$|R
30|$|We {{conclude}} that bolts {{can be employed}} safely to secure half pins in Rancho cubes and, if tightened maximally, provide as good or better security of hold on the pin to <b>grub</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{sought to}} examine, when a {{controlled}} torque {{was applied for}} securing all half pins, the loosening points of these constructs when subjected to axial loading. From the investigation in part 3, it was established that 5  Nm was a safe amount of torque to be applied on <b>grub</b> <b>screws</b> prior to breakage at the driver–head interface. Ten constructs using <b>grub</b> <b>screws</b> and ten using bolts were secured applying 5  Nm with a calibrated torque wrench. The constructs were then placed on a universal testing machine—UTM (Fig.  1 d), and increasing axial loads were applied to determine points of loosening as determined as mechanical failure on the load deformation curve.|$|R
50|$|On January 2, 2014, a fire {{partially}} {{destroyed the}} group's High Voltage Lab, and deposited soot {{all over the}} lab. A <b>grub</b> <b>screw</b> on a Tesla coil rotary spark gap was not tight enough, resulting in a tungsten electrode which it was holding {{to move out of}} its socket and strike one of the stationary electrodes. This resulted in a chain reaction with bits of molten tungsten being flung from the spark gap unit, which then caused a nearby capacitor array to catch fire and subsequently melt. From preliminary analysis, Project Gemini (a 200,000 watt Tesla coil demonstration) looks to be completely destroyed, and Project Thumper (a high impulse generator) was severely damaged. The fire was so hot it melted porcelain insulators, and aluminum racks. Although no one had been hurt, the building was closed to the public once again for repairs.|$|E
50|$|The {{first was}} the {{inclusion}} of a small <b>grub</b> <b>screw</b> which could be adjusted to allow closer focusing. Unfortunately, the resultant image quality is very soft, and there are also extremely high levels of edge fringing, making the hack unsuitable for conventional video and still image capture. The second of the Iscorama 42ʼs unique features was its ratcheting anamorphic alignment mechanism, which was actuated by sliding the rubber grip section {{at the rear of the}} lens forward by two millimetres. This proved to be inferior to the lockable, free rotating mechanism on other Iscoramas; the ratchet indent spacing being too coarse to allow absolutely precise alignment of the anamorphic when screwed onto a taking lens. The most obvious side effect of this issue is the notable difficulty in achieving perfectly horizontal anamorphic lens flares with the Iscorama 42 when the adapter is attached directly to a taking lens.|$|E
50|$|A {{set screw}} {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used to secure an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a set screw has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind set screw (known in the UK as a <b>grub</b> <b>screw,</b> quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The set screw passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|E
5000|$|Weldon shank: [...] "Weldon shank" [...] annular cutters have 2 {{flats and}} this is the {{traditional}} method adopted by many of the popular magnetic drill manufacturers. [...] "weldon shank" [...] annular cutters fix in the chuck by tightening <b>Grub</b> <b>screws</b> in the two flat areas.|$|R
50|$|Some sets have {{a safety}} issue {{that should be}} addressed, usually due to {{deterioration}} in {{the condition of the}} mains lead. Universal sets (sometimes called AC/DC sets) use a live chassis, and should be inspected carefully to ensure no <b>screws,</b> <b>grub</b> <b>screws</b> on knobs, or any other live metal part can be touched.|$|R
30|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the tightening torque {{that can be applied}} safely (prior to breakage) at the head–driver interface when using these two methods. Twenty <b>grub</b> <b>screws</b> and twenty bolts were used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes using a calibrated torque wrench to determine the point at which breakage at the driver–head interface occurs (Fig.  1 e).|$|R

30|$|These results {{demonstrate}} that bolts achieve good stability {{at the half}} pin–Rancho cube interface by tolerating higher axial loads than grub screws before loosening. This is a result from the greater torque that can be produced using a spanner or wrench. Whilst the point profile of the <b>grub</b> <b>screw</b> secures a better hold of the half pin when the torque used is equal, the driver used to insert the <b>grub</b> <b>screw</b> is limited in delivery of a high maximum torque before breakage; {{this appears to be}} the limiting factor for the security of hold on the half pin by grub screws.|$|E
30|$|In {{the fourth}} part, we {{controlled}} the torque applied when securing these fixator constructs. The results suggested that, when equal torque is applied, grub screws are superior in providing stability in axial loading. The <b>grub</b> <b>screw</b> point profile may produce {{a better grip}} on the half pin than that on the bolt when the same torque is used, but when both types of screws are mounted applying maximum torque, bolts demonstrate a significantly higher threshold for loads prior to loosening. This reinforces the clinical practice to increase tightening torque in application so that an increase in clamp force is achieved and correspondingly the tolerance to load to failure.|$|E
30|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether there was a difference in the torque applied for securing half pins to Rancho cubes when employing these two methods; the mounting conditions were similar to those encountered in clinical practice. Five participants were asked to secure half pins on Rancho cubes using 5 <b>grub</b> (set) <b>screws</b> and 5 standard 10 -mm bolts (Fig.  1 b) in an alternating fashion to account for fatigue. They were instructed to apply as much torque as they would in clinical practice to the point they were satisfied that the half pin has been secured adequately in the Rancho cube. New Rancho cubes and screws were used on each occasion to avoid threads cutting out and altering the results. Wrenches were used to tighten the standard 10 -mm bolts and straight hex drivers for the <b>grub</b> <b>screws</b> as would be the case when done intra-operatively (Fig.  1 c).|$|R

Meccano consists of reusable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, and high quality plastic parts that are connected together using nuts, bolts and set screws (also known as <b>grub</b> <b>screws).</b> It enables the building of working models and mechanical devices. Although Meccano has always been seen as an engaging education toy, today the brand focuses on promoting engineering and robotics through fun play to support STEM learning.|$|R
5000|$|Universal-shank: [...] "Universal shank" [...] annular cutters has {{one flat}} and three quick connect grooves. This {{is also a}} popular method for using annular cutters into mag drills quickly, without any strain of {{tightening}} <b>grub</b> <b>screws.</b> mostly [...] "universal shank cutters" [...] {{can be used in}} [...] "weldon -shank machines, where as weldon-shank annular cutters can't use in [...] "one-touch" [...] machines without the help of an extra adapter. while using [...] "universal shank cutters" [...] into [...] "weldon shank" [...] machines, the tightening area (flat area) is only one, which is also not 100% sufficient to tighten the both screws.|$|R
30|$|We have {{simulated}} {{clinical conditions}} {{by use of}} saw bone models; we recruited subjects with experience in mounting frames and instructed them to assemble these constructs {{in a manner similar}} to their clinical practice. In the first part of the experiment, loosening torque values were determined. These are not the same as the tightening torque values as different forces are involved (static vs dynamic). Values obtained demonstrate statistically significant higher loosening torque values when bolts are used to secure half pins. This suggests a higher torque is applied when half pins are secured with bolts. We surmise the difference is due to a wrench (spanner) being used in contrast to the straight hex driver for grub screws. The axial compression force (clamp force) applied through either bolt or <b>grub</b> <b>screw</b> would determine the security of hold at the half pin–Rancho cube interface. This clamp force is affected by many other variables too: the bolt diameter. The type and number of threads on the bolt, the bolt material and the torque applied. The last variable is that under control by the surgeon and may influence the likelihood of these constructs to failure.|$|E
30|$|High {{stresses}} at the pin–bone interface {{contribute to}} micro-motion and failure resulting in unicortical loosening. Experimental models have demonstrated far higher pressures are generated under loading {{conditions at the}} bone interface from half pins as compared to fine wires [5]. The pin–bone interface has therefore been regarded as the weakest link in the mechanical stability of external fixation systems and has been investigated extensively [6, 7, 8]. In contrast, no studies {{have looked at the}} interface between the half pin and frame assembly. Loss of stability here compromises the bone remodelling process through a change in the biomechanics of the construct. In the systems of Ilizarov and Taylor Spatial frames (TSF) external fixation by Smith and Nephew, grub screws are used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate 2 different methods used (<b>grub</b> <b>screw</b> or 10  mm stainless steel hexagonal headed bolt [M 6 A 2 - 70]) to secure external fixation half pins to circular frames. This is to determine whether use of bolts is appropriate and could reduce the potential for loosening at this interface.|$|E
30|$|A {{mechanical}} study {{investigating the}} use of two different methods (grub and bolt screws) to secure external fixation half pins to circular frames. A four part experiment: (1) Grub and bolt screws were used to secure half pins in Taylor Spatial frames. Loosening torques were measured using a calibrated torque wrench. (2) Using universal testing machine (UTM), axial loading was applied to establish thresholds for loosening in grub and bolt screw constructs. (3) We established the application torque to produce failure at the head–driver interface using these two methods. (4) Grub and bolt screw constructs were created controlling torque. Using UTM, axial loading was applied to establish thresholds for loosening. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS v 20.0. 0. (1) Higher torque is employed when bolt rather than grub screws is used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes (p <  0.05). (2) Loading threshold for loosening is higher in bolt screw constructs when the torque applied to secure the constructs is not controlled (p <  0.05). (3) Torque required for failure at the head–driver interface was 5.3  Nm for grub screws and 9.9  Nm for bolts. (4) Loading threshold for loosening is higher in <b>grub</b> <b>screw</b> constructs when the same torque was applied to secure them (p <  0.05). Bolt screws can be employed to secure the half pin–frame interface. They offer good stability and reduce failure at the head–driver interface.

5000|$|During {{production}} at Canley, the seat trim was again revised, with a plaid cloth in navy blue or tan, with matching coloured leather effect edging, and matching door cards. A further trim change during {{production at}} Solihull saw {{the use of}} a ruched velour in blue or tan on the seats, with matching inserts on the doors. Also, the internal door lock buttons were changed from the earlier standard BL round ones, to rectangular buttons held on with small <b>grub</b> <b>screws.</b> There was also a change to the trip mile counter's reset button, which became a push type operated through the instrument [...] "glass", rather than a turn type under the dash.|$|R
30|$|We {{sought to}} examine {{which of the}} two methods held the half pin better; this was tested in loading similar to those {{encountered}} in clinical practice. Two participants were each asked to secure 5 half pins using <b>grub</b> <b>screws</b> and 5 half pins using standard 10 -mm bolts {{in the same manner as}} the first part of our experiment. The Rancho cubes were released from the rings, and the whole half pin–Rancho cube construct was removed from the saw bone using T-handles. The constructs were then placed on a universal testing machine—UTM (Fig.  1 d), and increasing axial loading was applied to determine loosening points. This was determined as mechanical failure on the load deformation curve and was associated with loosening at the interface between the pin and Rancho cube.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2013, FCS {{introduced}} FCS II [...] a new pre-glass fin {{system to}} the market. The new system boasts {{a number of key}} advantages over its predecessors. Firstly, the need for any screws or tool to secure the fins has been eliminated; the fins now simply lock into the plugs. Secondly, {{the leading edge of the}} fin resides inside the plug, and the base of the fins sit flush to the surface of the board creating a more seamless connection. The final key feature of the new system is that it’s backward compatible, meaning it will accept fins from the original dual tab system. Adding two <b>grub</b> <b>screws</b> and a small silicon insert allows you to secure your two tab fins into the new system. Many consider the new system inferior, Channel Islands Surfboards parted with FCS after the new system and Kelly Slater continues to surf the original FCS tabs on his Komunity Project fins.|$|R

5000|$|The tip of an épée {{comprises}} several parts including: the mushroom-shaped movable tip; its housing or [...] "barrel", {{which is}} threaded to the blade; a contact spring; {{and a return}} spring. The tips are generally {{held in place by}} two small <b>grub</b> <b>screws,</b> which thread into the sides of the tip through elongated openings {{on either side of the}} barrel. The screws hold the tip within the barrel but are allowed to travel freely in the openings. While this is the most common system, screwless variations do exist. The return spring must allow the tip to support a force of 750 g-f N without registering a touch. Finally, an épée tip must allow a shim of 1.5 mm to be inserted between the tip and the barrel, and when a 0.5 mm shim is inserted and the tip depressed, it should not register a touch. The contact spring is threaded in or out of the tip to adjust for this distance. These specifications are tested at the start of each bout during competitions. During competitions, fencers are required to have a minimum of two weapons and two body wires in case of failure or breakage.|$|R

Tri-helical gravure roll coating is a process which is used widely for depositing a thin liquid film onto a moving substrate. An analytic model of a simplified form of the process, that of rectangular grooves at 0 mesh angle, is presented together with supporting experimental results which confirm {{the validity of the}} model. Included also are interesting flow visualisations of the coating process, which for the first time shows the underlying physics of the process. Experimental Setup A schematic of the coating rig used to carry out the experiments is shown in figure 1. The apparatus utilises gravure coating rolls, of length 200 mm and diameter 100 mm, which can reach a maximum speed of URoll 100 m s; together with controls for web tension, velocity and wrap angle. The gravure rolls are comprised of an acrylic sleeve mounted with <b>grub</b> <b>screws</b> on a central steel core. This facilitates study of a range of groove geometries and aids the illumination of the fluid bead for flow visualisation purposes achieved by the injection of a small volume of coloured dye. Film thickness measurements were made by scraping fluid from the web over a known time interval. The residual fluid remaining after scraping was found to be negligible. The fluid used in the experiments is a Newtonian water-glycerol mixture with a small volume of surfactant to reduce surface tension. The viscosities used were in the range of µ 0 002 to 0 0075 Pas and with surface tensions of σ 0 033 to 0 065 N m...|$|R
