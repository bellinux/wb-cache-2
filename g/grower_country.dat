Many customers focus on the special atmosphere each store has and which is characterized by the location, music, interior design, seating or whether internet access is provided. Particularly for specialty coffee shops it is important not to sell only the beverage but the whole experience. Coffee shops have to establish a unique image that prevents customers from buying products from another shop or use home-brewing systems which are also on the rise in American households. In addressing the increased level of competition, every company’s focus should be on differentiating from the rest of the market in every possible business segment (products, atmosphere, location, image etc.) ...|$|R

The effectiveness and value of IWM systems should increase with increasing application specificity and true integration made possible with contemporary advances in technology, information systems and decision support. IWM systems can be classified based on their degree of application specificity and level of integration of tactics. In the application specificity pathway, a tactic is applied at a range of scales, from subfield to plant specific. In the integration pathway, multiple weed control tactics are combined in a synergistic manner. We hypothesise that the full value of IWM can and will be realised only when current and emerging technological innovations, information systems and decision tools are synergistically combined for use in real time.

40|$|Fungi {{that belong}} to the genera Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium pose serious phytopathological and mycotoxicological risks at pre-harvest and post-harvest stages, {{as well as in}} {{processed}} food products because they can produce several mycotoxins. Mycotoxins pose a serious problem for animal and human health and have a significant economic impact worldwide. The Mediterranean basin is a large geographical region with a temperate climate supporting the cultivation of a wealth of field and greenhouse crops with a high risk of mycotoxin contamination. The most important mycotoxins that occur in the Mediterranean basin are aflatoxins (B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2) in dried fruits and nuts, ochratoxin A in grapes and raisins as well as trichothecenes and fumonisins in cereals. A variety of chemical, biological and physical strategies have been developed to control the mycotoxigenic pathogens; to minimize mycotoxin production at pre- or post-harvest level; to contribute to decontamination and/or detoxification of mycotoxins from contaminated foods and feeds; or to inhibit mycotoxin absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Biological control using microbial antagonists either alone or as part of an integrated control strategy to reduce pesticide inputs, has emerged as a promising approach for control of mycotoxins in crops, both pre- and post-harvest. Several organisms including atoxigenic Aspergilli, yeasts, bacteria and fungi have been tested for their ability to reduce both fungal infection and mycotoxin contamination. For instance, atoxigenic fungal strains are being used widely to prevent pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination of crops such as peanuts, pistachios, maize, and cottonseed in several parts of the world including the Mediterranean area.

In 2004, Agriflora Limited, a Trans-Zambezi Industries Limited (TZI) agribusiness in Lusaka Zambia was sold off. Agriflora Limited was one ofthe largest fresh vegetable exporters in Africa. It had contracted almost 500 small-scale farmers with 1 - 4 hectares of land within 50 km radius of Lusaka to grow vegetables for export. Makeni Cooperative Society {{was one of the}} targeted groups of growers. It grew baby corn, mangetout peas, and sugar snap and fine beans for export. The case study relied on both primary and secondary data. I undertook two months of ethnographic fieldwork utilising observations, in-depth interviews and informal discussions with some community members in Makeni. I also reviewed the literature on contract farming schemes (documenting both the negative and positive effects for <b>growers)</b> in developing <b>countries.</b> The case study showed that the impact of the collapse of Agriflora on the growers has been severe indeed; there has been a significant reduction in production with only a few farmers producing for export. Those that are producing are limited to one crop, baby corn. The effect on the local labour market (farm workers) has been quite drastic with a drop in employment. A new agribusiness company, York Farm, was sourced by the government for the contract growers of Makeni. York Farm has signed a procurement contract under which only sale and purchase conditions are specified. This means that, services such as extension services are no longer provided. It was also found that despite the price for baby corn at York Farm being better than what Agriflora used to offer the farmers, farmers are not producing peas which have a higher turnover than baby corn because York farm does not buy peas from the farmers. However, the farmers are hopeful that they will soon start producing peas after they pass the Eurep gap requirements. Furthermore, the farmers are still interested in contract farming as they are convinced that it can lead to higher farm incomes. While the neoliberal critique of the pre- Structural Adjustment agricultural policies was based on the need to improve rural farming income and productivity, my study shows that the contract farmers are not the "traditional" peasant farmers but retired civil servants or former public sector employees who lost their jobs during the contraction of the sector. In conclusion, my field work revealed that the collapse of Agriflora has had negative effects on the growers of MCS in terms a significant decrease in crop production, decline in farmer income, lack of technical assistance such as extension services, transportation problems (to take produce to the new market-York Farm) and reduced contraction in employment opportunities for farm workers...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the balance in}} the objectives of investment promotion in Ethiopia, i. e. the enhancement of development and well-being {{in the context of}} environmental sustainability. The flower sector is used for the purpose of thematic focus due to the tension that exists between the benefits in the enhancement of cut flower exports and the corresponding challenges in labour conditions, environmental compliance standards and in the sustainability of the economic benefits. In spite of the Ethiopian legal framework on sustainable development, many economic actors tend to pursue its weaker interpretation which is further debilitated by gaps in the institutional framework. There is thus the need for caveat against delinking investment promotion towards economic development from social wellbeing and environemntal sustainability which in the flower sector requires environmental mainstreaming (EM) and sustainability impact assessment (SIA) so that illusive economic benefits would not lead to irreversible environmental harm. It is argued that the contribution of investment promotion pursuits in Ethiopia’s flower sector towards sustainable development and rising standards of living depends upon {{the extent to which the}} sector moves towards sustainable floriculture which is drastically different from flower export boom that arises from unprotected soil and water resources. Three contradictions permeate the challenges toward sustainable floriculture in Ethiopia. The ownership profile and the marketing niche of flower farms under distress show that domestic-owned farms are the ones that are most severely hit by these challenges. The first contradiction arises from the tension among the three (economic, social and environmental) pillars of sustainable development and the institutional gaps despite laws that protect the environment. The second contradiction relates to the tension between the positive role of technoscience in sectors such as floriculture vis-à-vis its hegemonic features and the potential harm if it is improperly applied in developing countries. The third tension is attributable to the buyer-driven global value chain which requires social and environmental compliance standards in flower growing and meanwhile pushes down the profit margin of flower <b>growers</b> in developing <b>countries</b> like Ethiopia. This not only puts pressure on working conditions and the environment but also renders the economic benefits illusory and unsustainable. The research is based on sociological and legal inquiries, and also includes case study which involves in-depth interviews and on-site observations. The study, inter alia, recommends that hydroponics, integrated pest management and multimodal water sources ought to be encouraged in all new flower farms and future expansion projects. In the absence of such thresholds accompanied by enhanced competitiveness and effective institutional capabilities of regulation and governance, the flower export boom which results from unprotected soil and water resources is economically unsustainable and does not bring about social wellbeing and environmental sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Survival in {{a falling}} market Cue: There?s {{an awful lot}} of coffee in Vietnam. In fact in the last five years, Vietnamese coffee harvests have grown from {{virtually}} zero to become the second largest in the world, behind Brazil. Unfortunately the world?s coffee farmers are now growing more than the world?s people are drinking, and with global over-production has come a global decline in prices. For coffee <b>growers</b> in <b>countries</b> like Tanzania, times are hard. How can smallholder coffee farmers survive in such a falling market? Technoserve is an NGO that is helping Tanzanian farmers to do exactly that, concentrating not on how to grow more coffee, but on finding the best prices at the coffee auctions. Lazarus Laiser spoke to Mr. Thomson Dixon, Country Director of Technoserve Tanzania, about the challenge for African coffee growers to compete on the world market. He began by asking Mr. Dixon what he thought coffee farmers needed to do to survive in the face of falling prices. IN:		?What we see happening ? OUT:		?individual farmers can prosper. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 19 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: A report from Tanzania described the challenges facing coffee growers. Many of the points will be relevant for other export crops. Transcript Dixon	What we see happening in the coffee market is, you basically need to become a speciality coffee farmer to obtain good prices in today?s market. If your coffee quality is truly very very good, you can find very good prices in the market. Kenyan coffees are sometimes trading at over $ 2 per pound, because of their superb quality. I think Tanzania faces the same opportunities. We have had buyers in from Italy, we have had buyers in from the United States, expressing a very strong interest in Tanzanian coffee. However, uniformly they are saying that the quality is not there yet. And my feeling is that if a farmer, or a group of farmers fail to bring their quality up, they will face continued intense competition from low cost Vietnamese producers. So {{the answer to the question}} really is to get to the top of the market, be the best quality you possibly can, and there you have the best chance of survival. Laiser	And now I would like to ask you as an expert, what are the government actions in terms of both protecting against dangers, and supporting farmers efforts to take advantage of the market? Dixon	The government can provide a context, make sure that the laws are clear, make sure that the conditions under which business takes place are secure. We are facing some difficulties this year because the regulations for the coffee harvest this season have not been published yet, and therefore I think that a lot of farmers, and a lot of buyers are maybe somewhat confused about what is permitted and what is not permitted. So I think that number one the government must act with great clarity on these issues. And I think that in terms of farmers, it?s very important for the farmers to be educated on how the market works, and what the customers are looking for, so that farmers can produce to the needs of the customer. Because, when you have an Italian buyer in, saying ?I would like to see it prepared in this fashion or that fashion?, you have to be aware of that, and balance the pros and cons of doing that. And I think that is where the private sector, together perhaps with government officials, can come together and create the strategies for attending to the market. Laiser	What can non-government organisations do in order to support small-scale farmers? Dixon	They can do a variety of things. In the case of Technoserve, we are assisting groups of small farmers to take their coffee to auction, look for the best price possible at auction. We believe very strongly in adding value by doing pulping of the coffee, bulking that coffee into 5, 10, 15 or 20 ton units, and selling that as a single unit at the auction. This is really what the government was trying to do many years ago, and Tanzanian coffee was superb many years ago, and developed a tremendous name for its quality. But then those pulperies fell into disuse, and it became an individual activity instead. It is definitely time for farmers to be putting in pulperies again, and this will be what it takes to pull the coffee quality up, and that way the nation and the individual farmers can prosper. End of track. The Country Director of Technoserve Tanzania, a non-government organisation, explains how the Tanzanian coffee market has been affected by a global glut in coffee production, and how both the government and the Tanzanian farmers need to improve their management of coffee production, so that it can compete with low-cost foreign coffee...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the Doha Development Agenda {{objective}} of establishing a fair and market-oriented trading system West and Central African (WCA) cotton-producing countries have submitted to the WTO a joint proposal for reform of the cotton market. The proposal calls for 'reforms to correct and prevent restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets', particularly as this affects the cotton sector. It argues that in the cotton sector OECD subsidies have pushed down prices and export earnings of WCA countries by at least US $ 250 million, to the acute detriment of their cotton <b>growers.</b> The signatory <b>countries</b> called for: recognition of the strategic nature of cotton for development and poverty reduction in many LDCs; the extension of the concept of 'special products' - currently restricted to defensive measures - to the offensive interests of developing countries, in other words, where export of such products is essential for agricultural development or the survival of the rural population in LDCs, as is the case for cotton; explicit recognition of cotton as a 'special product' for development and poverty reduction in LDCs and hence extension of special treatment to cotton; a complete phasing out of support measures for the production and export of cotton; the complete phasing out of border controls; the establishment at Cancun of a mechanism for the phasing out of support for cotton production with a view to its total elimination; the provision of financial compensation to cotton producers in LDCs to offset income losses until such times as subsidies have been removed from the cotton sector. The submission provides background on the importance of cotton production in WCA countries and notes that WCA countries are the second largest cotton exporters after the USA and one of the lowest cost producers. The submission notes how much public aid to cotton production has grown in recent years. In July 2002, the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) indicated that 73 % of global production of cotton required direct financial support from governments up from 50 % five years earlier. The USA is seen as the worst offender, providing US$ 2. 3 billion in support in 2001 / 2002, while the EU provided around US$ 700 million in the same year. For Spanish cotton producers support represents 180 % of global prices and for Greek producers 160 % of global prices, the highest level of subsidies in the world in the cotton sector. The submission argues that if American domestic subsidies were eliminated cotton prices would rise from US $ 0. 12 per pound to US $ 0. 22 per pound. If globally all subsidies were removed the price increase could reach US $ 0. 33 per pound. Comment: This situation needs to be seen against the background of the dismantling of the STABEX Facility under the Cotonou Agreement and the singular failure of the new system which was intended to replace STABEX to effectively support the income of cotton and other basic commodity (e. g. coffee) dependent ACP countries. The dismantling of the STABEX scheme based as it was on the belief that the market would best serve these countries stands {{in stark contrast to the}} domestic support extended to cotton producers in the EU. Clearly in a number of the recommendations listed in this joint submission the EU could provide an important lead.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The South African {{deciduous}} fruit {{industry is}} influenced {{by a number of}} factors including increased globalisation of markets, trade liberalisation, advances in information technology and consumer preferences. These factors have a continuous effect on the competitiveness of the industry and force deciduous fruit producers and processors to position themselves as capable competitors in the global free-market environment. This study measures the competitiveness of the South African deciduous fruit supply chains relative to those of Chile in an attempt to address the following research question: What is the relative global competitive advantage of the South African deciduous fruit supply chains relative to those of Chile? To adequately address this research question, data from the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO, 2005) is used to examine the competitiveness of the supply chains. Three internationally recognised indexes are also used to calculate the comparative and competitive advantages of the deciduous fruit supply chains, namely, the Net Export index (NXi), Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA#) index and the Relative Revealed Comparative Trade Advantage (RTA) index. The results clearly show that South Africa’s deciduous fruit supply chains have a marginally relative competitive advantage, with most of the deciduous fruit products having RCA# and RTA index values situated around 0 to 10. The analysis shows that the South African deciduous fruit industry is struggling, with a marginal global comparative and competitive advantage in terms of its value added products. Chile, on the other hand, has a relatively better revealed comparative advantage as well as a higher relative global competitive advantage in most of the deciduous fruit supply chains. South Africa has a relatively better global comparative advantage and competitive advantage over Chile only in apple juice and dried apricots. Despite South Africa’s marginal competitiveness, most of the deciduous fruit supply chains are experiencing an upward competitiveness, which is not the case for Chile. The results also reveal that the competitiveness of most of the deciduous fruit supply chains in South Africa, except for the apple and apricot chains, decreases from primary to processed products which implies that value-adding opportunities are still limited or untapped. On the basis of these findings, this study makes an attempt to identify and discuss some of the factors that affect the competitiveness of the industry by using a framework of competitive advantage analysis proposed by Porter (1990, 1998). The most important factors that impact on the competitiveness of the South African deciduous fruit industry are availability of skilled labour; cost and quality of unskilled labour; availability and quality of capital; cost of technology; local market growth; threat of substitutes; land reform policy; labour legislation; current exchange rate (current strength of the rand); BEE policy; lack of timely and accurate information and the inaccuracy of some of the data of the Perishable Products Export Council Board (PPECB); continued agricultural subsidies received by <b>growers</b> in <b>countries</b> competing with South Africa in global markets; and the high incidence of HIV/AIDS and crime. In order for the industry to enhance its competitiveness, a number of strategies to be adopted by all participants in the supply chain are suggested {{at the end of this}} study. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die Suid Afrikaanse sagtevrugte bedryf word beïnvloed deur verskeie faktore insluitende groter wordende internasionale market, handels liberalisering, vooruitgang in inligtings tegnologie en verbruikers voorkeure. Hierdie faktore het ‘n voordurende effek op die mededingendheid van die bedryf en dwing die sagtevrugte produsente en produseerders om hulself te posisioneer as bekwame mededingers in die internasionale mark omgewing. Hierdie study meet die mededingendheid van die Suid Afrikaanse sagtevrugte voorsieningsketting relatief tot die van Chili in ‘n poging om die volgende navorsingsvraag te beantwoord: Wat is die relatiewe internasionale mededingende voordeel van die Suid Afrikaanse sagtevrugte voorsieningsketting relatief tot die van Chili. Om die navorsingsvraag na behore te beantwoord word inligting van die Voedsel en Landou Organisasie (Food and Agricultural Organization, FAO) van die Verenigde Nasies van 2005 gebruik om die mededingendheid van die voorsieningskettings te verduidelik. Drie internasionaal erkende indekse word gebruik om die vergelykende en mededingende voordele van die sagtevrugte bedryf voorsieningskettings te vergelyk naamlik die Netto Uitvoer indeks (NU), Openbare Vergelykende Voordeel (OVV) indeks en die Relatiewe Openbare Vergelykende Handels Voordeel (ROVHV) indeks. Die resultate wys duidelik dat Soud Afrika se sagtevrugte voorsieningsketting ‘n relatief marginale kompeteerdende voordeel het, met meestse van die sagtevrugte produkte met OVV en ROVHV indeks waardes van tussen 0 en 10 het. Die ontleedings toon aan dat die Suid Afrikaanse sagtevrugte bedryf dit moeilik vind met om internasionall mededingend te wees met slegs ‘n maginale internasionale vergelykende en mededingende voordeel in terme van waarde toegevoegde produkte. Anders as Suid Afrika het Chili ‘n relatief beter openbare vergelykende voordeel as ook ‘n beter relatiewe internasionale vergelykende voordeel in meeste van die sagtevrugte voordieningskettings as Suid Afrika. Suid Afrika het slegs relatiewe beter internasionale en mededingende voordele in appelsap en gedroogde appelkose as Chili. Ongeag Suid Afrika se marginale mededingendheid ondervind meeste van die voordieningskettings opwaartse mededinging wat die die geval is met Chili nie. Die resultate het ook gewys dat die mededingendheid van meeste van die sagtevrugte voorsieningskettings in Suid Afrika afneem van primere na vervaardigde produkte, behalwe vir die appel en appelkoos waardekettings, wat impliseer dat waardetoevoeging moontlikhede steeds baie beperk is of nog nooit ontgin is nie. Op basis van die bevindinge is ‘n poging aangewend om sommige van die faktore wat die mededingendheid van die bedryf affekteer te identifiseer en te bespreek deur gebruik te maak van die raamwerk van mededingende voordeel ontleedings soos voorgestel deur Porter (1990, 1998). Die mees belangrike faktore wat ‘n inpak het op die mededingendheid van die van die bedryf is die beskikbaarheid van opgeleide arbeid; die koste en kwaliteit van onopgeleide aerbeid; beskikbaarheid en kwaliteit van kapitaal; koste van tegnologie; groei in plaaslike mark; gevaar van substitute; grondhervormings beleid; arbeids wetsgewing; huidige wisselkoers (huidige sterkte van die Rand); swart bemagtigings beleid; tekort aan tydige en akkurate inligting en die onakkuraatheid van sommige data van die Bederfbare Produkte Uitvoer Raad; landbou subsidies aan produsente in lande waarmee Suid Afrika internasionaal meeding en die hoë voorvalle van HIV/AIDS en misdaad. Om mededingendheid binne die berdyf te verbeter word verskeie strategie voorgestel wat rolspelers in die bedryf kan implementer...|$|R
40|$|The citrus {{industry}} {{is an important}} source of incomes for both individual <b>growers</b> and producing <b>countries.</b> Therefore, breeding for quality especially seedlessness has a pivotal role for the market, since consumers demand seedless fruits. Recovery of triploid hybrids through ploidy manipulation is a very valuable methodology to recover seedless citrus varieties. Citrus triploid hybrids can be recovered through 2 x x 2 x taking advantage of the unreduced (2 n) gametes formation. 2 x x 4 x and 4 x x 2 x sexual hybridizations are also widely exploited. Underlying the production mechanisms and genetic structures of diploid gametes is a key for optimizing polyploid breeding strategies. Two main mechanisms have been found in angiosperm for production of unreduced gametes: First Division Restitution (FDR) and Second Division Restitution (SDR). On the other hand, although tetraploid rootstocks display promising agronomic traits, their meiotic behavior and their segregation analysis is still mostly unknown in citrus. Disomic and tetrasomic models were defined as extreme models for tetraploid segregation, however, an intermediate inheritance model has been described for several crops. In this framework, this thesis aimed to study three main aspects: (i) the mechanisms underlying unreduced pollen gamete formation in the diploid 'CSO' tangor hybrid used as male parent in 4 x x 2 x triploid breeding programs, (ii) the frequencies and mechanism s involved in the unreduced 2 n female gametes production for 'Eureka Frost' and 'Fino' lemon genotypes, and (iii) the interspecific recombination and the resulting diploid gamete structures of doubled-diploid 'Mexican' lime to evaluate the possibility that natural interploid hybridization maybe the origin of C. latifolia ('Tahiti' lime type) and C. aurantifolia ('Tanepao' lime type) triploid varieties. The production of 54 tetraploid hybrids from 4 x x 2 x sexual hybridizations allowed the analysis of the mechanisms underlying unreduced pollen gamete formation. SSR and SNP molecular markers revealed that the majority of these plants were obtained from unreduced 2 n pollen of the diploid tangor parent. Then, the maximum-likelihood method based on parental heterozygosity restitution (PHR) of centromeric loci revealed that both FDR with predominant occurrence and to a lower extend SDR were the mechanisms leading to unreduced male gamete formation in the tangor studied. These observations were confirmed by the analysis of PHR pattern along the linkage group (LG) 2. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tetraploid citrus progenies arising from unreduced pollen and the first description of the coexistence of two meiotic restitution mechanisms (SDR and FDR) producing unreduced pollen in citrus. In order to study the frequencies and the mechanisms involved in the unreduced 2 n female gametes production in two different genotypes of lemon, we produced 43 triploid and tetraploid hybrids from 2 x x 2 x and 2 x x 4 x sexual hybridizations using 'Eureka Frost' and 'Fino' as female parents. The frequencies of 2 n gamete production were respectively 4. 9 % and 8. 3 %. The maximum-likelihood analysis and pattern of PHR along LG 1 revealed that SDR is the main mechanism of unreduced female lemon gametes (88 %), followed by FDR or pre-meiotic doubling (PRD) (7 %) and post-meiotic genome doubling (PMD) mechanisms (5 %). This is the first report of the production {{of a large number of}} lemon progenies from 2 n gametes and the first identification of a new mechanism, PMD that has never been observed in citrus and has rarely been described in other herbaceous or woody species. Across both studies, we demonstrated at the methodological level the effectiveness of using two complementary approaches, the analysis of the PHR pattern in one LG and the maximum-likelihood method based on centromeric loci for distinguishing between the different mechanisms of unreduced gamete production. We analyzed the meiotic mechanisms of a doubled diploid 'Mexican' lime, the interspecific recombination and the resulting diploid gamete structures combining a segregation analysis of SSR and SNPs markers, a cytogenetic study and pollen viability evaluation. We concluded that the doubled-diploid 'Mexican' lime had a predominantly disomic segregation for three LGs, intermediate inheritance with disomic tendency was found for five LGs and intermediate models for one LG. The resulting interspecific diploid gamete structures displayed high C. medica / C. micrantha heterozygosity. The revealed genetic structures of the diploid gametes produced by the doubled–diploid 'Mexican' lime are compatible with the hypothesis that 'Tahiti' and 'Tanepao' triploid varieties results from interploid hybridization involving a doubled-diploid 'Mexican' like lime. This disomic tendency limits the recombination and the diversity of the diploid gamete population; however the observed pollen viability restoration at tetraploid level could be advantageous for intensive breeding projects. The implications for triploid breeding projects of the meiotic behavior leading to unreduced pollen in 'CSO' tangor, unreduced ovules in lemons and diploid gametes of the DD 'Mexican' lime are discussed.

40|$|Keywords: Wheat, Triticum spp., Barley, Hordeum vulgare L., Seed Systems, Formal Seed Sector, Informal Seed Sector, National Seed Program, Seed Source, Seed Selection, Seed Management, Seed Quality, Genetic Diversity, Ethiopia, Syria In Ethiopia and Syria, {{wheat and}} barley {{are the two}} most {{important}} principal cereal crops grown since ancient times. Many generations of natural and human selection led into highly adapted and diverse populations of local landraces. For most of the history of agriculture, plant improvement and seed selection were farmer-based activities carried out {{as an integral part of}} crop production. W ith the development of commercial agriculture, plant breeding and seed production evolved into different disciplines. The wheat and barley seed systems were studied in Ethiopia and Syria to obtain an insight into the functioning of formal and informal seed systems with emphasis on understanding: the flow of information on new agricultural technologies; farmers' perception, criteria and adoption of modern varieties; farmers' seed sources and indigenous knowledge in seed management practices; quality of seed planted by farmers and its constraints; and   on -farm wheat and barley diversity. Farmers use multiple sources of information such as the formal (extension services, development agencies, research institutions, media broadcast) or the informal (own experience, relatives, neighbors, other farmers, local traders) sources to acquire knowledge on varieties and/or agronomic packages for crop production. M ost wheat growers (over 90 %) are aware of and have information on modern varieties, agrochemical inputs (fertilizers, herbicides, etc.) and agronomic packages. In Ethiopia, the formal extension service was the main source of information for new technologies generated by research through its recently introduced agricultural package program, comparatively more so than in Syria where fellow farmers (relatives, neighbors and other farmers) accounted as the major source of information. Neighbors and other farmers were the second most important informal sources of information particularly for modern varieties partly due to the lateral varietal diffusion through traditional seed exchanges. Farmers grow three broad categories of wheat varieties, i. e. recommended, 'obsolete' or landraces. An extensive use of modern wheat varieties and production packages was found among wheat <b>growers</b> in both <b>countries.</b> In Ethiopia, the majority of farmers grew modern bread wheat varieties (76 % recommended and 10 % obsolete varieties), and applied fertilizers (96. 7 %) and herbicides (63. 5 %) to their wheat crop. Similarly, wheat farmers in Syria used modern varieties on the recommended list (97 %), fertilizers (99. 5 %), herbicides (92. 7 %), storage pesticides (40. 8 %), and seed treatment chemicals (90. 3 %). However, the use of modern varieties and associated technologies was negligible for barley growers in Syria except for the use of fertilizers (56 %). Although seven modern barley varieties were released none of them were widely adopted because of farmers' preferences or lack of varietal adaptability. The entire barley area (99 %) was planted with a local landrace Arabi Aswad in northeastern Syria. Developing crop varieties with high yield and yield stability for agroecologically diverse durum wheat growing environments in Ethiopia or agro-climatically variable marginal environments typical to barley production areas in northeastern Syria still remains a challenging task. About 26 technological and socio-economic criteria were identified by farmers for adopting new modern wheat and barley varieties or for evaluating those currently grown on their farm. Grain yield, grain color, grain size, marketability and food quality (feed quality for barley), appeared most important in both crops and transcended all regions. Ethiopian farmers also consider tolerance to pests very important given their awareness of the susceptibility of the existing wheat varieties to major rust diseases. In Syria, non-lodging, frost tolerance or drought tolerance are additional agronomic characteristics farmers seeking from new wheat varieties. Some wheat local landraces were highly preferred by farmers because of their unique adaptation to diverse agroecological zones, stable yield, grain quality, marketability and for traditional food preparation. Most farmers in Syria had positive perceptions of the barley local landrace where one third saw no disadvantage in growing it. Farmers' seed acquisition from external sources is dynamic reflecting their response to specific technical and socio-economic factors associated with farming. Farmers used four main sources of seed for planting: (a) own saved seed from the previous years' harvest; (b) seed obtained from relatives, neighbors or other farmers; (c) seed purchased through local markets or grain traders; and (d) seed purchased from the formal sector. The informal farmer-to-farmer seed exchange is the major initial source of wheat and barley varieties as well as for seed used for planting each year. In Ethiopia, the informal sector accounted as an initial source of modern varieties for 58 % of the wheat farmers and as a source of seed for planting for 92 % of farmers in 1997 / 98 crop season. In Syria the formal sector was the main initial seed source of modern wheat varieties where it accounted for nearly 60 %, but provided wheat seed for only 24 % among sample farmers in 1998 / 99 crop season. Almost all barley farmers (87 %) as expected initially sourced their current seed stock from informal sources (relatives, other farmers, neighbors or local markets). Farmers had a positive perception of seed both from formal and informal sources and were generally satisfied with the quality of seed obtained from different sources. Farmers purchase seed from the formal sector because of likely perception of high physical purity, chemical treatment, or as a strategy to acquire new varieties. Moreover, most farmers were also satisfied with the quality of own saved seed or that obtained from other informal sources due to its timely availability, less or no transaction costs or lack of credit facilities, adaptable varieties and certified seed. Farmers' perception of seed influenced them to practise different on-farm seed management approaches to maintain the quality of their wheat and barley seed through selection (46 - 67 %), cleaning (83 - 90 %), treatment (4 - 90 %), separate storage (64 - 76 %) or informal assessment of physiological quality (3 - 34 %). Almost all wheat and barley growers recognized the difference between grain and seed and attributed these to physical purity, absence of weeds, big kernel size, good germination, free of insect damage. The responsibility for on-farm seed management was shared between men and women, who had a distinctive role to play. In Ethiopia, the mean physical purity and germination of wheat seed was 98. 92 and 96 %, respectively and the majority of samples reached the minimum purity and germination standards. In Syria, mean physical purity and germination for wheat was 97. 59 % and 86 %, respectively whereas for barley the average analytical purity was 95. 47 % and germination was 86 %. However, the quality of wheat seed samples was higher than that of barley seed samples where most of the samples (90 and 28 % for purity and germination, respectively) failed to meet the minimum official seed standards. Highly significant differences in seed quality were observed for seed samples collected from different regions and districts for wheat and barley crops in both countries. However, there was limited significant difference in physiological quality of seed samples obtained from different sources, but not in physical quality. Several seed-borne fungi such as Drechslera sativum, Septoria nodorum and Fusarium graminearum, F. poae, F. avenaceum, and F. nivale including storage fungi were recorded across samples from different wheat growing region of Ethiopia. Among fungal pathogens isolated from wheat seed, 83. 6 % of samples were infected with D. sativum (average infection rate of 1. 85 %) and 74 % of the samples with Fusarium graminearum (average infection rate of 1. 54 %). Infection with loose smut (Ustilago tritici), common bunt (Tilletia spp.) and seed gall nematode (Anguina tritici) was low where only 11. 2, 2. 3 and 8. 6 % of the samples were infected, respectively. In Syria, 68 and 14 % of wheat seed samples were infected with common bunt and loose smut, respectively. The average loose smut infection was 0. 8 %. The majority of barley seed samples were also infected with covered smut (Ustilago hordei = 85 %) and loose smut (83 %) in varying proportion. The average loose smut infection for barley was 18 %. Seed health quality of wheat was better than of barley in terms of the frequency (number of samples) and intensity of infection (% infection). On-farm varietal diversity in terms of the number of varieties/landraces grown and area coverage were quite low both for wheat and barley. Farm level surveys showed low spatial diversity where few dominant wheat varieties occupy a large proportion of area. These few wheat varieties were also grown by the majority of farmers threatening the diversity of local landraces. In Ethiopia, the five top wheat varieties were grown by 56 % of the sample farmers and these varieties were planted on 80 % of the total wheat area whereas for Syria it was 78 and 81 %, respectively in the same order. In case of barley one single local landrace was grown in the entire survey area. The weighted average age of wheat varieties was 13. 8 years for bread wheat in Ethiopia and 10. 8 years for wheat in Syria showing low varietal replacement by farmers, an indicator of low temporal diversity. The coefficient of parentage analysis showed that the average and weighted diversity for bread wheat was 0. 76 and 0. 66, respectively in Ethiopia and for bread wheat (0. 73 / 0. 42) and durum wheat (0. 85 / 0. 73) in Syria. The field experiments showed significant variations for desirable agronomic and phenotypic traits diversity such as plant height, grain yield, and yield components (spike length, spikelets spike - 1, kernels per spike - 1, seed weight) among wheat and barley varieties and/or local landraces. This study combined farmer surveys, laboratory analysis and field experiments to better understand farmer's perception and adoption of modern varieties (and associated technologies) and to investigate on-farm genetic diversity and seed quality suggesting alternative ways for improving and strengthening the national seed system. Moreover, the study used extensive secondary data to draw a synthesis on the future direction of the national seed sector in developing countries in general and of the Ethiopian and Syrian seed industry in particular. </span...|$|R
