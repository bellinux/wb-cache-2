40|$|Recycling waste {{printed circuit}} boards (PCB) is an {{extremely}} complicated process, because PCBs consist {{of a number of}} complex components – hazardous and non-hazardous materials sets. Pyrolysis and combustion are currently the most effective treatment technologies for waste {{printed circuit boards}}. Pyrolysis can be used for thermally decomposing PCBs allowing for the simultaneous recovery of valuable materials. Following the extraction of valuable materials, the problem of residual ash utilization is encountered. Determining the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of <b>incineration</b> <b>residue</b> helps with choosing effective ash management technologies. This paper analyzes PCB ash generated at three different temperatures of 400 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C. Ash residues have been analysed to determine the quantity and type of metals present.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} distribution of metals and the influential factors on metal concentrations in <b>incineration</b> <b>residues.</b> Bottom ash and fly ash were sampled from 19 stoker and seven fluidized bed incinerators, which {{were selected to}} {{have a variety of}} furnace capacity, furnace temperature, and input waste. In the results, shredded bulky waste in input waste increased the concentration of some metals, such as Cd and Pb, and the effect was confirmed by analysis of shredded bulky waste. During MSW incineration, lithophilic metals such as Fe, Cu, Cr, and Al remained mainly in the bottom ash while Cd volatilized from the furnace and condensed to the fly ash. About two thirds of Pb and Zn was found in the bottom ash despite their high volatility. Finally, based on the results obtained in this study, the amount of metal in <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> of MSW was calculated and the loss of metal was estimated in terms of mass and money. A considerable amount of metal was found to be lost as waste material by landfilling of <b>incineration</b> <b>residues...</b>|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{technical}} {{advances in}} the cleaning of flue gases from waste incineration have increasingly made solid residues from the process the main emission route for inorganic contaminants. Appropriate strategies to manage waste <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> are therefore required and have driven scientific research toward finding environmentally sound solutions. Among {{the various types of}} solid <b>residues</b> from waste <b>incineration,</b> bottom ash (BA) is generated in the largest amounts and is recognized as the most suited for use. Several techniques have been developed for processing incinerator BA in view of reuse in various applications.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{a model for}} {{regional}} waste management in Central Norway is presented, with a special focus on challenges and different disposal strategies concerning waste <b>incineration</b> <b>residues,</b> such as bottom ash, fly ash and filter cake from flue gas cleaning systems. The main objective {{of this study is}} evaluating the total environmental performance of different waste incineration and ash disposal strategies, using a combined material flow accounting (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Different incineration technologies, and technology-specific performance regarding residues generation, are presented. Properties of different <b>incineration</b> <b>residues,</b> existing ash disposal strategy for the region and different alternative ash treatment strategies are also presented and discussed. An existing waste model for Central Norway is expanded to also include the amounts and flows of <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> generated in the region. The chemical composition of the residues is also accounted for. This dynamic waste model describe the development in waste generation and <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> generation, and is used as a basis for the further development of scenarios. To different scenarios are developed for waste <b>incineration</b> and <b>residues</b> disposal for the region; a centralized waste incieration scenario with disposal of incinerator ashes to landfills (Scenario A), and a decentralized waste incineration scenario with regional vitrification of the <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> (Scenario B). These two scenarios’ potential environmental impacts are compared using life cycle assassment methodology. The timespan of this assessment starts in year 2002 and ends in 2020. The results from this assessment show that Scenario B clearly has the lowest overall potential for environmental impacts. The results also show that the impacts from the subprocesses connected to the residuals downstreams from the incineration, are of minor importance to the total impacts. An exception here is the impact category “terrestrial ecotoxicity”, where landfilling of bottom ash is the dominant contributor for the total impact potential for this impact category. The subprocesses connected to the residuals disposal/treatment for both scenarios have also been compared separately. This comparison showed {{that it is difficult to}} say which of the two residual strategies that has the best overall environmental performance. The landfilling strategy in Sceanrio A causes highest potential impacts for certain impact categories such as “terrestrial ecotoxicity” and “eutrophication”, while the vitrification strategy causes highest potential impacts for other impact categories such as “global warming potential” and “acidification”. A change in the residuals treatment strategy will thus not necessarily reduce the total potential for environmental harm, but instead change the main impacts from one impact category to another - a situation often reffered to as “problem shifting”. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Incineration</b> <b>residues</b> contain both {{inorganic}} {{and organic}} material. The organic material {{may affect the}} mobility of pollutants in e. g. landfills or geotechnical constructions. Limit values of TOC (total organic carbon), determined according to European standard are stipulated to reduce the disposal of organic materials. The European standard methods to determine TOC and DOC (dissolved organic carbon) are evaluated. Factors controlling the mobility of DOC {{and its effect on}} metal mobility have also been studied. Determination of TOC according to European standard methods EN 13 137 and EN 1 484 include those carbon fractions that are oxidized during combustion. The definition of TOC as total organic carbon is not equivalent with the analytical result. The European standards on the definition of TOC need revision. Both organic and elemental carbon are oxidized upon heating, and the analytical TOC is thus a sum of organic and elemental carbon present in the sample. Since elemental carbon comprise the major part of the analytical TOC in solid samples of <b>incineration</b> <b>residues,</b> such results will most likely be misunderstood. Revision of the standard method EN 13 137 is recommended to better suit <b>incineration</b> <b>residues.</b> The L/S ratio (the relationship between the mass of liquid and the mass of solid material), excessive carbonation (addition of CO 2 until the pH in the solution was stable for 2. 5 h) and extraction pH were the main factors controlling the mobility of DOC in incineration bottom ash. Up to ~ 60 weight-% of the TOC in the bottom ash could be mobilized by controlling these factors (i. e. by using them as parameters). Only a minor part of the TOC (~ 7 weight-%) in APC residues was extractable with water, indicating a high proportion of elemental carbon. Water-soluble organic compounds may affect the mobility of metals in several ways. The formation of DOC-metal complexes has a direct effect on the metal mobility. Biological degradation of organic material may also affect the metal mobility indirectly due to changes of pH and redox- potential. The complexation capacity of DOC can be used in the development of washing as a pre-treatment process of <b>incineration</b> <b>residues.</b> Excessive carbonation may be useful in a washing process to enhance the separation of metals. Further treatment-oriented investigations of bottom ashes and APC residues are recommended {{in the development of a}} washing process of the materials. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{amounts of}} <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> {{need to be}} disposed, reused or treated, which calls for {{reliable}} characterisation methods. Leaching tests are often used for an assessment of release of pollutants from wastes {{under a variety of}} leaching factors. Nevertheless, the prediction of the contaminants release in field is difficult due to the complexity of the processes occurring in field. This work aims at evaluating limitations and possibilities of making long- term leaching predictions for <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> using diffusion leaching tests. Also the effect of carbonation on the leaching of elements was evaluated. Leaching predictions for Cl and Pb based on diffusion test data were compared with leachate data from MSWI bottom ash reused in road construction as well as leachate data obtained using a two-step compliance test. For the first years, leaching of Cl from bottom ash in field could be predicted with an accuracy within one order of magnitude. This could be considered as a good fit. Good agreement was also found between leaching predictions based on the diffusion test and the compliance test for Pb. However, predictions based on a diffusion tests might be misleading for longer time periods as the stock of contaminants depletes. Longer time series of field data are needed for comparison. Field conditions such as wet/dry and freezing/thawing cycles were not considered in this work, but might affect the mobility of contaminants. The impact of such field factors deserves a thorough examination in future research. Carbonation was found to significantly affect leaching of some elements from MSWI bottom ash. Leaching of Pb and Zn was increased due to carbonation, while leaching of Cr, Mo, and Sb decreased. Leaching of Cu was increased by carbonation alone, but it was also observed that leaching could be decreased if carbonation is combined with water-solidification. With such effect on leaching it is necessary to take carbonation into account when leaching predictions are made. Godkänd; 2004; 20070127 (ysko...|$|R

Vast and ever increasing amounts of <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> are produced worldwide; these are an environmental burden, but also a resource, as they are a major sink for the material flows of society. Due to strict environmental regulations, in combination with decreasing landfilling space, the disposal of the MSWI residues is problematic. At the same time, resource scarcity is recognized as a global challenge for the modern world, {{and even more so}} for future generations. This paper reports on the methods and efficiency of P extraction from MSWI fly ash by acid and base leaching and precipitation procedures. Phosphorus extracted from the MSWI residues generated each year could meet 30 % of the annual demand for mineral phosphorus fertiliser in Sweden, given a recovery rate of 70 % achieved in this initial test. The phosphorus content of the obtained product is slightly higher than in sewage sludge, but due to the trace metal content it is not acceptable for application to agricultural land in Sweden, whereas application {{in the rest of the}} EU would be possible. However, it would be preferable to use the product as a raw material to replace rock phosphate in fertilizer production.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{comparison}} of Swedish and Danish legislation on recycling of MSWI (Municipal Solid Waste <b>Incineration)</b> <b>residues</b> for construction purposes. The aim has been to look for differences and figure out whether these could be {{a reason for the}} minor use of MSWI ashes in Sweden compared to Denmark. To do this, text analysis has been performed on Swedish and Danish environmental legislation with focus on recycling of incineration ashes for constructions. In Denmark, use of incineration ashes was very common and large amounts were recycled during the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s. The new legislation, more similar to the Swedish in terms of an increased need for assessments along with tightened limits for hazardous substances, has diminished the use. This shows that changes in Danish legislation towards the Swedish complicate the use of incineration ashes. Thereby the minor use of ashes from MSWI in Sweden could, at least partially, be explained by differences in Danish and Swedish legislation...|$|R

The leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) bottom ash and air pollution control residue (APC) from the incineration of waste wood was investigated. Factors affecting the mobility of DOC were studied in a reduced 2 ^(6 - 1) experimental design. Controlled factors were treatment with ultrasonic radiation, full carbonation (addition of CO 2 until the pH was stable for 2. 5 h), liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio, pH, leaching temperature and time. Full carbonation, pH and the L/S ratio were the main factors controlling the mobility of DOC in the bottom ash. Approximately 60 weight-% of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the bottom ash was available for leaching in aqueous solutions. The L/S ratio and pH mainly controlled the mobilization of DOC from the APC residue. About 93 weight-% of TOC in the APC residue was, however, not mobilized at all, which might be due to a high content of elemental carbon.

Removal of these harmful substances from the water streams before they are discharged into the environment is essential. Methods such as precipitation, ion-exchange, membrane technology and adsorption have been employed to reduce the level of heavy metals; however, the economical competitiveness and user friendliness of these methods are important factors to stimulate industry to apply the technology. Therefore, development of low cost adsorbents that are capable of removing multi-contaminants is of interest.

40|$|Due to {{the finite}} nature of mineral {{phosphorus}} reserves, effective management of anthropogenic phosphorus flows is currently {{under investigation by}} the international research community. This article emphasizes the importance of urban phosphorus flows, which are often marginalized due to the greater magnitude of agricultural phosphorus flows. A study on phosphorus flows in Gothenburg, Sweden, points out the potential role of solid waste in nutrient management, as the amounts of phosphorus in solid waste and in wastewater were found to be equal. Importation of food commodities accounts for 50 % of the total inflow of phosphorus, and food waste is a major contributor of phosphorus to solid waste. The results suggest that solid waste <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> represent a large underestimated sink of phosphorus. Focusing on wastewater as the sole source of recovered phosphorus is not sufficient. The Swedish national goal on phosphorus recycling, which is limited to sewage sludge, targets only a part of the total phosphorus flow that can potentially be recovered.

We emphasize the need for debate on preferable routes for disposal of waste with a high phosphorus content.

Currently, the operation is starting with the incineration of sewage sludge. The elemental analysis of collected samples showed that both iron and aluminumare major elements contained in sewage sludge and aluminum is the predominant constituent in waterworks sludge. This study proposed a waste-to-resource strategy by using the waterworks and sewage sludge <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> (ash) as the ceramic raw materials to stabilize copper electroplating waste. When sintering the mixture of waterworks sludge ash and copper electroplating waste, the CuAl 2 O 4 spinel phase was detected at 650 oC, and became the predominant product phase at temperature higher than 850 oC. Strong signals of the CuAl 2 O 4 phase continued until the temperature reached 1150 oC, and further sintering initiated the generation of other copper-containing phases (CuAlO 2, Cu 2 O and CuO). After sintering the mixture of sewage sludge ash and copper electroplating waste, hematite (-Fe 2 O 3) became an effective component to incorporate copper into the CuFe 2 O 4 spinel with cubic structure. The leaching performances of CuO, CuAl 2 O 4 and CuFe 2 O 4 were compared by a 22 -d prolonged acid leaching test with leaching fluid at pH around 2. 9.

The methodology used is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). As the plant already applies the best technologies available in waste treatment, this study focuses on the fate of the residues (bottom and fly ash) produced during combustion. Nine scenarios are made, based on different ash treatment disposing/recycling techniques. The functional unit is the amount of waste incinerated in 2011. Boundaries are set from waste arrival in the plant to the disposal/recovery of the residues produced, with energy recovery. Only the operative period is considered. Software used is GaBi 4 and the LCIA method used is CML 2001. The impact categories analyzed are: abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, global warming, human toxicity, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, terrestrial ecotoxicity and primary energy demand. Most of the data are taken from Herambiente. When primary data are not available, data from Ecoinvent and GaBi databases or literature data are used. The whole incineration process is sustainable, due to the relevant avoided impact given by co-generator. As far as regards bottom ash treatment, the most influential process is the impact savings from iron recovery. Bottom ash recycling in road construction or as building material are both valid alternatives, even if the first option faces legislative limits in Italy. Regarding fly ash inertization, the adding of cement and Ferrox treatment results the most feasible alternatives. However, this inertized fly ash can maintain its hazardous nature.

40|$|AbstractAll {{processing}} systems of waterworks produce {{a substantial amount}} of sludge with the residues of treatment chemicals used as coagulants (commonly aluminum-based). Landfill is usually considered as a common disposal strategy for sludge and the <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> in most metropolitan areas worldwide However, the aluminum and/iron contained in the sludge will be largely wasted in landfills, and the metal ions might also be leached out and cause further pollution to the surrounding areas. Therefore, the need for “waste-to-resource” makes the increasing incentive to develop economically viable reuse and recycling options. The major elements in the incinerated ash of municipal wastewater sludge are aluminum and silicon detected from XRF results, which are major components for glass-ceramics. Therefore, in this study, the incineration ash of waterworks sludge was reused as raw materials to produce the glass-ceramics, and the metal transformation mechanisms were further explicated via the combination of advanced techniques. The ZnAl 2 O 4 spinels were produced with large quantity when sintering zinc oxide with ashes of waterworks sludge. The simulated system with clay and zinc oxide was also studied to investigate the incorporation mechanism of zinc in the glass-ceramics products Both zinc aluminate spinel (ZnAl 2 O 4) and willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4) phases were formed during the sintering process Furthermore, the efficiency of zinc transformation was determined through Rietveld refinement analyses of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. The results show a competitive formation between ZnAl 2 O 4 and Zn 2 SiO 4, and the ZnAl 2 O 4 spinel is predominant at high temperatures. This study used a prolonged leaching test modified from the U. S Environmental Protection Agency's toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) to evaluate ZnO, ZnAl 2 O 4, and Zn 2 SiO 4 product phases. The zinc concentrations in ZnO and Zn 2 SiO 4 leachates were about two orders of magnitude higher than that of ZnAl 2 O 4 leachate {{at the end of the}} experiment, indicating that ZnAl 2 O 4 formation is the preferred stabilization mechanism for incorporating zinc in ceramic products...|$|R
40|$|The {{landfilling}} ban for combustible {{waste in}} EU {{countries and the}} extended use of bio fuels in heat and electricity production will result in an increasing generation of <b>incineration</b> <b>residues,</b> such as fly ash and bottom ash. Instead of landfilling, ashes used as a construction material in, e. g., roads or landfill covers can result in saving natural resources and economical advantages. The main aim of this work is to assess how ashes used in landfill cover construction affect the environment and how the potential environmental impact can be assessed. The main pollution pathway of using ashes in landfill cover construction is leaching. Laboratory leaching tests {{can be used as}} a tool to assess the possible environmental impact of ashes before their use in a landfill cover. Solubility leaching tests, e. g. batch leaching test, pH-stat test and percolation test, can be useful tools to predict contaminants that can be released from ashes used in a protection and drainage layer. The diffusion leaching test together with the availability test are suitable to assess the release from ash used as liner material. However, predicting contaminant release in the field is difficult due to the complexity of the processes occurring in the field. Leachate and drainage water are two types of water generated in landfill cover. Leachate samples were mainly contaminated by As, Mo, Cl and N. Drainage water contained high concentrations of Ni, Cl and N with the addition of As, Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn in the areas where bottom ash is in the protection layer. Since leaching of most pollutants showed no clear tendency to decline over time, assessing how long leachate and drainage water need treatment is difficult. However, it is expected that salt forming elements will be depleted from ashes within some decades. A lower release of other trace elements, such as Cu, Pb and Zn, to ash leachate is expected due to immobilization by Al/Fe hydr(oxides) and clay minerals. Godkänd; 2006; 20061206 (pafi...|$|R

This study {{aimed to}} prepare a high {{performance}} plastic concrete made of epoxy resin and Portland type-I cement mixed {{with at least one}} inorganic solid waste of demercurated lighting phosphor powder or municipal solid waste <b>incineration</b> scrubber <b>residue.</b> The ratio between liquid epoxy resin and cement was 1 : 2; the scrubber residue and demercurated phosphor powder were added as modifiers for cement component in order to improve the strength and thermal properties of synthesized plastic concrete. The results indicate that, the addition of scrubber residue causes a decrease in both strength and thermal properties; whereas, the demercurated phosphor powder can replace 100 % of the contents of cement without any significantly change in either strength or thermal properties. Atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the chemical structure of cured concrete and the results indicate that the surface softness increases with an increase in the mixed percentage of epoxy resin...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of the composition variability frequently arises when evocating thetreatment or the eventual use of municipal solid waste <b>incineration</b> (MSWI) <b>residues.</b> This studyaims to estimate this assumed variability by following the composition of electrostaticprecipitator (ESP) fly ashes from MSWI day by day during one month. The samples compositionis determined by X-ray fluorescence and their mineralogy is analysed by X-ray diffraction. Theresults show that the concentration values of MSWI ESP fly ash elements remain {{in the range of}} 2 σ (standard deviation) around the average. An ANOVA test also indicates that there is nosignificant effect of the time-period on the ESP fly ash composition. The results suggest thus alow variability of the ESP fly ash composition over a one-month period. A one-year campaignbegan in March 2010 to investigate the MSWI ESP fly ash composition over a longer period. Alow variability of the MSWI ESP fly ash composition would constitute an incentive for the useof such residues in, for instance, construction materials. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{homogeneous}} {{design for}} landfill bodies is generally agreed. However {{the manner in}} which waste is deposited may result in a sequence of layers that causes inhomogeneity. The goal of this research was to investigate the influences of such inhomogeneities on long-term leaching of highly soluble salts and ecotoxic species. This long-term leaching of was observed for 25 months. Laboratory column tests and field experiments (test bodies and lysimeters) were performed with municipal solid waste <b>incineration</b> <b>residues.</b> Laboratory columns were irrigated with tap water. Control field experiments were exposed to natural precipitation. Due to the fact that municipal solid waste <b>incineration</b> <b>residues</b> are continually landfilled on monofills, the percolating landfill-leachates are highly saline. Therefore extended experiments were carried out and these were treated with saline solutions: either solely or in addition to natural precipitation. Highly saline irrigation-media artificial leachates produced in the lab, actual landfill leachate or a concentrate from reverse osmosis was used, depending on the experiment. Besides irrigation, the application of residues, as the top or intermediate layers, provided continuous supply of highly saline solutions. Commonly, column experiments are conducted under water-saturated conditions. For this research however, unsaturated conditions were chosen to understand real landfill conditions. All experiments were performed as parallel experiments. One test had a uniform-grain setup and acted as a control. The application of a fine-grained bottom ash layer within a column filled mainly with coarse-grained bottom ash provided the inhomogeneous setup. Grain size changeover as a barrier layer within a column should change the permeability along the profile of the column. In some cases the barrier layer was compacted. The results of long-term the solid sample and leachate investigations pointed out that the application of a barrier layer by means of grain size changeover had mainly physical effects. With the control experiment, water contents of solid samples increased in general {{from the top of the}} experiments to the basis. In contrast, the following was observed for the application of a barrier layer: 	impounding of leachate, 	slowdown of leachate percolation time, 	increased water retention capacity. Mainly the zone within the barrier layer showed the highest water content. A general observation was that the setting beneath the barrier layer was much drier. Another observation was that irrigation with saline water enhances water retention within the column. Additionally model experiments with plastic shots pointed out that the irrigation with small amount of water intensifies the physical effect of the barrier layer. Unsaturated water conditions which are common in landfills together with reduced permeability provide the basis for salt accumulations around the zone of the fine grained ash layer. An investigation on the distribution of the elements along the profile showed that impounding of the leachate at the barrier layer is linked to higher eluate soluble species concentrations: the tendency of accumulation was observable especially for the zone within and beneath the barrier layer and in the near-bottom samples for the control as well as extended experiments. Concerning a uniform setup the salt distribution along the profile was homogeneous up to gradual. In general the observations indicated that the application of a barrier layer by means of grain size changeover impounds the leachate. Thus, increased concentrations of different species of saline solutions in combination with changing water contents within the layers caused precipitation of the highly soluble salts out of the pore solution. The formation of salt accumulations is time-dependent. Most of the chemical and mineralogical progressions occurred only after a longer period: 	tendencies for the leachate progression changed several times during the long term, 	different processes depend on the pH-value (e. g. if the pH-value decreases Ca-concentrations will increase) and 	this supports the vital importance of long term leaching. A main conclusion is that unsaturated conditions in combination with physical and chemical processes provide conditions conducive for salt accumulations around the zone of the barrier layer. The effects of inhomogeneities because of compaction and/or grain size changeover, as investigated in this research, furnish an explanation for actual observations at the Waldering monofill. In a particular filler part a salt horizon of several meters was encountered. This highly saline layer consists mainly of Halite and Sylvite. Hence there is the possibility that salt accumulations up to salt horizon are generated even in a humid climate. In principle the MSWI-residues afford high contents of saline species. Due to the application of a barrier layer the following advantages can be derived for landfill operations: 	due to their high water retention capacity, salt accumulations cause little amounts of leachate, 	high water retention capacity combined with the intensifying effect of salty crusts within the zone of the fine grained ash layer provides strong buffering concerning rainstorms...|$|R

40|$|Landfilling {{municipal}} solid waste <b>incineration</b> (MSWI) <b>residue</b> alkalizes the waste layer, causing a subsequent decrease in microbial activity and a delay in the decomposition of organic matter. In this study, efficiencies of neutralization of the leachate and organic matter decomposition in the waste layer in a column filled with MSWI residue using aeration and compost addition were evaluated. Total organic carbon (TOC) reduction in the waste layer is large at high oxygen flow rate (OFR). To effectively accelerate TOC reduction in the waste layer to which compost was added, a high OFR exceeding that by natural ventilation was required. At day 65, the pH of the leachate when OFR was above 102 mol-O 2 /(day·m 3) was lower than that when OFR was below 101 mol-O 2 /(day·m 3). At the same OFR, the pH of waste sample was {{lower than that of}} waste sample with compost. Although leachate neutralization could be affected by compost addition, TOC reduction in the waste layer became rather small. It is possible that humic substances in compost prevent the decomposition of TOC in MSWI residue...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobility}} of antimony (Sb) in {{municipal solid waste}} <b>incineration</b> (MSWI) <b>residues</b> often exceeds the limit values stipulated by the European Union. As an ash treatment by washing is conceivable, this work investigated the Sb release from Swedish bottom ash and fly ash when mixed with water. The leaching experiments revealed the factors significantly (á = 0. 05) affecting Sb release from the ashes. The following factors were investigated: Liquid to solid ratio (L/S), time, pH, carbonation (treatment with CO 2), ultrasonics and temperature. The data were evaluated using multiple linear regression (MLR). The impact of the factors could be quantified. The maximum Sb release calculated was 13 mg (kg TS) - 1 for bottom ash and 51 mg (kg TS) - 1 for fly ash. The derived models explained the observed data well. Nevertheless, the calculated values were subject to a high uncertainty. For bottom ash, a lowering of the Sb total content of approximately 22 % could be achieved. If this also involves a sufficient lowering of the Sb mobility to meet EU limit values could not yet be assessed. Chemical equilibrium calculations were performed to explain the empirical results. However, no solid phases controlling Sb release from the ashes could be identified. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
