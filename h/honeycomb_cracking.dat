40|$|Civil {{engineers}} have used Nondestructive Testing and Evaluation (NDT 2 ̆ 6 E) methods based on Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) measurements {{as far back}} as the 1940 ’s to evaluate the condition of new construction and monitor the integrity of the existing infrastructure. A major emphasis in concrete NDT is the evaluation of concrete integrity and the detection of defects such as voids, <b>honeycomb,</b> <b>cracking,</b> and delamination in concrete. The conventional UPV tests (ASTM Standard C 597 - 83) may indicate the presence of a flaw, but are limited in determining the depth (but not the lateral definition) of the flaw. The commercially available UPV systems all use point-by-point measurement approaches that are too slow to economically gather enough information to create images of internal conditions for large concrete areas...|$|E
40|$|A 3 D peridynamic {{formulation}} of the thermo-mechanical problem allows to efficiently simulate the occurrence and propagation of cracks due to extreme thermal loading. The model is weakly coupled since no internal heat generation due to material deformation and damage is accounted for. As such, it is suitable to simulate low strain rate phenomena. Since the typical time scales of the mechanical and thermal systems may differ of several orders of magnitude, using a multirate explicit integration technique {{is suggested by the}} nature of the problem itself. Finally, the proposed formulation is used to model the thermal shock behavior of thin and thick slabs, in order to observe respectively a 2 D ordered set of parallel cracks and a 3 D <b>honeycomb</b> <b>crack</b> pattern addressed as columnar jointing...|$|R
40|$|Nondestructive {{testing of}} {{concrete}} structures {{is one of}} the essential task for estimating or assessing the quality. In order to validate the advanced NDT equipments like Radar and Pulse Echo, a unique large scale reinforced concrete specimen was cast at SERC, Chennai, with columns and beams of different sizes, cross section having different percentages of reinforcement. The defects such as <b>honeycombs,</b> <b>cracks,</b> delamination, presence of conduits, ducts, etc. were also incorporated while casting the large scale reinforced cement concrete specimen. In the present study, the top and bottom slabs were investigated by dividing into grid lines of 50 x 50 mm in both the direction using radar and pulse echo techniques. For radar measurements, 1. 6 GHz antenna was used over the grid lines. The pulse echo technique was adopted with an antenna array of 55 KHz and the data was collected over the same grid points. Two different data analysis programs were used for the analysis of the data. This paper highlights the test results from the application of these two methods Radar and Pulse Echo on the concrete slabs. The need for automatic scanning for both the methods compared to manual measurement is highlighted. The advantages and the limitations of the test methods are als...|$|R
50|$|Open gulls are {{comparatively}} rare in Britain, {{except in}} the central Weald, and they are nowhere better revealed than in the numerous open passages at High Rocks. The Ardingly Sandstone is friable and poorly cemented, but the surface develops a protective crust and displays a variety of micro-weathering features, notably <b>honeycombing</b> and polygonal <b>cracking.</b> The origin of this cracking is problematic but may relate tofreezing and thawing under periglacial conditions during the Pleistocene. This type of cracking is found in Britain only on the sandstone outcrops in the central Weald, and is most strikingly displayed at High Rocks.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present project is to compare the specific impact resistance of hexagonal honeycombs panels used in aeronautical applications with body centred cubic lattice structures. The AlSi 10 Mg lattice structures were produced by laser beam melting and sandwiched, like the honeycomb structures, between 2024 Al sheets. Samples of both types of structures were impacted with energies ranging from 5 to 30 J. For a fixed impact deflection, the sandwiched lattice structure is able to absorb more energy than the honeycomb sandwich. For large impact energies, the cover sheet of the <b>honeycomb</b> presents some <b>cracks</b> while {{this is not the}} case for the lattice structure cover sheet. 3 D X-ray tomography of an impacted honeycomb and lattices structure allows a detailed analysis of the deformation mechanisms. Furthermore, these observations allowed measuring the size of the impacted region...|$|R
30|$|Ultrasound (US) is a {{nondestructive}} {{monitoring technique}} {{used to assess}} the strength and deterioration of concrete. It has been used primarily to characterize concrete strength development (ACI Committee 228 2003), cracking (Aggelis et al. 2009), internal defects such as <b>cracks,</b> <b>honeycombs</b> and inclusions (Jung et al. 2002), porosity and permeability (Lafhaj et al. 2006), setting of high performance concrete (Lee et al. 2004; Trtnik et al. 2013) and deterioration of concrete by alkali-silica reactions (Gong et al. 2014; Ju et al. 2017). Several factors such as moisture content (Ohdaira and Masuzawa 2000), matrix density and porosity (Punurai et al. 2007), and pore fluid viscosity (Povey 1997) influence US measurements of cement-based materials. Increasing the NaCl concentration increases the solution density and viscosity (Lin and Brown 1993), which in turn increases the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and decreases the signal energy, respectively (Herzfeld and Litovitz 2013).|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo major {{helicopter}} blade {{structural defects}} may disturb flight stability before crashes: i. e. debonding of the isotropic skin enveloping the orthotropic materials {{of the leading}} edge (UD glass – epoxy, aluminum <b>honeycomb</b> core) and <b>cracking</b> of the lower and upper surface shields. During beats, the thin metal skin of the leading edge is subjected to tensile stresses followed by compression stresses, capable of causing the Bauschinger effect, defined as a reduction of the elastic limit. Thus {{the purpose of this}} study is to present the dynamic behavior of a composite helicopter blade based on the Westergaard formulation of crack problems and a simulation using the extended finite element method (XFEM). This is followed by a comprehensive discussion on near crack tip fields for a helicopter blade composed of orthotropic materials, in order to develop the necessary enrichment functions for the XFEM formulation. Finally, several numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the validity, robustness and efficiency of the approach proposed to evaluate mode I stress intensity factors and J integrals in composites. The study of the transient behavior allows determining the vibration responses due to unbalance and different excitation modes...|$|R
