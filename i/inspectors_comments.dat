An RSPCA <b>inspector</b> <b>commented</b> that [...] "Some may have been taken by foxes or other natural predators, {{but there is a}} possibility that others may have been stolen or harmed." [...] In 2010 the remaining six birds were given to an animal charity. Knowles said he would stop looking after the chickens as he could no longer bear to see them maltreated.|$|R

Three years later, the scaffolding was dismantled and the eighteen temporary, demountable, classrooms were lifted from the football and rugby pitches during the summer vacation. In November 2000, OFSTED <b>inspectors</b> <b>commented,</b> [...] "The school has had to cope with very difficult working conditions following a major fire in May 1998, which resulted in the loss of 24 classrooms, school offices, resources, equipment and pupils' coursework".

5000|$|The {{use of the}} [...] "not" [...] was {{recorded}} in the 18th century; it was also {{commonly known as the}} 'cwstom', the 'Welsh stick' and the 'Welsh lead' (a lump of lead). The practice was mentioned in the 1847 Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales, which became known as Brad y Llyfrau Gleision, the Treachery of the Blue Books. Though critical of many aspects of Welsh culture, some of the <b>inspectors</b> <b>commented</b> on the existence of the practice of using [...] "nots" [...] as being arbitrary and cruel. The reports did not endorse the practice, and also make it clear {{that the vast majority of}} education in Welsh-speaking communities was still conducted in Welsh.|$|R
5000|$|Design and {{construction}} of school buildings was {{the responsibility of the}} Department of Public Works from 1893. Its staff refined the Department of Public Instruction's existing practice of using standard plans and documentation to eliminate the expense of preparing site- specific documents for every school. In 1909, new standard designs for school residences were developed by the department in response to persistent criticism of the old designs by the School <b>Inspectors.</b> One <b>inspector</b> <b>commented</b> in 1904: [...] "I believe this want of comfort in the matter of residences {{to be one of the}} causes why teachers are so reluctant to accept schools in the Western parts of the State". In order to make the residences more comfortable, the verandas were enlarged, and, in larger residences, a rear veranda was designed to be used for dining or as a sleep-out.|$|R

The aim of the diploma thesis is to describe different CSI's activities and to find out which of them and how influence practice of primary schools in Prague. The results of the analysis of questionnaires, interviews with some headteachers and Deputy Chief School <b>Inspector's</b> <b>comment</b> show that majority of headteacher respondents act upon school inspection report, take inspectors' advice into consideration and follow them.

Mimi comes out to sing [...] "In Pango" [...] Leo Erdody and Ann Levitt ("I roamed all the world seeking gladness, but found in my heart only sadness") accompanied by two guitarists, a percussionist and a female accordionist. At another table, Krogan (Sidney Toler) is sitting with Johnny Pacific (Rick Vallin) and, when Diane serves them drinks, tries to grab her bare arm. As she pulls away, he laughs unpleasantly while, observing disapprovingly from his table, the <b>inspector</b> <b>comments,</b> [...] "rather unusual there". When Burke enters, Krogan tells Johnny Pacific, [...] "the other will be showing up any minute now, when Burke hits this port, Clancy's never far behind". Burke is waiting for Marge in her upstairs room, explaining that Clancy drowned and giving her the pocket watch she once gifted to Clancy.|$|R

Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced that the man was German.|$|R

A plan for the development was submitted for central Government examination on 23 June 2014, and modifications were published in January 2015 following the <b>inspector's</b> preliminary <b>comments.</b> Fareham Borough Council formally adopted the plan for Welborne as part of its statutory Local Plan for the Borough on 8 June 2015.

Openly gay Councillor Steve Radford said, [...] "Liverpool {{has a long way to}} travel in its journey to become a gay-friendly city". Chief <b>Inspector</b> Louise Harrington <b>commented,</b> [...] "We have to strike a balance between a heavy police presence which could scare people off and those that say it makes them feel safer." [...] Liverpool City Council have been working for some time to improve the safety of the area, particularly after dark; Several community safety initiatives are due to be completed by late January 2014 including a high-volume, marshalled Taxi Rank and the installation of gates on Progress Place, a section of Private Land off Stanley Street where many of the attacks in the area have been linked as well as antisocial behaviour.|$|R
