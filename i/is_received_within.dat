50|$|In the Netherlands, most {{types of}} primary laws can be {{subjected}} to a suspensory, non-binding referendum after royal assent and proclamation. The request procedure of a referendum consists of two stages. For the initial request, 10,000 requests have to <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> four weeks after proclamation of the law. After the requirements for this stage are met, 300,000 requests have to <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> six weeks {{after the completion of}} the initial request.|$|R

The data line is set to LOW and remains there {{for a period of}} time, tm, to recognize the transfer timeout [...] If a clock signal (data-output request) <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> that time, the same data will be transmitted again (multiple transmission).|$|E
50|$|The {{time within}} which the {{response}} to a RFE must be sent is indicated on the RFE. It generally varies between 30 and 90 days. If no response <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> the time indicated on the RFE, the USCIS will process the application without considering the additional evidence, which in most cases means a denial (because petitions where there was enough evidence to accept should not have RFEs in the first place).|$|E
5000|$|An actual {{total loss}} of a vessel occurs when repair is {{physically}} or legally impossible. A total loss may be presumed when a ship disappears and no news <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> a reasonable time. Some legal authorities do not consider it an {{actual total loss}} if repair costs are merely prohibitive, while others include cases where the cost of repair would exceed {{the cost of the}} vessel. In any case, the term [...] "legally impossible" [...] covers instances where reconstruction would be so extensive that the resulting craft would be legally considered a new vessel.|$|E

50|$|Maintaining the {{connection}} is done by tickling. DSI provides a mechanism for ensuring that client and server know that the other is still active. Every 30 seconds of inactivity, the server sends a tickle request to the client. Similarly, the client also sends its own tickle. (This is NOT a response packet.) Either the client or server can terminate the DSI session {{if they fail to}} hear from the other for 120 seconds. The client may also disconnect if a request is in flight and neither a response nor tickle <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> 60 seconds (in Mac OS X v.10.2 and later).|$|E
5000|$|Every {{decision}} made under social security law {{is to be}} in writing and given sufficient notice, usually in a letter. Applications for review of such decisions may be lodged at any time, but depending on the decision remedial action may only be taken if the review <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> 13 weeks of receiving notice, for decisions made under the Social Security act, or 52 weeks for decisions made under Family assistance law.

50|$|While {{having some}} {{similarities}} {{to a dead}} man's switch, this type of device (a command loss timer) is not actually a dead man's switch, because it aims to recover from a hardware failure rather than the absence of human operators. It is generally called a watchdog timer, and is also used extensively in nuclear power control systems. System components on a spacecraft that {{put it into a}} safe mode or cause it to execute default behaviors when no command <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> a predefined time window can be considered a dead man's switch, but hardware or software that attempts to receive a command from human operators through an alternate channel is an auto-recovering or adaptive communications system, not a dead man's switch. Voyager 2 recovered from a command receiver failure with a command loss timer.|$|E
5000|$|The REP was {{originally}} {{funded by the}} National Institute of General Medical Sciences in 1966 {{under the direction of}} Dr. Leonard T. Kurland, a neurologist who started his career at the NIH and moved to Olmsted County, Minnesota when he realized the great benefit to medical research that a population-based record linkage system could have. [...] Dr. Kurland considered Olmsted County an optimal location for such a population-based research infrastructure because the county is relatively isolated from other metropolitan centers, almost all medical care <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> the county, and all medical specialties are available to county residents. [...] More recently, the study funding source changed to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, and as of July 2010 the REP is funded by the National Institute on Aging. [...] In September 2016, the REP celebrated 50 years of continuous NIH funding.|$|E
30|$|The scheme then {{sets the}} timer to one RTT {{to wait for}} link level {{retransmission}} of the packets requested in the 3 rd duplicate ACK and continues transmitting new packets without reducing the congestion window. When a new ACK <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> one RTT, the sender cancels the timer as shown in Figure 5. This part overlaps with the scheme in TCP-DCR [8].|$|E
50|$|The request {{procedure}} of a referendum {{consists of two}} stages. For the preliminary request, 10,000 requests have to <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> four weeks after proclamation of the law. Upon completion of this stage, the provisions concerning entry into force {{of the law in}} question are suspended until the procedure has come to an end. For the definitive request, 300,000 requests have to <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> six weeks after the completion of the preliminary request. If this is not successful, the 30% turnout has not been met or the law is approved, then the law can enter into effect by royal decree. If the law is rejected, then the suspension is indefinite and a follow-up law must be enacted that either repeals the law or overrides the suspended provisions to let the law enter into force after all.|$|R

30|$|As soon as {{the station}} has {{received}} the ACK message, it tunes its WLAN card to the channel of the new AP. In case no ACK <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> a timeout period, the station retries up to five times. If no retry is successful, for example, because AP 1 is already out of reach, then the station nevertheless attempts to change the channel and sends a “Handover Initiate” message via AP 2. The OpenFlow switch, just like the station, contains a per station transmission buffer, which is set into the blocking state upon the reception of the pause transmission command. Once the station has tuned its card to the new channel, it sends a “Handover Complete” message to the controller via AP 2 and unblocks its transmission buffer. The controller then resumes the downlink traffic by unblocking its transmission buffer.|$|E
40|$|A {{robotic system}} {{includes}} a tendon-driven end effector, a linear actuator, a flexible tendon, {{and a plate}} assembly. The linear actuator assembly has a servo motor and a drive mechanism, the latter of which translates linearly {{with respect to a}} drive axis of the servo motor in response to output torque from the servo motor. The tendon connects to the end effector and drive mechanism. The plate assembly is disposed between the linear actuator assembly and the tendon-driven end effector and includes first and second plates. The first plate has a first side that defines a boss with a center opening. The second plate defines an accurate through-slot having tendon guide channels. The first plate defines a through passage for the tendon between the center opening and a second side of the first plate. A looped end of the flexible tendon <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> the tendon guide channels...|$|E
40|$|Background: Investigations {{into the}} context and {{causation}} of injury, including injury risks, are {{an essential part}} of the injury prevention knowledge base. Caregiver perceptions of childhood injury risks may assist in the design of safety interventions and influence the way in which an intervention <b>is</b> <b>received</b> <b>within</b> a community. Methods: Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted in two low-income neighbourhoods in South Africa to collect information on caregiver perceptions of injury risks. The data were analysed via thematic content analysis. Results: The results revealed that injury risks are perceived as multifaceted and as contributing synergistically to an injury event. Parents of children also tended to attribute most risks to the environment instead of individual action. Conclusions: Interventions including passive strategies and less activity from the parent may be welcomed in communities. Attention should be given to child injury prevention methods specifically for low-income contexts. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
