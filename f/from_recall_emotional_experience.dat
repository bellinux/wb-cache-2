40|$|This study {{examined}} the relative contribution {{and the nature of}} dimensions underlying intracultural and intercultural differences in the <b>recalled</b> frequency of <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> <b>From</b> 48 nations, 9, 300 participants provided self-reports of the frequency of experienced emotions and several other variables relevant to <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> The data were analyzed by means of multilevel component analysis, which decomposes the data into intracultural and intercultural components. The results showed that positive affect and negative affect emerged as universal dimensions underlying intracultural differences, accounting for the relatively largest part of variance in the data (40 %). These dimensions were related to life satisfaction and other variables reflecting positive and negative affectivity. Two dimensions, reflecting positive emotions and interpersonal (negative) emotions, emerged as dimensions underlying nation-level differences, accounting for a smaller proportion of the variance (6 %). Intercultural differences on these dimensions were related to nation-level life satisfaction, individualism, and the cultural appropriateness of experiencing corresponding emotions.

40|$|Despite the {{important}} theoretical and applied implications, {{there is limited}} experimental research investigating the influence of emotional valence on young children's verbal <b>recall</b> of everyday <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences.</b> This issue was addressed in the current study. Specifically, we investigated young children's (5 – 6 years) <b>recall</b> of <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> presented in six brief stories. To address methodological limitations of the small body of existing literature, we adopted a within participants design in which story content was matched and valence (positive, negative, neutral) was counterbalanced across stories. Fifty-four children were presented the six stories via narrated slideshow, and recall was assessed after delay. Results showed that emotional stories were better recalled than neutral stories and negatively valenced stories were better recalled than positively valenced stories. The recall advantage of negatively valenced information was found for all aspects of each story, suggesting that negative valence renders events particularly memorable. 7 page(s...|$|R

This paper challenges the universality of humiliated fury, and proposes that shame is turned into anger to the extent it is culturally devalued. In two cross-cultural studies (U.

40|$|Memories for <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> are {{influenced}} by a person's mood {{at the time of}} recall. This makes evaluating memory accuracy particularly challenging when asking about the daily experiences of people with a history of depression. People who report depressive symptoms typically experience negative moods and report more negative life experiences. As a result, it is unclear the extent to which their memories reflect a negativity bias based on their negative mood at the time of recall, or instead accurately represent their prior experiences. Using data from a daily diary study (N = 1, 657), the association between meeting criteria for depression in the past year and bias in memory for positive and negative <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> that occurred during the prior week was examined. It was further tested whether trait negative affect (TNA) and trait positive affect (TPA) explained these associations. Overall, people <b>recalled</b> more negative <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>from</b> the past week than they had indicated in daily reports. Recalled negative emotions, but not positive emotions, differed more from daily reports for those with a recent history of depression.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that men and women process emotional stimuli differently. In this study, we examined if there would be any consistency in regions of activation in men and women when processing stimuli portraying happy or sad emotions presented in the form of facial expressions, scenes, and words. A blocked design BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm was employed to monitor the neural activities of male and female healthy volunteers while they were presented with the experimental stimuli. The imaging data revealed that the right insula and left thalamus were consistently activated for men, but not women, during emotion recognition of all forms of stimuli studied. To further understand the imaging data acquired, we conducted the protocol analysis method to identify the cognitive processes engaged while the men and women were viewing the emotional stimuli and deciding whether they were happy or sad. The findings suggest that men rely on the <b>recall</b> of past <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> to evaluate current <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences.</b> This may explain why the insula, a structure important for self-induced or internally generated recalled emotions, was consistently activated in men while processing emotional stimuli.

40|$|Orientation: The {{positive}} organisational behaviour movement emphasises {{the advantages}} of psychological strengths in business. The psychological virtues of positive <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> can potentially promote human strengths to {{the advantages of}} business functioning and the management of work conditions. This is supported by Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory that emphasises the broadening of reactive thought patterns through experiences of positive emotions. Research purpose: A preliminary psychometric evaluation of a positive measurement of dimensions of <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> in the workplace, by rephrasing the Kiefer and Barclay Toxic <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale. Motivation for the study: This quantitative Exploratory Factor Analysis investigates the factorial structure and reliability of the Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale, a positive rephrased version of the Toxic <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale. Research approach, design and method: This Exploratory Factor Analysis indicates an acceptable three-factor model for the Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale. These three factors are: (1) psychological recurrent positive state, (2) social connectedness and (3) physical refreshed energy, with strong Cronbach’s alphas of 0. 91, 0. 91 and 0. 94, respectively. Main findings: The three-factor model of the Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale provides a valid measure in support of Fredrickson’s theory of social, physical and psychological endured personal resources that build positive emotions. Practical/Managerial implications: Knowledge gained on positive versus negative <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> could be applied by management to promote endured personal resources that strengthen positive <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences.</b> Contribution/value-add: The contribution of this rephrased Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale provides a reliable measure of assessment of the social, physical and endured psychological and personal resources identified in Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory.

The research aimed to understand the evolving <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> between people and portable interactive devices (PIDs). Activity Theory was the theoretical framework used to contextualise the research approach and findings. Two longitudinal experiments were conducted investigating <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> with PIDs over six months. Experiment 1 focused on media / entertainment PIDs while Experiment 2 focused on medical / health PIDs. Mixed research methods consisting of diaries, interviews and codiscovery sessions were used to collect data. Results identified that more social interactions were experienced with media PIDs than medical PIDs. Different Task Categories, and their emotional responses, were also revealed including Features, Functional, Mediation and Auxiliary Categories. Functional and Mediation categories were characterised as overall positive while Features and Auxiliary Categories were characterised as overall negative. Further, the consequences of Negative Personal and Social interactions on the overall <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> were determined. For media PIDs, Negative Social experiences adversely impacted the evolving <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> For medical PIDs, both Negative Social and Negative Personal experiences adversely impacted the evolving <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> As a result of the findings the Designing for Evolving <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experience</b> framework was developed, outlining principles to promote positive, and avoid negative, <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> with PIDs.
