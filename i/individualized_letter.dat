40|$|BACKGROUND:Clinicians often {{encounter}} {{information about}} drug-drug interactions (DDIs) during clinical practice. This information is found within product information (hardcopy and electronic) and various electronic systems. Prescribers may receive medication-related communications in practice that are distributed by facsimile (fax), mail, or telephone from pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine if near-real time fax alerts for potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) would influence prescribing. METHODS:A prospective study, in cooperation with a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), was conducted targeting 18 clinically important PDDIs. Fax alerts included an <b>individualized</b> <b>letter</b> to the prescriber with a list of the interacting drugs, PDDI evidence summaries with citations, and recommended clinical management strategies. Among the 18 PDDIs, 13 PDDIs could be assessed for prescription therapy changes using pharmacy claims data. A prospective cohort design was used to evaluate changes in prescription dispensing 90 -days following a PDDI fax alert. RESULTS:A total of 8, 075 fax alerts were sent to prescribers and there were 4, 712 alerts for the 13 PDDIs that could be assessed for change using pharmacy claims data. There were 2, 019 patients (interventions) for which fax alerts were sent to their prescribers who were matched with a control group consisting of patients with the same PDDIs but for whom no fax alert was sent. Overall, this study found 154 (7. 6 %) of patients in the fax alert group compared to 132 (6. 5 %) in the control group had changes in therapy (p= 0. 177). CONCLUSIONS:This fax alert intervention program observed no statistically significant differences in prescribing with a fax alert compared to the control group. If PBMs chose to send individualized, evidence-based information to clinicians regarding drug-drug interactions, this study suggests it may not be an effective intervention to mitigate harm...|$|E
50|$|Bristow {{brought in}} Moriarty {{because of his}} {{previous}} experience managing large numbers of clients in other mass action lawsuits. Hackerman later worked with Moriarty on the NME case in 1994. Moriarty created a computer program that allowed the lawyers to write <b>individualized</b> <b>letters</b> to the 5,800 clients they were managing. He is also credited for suggesting each plaintiff file an individual complaint to state regulators, the SEC, and the National Association of Securities Dealers - a scheme that Eichenwald suggests alerted the SEC to {{the magnitude of the}} Prudential fraud.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{its use in}} the Capture stage, {{when used}} for {{delivery}} COLD prepares output data for distribution and transfer to the archive. Typical applications are lists and formatted output (for example, <b>individualized</b> customer <b>letters).</b> These technologies also include journals and logs generated by the ECM components. Unlike most imaging media, COLD records are indexed not in a database table, but by absolute positions within the document itself (i.e. page 1, line 82, position 12). As a result, COLD index fields are not available for editing after submission unless they are converted into a standard database.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Despite {{reports of}} poor patient understand-ing and recall after cancer consultations, few doctors provide {{communication}} aids. We conducted a random-ized trial comparing {{an audiotape of}} the consultation versus <b>individualized</b> summary <b>letters</b> to patients after their first consultation with a medical oncologist. Methods: One hundred eighty-two cancer patients were randomized to receive either (1) the audiotape fol-lowed 7 to 10 days later by the letter or (2) the letter followed by the audiotape. Outcome measures included patient recall, anxiety and depression, satisfaction with {{and use of the}} communication aids, and patient prefer-ences for six communication options. Demographic and disease variables and information and involvement pref-erences were documented...|$|R
40|$|The Academic Autistic Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE), a {{partnership}} between academic researchers {{and members of the}} Autistic community, has conducted a series of studies to understand the healthcare experiences of autistic adults. We are using what we learned from these studies, as well as the lived experiences of our team members, to create information and tools to improve healthcare for autistic adults. After sharing what we learned from our studies, we will offer tips, ideas, information, and tools that may enable more effective self-advocacy in healthcare settings and reduce barriers to healthcare, including care for acute and chronic medical problems and preventive care. We will cover how to find and evaluate a healthcare provider, what to consider when deciding to make an appointment, how to prepare for a visit, what to expect during a visit, and what types of things to think about after a visit. We will show a tool we made for creating an <b>individualized</b> accommodations <b>letter</b> to give to healthcare providers and office staff...|$|R
