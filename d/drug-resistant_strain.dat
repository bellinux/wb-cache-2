40|$|Background: Approximately 40 % {{of adults}} in Botswana are HIV-infected. The Botswana {{antiretroviral}} program began in 2002 and currently treats 34, 000 {{patients with a}} goal of treating 85, 000 patients (~ 30 % of HIV-infected adults) by 2009. We predict the evolution of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> of HIV that may emerge {{as a consequence of}} this treatment program. We discuss the implications of our results for the World Health Organization's (WHO's) proposed surveillance system for detecting <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> of HIV in Africa. Methods: We use a mathematical model of the emergence of drug resistance. We incorporate demographic and treatment data to make specific predictions as to when the WHO surveillance threshold is likely to be exceeded. Results: Our results show - even if rates of acquired resistance are high, but the <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> that evolve are only half as transmissible as wild-type strains - that transmission of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> will remain low (< 5 % by 2009) and are unlikely to exceed the WHO's surveillance threshold. However,our results show that transmission of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> in Botswana could increase to ~ 15 % by 2009 if resistant strains are as transmissible as wild-type strains. Conclusion: The WHO's surveillance system is designed to detect transmitted resistance that exceeds a threshold level of 5 %. Whether this system will detect <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> in Botswana by 2009 will depend upon the transmissibility of the strains that emerge. Our results imply that it could be many years before the WHO detects transmitted resistance in other sub-Saharan African countries with less ambitious treatment programs than Botswana...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: South Africa {{has a high}} {{burden of}} {{drug-resistant}} tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: Routine drug susceptibility testing was performed prospectively over a 2 -year period on Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in two health districts of the Western Province, South Africa. A cluster of drug-resistant strains that shared a rare mutation in katG 315 was found in 64 of the 450 cases identified as having been infected with drug-resistant TB. Isolates belonging to this cluster were phenotypically and genotypically characterised. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics were used to identify mechanisms leading to the acquisition and spread of this <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strain.</b> RESULTS: An outbreak of an emerging non-Beijing <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strain</b> infecting 64 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases was identified. This previously undetected genotype (now designated DRF 150) is characterised by five IS 6110 insertions, specific spoligotypes {{and high levels of}} resistance to the first-line TB medications isoniazid, streptomycin and rifampicin. In 45 % of the cases it is also resistant to ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Key factors leading to the development and spread of this drug-resistant genotype were inappropriate chemotherapy, poor adherence to treatment and prolonged periods of infectiousness due to delays in susceptibility testing.

40|$|Background. Emerging {{research}} suggests that genetically distinct strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may modulate the immune system differently. Thismay be of importance in high-burden settings where 1 genetic group ofM. tuberculosis confers significant morbidity. Methods. A dynamic mathematical model was constructed to evaluate how different degrees of cross-immunity amongM. tuberculosis groups could affect epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Results. Simulated populations with immunogenically distinct TB strain groups experienced a heightened risk of drug-resistant TB, compared with populations without such strain diversity, even when the same rates of case detec-tion and treatment success were achieved. The highest risks of infection were observed in populations in which HIV was prevalent. <b>Drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> with very low transmission fitness could still propagate in environments with reduced cross-immunity among different strain groups, even after common targets for case detection and treatment success are reached. Conclusions. It {{is possible that the}} propagation of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> could depend not only on the rate of development of resistance and the fitness of the <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> but, also, on the diversity of the strains in the region.

40|$|Abstract Background Mathematical {{models can}} be used to predict the {{emergence}} and transmission of antiviral resistance. Previously it has been predicted that high usage of antivirals (in immunocompetent populations) to treat Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV- 2) would only lead to fairly low levels of antiviral resistance. The HSV- 2 predictions were based upon the assumption that <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> of HSV- 2 would be less infectious than drug-sensitive strains but that the <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> would not be impaired in their ability to reactivate. Recent data suggest that some <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> of HSV- 2 are likely to be impaired in their ability to reactivate. Objectives: (1) To predict the effect of a high usage of antivirals on the prevalence of drug-resistant HSV- 2 under the assumption that <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> will be less infectious than drug-sensitive strains of HSV- 2 and also have an impaired ability to reactivate. (2) To compare predictions with previous published predictions.

Results Our predictions are an order of magnitude lower than previous predictions; we predict that even after 25 years of high antiviral usage only 5 out of 10, 000 immunocompetent individuals will be shedding drug-resistant virus. Furthermore, after 25 years, 52 cases of HSV- 2 would have been prevented for each prevalent case of drug-resistant HSV- 2.

We analyzed voluntary counseling test {{data from a}} hospital in Southern Taiwan to investigate the TDR pattern in Southern Taiwan, the potential relationship between sexual behavior and HIV transmission, and HIV <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strain</b> transmission. MethodsGenotypic resistance assays were performed on treatment-naïve HIV patients recruited from voluntary counseling testing (VCT) in Southern Taiwan from 2007 to 2011.

40|$|Background: Traditionally, {{patients}} with drug-resistant tuberculosis {{are classified as}} having acquired drug-resistant or primary drug-resistant disease {{on the basis of}} a history of previous tuberculosis treatment. Only cases of primary drug resistance are assumed to be due to transmission of drug-resistant strains. Methods: This descriptive study of 63 {{patients with}} drug-resistant tuberculosis assessed the relative contribution of transmission of drug-resistant strains in a high-incidence community of Cape Town, South Africa, by restriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The RFLP results were compared with the results obtained by traditional classification methods. Findings: According to RFLP definitions, 52 % (33 cases) of drug-resistant tuberculosis was caused by transmission of a <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strain.</b> The proportion of cases due to transmission was higher for multidrug-resistant (64 %; 29 cases) than for single-drug-resistant (no cases) tuberculosis. By the clinical classification, only 18 (29 %) patients were classified as having primary drug-resistant tuberculosis (implying transmission). The clinical classification was thus misleading in 25 patients. Interpretation: The term acquired drug resistance includes patients infected with strains that truly acquired drug resistance during treatment and patients who were initially infected with or reinfected with a <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>strain.</b> This definition could lead to misinterpretation of surveillance studies, incorrect evaluation of tuberculosis programmes, and delayed diagnosis and treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant disease.

Results. Transmitted resistance in Botswana will be unlikely to exceed the WHO’s threshold by 2009 even if the rate of acquired resistance is high and the strains that evolve are half as fit as the wild-type strains.
