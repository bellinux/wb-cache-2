The band alignments are estimated empirically {{through the use}} of available Schottky barrier height data, and are compared to theoretically predicted values. Results for tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors with lattice constant values in the range from C through ZnSe are presented. Based on the estimated band alignments and the recently demonstrated p-type <b>dopability</b> of GaN, we propose three novel heterojunction schemes which seek to address inherent difficulties in doping or electrical contact to wide-gap semiconductors such as ZnO, ZnSe, and ZnS...|$|E

The materials lattice match to 0. 5 %. Experimental evidence and theoretical predictions for the band offset blocking minority carrier injection indicate a range from zero to 0. 3 eV maximum. This range of values is the lowest for heterojunctions involving wide-gap II–VI's. Substantial electron injection into the p-ZnTe should be possible.

40|$|Efficient {{modulation}} of the bandgap of In 2 O 3 {{will open}} up a route to improved electronic properties. We demonstrate using ab initio calculations that Tl incorporation into In 2 O 3 reduces the band gap and confirm that narrowing of the gap is observed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy on ceramic surfaces. Incorporation of Tl does not break the symmetry of the allowed optical transitions, meaning that the doped thin films should retain optical transparency in the visible region, in combination with a lowering of the conduction band effective mass.

40|$|Using defect thermodynamics, {{we discuss}} {{physical}} {{factors that affect}} doping limits in semiconductors. The dependencies of the defect formation enthalpy on the atomic chemical potentials and on the electron Fermi energy are demonstrated. These dependencies, in particular on the Fermi energy, lead to spontaneous formation of charge-compensating defects that can limit doping. Experimental data compiled for III-V, II-VI, and I-III-VI 2 compounds support this view and further {{provide insight into the}} connections among different host materials. We argue that what matters is not the magnitude of the band gap that determines the <b>dopability</b> of a material, but rather, the relative position of the conduction-band minimum (in the case of n-doping) and the valence-band maximum (in the case of p-doping) with respect to vacuum...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due to {{its high}} {{radiative}} stability and superior optoelectronic properties, such as wide {{direct band gap}} of ~ 3. 4 eV and high exciton binding energy of ~ 60 meV, ZnO is considered for the fabrication of ultraviolet and visible light emitting and laser diodes, solar-blind photodetectors. Although proof-of-concept devices were already demonstrated, further progress {{in this area is}} slowed down by the difficulties of doping ZnO p-type. Here, we discuss problems associated with doping of ZnO, cover recent progress in this area, and discuss an alternative approach to increase p-type <b>dopability</b> via anion substitution, replacing oxygen with other group VI elements (S, Se, Te). We also propose that these anion-substituted alloys will be extremely promising for fabrication of photovoltaic devices, such as highly efficient thin film solar cells...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the structural and optical properties of Ga-doped ZnO films grown on GaN templates by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. The carrier concentration in Ga-doped ZnO films can be controlled from 1. 33 × 1018 /cm 3 to 1. 13 × 1020 /cm 3. Despite high Ga incorporation, the linewidth of (0002) ω-rocking curves of Ga-doped ZnO films still lies {{in the range from}} 5 to 15 arc min. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Ga-doped ZnO films show dominant near-bandedge emission with negligibly weak deep-level emission, independent of carrier concentration. The PL spectrum exhibits a new emission line at 3. 358 eV, which corresponds to exciton emission bound to a Ga donor.

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} large electronegativity of O 2 p {{character of}} the valence-band maximum (VBM) of ZnO renders it extremely difficult to be doped p type. We show from density functional calculation that such VBM characteristic can be altered by compensated donor-acceptor pairs, thus improve the p-type <b>dopability.</b> By incorporating (Ti+C) or (Zr+C) into ZnO simultaneously, a fully occupied impurity band that has the C 2 p character is created above the VBM of host ZnO. Subsequent doping by N in ZnO: (Ti+C) and ZnO: (Zr+C) lead to the acceptor ionization energies of 0. 18 and 0. 13 eV, respectively, which is about 200 meV lower {{than it is in}} pure ZnO.

Computational modeling of point-defect energetics demonstrates that a complex interplay exists between dopants, thermodynamic parameters, and intrinsic defects in thin films of SrTiO[subscript 3] (STO). We synthesize STO thin films via pulsed laser deposition and explore this interplay between intrinsic defects, doping, compensation, and carrier concentration. Our point-defect analysis (i) demonstrates that careful control over growth conditions can result in the tunable presence of anion and cation vacancies, (ii) suggests that compensation mechanisms will pose intrinsic limits on the <b>dopability</b> of perovskites, and (iii) provides a guide for tailoring the properties of doped perovskite thin films.

40|$|The only II‐VI/II‐VI wide band‐gap {{heterojunction}} {{to provide}} both good lattice match and p‐ and n‐type <b>dopability</b> is CdSe/ZnTe. We have carried out numerical simulations of several light emitter designs incorporating CdSe, ZnTe, and Mg alloys. In the simulations, Poisson’s equation is solved {{in conjunction with}} the hole and electron current and continuity equations. Radiative and nonradiative recombination in bulk material and at interfaces are included in the model. Simulation results show that an n‐CdSe/p‐ZnTe heterostructure is unfavorable for efficient wide band‐gap light emission due to recombination in the CdSe and at the CdSe/ZnTe interface. An n‐CdSe/Mg_(x) Cd_(1 −x) Se/p‐ZnTe heterostructure significantly reduces interfacial recombination and facilitates electron injection into the p‐ZnTe layer. The addition of a Mg_(y) Zn_(1 −y) Te electron confining layer further improves the efficiency of light emission.

40|$|The {{ability of}} CuI to be doped p-type via the {{introduction}} of native defects has been investigated using first-principles pseudopotential calculations based on density functional theory. The Cu vacancy has a lower formation energy {{than any of the}} other native defects, which include I vacancy (V(I)), Cu interstitial (Cu(i)), I interstitial (I(i)), Cu antisite (Cu(I)), and I antisite (I(Cu)). Combined with its shallow acceptor level, it offers sufficient hole concentrations in CuI. The natural band alignments as compared to zinc-blende ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnTe have also been calculated in order to further identify the p-type <b>dopability</b> of CuI. It is found that CuI has a relatively high valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, which also makes it easy to dope CuI p-type in terms of the doping limit rule. In addition, the small effective mass of the light hole-about 0. 303 m(0) -can provide high mobility and p-type conductivity in CuI.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{electronic}} and optical properties of two theoretically predicted stable spinel compounds of the form ZnB 2 O 4, where B = Ni or Cu; neither compound has been previously synthesized, so we compare them to the previously studied p-type ZnCo 2 O 4 spinel. These new materials exhibit spin polarization that is ideal for spintronics applications, and broad conductivity maxima near the valence band edge that facilitate p-type <b>dopability.</b> We show that 3 d electrons on the octahedrally coordinated Zn atom fall deep within the valence band and do not contribute significantly to the electronic structure of the material, while the O 2 p and tetrahedrally coordinated B 3 d electrons hybridize broadly in the shallow valence states, resulting in increasing curvature (i. e., decreased electron effective mass) of valence bands near the band edge. In particular, ZnCu 2 O 4 exhibits high electrical conductivities near the valence band edge that, at sigma = 2 x 10 ^ 4 S/cm, are twice the maximum found for ZnCo 2 O 4, a previously synthesized compound in this class of materials.

For these applications, native point defects play important roles, but only those of SnS have been investigated theoretically in the literature. In this study, we consider the band structures, band-edge positions, and thermodynamical stability of the tin sulfides using a density functional that accounts for van der Waals corrections and the GW 0 approximation. We revisit the point-defect properties, namely, electronic and atomic structures and energetics of defects, in SnS and newly examine those in SnS 2 and Sn 2 S 3 with a comparison to those in SnS. We find that SnS 2 shows contrasting defect properties to SnS: Undoped SnS shows p-type behavior, whereas SnS 2 shows n type, which are mainly attributed to the tin vacancies and tin interstitials, respectively. We also find that the defect features in Sn 2 S 3 can be described as a combination of those in SnS and SnS 2, intrinsically Sn 2 S 3 showing n-type behavior. However, the conversion to p type can be attained by doping with a large monovalent cation, namely, potassium.

In {{the case of a}} p-i-n structured solar cell, the layers are the absorber system, the doped electron and hole transport layers, and the bottom and top contacts. This work focuses on the investigation and characterisation of the transparent hole transport materials PV-TPD, PV-TPDoM, Di-NPB, and MeO-Spiro-TPD, as used in organic p-i-n solar cells. The motivation is to replace the hole transport material MeO-TPD, which has been used so far despite its morphological instability at elevated temperatures, with an energetically and morphologically more suitable material.

They are a critical component as the window electrode in liquid crystal and electroluminescent display devices, {{as well as in}} many designs of solar cells now under development. Sn-doped In 2 O 3 is currently the most important TCO, but it suffers from some drawbacks. These include the high cost of indium, weak optical absorption in the blue-green region, as well as chemical instability that leads to corrosion phenomena in organic light-emitting devices. Indium tin oxide (ITO) films are also brittle and of relatively low durability. A number of other systems are therefore of interest as potential alternatives to Sn-doped In 2 O 3. Recently, CdO has received considerable attention because of its high intrinsic <b>dopability,</b> which coupled with excellent Hall mobilities gives a high electrical conductivity. In the present study we have explored the structure, electronic, and electrical properties of CdO thin films prepared by a simple metalloorganic chemical vapor deposition route. The techniques employed include X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, optical absorption spectroscopy, and luminescence measurements. Electrical properties were characterized by four-point probe and Hall effect measurements in the temperature range between 80 and 460 K.

40|$|By {{employing}} first-principle total-energy calculations, {{a systematic}} {{study of the}} <b>dopability</b> of ZnS to be both n- and p-types {{compared with that of}} ZnO is carried out. We find that all the attempted acceptor dopants, group V substituting on the S lattice site and group I and IB on the Zn sites in ZnS, have lower ionization energies than the corresponding ones in ZnO. This can be accounted for by the fact that ZnS has relative higher valence band maximum than ZnO. Native ZnS is weak p-type under S-rich condition, as the abundant acceptor V-Zn has rather large ionization energy. Self-compensations by the formation of interstitial donors in group I and IB-doped p-type ZnS can be avoided when sample is prepared under S-rich condition. In terms of ionization energies, Li-Zn and N-S are the preferred acceptors in ZnS. Native n- type doping of ZnS is limited by the spontaneous formation of intrinsic V-Zn(2 -); high efficient n-type doping with dopants is harder to achieve than in ZnO because of the readiness of forming native compensating centers and higher ionization energy of donors in ZnS.

Solution-processed thin films of CH 3 NH 3 BaI 3 exhibited a high band gap of approximately 3. 87 eV, which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical estimate of 4 eV. Also, the XRD patterns of the thin films match well with the l-peaks of the simulated pattern obtained from the relaxed unit cell of CH 3 NH 3 BaI 3, crystallizing in the I 4 /mcm space group, with lattice parameters, a = 9. 30 A, c = 13. 94 A. Atom projected density of state and band structure calculations reveal the conduction and valence band edges to be comprised primarily of Barium d-orbitals and Iodine p-orbitals, respectively. The larger band gap of CH 3 NH 3 BaI 3 compared to CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 {{can be attributed to}} the lower electro-negativity coupled with the lack of d-orbitals in the valence band of Ba{ 2 +}.

The growing process of Nd:LSB has been optimized. It is now possible to grow laser crystals with a diameter of 10 - 15 mm and a maximum length of 50 mm. Absorption- and luminescence spectra have been measured, the refractive index has been determined. FIRN has grown crystals with various dopant concentrations and overall lengths in order to optimize the lasing efficiency. Low loss dielectric coatings for the crystals have been developed at Carl Zeiss Oberkochen. The characterization of the laser crystals has been performed using various test resonators. Pumping diodes with a maximum optical power of 10 Watt have been available for the measurements. The result of this analysis is {{that the use of}} Nd:LSB in laser systems is limited to output levels of around 1 Watt due to the relatively low thermal conductivity of the bulk material.

40|$|B 6 O is {{a member}} of {{icosahedral}} boron-rich solids known for their physical hardness and stability under irradiation bombardment, but it has also recently emerged as a promising high mobility p-type transparent conducting oxide. Using a combination of hybrid functional and many-body perturbation theory calculations, we report on the electronic structure and defect properties of this material. Our calculations identify B 6 O has a direct band gap in excess of 3. 0 eV and possesses largely isotropic and low effective masses for both holes and electrons. Of the native defects, we identify no intrinsic origin to the reported p-type conductivity and confirm that p-type doping is not prevented by intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies, which we find act exclusively as neutral defects rather than hole-killing donors. We also investigate a number of common impurities and plausible dopants, finding that isolated acceptor candidates tend to yield deep states within the band gap or act instead as donors, and cannot account for p-type conductivity. Our calculations identify the only shallow acceptor candidate to be a complex consisting of interstitial H bonded to C substituting on the O site (CH) O. We therefore attribute the origins of p-type conductivity to these complexes formed during growth or more likely via isolated CO which later binds with H within the crystal. Lastly, we identify Si as a plausible n-type dopant, as it favorably acts as a shallow donor and does not suffer from self-compensation as may the C-related defects. Thus, in addition to the observed p-type conductivity, B 6 O exhibits promise of n-type <b>dopability</b> if the stoichiometry and both native and extrinsic sources of compensation can be sufficiently controlled. © 2014 American Physical Society...|$|E

This thesis presents {{the investigation of}} semiconductor heterostructures for optoelectronic applications, with particular emphasis on band alignment considerations, strain effects, band structure calculations and characterization by optical spectroscopy. The purpose of the work described here is two-fold. The {{first part of this}} thesis is concerned with the study of novel optoelectronic properties exhibited by Si/Ge superlattices both in the near infrared (interband transitions) and far infrared (intersubband transitions) energy ranges. The second part of this thesis is concerned with establishing the merits of II-VI semiconductor heterostructures for producing visible light emitters, and investigating techniques to improve the <b>dopability</b> of II-VI semiconductors. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we investigate the merits of Si/Ge superlattices for optical applications. Although Si and Ge are indirect band gap materials, Si/Ge superlattices can exhibit a direct band gap for certain layer thickness combinations. In Chapter 2, we show that the optical absorption/emission strengths for interband transitions in Si/Ge superlattices can be enhanced by six orders of magnitude over pure Si or Ge. However, these numbers are still three to four orders of magnitude lower than the optical absorption/emission strengths of direct band gap materials such as GaAs. These results are based on a full zone [ [...] . ] formalism that we developed specifically to study the band structure of Si/Ge superlattices. In Chapter 3, we investigate the intersubband absorption coefficients in doped Si/Ge superlattices. Intersubband transitions in these superlattices make them interesting candidates for long-wavelength infrared detectors. Such infrared detectors are analogous to extrinsic Si detectors, with the additional advantage of tunability of the peak absorption wavelength. The intersubband absorption strengths of Si/Ge superlattices reported in this thesis are comparable to those for AlxGa 1 -xAs/GaAs superlattices, with the additional benefits of the ability to detect normally incident light, and compatibility with the fabrication and processing technology of Si electronics. In the second part of this thesis, we describe investigations of II-VI semiconductor heterostructures for visible light emitter applications. The wide band gap II-VI semiconductors are ideally suited for visible optoelectronics by virtue of their direct band gaps in the blue/green region of the spectrum. However, difficulties associated with doping these materials have severely limited their applications. Low-temperature, epitaxial-growth techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy have opened up new approaches for II-VI materials that show potential for overcoming some of these problems. In Chapter 4, we investigate minority carrier injection in II-VI semiconductors using heterojunctions. We also perform band structure calculations on II-VI strained layer superlattices to investigate the role of strain on the heterojunction band alignments. We experimentally determine the band offsets for CdTe/ZnTe and ZnSe/ZnTe heterojunctions using optical techniques, and remark on the merits of these heterojunctions for carrier injection. We theoretically extended our conclusions to II-VI quaternary alloys and show that there is great promise for visible light-emitter applications within quaternary heterostructures. In Chapter 5, we analyze the role of external electric fields applied during growth in suppressing self-compensation in II-VI semiconductors. This is a novel approach to achieve and control metastability in semiconductors. Our results indicate that II-VI doping efficiencies can be dramatically improved if substantial electric fields are applied during growth...|$|E
