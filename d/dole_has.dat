5000|$|Mondale: [...] "I think uh - Senator <b>Dole</b> <b>has</b> richly {{earned his}} {{reputation}} as a hatchet man tonight, by implying, and stating, that World War II and the Korean War were Democratic wars. Does he really mean to suggest to the American people that there was a partisan difference over our involvement in the war to fight Nazi Germany? I don't think any reasonable American would accept that. Does he really mean to suggest that it was only partisanship that got us into the war in Korea?" ...|$|E
50|$|After {{a bitter}} primary, <b>Dole</b> <b>had</b> secured the Republican nomination—but at high cost, financially and politically.

5000|$|Subsequent {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the impact of Work for the Dole in Australian society and found that because it compels or contracts individuals to contribute, it [...] "may actually weaken their long-term commitment to society", while another has suggested it may be discriminatory because it was found to benefit men but not women.

40|$|Work for the <b>Dole</b> <b>has</b> {{a unique}} {{importance}} as the default option in Australia’s mutual obligation system. The only substantial independent {{review of the}} Work for the Dole program covered a period ending in June 2003.

It confirms that employment outcomes are positive and surprisingly high by international standards. However, {{the changes in the}} program have not brought the increase in effectiveness in Work for the Dole that one would expect. To a large extent this is because Job Network members are slow to see Work for the Dole as a valuable option for particular clients, rather than routinely referring people to Work for the Dole when they reach the mutual obligation legal requirement. ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a widely}} covered speech on May 31, 1995, Republican presidential {{candidate}} Bob Dole attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling [...] "nightmares of depravity".
