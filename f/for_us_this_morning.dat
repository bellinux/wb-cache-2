You can't, naturally, help me to destroy the faculty itself, but you can aid in the defeat of its application to a particular case. It was because you so smiled, before, on that application, that I valued even my minor difference with you; and what I refer to as my loss is the fact that your frown leaves me struggling alone. The best thing for me, accordingly, as I feel, is to get rid altogether of the obsession. The way to do that, clearly, since you've done it, is just to quench the fire. By the fire I mean the flame of the fancy that blazed so <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> What the deuce have you, for yourself, poured on it? Tell me," [...] I pleaded, [...] "and teach me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nov. 23.--You {{will see}} that {{whatever}} turns up, I am sure to be in [...] the wrong. An invitation to Windsor <b>for</b> <b>us</b> came <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and I [...] am sorry to say one including Sunday--Nov. 30 to Dec. 2. I have [...] had a long battle with Peel on the matters of my office; not [...] another syllable. So {{far as it goes}} this tends to make me think he [...] does not calculate on any change in me; yet on the whole I lean the [...] other way. Manning comes up on Monday.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{follow the}} example of all great golfers," [...] Hamel said. [...] "Let <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> at any rate, imagine that your whole world is {{encompassed}} within these eighteen holes. We have been sent here in a moment of good humour by your tyrant uncle. The sun shines, and the wind is from the west. Why not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} for that," [...] says Ballantrae. [...] "For {{there are several other}} {{circumstances}} with which I must acquaint you. First of all, there is no bullet in your pistols, which (if you remember) I was kind enough to load <b>for</b> both of <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Secondly, as there is some one else who knows a passage, you must think it highly improbable I should saddle myself with a lunatic like you. Thirdly, these gentlemen (who need no longer pretend to be asleep) are those of my party, and will now proceed to gag and bind you to the mast; and when your men awaken (if they ever do awake after the drugs we have mingled in their liquor), I am sure they will be so obliging as to deliver you, and you will have no difficulty, I daresay, to explain the business of the keys." ...|$|R
60|$|October 6.--Charles and {{his friend}} Surtees left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "For all that," [...] he added, with an oath, [...] "and if he bursts by the wayside, he {{must bring}} <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to the treasure." ...|$|R
2500|$|My God, I {{wish we had}} [...] 9th Australian Division with <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> [...]—Major General Freddie de Guingand, Chief of Staff, Allied Land-force Headquarters Europe, 1944.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing like it," [...] {{said the}} constable, looking up. [...] "Your missus gave ’em to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> A little gravel on top, {{and there you}} are." ...|$|R
60|$|Obliged {{to give up}} writing to-day--read Pepys instead. The Scotts of Harden were to have dined, but sent an apology,--storm coming on. Russells left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to go to Haining.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] objected Queen Bee, [...] "if {{one of the}} {{children}} is ill, do you think Aunt Roger will like to have <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning?</b> and the post girl could take the jelly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hunting, I think," [...] replied Edward; [...] "at {{least he}} left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{to join the}} Laird of Colmslie and his hounds. I have heard them baying in the glen all day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do mine," [...] Matteo agreed. [...] "In addition, I am hungry, for {{the bread}} they gave <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> was not fit for dogs, {{although}} I {{had to eat}} it, as it was that or nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Louis {{is remarkably}} fond of coming here," [...] said Elsie to Cora, {{who entered the}} room a few minutes later, [...] "but he {{did not come to}} see <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> He only came to ask after Herr Winklemann." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All you anti-railroad fellers {{ought to}} get together," [...] Mr. Bascom suggested; [...] "you've got us terrified since your friend from Leith turned the light of {{publicity}} on <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I hear Ham Tooting's been in and made you an offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's one thing, you old grumbler, it {{is quite}} certain he cannot do worse than you do. My jaws ache now with trying to eat the food you gave <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Another week {{and you would have}} starved the whole band to death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] exclaimed {{the blue}} jay, [...] "we cannot be shot now, for we are stuffed. Indeed, two men fired several shots at <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but the bullets only ruffled our {{feathers}} and buried themselves in our stuffing. We do not fear men now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} stolen a march upon <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> my dear General," [...] said Lord Woodville; [...] "or {{you have not}} found your bed so much to your mind as I had hoped and you seemed to expect. How did you rest last night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|September 4.--Archie Swinton left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> early. I wrote {{from seven}} to half-past two; but, partly that I had five proof-sheets to correct, partly that like old John Fraser[335] [...] "I {{was not very}} cleever to-day." [...] I made out but a page and a half.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your friends {{may have}} {{something}} to say to you," [...] he muttered. [...] "If you think to stop our tongues, you're wrong--wrong, I tell you. The game's up for you, Wingate. The wires that are ruining <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> will be telling of your arrest to-night, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say not so," [...] {{cried the}} Marchioness. [...] "Our son, Lord Mordaunt Muddlenut, is young, handsome, all {{that a girl}} could desire. After months of {{wandering}} he returns to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It is our dearest wish to see him married and established. We offer you his hand." ...|$|R
60|$|My son Charles left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to take {{possession}} of his situation in the Foreign Office. He has been very lucky. Correcting sheets, etc., took up the morning hours. I wrote three leaves before two o'clock. Day bitter cold--with snow, a strong contrast to the mild weather we had last week.|$|R
40|$|I am very honored {{today to}} be visitor in this Indigenous Territory, and I {{would like to}} begin by thanking the Indigenous Nations of Saskatchewan {{for taking care of}} this {{beautiful}} land for so many generations. I would also like to say Meegwetch to the Elders who shared their powerful teachings with <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning...</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "One wouldn't {{believe that}} {{a man of his}} size and {{appearance}} could be so fond of women," [...] said Mr. Cuthbert. [...] "He's the greatest old lady-killer that ever breathed. For two cents he would have come with <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and let a five thousand dollar commission go. Do you know Mrs. Shorter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Blake owes you a rare candle, Merton,' said Bude, adding, 'A {{great deal}} may be done, or said, {{in a long}} walk by {{a young man with}} his advantages. And if you had not had your knife in him last night I do not think she would have {{accompanied}} <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to attend the ministrations of Father McColl. He preached in Gaelic.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{inevitable}} {{third person}} with <b>us,</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> was Monsieur Villeray. Sitting {{at the window}} with a book in his hand--sometimes reading, sometimes looking at the garden with {{the eye of a}} fond horticulturist--he discovered a strange cat among his flower beds. Forgetful of every other consideration, the old gentleman hobbled out to drive away the intruder, and left us together.|$|R
60|$|ROBERTS. Ye told <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> gentlemen, to go {{away and}} reconsider our position. We have reconsidered it; {{we are here to}} bring you the men's answer. [To ANTHONY.] Go ye back to London. We have nothing for you. By no jot or tittle do we abate our demands, nor will we until the whole of those demands are yielded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Hallett, here we are," [...] Lisle {{said the}} next morning, [...] "and thank God {{neither of us}} is touched, except perhaps by a few slugs. Of these, however, I dare say the surgeon will rid <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It {{has been a big}} affair and, if we live to a hundred years, we are not likely to go through such another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to make a disagreeable remark," [...] she announced. [...] "You look ten years older, sir, than you did when you left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to go to the Court. Do me a favor--come to the sideboard." [...] The lawyer having obeyed, she poured out a glass of wine. [...] "There is the remedy," [...] she resumed, [...] "when {{something}} has happened to worry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Even so!' said Charles. 'Charlotte {{says he is}} gone. [...] "Poor Mr. Thorndale left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> after a day {{of private}} conferences, in which he seems to have had no satisfaction, for his {{resolute}} dignity and determination to be agreeable all the evening were"--ahem--"were great. Mabel cannot get at any of the real reasons from Eveleen, though I think I could help her, but I can't tell you."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we thought}} you'd come to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but we turned out early and left Woolwich, {{the best of}} boys, to mind his sisters and came to you instead--as you see! For Lignum, he's tied so close now, and gets so little exercise, that a walk does him good. But what's the matter, George?" [...] asks Mrs. Bagnet, {{stopping}} in her cheerful talk. [...] "You don't look yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|August 7.--My niece Anne leaves <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> summoned {{back from}} one scene of {{distress}} to another. Her uncle, David Macculloch, is extremely ill--a paralytic stroke, I fancy. She is a charming girl, lady-like in thought and action, and very pleasant in society. We are to dine to-day with our neighbours at Gattonside. Meantime I will avail myself of my disposition to labour, and work instead of journalising.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] Abe said, [...] "ye had best look to yer guns, {{for they}} mean mischief; {{they must have}} been {{watching}} <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> when we started, but concluded that the ground was too level, and that we should have time to get into position before they could get up to us, besides we had all the advantage in the stockades at the station. There ain't no station this evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Tyler," [...] he said, in {{his usual}} speech-making style, [...] "when our friend Ben told <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> about your having {{discovered}} Mr. Stubbs's brother, we sent out and got this collar for the monkey, and we take the greatest possible pride in presenting it to you; although, {{if it had been}} something that my Lilly could have made with her own fair fingers, I should have liked it better." ...|$|R
60|$|February 13.--Mr. Macintosh Mackay, {{minister}} of Laggan, breakfasted with <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>This</b> reverend gentleman is completing the Highland Dictionary,[130] and seems very competent for the task. He left {{in my hands}} some papers of Cluny Macpherson, concerning the affair of 1745, from which I have extracted {{an account of the}} battle of Clifton for Waverley. He has few prejudices (for a Highlander), and is a mild, well-mannered young man. We had much talk on Highland matters.|$|R
60|$|August 25.--Mr. Adolphus left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{after a very}} {{agreeable}} visit. We all dined at Dr. Brewster's. Met Sir John Wright, Miss Haig, etc. Slandered our neighbours, {{and were}} good company. Major John Scott there. I did a little more at the review to-day. But I cannot {{go on with the}} tale without I could speak a little Hindostanee--a small seasoning of curry-powder. Ferguson will do it if I can screw it out of him.|$|R
60|$|July 25.--Thomson left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> early. I {{finished}} four pages, {{and part}} of a fifth, then drove to Huntly Burn and returned through the Glen; I certainly turn heavy-footed, not in the female sense, however. I had one or two falls among the slippy heather, not having Tom Purdie to give me his arm. I suppose I shall need a go-cart one of these days; and if it must be so--so let it be. Fiat voluntas tua.|$|R
