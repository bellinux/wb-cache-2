40|$|Globally, {{vegetable}} {{fields are}} {{the primary source of}} greenhouse gas emissions. A closed-chamber method together with gas chromatography was used to measure the fluxes of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions in typical vegetable fields planted with four vegetables sequentially over time in the same field: endive, lettuce, cabbage and sweet corn. Results showed that N 2 O fluxes occurred in pulses with the N 2 O emission peak varying greatly among the crops. In addition, N 2 O emissions were linearly associated with the nitrogen (N) application rate (r = 0. 8878, n = 16). Excessive fertilizer N application resulted in N loss through nitrous oxide gas emitted from the vegetable fields. Compared with a conventional fertilization (N 2) treatment, the cumulative N 2 O emissions decreased significantly in the growing seasons of four plant species from an nitrogen synergist (a nitrification inhibitor, <b>dicyandiamide</b> and biochar treatments by 34. 6 % and 40. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|Introduction: Nitrification inhibitors (NIs) are {{compounds}} that retard the biological oxidation of ammonium to nitrite by depressing {{the activity of}} Nitrosomonas bacteria in the soil. Many popular NIs such as nitrapyrine (NP), <b>dicyandiamide</b> (DCD) and 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) are produced and used in agricultural soils. <b>Dicyandiamide</b> is a very popular NI {{in some of the}} world countries. It delays nitrification process in the soil through its bacterial static property. It is easy to blend with commercial fertilizers such as urea, due to its low volatile nature.

It has several beneficial effects for agriculture and enhances environmental protection. Studying the ammonium oxidation kinetics in the presence of nitrification inhibitor DCD can provide the experts in agriculture with very useful information regarding the ammoniumdurability in different soils.
