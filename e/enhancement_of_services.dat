"Transmitting real-time audio {{or video}} applications over the Internet {{is a challenge}} in the current technology. The motivation for deploying this technology is the reduction in voice communication overheads and the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) provides improved features like flexible call routing, unified messaging and call center and network multimedia applications which in turn provide reduced costs and improvised services for distance learning, customer support, and remote sales presentations.

40|$|HIV {{testing has}} been a {{cornerstone}} ofHIY prevention efforts since 1985 when an accurate and reliable test for the HIY antibody became available (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1994, 2001; World Health Organization, 1990). At present, changes in the technology of testing (e. g., rapid point-of-care testing, home testing) and the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> for specific populations (such as repeat testers or pregnant women) put even greater emphasis {{on the need for}} a clear understanding of what happens when the test is applied and the effectiveness of the pre-test and post-test encounters for HIY prevention and/or treatment. In this study, I sought to enhance our understanding of HIY testing through the investigation of clients ' perspectives on, and conceptualizations of, testing services. Statement of the Research Question To date, most research on HIY testing has been coloured by the assumptions of public health-based service providers. Therefore, research has focussed on desired outcomes associated with HIY testing, particularly HIY risk behaviour change (see summaries in Choi & Coates (1994), Weinhardt et al. (1999), and Wolitski et al. (1997 ». The processes ofHIY testing have received little attention. As a result, our understanding of service functioning and the dynamics of HIY test counselling is rudimentary (Beardsell & Coyle, 1996; Higgins et aI., 1991). At the centre ofHIY testing processes is the test recipient's experience of these processes. The test recipient perspective has been largely neglected in research in this area until very recently. In the broader health and social service sectors, client views of care have received substantial attention over the past several decades. Client participation or 'voice ' {{has been a}}dvocated by those who believe in democratizing programs and service systems (Crossley & Crossley, 2001; Winkler, 1987). In addition, health and human service professionals have increasingly acknowledged that the client's perspective is crucial in the provision of high quality services and programs. This perspective is most noticeable in the trend to client- or patient-focussed care at both the clinical and organizational levels in social and medical services (McLaugWin & Kaluzny, 1999; Rap...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is, therefore, to determine the satisfaction of users with library services at the circulation desk at Walter Sisulu University (WSU), Ibika Campus. The specific objectives of the study are as follows: To determine the levels of satisfaction of users, especially at the circulation desk; to determine the reasons for any dissatisfaction expressed by the users; to determine the use of databases by the users, and to determine how the Ibika Campus library is rated in general. In this study, a survey was used to determine the levels of satisfaction of users with library services. Questionnaires were distributed to hundred and twenty users, and ninety users responded to these. From the findings, it was clear that most of the respondents were in general satisfied with the library services at WSU, Ibika Campus. Dissatisfaction was expressed by approximately twenty percent of the respondents, because of various reasons which include library opening hours, noise level, temperature, photocopying facilities, the accuracy of the searches, including the use of OPAC. There were also some suggestions from the respondents that entail more staffing, training, expansion of the library building, twenty-four hour reading room facilities and more cubicles for senior students and staff. The expansion of the library building may reduce the noise level because there will be more space, and that will limit group discussions inside the library. Group discussions will be done outside the library in the suggested twenty-four hours reading room. In one of the recommendations, it is suggested that library management should provide ongoing training for all library staff. This will result in <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> The training will assist the circulation staff to possess excellent interpersonal skills together with a strong service orientation. Lastly, further research needs to be done on library satisfaction in terms of the problems that have been identified, for example, extension of the library building...|$|E

KEY MESSAGES Planning the project Impact studies may usually be conducted as audit projects, and this avoids the need to obtain research ethics approval. Advice from research governance staff is recommended, and research governance practice varies locally. Human resources will do the random sampling of acute staff for you ? but primary care staff need to be targeted in other ways. Research design Keep questionnaires short, check that the terms on any validated questionnaires will be interpreted as you expect. Use a mix of questionnaire and interview. Calculate the sample size required for your population and the confidence interval you wish for the questionnaire survey. If you do not have time to do a large survey, focus your impact survey on one or two staff groups ? better to get a good response from one staff group than a poor response from all staff groups. Use interviews to collect the details, and the stories, about the way in which information obtained via library service contributed to policy, guidelines, patient care, governance. Target teams, units, and practice development (in the widest sense) to make best use of interview time. Conducting the research Ensure that the accompanying documentation is clear, and indicates any benefits to the potential respondent of participation. Simple descriptive statistics are adequate {{for assessing}} the impact, but when planning <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> some synthesis and interpolation of the findings may be necessary.
