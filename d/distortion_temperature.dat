The type of resin used will primarily determine the corrosion resistance, heat <b>distortion</b> <b>temperature,</b> and surface finish. Resins used in this process must have low viscosities due to the limited pressure differential provided by the vacuum pump. High performance fibers, such as carbon fiber, can also be used.

However, PS is miscible with PPO; it reduces not only the viscosity but also the heat <b>distortion</b> <b>temperature</b> and, consequently, narrows the applications. This paper {{is an attempt to}} develop crystalline additives that will dissolve in PPO at processing temperature but precipitate and recrystallize after molding. Thereby, the additives are able to reduce the viscosity of PPO melts but will not reduce the heat <b>distortion</b> <b>temperature</b> of PPO materials. In the present work, a PPO was compounded with bisphenol-A and bisphenol-S as well as PS separately on Haake Rheometer and the mixing torque was recorded. The dynamic properties of the modified PPO were analyzed with DMA and the mechanical properties were tested at ambient and elevated temperatures. The phase structures were examined with DSC and TEM.

An S-duct inlet used in aircraft gas turbine engines is computationally studied {{for the effects of}} inlet icing and wall heat transfer. A Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) code with k-ω turbulence model is used to simulate the compressible viscous flow in the duct. Engine face distortion is analyzed with particular emphasis on the static <b>temperature</b> <b>distortion.</b> The glaze-ice accretion on the inlet lip, which can significantly impact engine face distortion, is modeled using the numerical icing shape. Inlet lip separation, increased internal blockage, and internal shocks do appear in the S-duct as a result of glaze-inlet icing at freestream Mach numbers of 0. 475 and 0. 85.
