40|$|The {{problem of}} {{assigning}} conference paper submissions to suitable reviewers {{can be viewed}} as a variant of the general problem of technical paper recommendation. In both cases one would ideally like to direct only those papers that are of the greatest interest to the appropriate set of people. Current attempts to automate the conference reviewing process have typically converted it into a task that requires reviewers to rate keywords and sift through long lists of abstracts to find those that are appropriate for their interests and background. In this paper, we propose an automated method for recommending small focused sets of papers to reviewers. We show how <b>intelligent</b> <b>paper</b> recommendation can be performed by combining techniques from information retrieval and database technology, and by mining multiple information sources from the Web. We use abstracts of papers submitted to AAAI- 98 and data mined from the home pages of its program committee members, and we evalu [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Sketches are {{hand-drawn}} informal figures often {{created as}} a way of thinking about or working through a problem. Sketch-understanding systems let users interact with computers by drawing naturally, offering a freedom not available with traditional CAD systems. Sketching is ubiquitous: We draw {{as a way of}} thinking, solving problems, and communicating {{in a wide variety of}} fields, for both design (such as sketches of conceptual designs) and analysis (such as sketches drawn to help puzzle through problems in physics or electronic circuits). Unfortunately in today’s technology, sketches are dead—they’re either graphite on slices of dead trees, or, if captured on a PDA or tablet computer, simply pixels of digitized ink. The Sketch Understanding Group at MIT has been working toward a kind of “magic paper”—that is, a surface that’s as natural and easy to draw on as paper, yet that understands what you draw. What does it mean for the paper to “understand”? One example, in Figure 1, shows some of our earliest work. We use Assist (A Shrewd Sketch Interpretation and Simulation Tool) to sketch simple 2 D physical devices, then watch them behave. 1 Assist understands the raw sketch shown in Figure 1 a in the sense that it interprets the ink the same way we do (Figure 1 b), that is, as an inclined plane with a wheeled cart. As Figure 1 c shows, it hands this interpretation to a physics simulator, which animates the device, giving the user the experience of drawing on <b>intelligent</b> <b>paper.</b> One detail helps illustrate the sense in which the system understands the sketch in a manner similar to a human observer. The wheels (blue circles) are attached to the car’s body with pin joints (pink circles), yet the user draws both the wheels and pin joints with the same geometric shape—a circle. The system interprets a circle differently based on context—a circle can be a pin joint only if it’s drawn over two bodies that are already overlapping (in this case the car body and the wheel). We’ve built sketch-understanding systems for a variety of domains, including the simple physics sketche...|$|E
