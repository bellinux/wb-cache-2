40|$|The {{stability}} of hydrocarbon ion exchange membranes {{is one of}} the critical issues for a flow battery. However, the degradation mechanism of ion exchange membranes has been rarely investigated especially for anion exchange membranes. Here, the degradation mechanism of polysulfone based anion exchange membranes, carrying pyridine ion <b>exchange</b> <b>groups,</b> under vanadium flow battery (VFB) medium was investigated in detail. We find that sp(2) hybrid orbital interactions between pyridinic-nitrogen in 4, 4 '-bipyridine and benzylic carbon disrupt the charge state balance of pristine chloromethylated polysulfone. This difference in electronegativity inversely induces an electrophilic carbon center in the benzene ring, which can be attacked by the lone pair electron on the vanadium(V) oxygen species, further leading to the degradation of polymer backbone, while leaving the 4, 4 '-bipyridine ion <b>exchange</b> <b>groups</b> stable. This work represents a step toward design and construction of alternative type of chemically stable hydrocarbon ion exchange membranes for VFB...|$|R
