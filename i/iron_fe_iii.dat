40|$|This work {{deals with}} an {{industrial}} research on ecological innovative descaling treatments for stainless steels, in substitution of the acid etching process: {{from the study}} and the research on samples, the most efficient techniques and their application to industrial purpose are explained. The research has basically covered the study of two pre-finishing treatments (high pressure water blasting and “dry ice”-blasting) and two etching treatments (electropolishing with ionic liquids and in aqueous media). In the field of stainless steels, the surface oxide of <b>iron</b> <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> is combined with the multiple elements added to alloys {{in order to increase}} their characteristics (carbon, chromium, nickel and other). Moreover, the surface oxide is presented as a layer very tenacious and compact. In addition, heat treatment leads to the formation of a layer without chromium more readily attacked by oxygen from the atmosphere. Surface treatments are required to remove the surface oxide and recover the chromium layer. The chemical pickling, {{that is one of the}} most common etching processes, depends on many factors, such as the size of the pieces, the type of plant, the type of alloy et al. In general, the traditional solutions contain from 10...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{extracellular}} production of superoxide in {{cultures of the}} marine diatoms Thalassiosira weissflogii and Thalassiosira pseudonana. In EDTA-buffered media with; 45 pmol L 21 <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> (<b>III)</b> 9, over half the Fe(III) reduction is mediated by extracellular O production. Surprisingly, even though we saw a consistent inhibition of 22 Fe reduction {{by the addition of}} superoxide dismutase (SOD) and enhancement of Fe reduction due to superoxide production using the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system (X-XO), we observed no effect of SOD or X-XO on Fe uptake in these cultures. We also observed no effect of SOD on the uptake of Fe from either ferrihydrite, an Fe-labeled porphyrin, or as regenerated by metazoan grazers. Our data reveal that Fe(II) 9 is formed by O via the 22 reduction of Fe(III) 9 rather than by the reduction and dissociation of FeEDTA complexes in EDTA-buffered media. This bulk-phase reduction of Fe(III) 9 by O is a ‘‘futile’ ’ reductive step, as the Fe(II) 9 formed is rapidly reoxidized 22 to Fe(III) 9 in pH 8 oxygenated seawater. One of the major recent discoveries within the field of biological oceanography is that the growth of phytoplankton, particularly of diatoms, is limited by the availability of iron (Fe) in several oceanic regions (Martin et al. 1994; Boyd e...|$|E
40|$|Iron oxy-hydroxides in soil {{are known}} to have a large {{affinity}} for arsenate (As(V)) inorganic species. At the soil–root interface such mineral components are embedded by mucilaginous material that is secreted from continuously growing root cap cells. In order to determine the role of plant mucilages in As(V) sorption by iron oxy-hydroxides, we layered a calcium (Ca) -polygalacturonate network (CaPGA) on to amorphous <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> (<b>III)</b> hydroxide (ferrihydrite, Fh) particles. The scanning electron micrographs of the CaPGA network coating the ferrihydrite (Fh–CaPGA) show a regular structure with a honeycomb-like pattern where interlacing fibrils form a porous system. The FT-IR spectra of Fh–CaPGA suggest that CaPGA fibrils are retained by the surface Fe(III) nuclei of Fh through electrostatic interactions. The sorption experiments carried out at pH 4. 3 and 5. 8 indicated a smaller amount of As(V) sorbed by Fh–CaPGA than by Fh alone, being less after 3 and 24 [*]hours of reaction by about 70 and 30 %, respectively. The sorption of As(V) by Fh was also studied in the presence of caffeic acid (CAF), an important root exudate. Simultaneous sorption kinetics show that As(V) sorption by Fh is almost independent of CAF concentration, indicating a greater affinity of arsenate ions towards the Fh surfaces. However, the amount of As(V) sorbed by the Fh coated by CaPGA, in the presence of 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 [*]mm[*]CAF, is markedly smaller by about 20, 27 and 40 %, respectively, than that found in the As(V) –CAF-Fh ternary systems. This is caused mainly by redox reactions involving CAF and the surface Fe(III) nuclei of Fh leading to the formation of CAF oxidation products which prevent As(V) sorption...|$|E

40|$|The iron is an organogenous {{chemical}} element which, although in small quantities, is absolutely needed for live. The iron can {{be present in}} nature under 2 forms: bivalent or trivalent. Microorganism has an important role concerning the iron circuit in the biosphere. The iron cycle has 4 microbial processes: mineralizing the organic iron, forming the organic compounds with iron, the bivalent iron oxidity and {{the reduction of the}} trivalent <b>iron.</b> The <b>Fe</b> <b>III</b> and <b>Fe</b> II reduction, under the action of iron reductive bacteria, has a biological significance and a special a practical importance. Several proceedings used in mining, pottery and in the discovery of toxicity of certain compounds, at the level of anaerobic environment, are based on this process of reduction. The <b>Fe</b> <b>III</b> and <b>Fe</b> II reductive process can also have dangerous negative effects, due to the huge quantity of the accumulated Fe II. This huge quantity of Fe II is a big problem for the level of underground water, because Fe II compromises the water quality and the damaged metal plumbing.

40|$|The {{ability of}} amosite cored {{asbestos}} bodies isolated from human lungs to catalyse damage to phi X 174 RFI DNA in vitro was measured and {{compared with that}} of uncoated amosite fibres with a similar distribution of length. Asbestos bodies (5000 bodies) suspended for 30 minutes in 50 mM NaCl containing 0. 5 micrograms phi X 174 RFI DNA, pH 7. 5, did not catalyse detectable amounts of DNA single strand breaks. Addition of the reducing agent ascorbate (1 mM), however, resulted in single strand breaks in 10 % of the DNA. Asbestos bodies {{in the presence of a}} low molecular weight chelator (1 mM) and ascorbate catalysed the formation of single strand breaks in 21 % of the DNA with citrate or 77 % with ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), suggesting that mobilisation of iron may increase damage to DNA. Preincubation for 24 hours with desferrioxamine B, which binds <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe</b> (<b>III))</b> and renders it redox inactive, completely inhibited the reactivity of asbestos bodies with DNA, strongly suggesting that iron was responsible. Amosite fibres (5000 fibres/reaction), with a similar length distribution to that of the asbestos bodies, did not catalyse detectable amounts of single strand breaks in DNA under identical reaction conditions. The results of the present study strongly suggest that iron deposits on the amosite core asbestos bodies were responsible for the formation of DNA single strand breaks in vitro. Mobilisation of iron by chelators seemed to enhance the reactivity of asbestos bodies with DNA. It has been postulated that the in vivo deposition of the coat material on to fibres may be an attempt by the lung defenses to isolate the fibre from the lung surface and thus offer a protective mechanism from physical irritation. These results suggest, however, that the iron that is deposited on asbestos fibres in vivo may be reactive, potentially increasing the damage to biomolecules, such as DNA, above that of the uncoated fibres...|$|E
40|$|Drained thaw {{lake basins}} (DTLB) are the {{dominant}} land {{form of the}} Arctic coastal plain in northern Alaska. The presence of continuous permafrost prevents drainage and so water tables generally remain close to the soil surface, creating saturated, suboxic soil conditions. However, ice wedge polygons produce microtopographic variation in these landscapes, with raised areas such as polygon rims creating more oxic microenvironments. The peat soils in this ecosystem store large amounts of organic carbon which is vulnerable to loss as arctic regions continue to rapidly warm, {{and so there is}} great motivation to understand the controls over microbial activity in these complex landscapes. Here we report the effects of experimental flooding, along with seasonal and spatial variation in soil chemistry and microbial activity in a DTLB. The flooding treatment generally mirrored the effects of natural landscape variation in water table height due to microtopography. Areas in the flooded areas had lower dissolved oxygen, lower oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and higher pH, as did lower elevation areas of the landscape. Similarly, soil pore water concentrations of dissolved ferric <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe</b> <b>III),</b> organic carbon, and aromatic compounds were higher in flooded and low elevation areas. Dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) concentrations were higher in low elevation areas. In anaerobic laboratory incubations, more CH 4 was produced by soils from low and flooded areas, whereas anaerobic CO 2 production only responded to flooding in high elevation areas. Seasonal changes in the oxidation state of solid phase Fe minerals showed that significant dissimilatory Fe reduction occurred, especially in topographically low areas. This suite of results can all be attributed to the effect of water table on oxygen availability: flooded conditions promote anoxia, stimulating anaerobic processes, methanogenesis and Fe(III) reduction. Flooding also increased soil temperature, which might account for the higher N mineralization rates and dissolved P concentrations observed in flooded areas, though the latter could also have resulted from solubilization of Fe-P minerals under more reducing conditions. Overall, the results indicate that the microbial community is well-adapted for anaerobic respiration, in particular, dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction, and could have implications for some high Arctic areas where warming and flooding are likely consequences of climate change...|$|E
40|$|Sequential {{injection}} analysis (SIA) {{that was}} developed in 1990 is a simple, versatile and automated technique based on precise aspiration of small volumes of reagents and samples into a single channel. It is economical in terms of reagent consumption and waste generation. SIA is applied to food, environmental and pharmaceutical samples. SIA parameters and the chemical variables are optimized and figures of merit are reported. Spectrophotometer {{has been used as}} a detector in the analysis of formaldehyde (HCHO), ascorbic acid and ferric <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe</b> (<b>III)).</b> A stopped flow method was adapted to SIA spectrophometric technique. Enhanced sensitivity was obtained using a stopped flow method as compared to a non-stopped flow method. The SIA spectrophotometric determination of Fe (III) through complex formation with the thiocyanate and the Tiron reagents has been studied in chapter 3. The two methods were compared based on convenience, sensitivity, simplicity, reliability and on general application. Both methods are simple, employ readily available reagents and have lower detection limits and shorter analysis time of 72 samples per hour. The thiocyanate method enabled the determination of Fe (III) in the linear range of 2 to 50 mg/ℓ with a detection limit of 0, 2 mg/ℓ whereas the Tiron method provided a linear range of 1 to 50 mg/ℓ with a detection limit of 0, 1 mg/ℓ. Chapter 4 presents the application of SIA spectrophotometric method for the determination of formaldehyde in wastewater. The method is based on the inhibition of brilliant green-sulfite reaction by formaldehyde. The kinetic method was implemented by stopping the flow when the complex reaches the detector and the measurements were taken as the reaction proceeds. The SIA method was compared with the chromotropic acid method and the paired t-test was used to determine whether the results obtained by the two methods differ significantly. Good sensitivity with a detection limit of 0, 06 mg/ℓ and a wider linear range of 1 - 3 mg/ℓ was achieved. Chapter 5 describes the indirect determination of ascorbic acid in pharmaceutical samples, sweets and beverage (orange juice). This method is based on reduction of Fe (III) to ferrous iron (Fe (II)) by ascorbic acid under UV-light irradiation and the reaction of generated Fe (II) with 1, 10 -phenanthroline. The flow was stopped in the holding coil for a defined time to ensure that complete reduction process take place under irradiation. Photochemical reaction methods improved the sensitivity with detection limit of 0, 06 mg/ℓ. Good precision was obtained with relative standard deviation of 1, 3 %. The method compared well with the N-bromosuccinimide titration method. The versatility and simplicity of SIA technique makes it suitable to different requirements of various analytical problems.

40|$|Viscoelastic {{surfactant}} (VES) -based acid {{systems have}} been used successfully in matrix and acid fracturing treatments. However, the existence of <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> as a contaminant in such systems may lead to many problems, due to interactions between VES and <b>Fe</b> (<b>III).</b> Such interactions can reduce the effectiveness of VES-based acid systems and potentially lead to formation damage. In this study, two VES?s were selected and reaction mechanisms between VES and <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> were studied. Rheological properties of these two surfactants were examined with various concentrations of <b>Fe</b> (<b>III).</b> An energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to identify precipitates from reaction products.

40|$|Chlorinated solvents, such as {{trichloroethene}} (TCE), {{are major}} groundwater contaminants that often persist as dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in subsurface environments. Microbial reductive dechlorination as a polishing step after physical-chemical treatments is a promising approach for the remediation of TCE-DNAPL source zones and dechlorination activity {{at or near}} the source zones can enhance DNAPL dissolution. The physicochemical properties of the aquifer can affect the microbial dechlorination activity and, hence, the TCE DNAPL dissolution. This dissertation explores the influence of geochemical factors on TCE dechlorination, more in particular the competition between microbial reduction of iron (III) minerals and dechlorination processes. Thermodynamic considerations as well as observed threshold hydrogen concentration show that <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> reducers can compete with anaerobic TCE dechlorinators. This competition can impede the enrichment of dechlorinating populations and inhibit anaerobic reductive dechlorination. All studies were performed by inoculating matrices with a mixed dechlorinating culture (KB- 1) that also contain <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> reducers in order to limit the influence of the composition of the microbial communities on the microbial processes; all studies used formate as electron donor. In a first part, the influence of the quantity and mineralogy of <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> minerals on TCE dechlorination was investigated. A matrix extraction procedure for testing bioavailable <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> in sediments was also calibrated. Experiments were performed in batches with either 1) variable amounts of ferrihydrite or 2) with 14 different <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> minerals coated onto or mixed in with quartz sand at constant total Fe and at a stoichiometric excess <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> over electron donor. At constant total Fe in the sand, TCE dechlorination time varied with Fe mineralogy between 8 days (no Fe added) to > 120 days (Fe-containing bentonite). Poorly crystalline <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> minerals increased the dechlorination time whereas crystalline <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> minerals such as goethite or hematite had no effect. The TCE dechlorination time increased with increasing total reduced Fe and with increasing surface area of the <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> minerals. Extractable <b>Fe</b> determined based on <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> reduction using NH 2 OH. HCl predicted the competitive inhibition of TCE degradation in these model systems. This study shows that Fe mineralogy rather that total Fe content determines the competitive inhibition of TCE dechlorination. In a second part, the H 2 pressure was measured during dechlorination in presence and absence of <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> to determine critical H 2 for the different terminal electron accepting reactions (TEAP) in the system. Different natural and synthetic Fe containing matrices were used and compared. Iron (III) and Mn (IV) reduction limited microbial dechlorination by decreasing the level of H 2 in the system and subsequently resulted in a H 2 limited condition. The H 2 measurements indicated that a wide concentration range of H 2 is possiblefor different TEAPs in these systems and that these TEAPs can therefore occur concurrently rather than exclusively. Differences in <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> bioavailability and, hence, <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> reduction partially explain this wide range. The distinction between dechlorination and other microbial reduction processes based on H 2 concentrations threshold values is not feasible under such conditions. Dechlorination leads to acidification and slows down dechlorination. In addition, acidification facilitates <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> reduction because of increased <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> solubility. In a third part, it was investigated if acidification and <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> reduction have a synergistic inhibition on reductive dechlorination. Two common aquifer <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> minerals, goethite and ferrihydrite and sand only as control were studied in batch bottles at different solution pH values (6. 2 - 7. 2). In the absence of Fe, lowering matrix pH between 7. 2 to 6. 2 increased the time for TCE degradation. At pH 7. 2, goethite did not affect TCE degradation time while ferrihydrite increased it. Iron reduction in ferrihydrite increased between pH 7. 2 and 6. 5 but decreased by further lowering pH to 6. 2, likely due to reduced microbial activity. This study confirms that TCE reduction is increasingly inhibited by the combined effect of acidification and bioavailable <b>Fe</b> (<b>III),</b> however no evidence was found for synergistic inhibition since Fe reduction did not increase as pH decreased. A fourth part of this work examined to what extent <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> minerals affect dechlorination in environmental samples. Seventeen environmental matrices with contrasting properties (pH 3. 5 - 11; total Fe 0. 1 - 87 g kg- 1, total Fe (II) 0. 05 - 2 % of total Fe) were inoculated in unbuffered media with 1 mM TCE and 9 mM formate, sufficient for complete TCE dechlorination. The time for 90 % conversion of TCE to cis-DCE ranged 5 - > 100 days with only partial or no dechlorination past cis-DCE {{due to the lack of}} electron equivalents. Reduction of <b>Fe</b> (<b>III),</b> SO 42 -and NO 3 - was detected in almost all treatments. The TCE and cis-DCE dechlorination was completely inhibited below pH 4. 3, above pH 10. 5 and in matrices where Fe reduction was highest. No cis-DCE degradation was observed below pH 5. 9. The TCE dechlorination time and the inhibition of cis-DCE dechlorination increased with increasing concentrations of available <b>Fe</b> (<b>III),</b> determined with citrate bicarbonate extraction for matrices between pH 4. 3 - 10, however statistical effects were small (R 2 < 0. 30). Weak Fe extraction methods such as the citrate bicarbonate ascorbate extraction determines bioavailable <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> in the matrix and predict the stoichiometric requirements of electron donor to overcome inhibition of dechlorination. The fifth part of this study assessed the role of <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> minerals on the bio-enhanced dissolution of a TCE DNAPL. Columns were set up as 1 -D diffusion-cells consisting of a lower DNAPL layer, a layer with an aquifer matrix and an upper water layer that is regularly refreshed with formate containing medium. The matrices were either inert sand, inert sand coated with 2 -line ferrihydrite (HFO) and two environmental Fe containing matrices. In none of the diffusion cells, vinyl chloride or ethene was detected while dissolved and extractable Fe (II) increased strongly during 60 days incubation. The cis-DCE concentration peaked at 4. 0 cm from the DNAPL (inert sand) while it was at 3. 4 cm (sand + HFO), 1. 7 cm and 2. 5 cm (environmental samples). The TCE concentration gradients near the DNAPL indicate that the DNAPL dissolution rate was larger than that in an abiotic cell by factors 1. 3 (inert sand), 1. 0 (sand + HFO) and 2. 2 (both environmental samples). This results show that high bioavailable <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> in the HFO reduces the TCE degradation by competitive <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> reduction, yielding lower bioenhanced dissolution. However, <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> reduction in the environmental samples was not affecting bioenhanced dissolution which was even larger than in inert sand. It is speculated that physical factors, e. g., micro-niches in the environmental samples, protect microorganisms from toxic concentrations of TCE. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> reduction can limit the overall dechlorination rate and bioenhanced dissolution. Amorphous <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> oxyhydroxides are readily reduced and largely inhibit dechlorination whereas crystalline <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> oxyhydroxides have weak or no effects. Effects of Fe on dechlorination past cis-DCE are larger than on TCE and this deserves further study. The occurrence of multiple terminal electron acceptors increase the electron donor consumption and result in a cis-DCE or VC stall due to the electron donor limitation. Addition of surplus electron donor without calculations can overstimulate methanogens and also can increase the bioremediation costs. Thus, a stoichiometric calculation of electrons equivalents is necessary to match the <b>Fe</b> (<b>III)</b> reduction. Citrate bicarbonate ascorbate extraction is recommended as a simple matrix Fe extraction assay in order to approximate the electron equivalents necessary for depleting the bioavailable Fe fraction. Acid pH conditions can severely limit the dechlorination and iron reduction can acts as an additive stress factor in the acid systems limiting the microbial dechlorination capacity.

The kinetics of the {{reaction of}} CN with <b>Fe</b> <b>III</b> (TMPS) - (CN) (H 2 O) was studied {{as a function of}} temperature and pressure. The positive value of the activation volume for the formation of <b>Fe</b> <b>III</b> (TMPS) (CN) 2 is consistent with the opera- tion of a dissociatively activated mechanism and con fi rms the six-coordinate nature of the monocyano complex. A good agreement between the rate constants at pH 8 and 9 for the formation of the dicyano complex implies the presence of water in the axial position trans to coordinated cyanide in the monocyano complex and eliminates the existence of <b>Fe</b> <b>III</b> (TMPS) (CN) (OH) under the selected reaction conditions. Both <b>Fe</b> <b>III</b> (TMPS) - (CN) (H 2 O) and <b>Fe</b> <b>III</b> (TMPS) (CN) 2 bind nitric oxide (NO) to form the same nitrosyl complex, namely, Fe II (TMPS) (CN) - (NO þ). Kinetic studies indicate that nitrosylation ofFe III (TMPS) (CN) 2 follows alimiting dissociative mechanism that issupported by the independence of the observed rate constant on [NO] at an appropriately high excess of NO, and the positive values of both the activation parameters Δ S q and Δ V q found for the reaction under such conditions. The relatively small fi rst-order rate constant for NO binding, namely, (1. 54 (0. 01) 10 2 s 1, correlates with the rate constant for CN release from the <b>Fe</b> <b>III</b> (TMPS) (CN) 2 complex, namely, (1. 3 (0. 2) 10 2 s 1 at 20 ° C, and supports the proposed nitrosylation mechanis...|$|R

Phytoremediation technique is more conducive and preferable technique in terms of monetary and effectivity. Mining activities in Kelantan surge up the iron contamination in soil, water and air. In this study, the potential of Ipomoea aquatica as iron hyperaccumulator has been investigated. The phytoremediation mechanism of Ipomoea aquatica were analysed by screening the amount of <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> accumulated in the leaf, shoot and root of Ipomoea aquatica plant via X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) technique. The independent variable {{in this study was}} the <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> concentration levels induced on red soil, ranging from 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg. After 40 days of exposure, the plants were harvested and segment accordingly for analysis. Results showed the maximum <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> accumulation (266. 0 ± 4. 770 mg/kg) was found on concentration level 150 mg/kg. Where the amount of <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> found in the root was 158. 0 ± 6. 083 mg/kg, followed by leaf (71. 3 ± 2. 443 mg/kg) and shoot (36. 7 ± 1. 572 mg/kg) [root > leaf > shoot]. There was a strong correlation between soil pH, organic matter, temperature and soil texture to the bioavailability of <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> in soil for plant uptake. Therefore, the above statements prove that Ipomoea aquatica which has phytoremediation characteristics could reduce the <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> contamination level in soil. Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) and Translocation Factor (TF) values also show vital relationship to the phytoremediation ability of Ipomoea aquatica. Based on the BCF and TF values, Ipomoea aquatica sh ows a great potential as <b>iron</b> (<b>Fe)</b> hyperaccumulator in applying phytoextraction and phytostabilization mechanisms...|$|R
