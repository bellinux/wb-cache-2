40|$|This paper {{documents}} a {{study that}} drove {{the development of a}} mathematical expression in the minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) of detect-and-avoid (DAA) systems for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This equation describes the conditions under which vertical maneuver guidance could be provided during recovery of well clear separation with a non-cooperative VFR aircraft in addition to <b>horizontal</b> maneuver <b>guidance.</b> Although suppressing vertical maneuver guidance in these situations increased the minimum horizontal separation from 500 to 800 feet, the maximum severity of loss of well clear increased in about 35 of the encounters compared to when a vertical maneuver was preferred and allowed. Additionally, analysis of individual cases led to the identification of a class of encounter where vertical rate error had a large effect on horizontal maneuvers due to the difficulty of making the correct left-right turn decision: crossing conflict with intruder changing altitude. These results supported allowing vertical maneuvers when UAS vertical performance exceeds the relative vertical position and velocity accuracy of the DAA tracker given the current velocity of the UAS and the relative vertical position and velocity estimated by the DAA tracker. Looking ahead, these results indicate a need to improve guidance algorithms by utilizing maneuver stability and near mid-air collision risk when determining maneuver guidance to regain well clear separation...|$|R
40|$|Aims and Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of direct and indirect face-bow transfer on the <b>horizontal</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> (HCG) values obtained on the semi-adjustable articulator. Materials and Methods: A total of 15 subjects of age 20 - 30 years, of either sex were selected. Two sets of maxillary and mandibular casts were obtained. A single arbitrary face-bow record was used for mounting the maxillary casts by direct and indirect transfer for each subject. The mandibular casts were mounted using maximum intercuspation record. Protrusive records were made in Alu wax and used to program the directly and indirectly transferred casts. HCG values obtained from cephalometric records were taken as control. The data was subjected to ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test. Results: Mean values of HCG obtained in direct face-bow transfer were 24. 93 °, indirect transfer − 27. 66 °, and cephalometric analysis − 32. 73 °. One-way ANOVA test {{indicated that there was}} a significant difference between all the groups (P < 0. 05). Tukey′s test with Bonferroni′s correction (P < 0. 01) was significant for direct and indirect transfer (P = 0. 008), and direct transfer and cephalometric readings (P = 0. 0046). A nonsignificant difference was found between indirect transfer and cephalometric readings (P = 0. 047). Conclusion : There is a statistically significant difference in HCG values obtained from direct and indirect face-bow transfer records. Lateral cephalograms gave higher mean HCG values than those obtained from protrusive records. Mean HCG values obtained from indirect face-bow transfers are significantly more than those obtained from direct transfers and are also closer to the values obtained from the lateral cephalograms...|$|R
40|$|Context: Many {{authors have}} {{conducted}} studies that determine <b>horizontal</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> (HCG) using various methods, articulator systems, and recording materials. However, {{there is a}} dearth of literature on variability existing in HCG in individuals with different skeletal relationships. This study {{is an attempt to}} verify whether such a difference exists or not. Aims: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine and correlate the HCG in individuals with Angle's Class I, Class II, and Class III malocclusion using radiographic and clinical methods. Settings and Design: HCG was recorded for thirty individuals, ten of each class. For each individual, HCG was recorded clinically as well as radiographically. Subjects and Methods: Clinically, HCG was recorded using protrusive check bites and a semi-adjustable articulator. Radiographically, two methods were employed. First, a “tangent method” wherein the angle made by a tangent to the posterior slope of articular eminence with the Frankfurt horizontal (FH) plane was considered as the HCG, and second, a “protrusive method” where the position of the condyle at maximum intercuspation and 6 mm protrusion were traced, and the angle this path made with the FH plane was recorded as the HCG. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis along with Tukey's test and analysis of variance was used to calculate and compare the mean values. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to establish correlation between various means. Results: A significant difference in the HCG of three skeletal relationships was seen, with Class II having a steeper angle than the other two. Among the various methods used, a correlation was found between the clinical and the protrusive method; however, the tangent method yielded greater values of HCG. Conclusions: The average value of HCG should not be used as it differs according to the skeletal relationship. Radiographic method can be used to yield consistent HCG; however, the protrusive method should be employed...|$|R

5000|$|One prototype, {{developed}} in 1944. In April 1944, {{in attempt to}} increase the firepower of the ISU-152, a high-power variant of the self-propelled gun was {{developed in}} Factory No. 100, designated ISU-152BM (ИСУ-152БМ), {{sometimes referred to as}} ISU-152BM-1 or ISU-152-1. The factory designation was Object 246 (Объект 246). The [...] "BM" [...] ("БМ") in the designation stands for [...] "High Powered" [...] ("Большой Мощности"). The main purpose of the ISU-152BM was the fight against heavily armored tank destroyers such as the Elefant and the Jagdtiger. It was armed with the 152.4 mm BL-8 (БЛ-8) long barrel gun, which unlike the ISU-152's gun wasn't a gun-howitzer. The gun had a maximum range of 18,500 metres, with the 43.56 kg high-explosive shell which had a muzzle velocity of 880 m/s. The overall length of the gun was over 8 metres, with a barrel length of 7620 mm (50 calibers). The armor-piercing round, weighing 48.78 kg, had a muzzle velocity of 850 m/s. During test firing at armour plates with different thickness, the ISU-152BM successfully penetrated a maximum of 203 mm of RHA at 90° at ranges of up to 2,000 metres. However, during the trials, July 1944, the gun showed some deficiencies such as being difficult to operate by the crew, unreliable working of the muzzle brake and the breech block, and unsatisfactory performance of the shells. In addition, the gun, protruding far forward of the hull front, limited the maneuverability of the fighting vehicle. The self-propelled gun carried 21 rounds of two piece (shell and charge) ammunition, and had a rate of fire of 2 rounds/min. It used the engine, transmission, running gear, and electric equipment of the ISU-122. In August 1944 the BL-8 gun was replaced with the improved 152.4 mm BL-10 (БЛ-10) long barrel gun, with a slightly shorter barrel of 7.392 metres (48.5 calibers). This vehicle gun was designated ISU-152-2 (ИСУ-152-2). The factory designation was Object 247 (Объект 247). It was also equipped with external fuel tanks. The gun had a modified muzzle brake and a semi-automatic breech block. It had a rate of fire of 3 rounds/min. The BL-10 had a maximum range of 18,000 metres, with the 43.56 kg high-explosive shell. In December 1944 the ISU-152-2 underwent trials, revealing the barrel strength and the angle of <b>horizontal</b> <b>guidance</b> were unsatisfactory. The gun was sent for further improvement, but it wasn't completed before the war ended. The fighting vehicle was never adopted. After the war, the final and most improved, third modification of ISU-152-2 was completed. The gun had a maximum range of 19,500 metres, using a 48.5 kg high-explosive shell with a muzzle velocity of 880 m/s.|$|E

40|$|An Approach with Vertical Guidance (APV) is an {{instrument}} approach procedure which provides <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>guidance</b> to a pilot on approach to landing in reduced visibility conditions. APV approaches can greatly reduce the safety risk to general aviation by improving the pilot’s situational awareness. In particular the incidence of Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) which has occurred {{in a number of}} fatal air crashes in general aviation over the past decade in Australia, can be reduced. APV approaches can also improve general aviation operations. If implemented at Australian airports, APV approach procedures are expected to bring a cost saving {{of millions of dollars to}} the economy due to fewer missed approaches, diversions and an increased safety benefit. The provision of accurate <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>guidance</b> is achievable using the Global Positioning System (GPS). Because aviation is a safety of life application, an aviation-certified GPS receiver must have integrity monitoring or augmentation to ensure that its navigation solution can be trusted. However, the difficulty with the current GPS satellite constellation alone meeting APV integrity requirements, the susceptibility of GPS to jamming or interference and the potential shortcomings of proposed augmentation solutions for Australia such as the Ground-based Regional Augmentation System (GRAS) justifies the investigation of Aircraft Based Augmentation Systems (ABAS) as an alternative integrity solution for general aviation. ABAS augments GPS with other sensors at the aircraft to help it meet the integrity requirements. Typical ABAS designs assume high quality inertial sensors to provide an accurate reference trajectory for Kalman filters. Unfortunately high-quality inertial sensors are too expensive for general aviation. In contrast to these approaches the purpose of this research is to investigate fusing GPS with lower-cost Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and a mathematical model of aircraft dynamics, referred to as an Aircraft Dynamic Model (ADM) in this thesis. Using a model of aircraft dynamics in navigation systems has been studied before in the available literature and shown to be useful particularly for aiding inertial coasting or attitude determination. In contrast to these applications, this thesis investigates its use in ABAS. This thesis presents an ABAS architecture concept which makes use of a MEMS IMU and ADM, named the General Aviation GPS Integrity System (GAGIS) for convenience. GAGIS includes a GPS, MEMS IMU, ADM, a bank of Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and uses the Normalized Solution Separation (NSS) method for fault detection. The GPS, IMU and ADM information is fused together in a tightly-coupled configuration, with frequent GPS updates applied to correct the IMU and ADM. The use of both IMU and ADM allows for a number of different possible configurations. Three are investigated in this thesis; a GPS-IMU EKF, a GPS-ADM EKF and a GPS-IMU-ADM EKF. The integrity monitoring performance of the GPS-IMU EKF, GPS-ADM EKF and GPS-IMU-ADM EKF architectures are compared against each other and against a stand-alone GPS architecture in a series of computer simulation tests of an APV approach. Typical GPS, IMU, ADM and environmental errors are simulated. The simulation results show the GPS integrity monitoring performance achievable by augmenting GPS with an ADM and low-cost IMU for a general aviation aircraft on an APV approach. A contribution to research is made in determining whether a low-cost IMU or ADM can provide improved integrity monitoring performance over stand-alone GPS. It is found that a reduction of approximately 50...|$|R
40|$|Snake robots are {{inspired}} by biological snakes in both shape and dynamical behavior. A snake robot is constructed by a chain of links, interconnected by revolute joints. By imitating gaits of biological snakes, the snake robot is able to move in rough terrains. The great maneuverability of biological snakes has inspired researchers to develop snake robots for future use within different applications where great mobility in various terrains is required. A lot of research has been made {{within the field of}} snake robot construction. Open loop control strategies have been proposed in snake robot literature, but still a lot of work remains on a theoretical level in providing stability proofs for snake robot control systems. Additionally, a higher degree of automation is desirable within snake robots in order to fulfill high level control objectives in future applications. In this thesis, control and stability analysis of snake robot locomotion is considered. Initially, a description of biologically inspired snake robots is given, including brief presentations of the most common gaits for biological snakes. Future applications like fire fighting and search and rescue is briefly presented in order to get an overview of possibly future usages of snake robots. Mathematical models of snake robot motion is presented. A somewhat simplified process plant model describes a snake robot with revolute joints, while a model based on a snake robot with prismatic joints is used as control plant model. Averaged system equations for the control plant model are presented based on a snake robot performing the gait lateral undulation. Simulations are carried out to investigate the validity of the averaged system equations during turning motions. Good correspondence between the averaged model and the original control plant model is seen as long as the steering input is not varying too rapidly. Control objectives for a planar snake robot moving in a horizontal plane are discussed. To which degree the snake robot is to be autonomous is highly dependent on the application within which it is used. It is proposed that a suitable way of controlling a snake robot can be for the operator to define certain points of interest within the planar space. The snake robot should be able to navigate autonomously through these points. Inspired by way-point guidance known from marine applications, a solution involving path following strategies by means of guidance laws and orientation control is considered. Next, the control plant model is used for design of orientation controllers for the snake robot. Simulations are made to show tracking performance of time-varying reference trajectories. The proposed controllers show good performance, but a drawback is that the controllers are all singular when the tangential velocity of the snake robot is zero. Boundedness of the snake robot state space is ensured when constraints are set on the steering input. However, simulations show that such constraints on the input give highly conservative bounds on the tangential velocity. It is desirable in the future to calculate actual bounds of tangential velocity when the snake robot is steered by a non-constrained orientation controller. In order to fulfill the higher control objective of steering the snake robot through points of interest in the <b>horizontal</b> plane, <b>guidance</b> laws are used to ensure that the snake robot is able to follow straight-lines and curved paths. By employing cascaded systems theory, the complete control system, including guidance laws and orientation controllers, is proven to be asymptotically stable. The theoretical results are verified through simulations of the control plant model, while simulations of the process plant model investigate the likelihood of successful control of a real snake robot. The control strategies for straight-line following are seen to successfully steer the process plant model to the desired straight-line, but for curved path following some deviations are observed. Better results for curved path following of the process plant model may be obtained by performing system identification and including integral control. The thesis briefly presents experimental results where the proposed path following controller is implemented on a physical snake robot. These experiments show that the path following controller successfully steer the physical snake robot towards a desired straight path. </p...|$|R

Guidance problems such as capturing an ILS beam at a specified point on the beam, intercepting a VOR radial, and point-to-point navigation can be formulated in terms of these problems.

This inclusionwill provide better levels of performance of <b>horizontal</b> <b>guidance</b> than RAIM with GPS alone. In addition, when sufficient satellites have dual frequency (L 1 -L 5) signals,ARAIM could enable aviation safety of life operations, including approaches with vertical guidance. The European Union (EU) and the United States (US) have an agreement establishing cooperation between GPS and Europe's Galileo system. As part of this cooperativeagreement a technical subgroup was formed to investigate the benefits of Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) [1]. This EU-US ARAIMsubgroup has developed a reference airborne algorithm [2] and two potential ARAIM architectures [3, 4, 5]:Offline ARAIM to support horizontal and vertical navigation based on a low latency (days to months) ISM.

40|$|The {{design of}} an {{automated}} {{air traffic control}} system based on a hierarchy of advisory tools for controllers is described. Compatibility of the tools with the human controller, a key objective of the design, is achieved by a judicious selection of tasks to be automated and careful attention to the design of the controller system interface. The design comprises three interconnected subsystems referred to as the Traffic Management Advisor, the Descent Advisor, and the Final Approach Spacing Tool. Each of these subsystems provides a collection of tools for specific controller positions and tasks. This paper focuses primarily on the Descent Advisor which provides automation tools for managing descent traffic. The algorithms, automation modes, and graphical interfaces incorporated in the design are described. Information generated by the Descent Advisor tools is integrated into a plan view traffic display consisting of a high-resolution color monitor. Estimated arrival times of aircraft are presented graphically on a time line, which is also used interactively in combination with a mouse input device to select and schedule arrival times. Other graphical markers indicate the location of the fuel-optimum top-of-descent point and the predicted separation distances of aircraft at a designated time-control point. Computer generated advisories provide speed and descent clearances which the controller can issue to aircraft to help them arrive at the feeder gate at the scheduled times or with specified separation distances. Two types of <b>horizontal</b> <b>guidance</b> modes, selectable by the controller, provide markers for managing the horizontal flightpaths of aircraft under various conditions.

40|$|In the propulsive phase (after {{parachute}} release) {{of planetary}} landing like Mars or Moon, horizontal motion is obtained by tilting the axial thrust, which aligns {{either to the}} negative velocity vector or to the requested acceleration vector. The rst strategy called gravity turn, employed in past planetary landing, automatically leads to vertical alignment of the velocity vector; vehicle braking together with appropriate touch-down artifacts achieves soft landing. Horizontal motion is constrained, but some freedom must be allowed just after parachute release for separating vehicle and parachute trajectories. The second strategy is assumed here, as it allows free horizontal motion and accurate landing. Trigonometric functions of tilt angles (pitch and yaw) times the vertical acceleration magnitude become the horizontal acceleration. Instead of designing a hierarchical guidance and control in which horizontal acceleration becomes attitude reference, a unique control system has been designed based on the fourth order dynamics from angular acceleration to position. Following the Embedded Model Control methodology, a unique discrete-time state equation has been derived, encompassing horizontal, vertical and spin motions, {{to be used by}} guidance, navigation and control. Propulsion has been split into a main assembly for CoM guidance and control (9 to 12 thrusters slighted canted from the axial direction) and a secondary assembly for spin damping. The latter could be used for the guided entry from the entry point to parachute deployment. Here only guidance is presented with a brief mention to control strategies, as they have been treated elsewhere. Navigation concepts are in Acta Astronautica, 2012. Guidance has been designed to track a variable landing site, to reduce propellant consumption and to account for vehicle tilt limitations due to on board sensors like radar altimeter/velocimeter and camera. Guidance is recomputed during the descent until a minimum altitude is reached. Given the vertical guidance, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>guidance</b> is solved as a closed-form optimal control problem, with some iteration because of nonlinearities in the attitude- to-acceleration gain and of tilt bounds. Guidance is also in charge of real-time computing propellant ellipses, i. e. the elliptical ground regions that could be reached given the available propellant. They may become a source to a piloting function looking for a reachable and safe landing site. The whole guidance, navigation and control algorithms have been tested on a ne descent simulator.

40|$|The GNSS {{environment}} will experience {{major changes in}} the coming years. GPS and GLONASS are undergoing modernization phases, while Galileo and Compass are currently in their deployment phase. When all these constellations are in their Full Operational Capability (FOC) state, there will be at least three times as many ranging sources than today. In addition, all of these GNSS core constellations will broadcast signals in the two frequency bands, L 1 /E 1 and L 5 /E 5. These signals will be available for civil aviation, allowing users to cancel the pseudorange errors due to the ionosphere. Many studies suggest that it could be possible to achieve global coverage of vertical guidance using multi-constellation, dual frequency Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM). The benefits of ARAIM would include a reduced ground infrastructure (which would reduce the maintenance costs compared to current augmentation systems), a reduced dependency on any one GNSS core constellation, and, in general, lessen exposure to single points of failure. However, to achieve vertical guidance using ARAIM, it will not be sufficient to adapt the RAIM algorithms that are used for horizontal navigation. This is due to the increased level of safety required for vertical guidance compared to <b>horizontal</b> <b>guidance.</b> Therefore, ARAIM will require a careful faults and effects analysis. Because the integrity provision will be shared across service providers, {{it will be necessary to}} develop a common understanding in at least three domains: the navigation requirements, starting with LPV- 200; the airborne algorithm; and the threat model, comprised of both the nominal performance of the constellations and the fault modes. In this paper, we present a concept for the provision of integrity using multiple constellations with ARAIM and an Integrity Support Message (ISM). We will first propose an interpretation of the LPV- 200 requirements in the ARAIM context. We will then propose a typical threat model for GNSS which includes both the nominal performance of the constellations and all the faults that need to be mitigated. These threats include both single satellite faults, multiple satellite faults, and constellation wide faults, one of them being the use or broadcast of erroneous Earth Orientation Parameters. We will show how the threats can be mitigated through the use of ground monitoring and the ISM in addition to the ARAIM subset position and residual test. Finally, we will give examples of multiple constellation configurations and performance providing worldwide coverage of LPV- 200...|$|E
