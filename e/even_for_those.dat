The neighborhood's boundaries are roughly Interstate 10 to the north, the St. Johns River to the east, Fishweir Creek to the south, and Roosevelt Boulevard and the CSX Railroad line to the west. It borders the Brooklyn and North Riverside neighborhoods to the north, Murray Hill to the west, and Lake Shore and Fairfax to the south. The boundary between Riverside and Avondale is not clear cut, <b>even</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> living in the neighborhood. It is sometimes given as Seminole Road and Belvedere Avenue, the northern limit of the Avondale Historic District. Alternately, author Wayne Wood of the Jacksonville Historic Landmarks Commission puts it at about McDuff Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended <b>even</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E

40|$|Background: Personal {{history of}} type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) {{is associated with a}} lower incidence of prostate cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We hypothesized that genetic factors that are involved in the development of T 2 DM might protect again prostate cancer. Methods: We used a few Swedish registers, including the Swedish Multigeneration Register and the Cancer Register, to examine the risk of prostate cancer among men with a family history of T 2 DM. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to calculate the relative risk. Results: The overall risk of prostate cancer among men with a familial history of T 2 DM was 0. 87 (95 %CI 0. 86 - 0. 89) as compared to matched controls. The risk was <b>even</b> lower <b>for</b> <b>those</b> multiple affected relatives with T 2 DM, and it was 0. 86 <b>for</b> <b>those</b> with two affected relatives and 0. 67 <b>for</b> <b>those</b> with three and more affected relatives. Conclusions: Family history of T 2 DM was associated with a lower incidence of prostate cancer, and the risk was <b>even</b> lower <b>for</b> <b>those</b> with more than one affected relative. Our study strongly suggests that genetic factors or shared familial factors, such as obesity, that contributed to T 2 DM may protect against prostate cancer...|$|R

The Centre for Lifelong Learning is not part of any of the colleges and provides adult-education courses to the general public, <b>even</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> without the academic qualifications usually needed for admission to the university.

25|$|The major {{sticking}} point {{for many in}} the question of human evolution was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved. The gap between humans and even the smartest ape seemed too large, <b>even</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who were sympathetic to Darwin's basic theory. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, believed that the human mind was too complex to have evolved gradually, and began over time to subscribe to a theory of evolution that took more from spiritualism than it did the natural world. Darwin was deeply distressed by Wallace's change of heart, and much of the Descent of Man is in response to opinions put forth by Wallace. Darwin focuses less {{on the question of whether}} humans evolved than he does on showing that each of the human faculties considered to be so far beyond those of beasts—such as moral reasoning, sympathy for others, beauty, and music—can be seen in kind (if not degree) in other animal species (usually apes and dogs).|$|E
25|$|After Israel's {{capture of}} the West Bank, Jerusalem, Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt in the Six-Day War in 1967, {{frustration}} grew among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel opened its labor market to Palestinians in the newly occupied territories. Palestinians were recruited mainly to do unskilled or semi-skilled labor jobs Israelis did not want. By {{the time of the}} Intifada, over 40 percent of the Palestinian work force worked in Israel daily. Additionally, Israeli confiscation of Palestinian land, high birth rates in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the limited allocation of land for new building and agriculture created conditions marked by growing population density and rising unemployment, <b>even</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> with university degrees. At the time of the Intifada, only one in eight college-educated Palestinians could find degree-related work. Couple this with an expansion of a Palestinian university system catering to people from refugee camps, villages, and small towns generating new Palestinian elite from a lower social strata that was more activist and confrontational with Israel.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{statistical}} {{learning by}} itself cannot account <b>even</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> aspects of language acquisition {{for which it}} has been shown to play a large role. For example, Kuhl, Tsao, and Liu found that young English-learning infants who spent time in a laboratory session with a native Mandarin speaker were able to distinguish between phonemes that occur in Mandarin but not in English, unlike infants who were in a control condition. Infants in this control condition came to the lab as often as infants in the experimental condition, but were exposed only to English; when tested at a later date, they were unable to distinguish the Mandarin phonemes. In a second experiment, the authors presented infants with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers and tested the infants’ ability to distinguish between the Mandarin phonemes. In this condition, infants failed to distinguish the foreign language phonemes. This finding indicates that social interaction is a necessary component of language learning and that, even if infants are presented with the raw data of hearing a language, they are unable {{to take advantage of the}} statistical cues present in that data if they are not also experiencing the social interaction.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{employers}} who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. <b>Even</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who are employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured {{were significantly more likely}} than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes—73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. However, a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found that the typical large employer preferred provider organization (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option. One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in Health Affairs that concluded that half of personal bankruptcys involved medical bills, although other sources dispute this.|$|E
