5|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, {{curvilinear}} perspective found <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a convex mirror with reflections {{of the people in}} the scene, while Parmigianino's Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.|$|E
5|$|The Reserve Bank issued Special Agro (Agricultural) cheques from 15 May to 31 July 2008. Although of a {{different}} design and with the intention for use only by farmers, it had found <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> regular use because of the parallel functions with bearer Cheques and the exponential rise of food prices. Following the 2008 currency reform, Agro and bearer cheques were phased out on 1 January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of}} the circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E

5|$|After NY448, NY117 {{becomes a}} four-lane, {{undivided}} at-grade street as it heads northeast through a residential area of Mount Pleasant. Just past the NY448 junction, NY117 enters adjacent interchanges with Saw Mill River Road (NY9A and NY100) and the northbound {{direction of the}} Taconic State Parkway near Graham Hills County Park. From here, the highway passes south of Pace University's Pleasantville campus on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the village of Pleasantville, where it narrows to two lanes and initially serves mostly commercial neighborhoods. NY117 remains on Bedford Road for its first few blocks in Pleasantville; however, it veers northeast onto Manville Road just southwest of the community's central business district.|$|E
5|$|After this junction, NY12E crosses Guffin Creek on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> {{the village}} of Chaumont. Here, NY12E becomes Main Street again as it {{transitions}} from a rural highway back to a residential street. In {{the southern part of}} Chaumont, the route connects to CR125, at which point NY12E begins to pass by a mix of commercial and residential properties. It crosses over a small creek leading away from Chaumont Bay before turning slightly westward and entering the Chaumont Historic District.|$|E
5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As {{the railroad}} made <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{attempts}} by Paul I {{to play down}} Potemkin's role in Russian history, his name found <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> numerous items of common parlance. The phrase Potemkin village entered common usage in Russia and globally, despite its fictional origin. A century after Potemkin's death, the Battleship Potemkin was named in his honour. The ship became famous for its involvement in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and subsequent dramatization in The Battleship Potemkin, a Soviet movie by Sergey Eisenstein, which at one point was named the greatest film of all time. The name of the giant seaside staircase in Odessa, featured in the movie, eventually {{became known as the}} Potemkin Stairs.|$|E
5|$|East of Thurston hamlet, NY333 {{continued}} to {{run along the}} base of the Michigan Creek valley into the town of Campbell, where the valley met a larger valley surrounding the Cohocton River. The route proceeded eastward across the width of the latter valley, crossing over the river on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the riverside hamlet of Campbell, the largest community along NY333. It proceeded eastward through the hamlet along Main Street to an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (then-NY15 and NY17) just east of the community. NY333 ended just east of the Southern Tier at a junction with NY415. The right-of-way also terminated at the junction.|$|E
5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, {{religious}} persecution, and prebendalism {{have affected}} Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism has made <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal {{power to a}} particular region of their interests. Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E

Islamic buildings such as the Taj Mahal and the Lotfollah mosque make elaborate use of symmetry both in their structure and in their ornamentation. Moorish buildings like the Alhambra are ornamented with complex patterns made using translational and reflection symmetries as well as rotations.|$|R

5|$|In 1960, {{physicists}} Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi {{proposed that}} extraterrestrial civilisations might be using radio signals for communication. Project Ozma, led by astronomer Frank Drake, used the Tatel Telescope {{to search for}} such signals from the nearby Sun-like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, 1,420MHz (21cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.|$|E
5|$|Lin trademarked {{the word}} Linsanity in 2012 to preempt strangers from {{profiting}} from his likeness.

5|$|On {{the south}} {{bank of the}} Markham River lay Markham Point, where the Japanese {{maintained}} a force of about 200 men on commanding ground. Part of the 24th Infantry Battalion was ordered to capture the position. The attack {{on the morning of}} 4 September went wrong from the start, with two scouts being wounded by a land mine. The force fought <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the Japanese position but took heavy casualties and was forced to withdraw. Twelve Australians were killed and six were wounded in the attack. It was then decided to merely contain the Japanese force at Markham Point, which was subjected to mortar fire and an airstrike.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} Sussex County, Route 183 {{enters the}} community of Stanhope. At the intersection with Musconetcong Avenue, the highway turns to the northwest, leaving {{the shores of the}} lake. Route 183 continues through the residential developments in Stanhope, working <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the mountains above the lake. At the intersection with Dell Road, Route 183 becomes intertwined with the interchange on U.S. Route 206 northbound, and the highways merge a short distance later in Stanhope.|$|E
5|$|While {{it may be}} {{uncertain}} when cultivation began it {{is still}} {{considered one of the}} oldest domesticated crops. Remains of charred cowpeas from rock shelters in Central Ghana have been dated to the second millennium BCE. In 2300 BC the cowpea is believed to have made <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> South East Asia where secondary domestication events may have occurred. From there they traveled north to the Mediterranean, where they were used by the Greeks and Romans. The first written references to the cowpea were in 300 BC and they probably reached Central and North America during the slave trade through the 17th to early 19th centuries.|$|E

The tortoise also finds <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> science, as its species, Testudo whitei (Bennett 1836), long thought to be a synonym of Testudo graeca, has been rediscovered in Algeria.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} to the north, NY78 and NY104 fork in different directions, with NY104 following Ridge Road to the northeast and NY78 running along LockportOlcott Road to the northwest. Still {{in the town of}} Newfane, NY78 proceeds northwest as a four-lane (quickly changing to two-lane) residential street. The route passes east of Bent-Wing Airport, continuing northwest through Newfane. The route remains residential for a distance, crossing over a brook on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the hamlet of Corwin. In Corwin, NY78 remains a two-lane residential road, crossing over Somerset Railroad tracks that are operated by CSX Transportation (heading for the Somerset Power Plant near Camp Kenan) north of Jacques Avenue. Now paralleling Eighteenmile Creek, NY78 intersects with the western terminus of CR105 (Hatter Road). While winding northwest, the route soon enters the hamlet of Newfane.|$|E
5|$|After NY18, NY93 curves to the southeast, serving another {{residential}} stretch {{ahead of}} a junction with YoungstownWilson Road (CR36) on {{the eastern edge of}} Towers Corners.
