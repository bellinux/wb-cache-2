5|$|Last Man Standing: Similar to Deathmatch, the player's {{objective}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> alive {{longer than}} their opponents, putting {{an emphasis on}} number of deaths rather than kills. Players start with all weapons (except the Redeemer) available, fully loaded, and have a set number of lives. Power-ups, including health and ammunition packs, are unavailable. Once a player runs out of lives, they lose.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{has only}} one female character, Miranda. Other women, such as Caliban's mother Sycorax, Miranda's mother and Alonso's {{daughter}} Claribel, are only mentioned. Because of the small role women play in the story in comparison to other Shakespeare plays, The Tempest has attracted much feminist criticism. Miranda is typically viewed as being completely deprived of freedom by her father. Her only duty in his eyes <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> chaste. Ann Thompson argues that Miranda, in a manner typical of women in a colonial atmosphere, has completely internalised the patriarchal order of things, thinking of herself as subordinate to her father.|$|E

25|$|Horned lizards use a {{wide variety}} of means to avoid predation. Their {{coloration}} generally serves as camouflage. When threatened, their first defense <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> still to avoid detection. If approached too closely, they generally run in short bursts and stop abruptly to confuse the predator's visual acuity. If this fails, they puff up their bodies to cause them to appear more horned and larger, so that they are more difficult to swallow.|$|E
25|$|Still {{under the}} command of Van Voytz, the Tanith First is {{deployed}} as part of the Imperial Expeditionary Force to Aexe Cardinal, where a deadlocked land war has been raging for forty years between the Aexe Alliance (a handful of loyal nation-states) and the Chaos-corrupted Shadik Republic. Warmaster Macaroth insists that the Aexe Alliance <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in command of the campaign, with strained success. The Alliance employs methods of warfare considered obsolete and inefficient according to the modern standard tactics of the Imperial Guard.|$|E

As part of a 10-year renewal program, Asia Trail – a series of habitats for seven Asian species including sloth bears, red pandas, and clouded leopards – was created. Elephant Trails, opened in 2013, provides a new home for the zoo's Asian elephants.

This decision was confirmed in May 2016, with the School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health being transferred to Newcastle University on 1 August 2017. The Queen's Campus <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> part of the University and will be repurposed as an International Study Centre, to be run by Study Group.|$|E
25|$|Eversion and inversion: Stretching the {{eversion}} and inversion muscles {{allows for}} better {{range of motion}} to the ankle joint. Seated ankle elevations and depressions will stretch the peroneus and tibilalis muscles {{that are associated with}} these movements as they lengthen. Eversion muscles are stretched when the ankle becomes depressed from the starting position. In like manner, the inversion muscles are stretched when the ankle joint becomes elevated. Throughout this seated stretch, the ankle joint <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> supported while depressed and elevated with the ipsilateral (same side) hand in order to sustain the stretch for 10–15 seconds. This stretch will increase overall eversion and inversion muscle group length and provide more flexibility to the ankle joint for larger range of motion during activity.|$|E

25|$|Not able to {{live with}} the guilt anymore and with {{encouragement}} from Stuart's ghost, Kendall refuses to bargain and confesses to the murder, being sentenced to live in prison. Zach is able to get Kendall out of prison by paying a Kendall lookalike a large sum of money (according to Jesse) in order to pose as her in prison. He is able to give Kendall a room in the house where she <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain,</b> not to come out for any reason, even to check on Ian and Spike. When asking Zach why she cannot stay in his room with him, Kendall concludes that it is because she slept with Ryan and that Zach has not forgiven her, which he confirms. He tells her that he will not forgive anyone anymore, not even Kendall. He does tell her that she is his wife and that he will protect her and his children no matter what.|$|E
500|$|The book closes with a {{final chapter}} {{offering}} a critique of Labour Party policy, and discusses its future.

500|$|On 24 October 2015, Sweden {{announced}} its bid of the JAS 39 Gripen C/D for Croatia's fighter replacement requirement, following {{a request for}} information from the Croatian Ministry of Defence in June for between 8 and 12 newly built aircraft to replace the Croatian fleet of ageing MiG-21bis aircraft. According to the Ministry of Defence's Long-Term Development Plan (LTDP), however, the MiG-21 <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in service until 2024 {{as a result of}} ongoing modernisation programmes.

500|$|The [...] "armored" [...] endotracheal {{tubes are}} cuffed, wire-reinforced {{silicone}} rubber tubes. They {{are much more}} flexible than polyvinyl chloride tubes, yet they are difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> flexed during surgery. Most armored tubes have a Magill curve, but preformed armored RAE tubes are also available. Another type of endotracheal tube has four small openings just above the inflatable cuff, {{which can be used}} for suction of the trachea or administration of intratracheal medications if necessary. Other tubes (such as the Bivona Fome-Cuf tube) are designed specifically for use in laser surgery in and around the airway.|$|E
500|$|In a final meeting, a {{disappointed}} Lipnick, {{in uniform}} (as {{he attempts to}} secure an Army Reserve commission), angrily chastises Barton for writing [...] "a fruity movie about suffering" [...] then informs him that he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in Los Angeles; although Barton will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes so he can be ridiculed as a loser around the studio while Lipnick is in the war. Dazed, Barton wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks {{just like the one}} in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box. He tells her he does not know what it contains nor who owns it. She then assumes the pose from the picture.|$|E

500|$|Common lyrical themes include love, family, friends, and relationships. In greater detail, this {{includes}} [...] "adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over {{the care and}} feeding of girls." [...] Lyrics in singles such as [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] reflect age and maturity, while more serious compositions such as [...] "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] touch {{on the subject of}} divorce. DeLonge said in a 1999 interview that the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> sincere and relatable, noting that the band takes its lyrics very seriously. Despite this, the band gained a reputation for occasional lyrical toilet humor (Take Off Your Pants and Jacket). As the band members grew older, lyrical themes began to reflect the realities of adulthood, including relationship woes, daily pressures and unexpected hardships, most prominently explored on Blink-182 (2003). On Neighborhoods, darker lyricism continues: themes concerning depression, addiction, loss and death were inspired by Barker's plane crash and the death of producer Jerry Finn.|$|E
500|$|Trapattoni still {{believed}} Benifca {{could win the}} title, saying, [...] "What matters <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> confident." [...] On 16 April, Benfica suffered another setback, nearly losing at home against União de Leiria. [...] A goal scored by João Paulo gave the visitors the lead for over 70 minutes until Mantorras scored the equalizer in the 93rd minute. Four days later, Benfica met Estrela da Amadora for the Portuguese Cup semi-final. Benfica dominated the second tier-side and won 3–0, qualifying for the tournament's final. Trapattoni said Benfica had achieved half of their objective in the competition; the other half was winning it. On 24 April, Benfica played away to Estoril. The Estoril team played at the Estádio António Coimbra da Mota, but decided to moved the game to Estádio do Algarve for financial reasons. Estoril scored the opening goal in the 12th minute and Benfica's Luisão equalized 64 minutes later. With Estoril reduced to nine players after two ejections, Mantorras scored the winning goal for Benfica in the 82th minute. Benfica finished April by hosting Belenenses on April 30, beating them 1–0. Simão scored the only goal of the match.|$|E
500|$|An Independence from Europe fielded 60 {{candidates}} in the 2014 European Parliament election, proposing representatives for each of England's nine constituencies. The most notable of whom were Nattrass, who sought re-election in the West Midlands, and Laurence Stassen, a Dutch MEP who had recently left the Party for Freedom (PVV) and was vying for election in the South East England region. Stassen's unusual standing for the party [...] "demonstrate {{the extent to which}} MEPs whose true ambition <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in the European Parliament will go in order to remain in their seat" [...] according to political scientist William T. Daniel. The party did not stand {{candidates in}} the Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland constituencies. Campaigning for the election included a nationwide party political broadcast through the BBC on 8 May and Nattrass' appearance on Daily Politics, where he was interviewed by Andrew Neil on 14 May. Despite claiming it would receive more than 10% of the national vote and elect up to four MEPs, the party only collected 1.49% and all candidates were defeated. Finishing seventh, it was the highest placed party not to elect an MEP; it polled more votes than the British National Party (BNP), which was defending two seats.|$|E
