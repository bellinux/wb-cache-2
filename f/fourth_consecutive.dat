5000|$|Parallel <b>fourths</b> (<b>consecutive</b> perfect <b>fourths)</b> are allowed, {{even though}} a P4 is the {{inversion}} and thus the complement of a P5. The literature deals with them less systematically however, and theorists have often restricted their use. Theorists commonly disallow <b>consecutive</b> perfect <b>fourths</b> involving the lowest part, especially between the lowest part and the highest part. Since {{the beginning of the}} common practice period, it has been theorized that all dissonances should be properly resolved to a perfect consonance (there are few exceptions). Therefore, parallel fourths above the bass are generally dismissed in voice leading as a series of consecutive unresolved dissonances. However parallel fourths in upper voices (especially as part of a parallel [...] "6-3" [...] sonorities) are common, and formed the basis of fifteenth-century fauxbourdon style. As an example of this type of allowed parallel perfect fourth in common practice music, see the final movement of Mozart's A minor Piano sonata whose theme in mm. 37-40 consists of parallel fourths in the right hand part (but not above the bass).|$|R
