2500|$|Fascinated {{with the}} {{emerging}} {{phenomenon of the}} Internet, Armstrong saw considerable potential for publishing online and earning through advertising revenues. He sold Square Deal and commenced working as an ad-sales director for I-Way, described by him as [...] "the first <b>Internet</b> <b>magazine</b> for consumers". It was run by the Boston-based International Data Group.

The firm was acquired by Disney in 1998. Armstrong served as the Director of Integrated Sales and Marketing for Starwave's and Disney's ABC and ESPN Internet ventures.

2500|$|Drowned in Sound observed, [...] "Fans of {{her earlier}} work will {{delight in the}} more direct, piano-driven melodies and orchestral {{arrangements}} that dominate the album, {{as well as the}} welcomed return of the long neglected harpsichord on several tracks," [...] A mixed review by The Skinny called the album [...] "moderately successful," [...] awarding it 3/5 stars. [...] Slant Magazine gave the album 3/5 stars, citing Winter's Carol, a song from and preview of Amos' upcoming musical adaptation of George MacDonald's The Light Princess, as the standout track: [...] "The song's strong melody and arrangement are reminiscent of something from Under the Pink, bolstering a pagan yarn about the passing of the seasons." [...] On the album as a whole, Slant concluded, [...] "it's an ironic, pleasantly competent oddity." [...] Consequence of Sound gave it four stars out of five and called it [...] "a pleasant and often gorgeous effort," [...] and <b>Internet</b> <b>magazine,</b> PopMatters, cited the album as [...] "Amos’ best work in years." [...] AllMusic was not impressed, however, giving it two-and-a-half stars out of five and stating, [...] "Thanks to some familiar melodies, it can sometimes seem seasonally appropriate, but it always seems purely Tori, who has somehow managed to deliver an easy listening version of all her signatures in one tidy, not so-Christmasy, package." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 17, 2007, the {{day after}} Obama {{announced}} his candidacy, the <b>Internet</b> <b>magazine</b> Insight published an article claiming that Clinton campaign staff had told them that Obama had attended a Muslim seminary {{as a child in}} Indonesia and that they were planning to use that information against him during the upcoming primary election campaign. The Clinton and Obama campaigns quickly denounced the allegations. Investigations by CNN, ABC and others showed that Obama had not, as Insight had written, attended an Islamic seminary. Instead, for his first three years abroad Obama attended St. Francis Assisi Catholic School, and in his last year he transferred to State Elementary School Menteng Besuki, an Indonesian public school for children of all faiths. A series of Chicago Tribune reports found that [...] "hen Obama attended 4th grade in 1971, Muslim children spent two hours a week studying Islam, and Christian children spent those two hours learning about the Christian religion." [...] The series also stated: [...] "In fact, Obama's religious upbringing in Indonesia depended more on the conventions of the schools he attended than on any decision by him, his mother or his stepfather. When he was at a Catholic school for three years, he prayed as a Catholic. When he was at a public school for a year, he learned about Islam." [...] In May 2008 Insight ceased publication.|$|E
