25|$|Re Fong Thin Choo is an {{administrative}} law case decided in 1991 by the High Court of Singapore concerning {{the legality of}} a demand by the Director-General of Customs and Excise ("DG") that the applicant's company pay S$130,241.30 in customs duty as it had not exported certain goods. The case was presided over by Justice Chan Sek Keong. The Court decided that the DG had failed {{to take into account}} relevant <b>evidence</b> <b>adduced</b> by the applicant's company which could have been capable of rebutting the prima facie evidence of non-export, and had thus made an insufficient inquiry before arriving at his decision. Since the DG's demand had been based on an incorrect basis of fact and thus had been made contrary to law, the Court granted the applicant an order of prohibition that barred the DG from deducting the sum from certain bankers' guarantees that the applicant's company had lodged with Customs as security.|$|E
25|$|What commends it (Quran) so powerfully to the {{historian}} is its authenticity, {{not as the}} Word of God, of course, as the Muslims believe but as the secular historian cannot and should not, {{but rather as a}} document attesting to what Muhammad said at that time and place, early seventh-century Mecca. It is not a transcript, however; our present Quran is the result of an edition prepared under the orders of Uthman... but the search for significant variants in the partial versions extant before Uthman's standard edition, what can be called the sources behind our text, has not yielded any differences of great significance. Those Uthmanic clues are fragmentary, however, and large 'invented' portions might well have been added to our Quran or authentic material deleted. So it has been charged in fact by some Muslims who failed to find in the present Quran any explicit reference to the designation of a successor to the Prophet and so have alleged tampering with the original texts. But the argument is so patently tendentious and the <b>evidence</b> <b>adduced</b> for the fact so exiguous that few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is in fact what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words.|$|E

500|$|The {{reasonable}} doubt standard is primarily effectuated by jury instructions, but it retains its relevance when {{the trial judge}} considers a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal and when an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence.

500|$|Because {{there was}} no written {{agreement}} relating to Horsburgh Lighthouse and Pedra Branca, the Court was unable {{to determine whether the}} November 1844 replies by the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor to Governor Butterworth's query amounted to a cession of the place that would be chosen for the site of the lighthouse or was merely a permission to build, maintain and operate a lighthouse there. Although the Governor had indicated in his 28 November 1844 letter to the Secretary of the Government in India to recommend that the replies amounted to a gratuitous cession to the East India Company, this understanding was not communicated to the Sultan and Temenggung. Similarly, the fact that Britain had not informed Johor about its decision to site the lighthouse on Pedra Branca might be seen either as recognition that Britain only had consent to build and operate it, or that Johor no longer had rights over the island. On the <b>evidence</b> <b>adduced,</b> the Court was unable to reach a conclusion on the issue. It also did not draw any conclusions about the construction and commissioning of the lighthouse, stating only that it saw the events as [...] "bearing {{on the issue of the}} evolving views of the authorities in Johor and Singapore about sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh". It noted, though, that apart from a two-day visit by the Temenggung and his followers to the island in early June 1850, Johor had no involvement in the project.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2007, Bain's legal team, {{including}} Karam, travelled to London {{to lay out}} nine arguments {{before the}} Privy Council as to why his convictions should be quashed.

The Privy Council concluded that: [...] "In the opinion of the board, the fresh <b>evidence</b> <b>adduced</b> in relation to the nine points ... taken together, compels the conclusion that a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred in this case."

2500|$|Justice Rehnquist {{would have}} upheld North Carolina's and Louisiana's {{mandatory}} death penalties. He disputed the historical <b>evidence</b> <b>adduced</b> {{in support of}} the claim that American juries dislike mandatory death penalties. He also felt that the Court's decisions had an analytical flaw. The Court had struck down the mandatory death penalty because it took away discretion from the jury. Yet, Rehnquist pointed out, a jury in Georgia could reject the death penalty for no reason at all. Thus, Georgia's scheme did not alleviate the concerns articulated in Furman about the arbitrariness of the death penalty any more than North Carolina's ignored them. He also disputed whether the appellate review of death sentences inherent in the systems the Court had approved could truly ensure that each death sentence satisfied those concerns. He finally took issue with the idea that the fact that [...] "death is different" [...] requires any extra safeguards in the sentencing process.|$|E

He took a keen and laborious interest in the <b>evidence</b> <b>adduced</b> by Canadian geologists as to the organic nature of the so-called Eozoon canadense, discovered in the Laurentian strata, also called the North American craton, and {{at the time of his}} death had nearly finished a monograph on the subject, defending the now discredited theory of its animal origin.

2500|$|After {{hearing the}} evidence, Judge George M. Dallas {{ruled in favor}} of McGuire, holding that the Brooklyn {{contract}} was unenforceable {{due to a lack of}} mutuality, and because Brooklyn had failed to prove that McGuire's services were unique and irreplaceable. [...] Judge Dallas' opinion, in part, stated:"The contract upon which this suit is founded provides that the party of the first part (the plaintiff) may end and determine all its liabilities and obligations thereunder upon giving the party of the second part (the defendant) ten days' notice of its option and intention to do so, and in Marble Company vs. Itipley, 10 Wall. 339, it was distinctly held that a contract which the plaintiff may abandon at any time on giving one year's notice is not enforceable in equity.... In short, I am of opinion that the decision in Marble Company against Ripley is binding upon this Court and is determinative of the present motion. A preliminary injunction should not be awarded in any case where the proofs leave the mind of the Court in serious doubt respecting the plaintiff's asserted right, and the testimony and affidavits submitted for and against the present application do not establish with reasonable certainty that the breach of contract of which the plaintiff complains could not be adequately compensated at law. The <b>evidence</b> <b>adduced</b> is by no means conclusive upon the question whether the services which the defendant contracted to render were so unique and peculiar that they could not be performed and substantially as well by others engaged in professional ball playing, who might be easily be obtained to take his place.
