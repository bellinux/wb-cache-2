40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{efficacy}} <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> {{to reduce}} long-term benzodiazepine use could be compromised by subsequent increases in {{contacts with the}} family practice. In this study the hypothesis was tested as to whether participation in a benzodiazepine discontinuation programme affects the frequency of contacts with the family practice. DESIGN: A controlled stepped-care intervention programme to decrease long-term benzodiazepine use. SETTING: Family practices in the Netherlands. Subjects. The experimental group consisted of 996 long-term benzodiazepine users and a control group of 883 long-term benzodiazepine users. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Practice contacts before and up to 12 months after the start <b>of</b> the <b>programme.</b> RESULTS: There was a general tendency visible for contacts to decrease during the follow-up time. The course {{of the number of}} contacts during the follow-up was not different for the experimental and control groups (p= 0. 45). The level of non-benzodiazepine prescriptions was generally not altered. The number of non-benzodiazepine prescriptions decreased in benzodiazepine quitters during the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> the <b>programme.</b> CONCLUSION: No clinically important differences in practice contacts were observed when the course of the number of contacts and non-benzodiazepine prescriptions were compared between the experimental and control groups.

The Vifladt & Hopen model for patient education is aimed to strengthen the ability of patients with long-term illnesses to cope in everyday life.

METHODS: A one-year <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> the education <b>programme</b> was conducted by means of focus group interviews (n= 13). A qualitative descriptive design using content analysis was used. RESULTS: Two main categories emerged: views on topics and matter, and views on form.

40|$|Background: All {{patients}} who undergo surgery for colon cancer are followed up {{according to the}} guidelines of the Norwegian Gastrointestinal Cancer Group (NGICG). These guidelines state that the aims <b>of</b> <b>follow-up</b> after surgery are to perform quality assessment, provide support and improve survival.

We describe a multi-centre randomized controlled trial to test whether these patients can be followed up by their general practitioner (GP) without altering quality of life, cost effectiveness and/or the incidence of serious clinical events. Methods and Design: Patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer with histological grade Dukes's Stage A, B or C and below 75 years of age are eligible for inclusion. They will be randomized after surgery to follow-up at the surgical outpatient clinic (control group) or followup by the district GP (intervention group). Both study arms comply with the national NGICG guidelines.

40|$|Utilization of {{renewable}} energy {{has been identified as}} a priority within the “European Energy Policy” which stresses the need to develop new sources of green energy. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> the <b>programme</b> “Intelligent Energy – Europe” (Decision No. 1230 / 2003 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003) is projected for the 7 th Framework Programme (2007 - 2013). The main focus <b>of</b> the <b>programme</b> is the production of electricity from renewable sources of energy, as described in Directive 2001 / 77 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001. According to this document, Portugal has committed to raise the national electricity production exclusively from renewable sources to 39 % by 2010. In addition, it constitutes {{an essential part of the}} package of measures necessary to comply with the commitments made by the EU under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is a CO 2 -neutral energy source with a very promising future as an alternative to fossil fuels for energy production. The treatment and disposal of wastes by conventional methods poses many problems throughout the world and may result in the consumption of energy. In addition, costs to dispose and treat wastes are escalating. Hydrogen can be produced, from undesirable waste products by bacterial fermentation, to generate electricity. The Centre for Biological Engineering at the University of Minho is studying bio-hydrogen production from organic wastes and sugars. The specific tasks of the project (FCT/POCI/ENR/ 57786 / 2004) include the utilization of different waste compositions from a real kitchen waste and sugars to produce and optimize H 2 yields, methanogenesis inhibition strategies, design, construction and operation of batch and continuous lab scale reactors for mesophilic (37 °C), thermophilic (55 °C), and hyperthermophilic (70 °C) conditions. In addition, molecular ecology techniques are being used to study bacterial community dynamics in the different bioreactors, comparing the microbial communities developed at different temperatures and different OLR.

A second aim was to explore the use of hospital outpatient and community support services (‘outpatient services’) by this patient population. These aims served the more general goal of identifying patients most likely in need of services additional to those routinely provided by our Seizure Surgery Follow-up and Rehabilitation Programme. The medical records of 100 consecutive ATL patients were retrospectively examined for the incidence and diagnoses precipitating acute readmission, and the utilization of additional outpatient services. Twenty-one patients (21 %) required readmission post-ATL, totalling 47 readmissions between them. Psychiatric diagnoses were the most prevalent (53 %), including anxiety, depression and/or post-ictal psychosis. Epileptological diagnoses were the other main precipitant (28 %). Additional outpatient services were predominantly utilized for ongoing psychological support. Of the 21 patients requiring readmission, 10 (10 %) also needed additional outpatient services. These patients were predominantly female or unemployed, in contrast to male or employed patients who tended to require readmission only. Seventeen patients (17 %) were maintained within the community using additional outpatient services only. Characteristics of these patients included disrupted family dynamics, limited social networks, and/or a psychiatric history. These patients were also more frequently beyond the 24 -month <b>follow-up</b> period <b>of</b> the <b>programme.</b> A profile <b>of</b> patients most in need of additional support services can be constructed to assist team planning of proactive management strategies for the rehabilitation phase of ATL...|$|R
