5|$|The {{federal tax}} credit for new plug-in {{electric}} vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each <b>kilowatt-hour</b> of battery capacity over 5 kWh, and {{the portion of the}} credit determined by battery capacity cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, the total amount of the credit allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Several states have established incentives and tax exemptions for BEVs and PHEV, and other non-monetary incentives.|$|E
5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per <b>kilowatt-hour</b> under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.|$|E
25|$|The Vancouver SeaBus uses 83 <b>kilowatt-hours</b> per vehicle-kilometre, at a {{speed of}} 13.5 {{kilometres}} per hour. When full (i.e. when seating 400 people), the energy used is 0.21 <b>kilowatt-hours</b> per passenger-kilometre.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{problem that}} came up {{because there was no}} testing at the manufacturer's shop was {{concerning}} thrust. The design of the huge turbine allowed for ease of dismantling, however this design flaw caused an unevenness of temperature under the superheated steam which made for poor performance.

[...] "Mary-Ann" [...] produced 80,000 <b>kilowatt-hours</b> during the first year, 429,000 <b>kilowatt-hours</b> during the second year, 616,000 <b>kilowatt-hours</b> during the third year, and nearly 2,500,000 <b>kilowatt-hours</b> during the fourth year. The steam turbine electric generator was moved to their Dutch Point plant in 1905.|$|R
5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per <b>kilowatt-hour</b> in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|Hydropower is {{produced}} in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela. The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per <b>kilowatt-hour.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 25 October 2011 a {{commission}} of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission revealed {{during a meeting}} calculations about the costs of recycling nuclear fuel for power generation. These costs could be twice the costs of direct geological disposal of spent fuel: the cost of extracting plutonium and handling spent fuel was estimated at 1.98 to 2.14 yen per <b>kilowatt-hour</b> of electricity generated. Discarding the spent fuel as waste would cost only 1 to 1.35 yen per <b>kilowatt-hour.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{specimen}} of the AC <b>kilowatt-hour</b> meter produced {{on the basis}} of Hungarian Ottó Bláthy's patent and named after him was presented by the Ganz Works at the Frankfurt Fair in the autumn of 1889, and the first induction <b>kilowatt-hour</b> meter was already marketed by the factory {{at the end of the}} same year. These were the first alternating-current watt-hour meters, known by the name of Bláthy-meters.

25|$|In 1906, voters {{approved}} a $3.25 Million Dollar expenditure {{for development of}} a hydroelectric plan at Pointe du Bois. Immediately following the decision to build the Pointe du Bois plant, the price of electricity charged {{by the private sector}} in Winnipeg dropped from 20 cents per <b>kilowatt-hour</b> to 10 cents and subsequently to 7 1/2 cents. After completion of the plant in 1911, Winnipeg Hydro set its rate at 3 1/3 cents per <b>kilowatt-hour.</b> This rate remained unchanged until 1973. Customers of Winnipeg Hydro enjoyed among the lowest electricity rates in North America.|$|E
