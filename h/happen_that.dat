5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it may well}} <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> an empty {{intersection}} belongs to neither player's territory. In that case the point {{is said to be}} neutral territory. There are rarely any {{more than a handful of}} neutral points at the end of a game; in the majority of cases, there are none at all.|$|E
25|$|Habitats and biota do {{frequently}} change. Therefore, {{it follows}} that the process of adaptation is never finally complete. Over time, it may <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> the environment changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings better and better. On the other hand, it may <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> changes in the environment occur relatively rapidly, and then the species becomes less and less well adapted. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic tracking process, which goes on all the time to some extent, but especially when the population cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough to bring a population back from the brink of extinction in a process called evolutionary rescue. It should be noted that adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a particular ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Risk is the {{likelihood}} that something bad will <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> causes harm to an informational asset (or {{the loss of the}} asset). A vulnerability is a weakness {{that could be used to}} endanger or cause harm to an informational asset. A threat is anything (man-made or act of nature) that has the potential to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} resolution {{process is}} the procedure by which, starting from the CRID of a given content, one or several locators of that content are obtained. Resolving a CRID can be a direct process, which leads immediately to one or many locators, or it may also <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> {{in the first place}} one or many intermediate CRIDs are returned, which must undergo the same procedure to finally obtain one or several locators.|$|E
25|$|The more fearsome a mafioso's {{reputation}} is, {{the more}} he can win disputes without having recourse to violence. It can even <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> a mafioso who loses his means to commit violence (e.g. his soldiers are all in prison) can still use his reputation to intimidate and provide protection if everyone is unaware of his weakness and still believes in his power. However, in the tough world of the Mafia, such bluffs generally do not last long, as his rivals will soon sense his weakness and challenge him.|$|E
25|$|If Ω is un{{countable}}, still, it may <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> p(ω) ≠ 0 {{for some}} ω; such ω are called atoms. They are an at most countable (maybe empty) set, whose probability {{is the sum}} of probabilities of all atoms. If this sum is equal to 1 then all other points can safely be excluded from the sample space, returning us to the discrete case. Otherwise, if the sum of probabilities of all atoms is between 0 and 1, then the probability space decomposes into a discrete (atomic) part (maybe empty) and a non-atomic part.|$|E

25|$|Emergency – An Emergency {{is issued}} when {{an event that}} by itself cannot {{pose a threat to}} life or property, but may {{indirectly}} cause other events to <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> may pose a threat to life or property. An example of this would be a power outage, which although not directly posing a hazard, may threaten public safety and critical services. The only existing exceptions to this are the tornado emergency and flash flood emergency, which are issued {{to get the attention of}} the public to a major tornado or flash flood.|$|E
25|$|The {{move was}} not without {{incident}}. In the first spring of the move, rumors swept the school that various Bronx youth street gangs were coming to the school, and that the Fordham Baldies would shave the hair of Science students. This never happened. Another incident did <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> spring: The first time Science girls appeared on the outdoor physical education field in gym clothes, some students from the neighboring, all-male DeWitt Clinton High School charged the separation fence between their field and the Science field. The fence held, but the female students exercised indoors {{for the remainder of}} that year.|$|E
25|$|Different atlases {{can give}} rise to, in essence, the same manifold. The circle can be mapped by two {{coordinate}} charts, {{but if the}} domains of these charts are changed slightly a different atlas for the same manifold is obtained. These different atlases can be combined into a bigger atlas. It can <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> the transition maps of such a combined atlas are not as smooth {{as those of the}} constituent atlases. If Ck atlases can be combined to form a Ck atlas, then they are called compatible. Compatibility of atlases is an equivalence relation; by combining all the atlases in an equivalence class, a maximal atlas can be constructed. Each Ck atlas belongs to a unique maximal Ck atlas.|$|E
