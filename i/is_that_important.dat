60|$|Two considerations, however, {{have led}} me to face the double risk. The one is that though, in my judgment, M. Reville is wholly in the right {{in that part of}} the {{controversy}} to which I propose to restrict my observations, nevertheless he, as a foreigner, has very little chance of making the truth prevail with Englishmen against the authority and the dialectic skill of the greatest master of persuasive rhetoric among English-speaking men of our time. As the Queen's proctor intervenes, in certain cases, between two litigants in the interests of justice, so it may be permitted me to interpose as a sort of uncommissioned science proctor. My second excuse for my meddlesomeness <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>important</b> questions of natural science--respecting which neither of the combatants professes to speak as an expert--are involved in the controversy; and I think it is desirable that the public should know what it is that natural science really has to say on these topics, to the best belief of one who has been a diligent student of natural science for the last forty years.|$|E

50|$|Waste {{compaction}} is {{the process}} of compacting waste, reducing it in size. Garbage compactors and waste collection vehicles compress waste so that more of it can be stored in the same space. Waste is compacted again, more thoroughly, at the landfill to conserve valuable airspace and to extend the landfill's life span. A side effect of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>important</b> items, like evidence in a crime, may be difficult to recover from the garbage. Due to reduced oxygenation, biodegradation of organic waste is also slowed.|$|E

Charlie pours coffee for her would-be assassin, who startles her after Sylar reveals he knows about her aneurysm. Hiro watches from afar, wondering how he can stop Sylar. Meanwhile, in the present, Samuel Sullivan is worried for his dying friend Arnold, who has the ability to manipulate space-time like Hiro, and intends to have Hiro replace him. When Samuel wonders where he could be, Lydia reveals that Hiro had loved Charlie before she died, correctly deducing Hiro must have gone back in time to save her. Samuel asks Arnold one last time to be sent back, and appears by Hiro. Samuel warns Hiro of the implications to history he could cause by saving Charlie. Hiro asserts Charlie <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>important</b> to him, and promises to keep everything else in balance.|$|E

5000|$|Equal {{opportunity}} {{arises from}} the similar treatment of all people, unhampered by artificial barriers or prejudices or preferences, except when particular distinctions can be explicitly justified. The aim according to this often complex and contested concept <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>important</b> jobs should go to those [...] "most qualified" [...] - persons most likely to perform ably in a given task - and not go to persons for arbitrary or irrelevant reasons, such as circumstances of birth, upbringing, having well-connected relatives or friends, religion, sex, ethnicity, race, caste, or involuntary personal attributes such as disability, age, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Chances for advancement should be open to everybody interested such that they have [...] "an equal chance to compete {{within the framework of}} goals and the structure of rules established". The idea is to remove arbitrariness from the selection process and base it on some [...] "pre-agreed basis of fairness, with the assessment process being related to the type of position", and emphasizing procedural and legal means. Individuals should succeed or fail based on their own efforts and not extraneous circumstances such as having well-connected parents. It is opposed to nepotism and plays a role in whether a social structure is seen as legitimate. The concept is applicable in areas of public life in which benefits are earned and received such as employment and education, although it can apply to many other areas as well.|$|E
50|$|Next day, Haruki {{goes to the}} {{farewell}} party held by {{his colleagues}} as they know that Haruki is about to resign his job and go to Vienne; meanwhile, Kazusa talks with her mother. In order to be with Haruki she abandons her sick mother. Kazusa later has a meeting with Setsuna. Setsuna says she is very glad Kazusa is doing so well, she is famous, talented, beautiful and she recently got... a boyfriend (sour tone). She asks her why must she hog all the happiness, she has Haruki, she has everything. Setsuna explains to Kazusa that she is very broken and that she is suffering from memory loss. She has become unable to work and she keeps repeating things she has said because she does not remember anything. Then she says it can actually {{be a good thing}} to break down. According to her, if she completely breaks down and becomes unable to live without Haruki (because she can't live by herself anymore), then Haruki may feel pity for her and stay by her side. She tells Kazusa that she may actually get Haruki and win in the end. Kazusa says that even so, she won't give up on Haruki. Kazusa then almost mutilates her hands as recompense but got immediately prevented by Setsuna. This made Setsuna see how serious Kazusa was to be with Haruki. Kazusa goes to see Haruki. She tells him Setsuna got hurt so much because of her, yet nothing changed in her heart. She also says that she had tried to protect him and because of that she had ended up hurting Setsuna even more. According to Kazusa Haruki <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>important</b> to him, that is how much she means to him. In order to be with Haruki, Kazusa had abandoned her sick mother and destroyed her friend's life, she even almost mutilates her hands.|$|E
5000|$|Maury Yeston and Peter Stone {{began work}} on the musical in 1997, {{immediately}} after their success with Titanic. [...] Titanic was a large-scale show, and Yeston and Stone decided to turn to a smaller-scale work for their next piece. They felt that the Cassella play, a story celebrating the joy and humor of love, was both universal and moving, and that with its recent adaptation as Meet Joe Black, {{it was a good}} time to musicalize the story. Yeston said, [...] "it seemed to me that the piece screamed to be sung." [...] Since the story is set in Northern Italy during the Roaring Twenties, Yeston incorporated jazz, the Shimmy, and other period styles into his contemporary score [...] "to achieve a modern sensibility within the Period flavor of the score." [...] Yeston had lived in Northern Italy for a time, which informed his writing. “It was written by Alberto Casella in 1927 in response to the overwhelming killing in World War One and the pandemic that followed”, Yeston explains. “Death’s job is merely to collect people when they pass away. Exhausted from the recent scale of killing and death, he confronts a girl who has been in a car accident and he cannot take her because her potency of life is so strong. He sends her back into the world and resolves that he finally needs to know why people hate him so. Why do they dread him, why are they afraid of him, why do they cling to life, why <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>important?</b> And so, with Death tantalized by taking a few days off, nobody will die on the earth because he's not collecting them as, instead, he spends a weekend with this family in Northern Italy and discovers the one thing that makes life so precious -- love.|$|E

30|$|A {{critical}} step forward for changing this ‘what we know’ condition is engaging learners in doing science and examining {{the relationships between}} evidence and explanation. In classrooms, such opportunities typically occur when planning and carrying out investigations (PCOI) {{that are designed to}} engage learners in the nuanced decision making steps of moving from questions, to measures, to data, to evidence, and to explanation. PCOI is a complex process and frequently an iterative one, too. It takes time when designing and implementing investigations to sort things out about measuring and structuring data. If students and teachers only encounter preplanned confirmatory investigations based on tried and true step-by-step procedures always ensuring the anticipated outcome(s), then an undesirable outcome for students <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>important</b> and relevant cognitive and materials struggles of doing science get stripped away.
