5|$|However intense running {{sessions}} ran by coach Mick Lyons {{took their}} toll on <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee,</b> and on 20 September 1990 he took a knock in a practice match, which required him to have yet another operation on <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> After the return of Howard Kendall as manager in November 1990, Whiteside managed to appear in a few reserve team games, but this only delayed the inevitable, and {{he was forced to}} retire from the game at the age of 26 in June 1991. He had a testimonial game between Manchester United and Everton at Old Trafford in May 1992, but as United lost the title the previous week, only 7,434 turned out for the occasion.|$|E

5|$|With Warnock {{replacing}} Ternent as Bury {{manager and}} Ternent {{moving on to}} manage Burnley, this signalled a return to Turf Moor for Swan. Ternent moved Swan back into defence, but could only give him eleven starts and six substitute appearances following a combination of suspensions, illness and injury.

After two painful years, Burciaga returned to the Wizards' lineup in 2004, and was injury-free for the entire year. Given the opportunity he seized the left back position, and kept it all year long.

After injuries befell the Packers' defensive line, Johnson regained his starting position at defensive end. He started all 16 games that year, achieving 9.5 sacks. His career started to diminish after that season. In 1986, Johnson was credited with three and a half sacks as he was used as the designated third-down pass rushing specialist.
