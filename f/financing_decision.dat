Pooled OLS, fixed effect method (FEM) panel models and Tobit regressions are employed to examining the relationship between managerial overconfidence, government ownership, and leverage decision of publicly listed companies in Malaysia. This is the first study that empirically examines {{the impact of}} managerial overconfidence by testing CEO personal characteristics as a main independent variable on corporate <b>financing</b> <b>decision</b> for Malaysian firms. We also make the first attempt to test the moderating effect of government ownership on the relationship of managerial overconfidence and leverage decision.

(2) A higher degree of managerial overconfidence would result in lower leverage in GLCs, whereas the effect does not significantly exist in NGLCs.

30|$|The {{essence of}} capital {{structure}} decisions {{exists in the}} arguments put forwarded by Modigliani and Miller (1958). They argue that in ideal markets, business value is not influenced by firms’ <b>financing</b> <b>decisions.</b> However, {{this is not the}} case in real markets. Due to existence of taxes, transaction costs, and other factors, <b>financing</b> <b>decisions</b> become relevant to business valuation. One important study in this regard is the study of Byoun and Xu (2013). They examined financing policy of debt-free firms. They found that debt-free firms have the ability to raise funds through high-dividend payments. Dividend payment enables these firms to raise equity funds on flexible terms and also help them in maintaining good reputation in equity markets. This greatly reduces the agency costs of free cash flow. While analyzing <b>financing</b> <b>decisions</b> in Korean firms, Jung and Kim (2008) reported that firms having larger cash reserves have better chance of exploiting benefits of interest tax shield in Korea.|$|R

Empirically, I estimate the volatility costs of debt for a large sample of U. S. firms and test whether these costs affect <b>financing</b> <b>decisions.</b> I find evidence that volatility costs affect both the level of and short-term changes in debt. Further, a probit model of security issues suggests that managerial preferences help explain a firm's choice between debt and equit...|$|R
