5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes. A carcass was {{so named because}} the iron cage was thought to resemble the ribs of a body. A carcass {{was filled with a}} <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|The boranes (boron {{hydrogen}} compounds) {{and similar}} gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, {{it is not}} an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are also <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.|$|E

5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E

25|$|One of the {{simplest}} arsenic compound is the trihydride, the <b>highly</b> toxic, <b>flammable,</b> pyrophoric arsine (AsH3). This compound is generally regarded as stable, since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly. At temperatures of 250–300°C decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid. Several factors, such as humidity, presence of light and certain catalysts (namely aluminium) facilitate the rate of decomposition. It oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water, and analogous reactions take place with sulfur and selenium instead of oxygen.|$|R

5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of stores and provisions. The <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E

5|$|To {{make the}} tunnel water and frost tight, {{the walls were}} covered with {{polyethylene}} mats. Because they are <b>highly</b> <b>flammable,</b> they were then covered in a layer of gunite. Also installed were fire water pipes and ventilation systems to remove smoke. To sound-insulate the tunnel and avoid vibrations spreading to nearby housing, the entire tunnel was covered in a layer of rock wool. By December 2010, the ballast had been laid, and in January 2011 laying of the tracks and ties started. The work to build the tracks and overhead wires has been contracted to Baneservice. The contract for the electro-technical installations was awarded to YIT Building Systems for NOK120 million. As of 2006, the whole section from Lysaker to Sandvika was estimated to cost NOK2.7 billion.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{cities were}} highly {{vulnerable}} to damage from firebombing {{due to their}} design and the weak state of the country's civil defense organization. Urban areas were typically congested, and most buildings were constructed from <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> materials such as paper and wood. In addition, industrial and military facilities in urban areas were normally surrounded by densely populated residential buildings. Despite this vulnerability, few cities had full-time professional firefighters and most relied on volunteers. Such firefighting forces that did exist lacked modern equipment and used outdated tactics. Air raid drills had been held in Tokyo and Osaka since 1928, however, and from 1937 local governments were required to provide civilians with manuals that explained {{how to respond to}} air attacks. Few air-raid shelters and other air defense facilities for civilians and industry were constructed prior to the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Defence and Orion {{attacked}} the fifth French ship, Peuple Souverain, {{from either side}} and the ship rapidly lost the fore and main masts. Aboard the Orion, a wooden block was smashed {{off one of the}} ship's masts, killing two men before wounding Captain Saumarez in the thigh. On Peuple Souverain, Captain Pierre-Paul Raccord was badly wounded and ordered his ship's anchor cable cut in an effort to escape the bombardment. Peuple Souverain drifted south towards the flagship Orient, which mistakenly opened fire on the darkened vessel. Orion and Defence were unable to immediately pursue. Defence had lost its fore topmast and an improvised fireship that drifted through the battle narrowly missed Orion. The origin of this vessel, an abandoned and burning ship's boat laden with <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> material, is uncertain, but it may have been launched from Guerrier as the battle began. Peuple Souverain anchored not far from Orient, but took no further part in the fighting. The wrecked ship surrendered during the night. Franklin remained in combat, but Blanquet had suffered a severe head wound and Captain Gillet had been carried below unconscious with severe wounds. Shortly afterwards, a fire broke out on the quarterdeck after an arms locker exploded, which was eventually extinguished with difficulty by the crew.|$|E
50|$|Eupione, or eupion, is a {{hydrocarbon}} of the paraffin series, {{probably a}} pentane, C5H12, discovered by Carl Reichenbach in wood tar.

5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are <b>highly</b> <b>flammable.</b> South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E

For safe handling procedures, a hydrogen sulfide safety data sheet (SDS) should be consulted.|$|R
40|$|High {{temperature}} sintering of porous pellets {{of metal}} oxides to form flammable gas sensors {{remains one of}} the most straightforward and popular fabrication methods in use today, but is unsatisfactory in many ways including lack of control over structure and morphology of the pellets. In addition, the chemical and physical role of catalytic dopants is often unclear and further sintering during operation can lead to long-term drift and unreliable behaviour. We have been exploring the use of alternative fabrication techniques, for the development of <b>highly</b> sensitive <b>flammable</b> ps detectors, based on the sol-gel process. The main advantage of this technique over conventional processing technologies is the use of homogeneous, multi-component systems which can be prepared to a high degree of purity by mixing the molecular precursor solutions, and the reduction in fabrication temperature leading to unusual glasses or ceramics with better-defined properties. Several advantages in the development of <b>highly</b> sensitive <b>flammable</b> gas sensors are to be expected. Deliberate addition of impurities can be carefully controlled and low temperature fabrication should allow greater control over the structure, stoichiometry and morphology of the sensors. Both of these factors will contribute towards low background conductivity and high purity for high sensitivity. Finally the high porosity and large surface area of glassy materials produced by sol-gel methods should enhance sensitivity in mechanisms dominated by surface phenomena. In this paper we present details of the preparation of novel tin oxide thin-film sensors and initial results of response to a variety of organic solvents and common flammable gases. A comparison with conventional, commercially available tin dioxide (Taguchi) flammable gas sensors will be given...|$|R
