5|$|Current historiography {{developed}} in the 20th century; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw <b>in</b> <b>slavery</b> the conditions {{for the development of}} elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite.

5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} slavery in ancient Greece is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing primarily on the city-state of Athens. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested <b>in</b> <b>slavery</b> only inasmuch as it provided a source of revenue. Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s, however, {{witnessed}} {{the publication of}} revisionist studies that departed from the traditional historiography of slavery.

Genovese's Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (1974), Peter H. Wood, Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 Through the Stono Rebellion (1974), Leslie Howard Owens's This Species of Property: Slave Life and Culture in the Old South (1976), Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family <b>in</b> <b>Slavery</b> and Freedom, 1750–1925 (1976), and Lawrence W. Levine's Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom (1977). One of the more controversial of these studies was John W. Blassingame's The Slave Community.|$|E
