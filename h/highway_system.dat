5|$|A {{state highway}} was routed through {{downtown}} starting on May 13, 1913, {{when the system}} was created. It was first a part of M-15 when the <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> was signed in 1919, and then later as US41/M-28 after {{the creation of the}} United States Numbered <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> in 1926. (Under the original 1925 draft plan for the U.S. <b>Highway</b> <b>System,</b> US102 was the number assigned to run through Marquette.) The streets have been paved since at least the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|From 1929 until 1960, {{the road}} {{was part of the}} state <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> as M-135. The {{northern}} end of the highway always contained a section that ran concurrently with M-98, another state highway in the area. For a period in the 1950s, M-135 had a different northern terminus separate from M-98's endpoint. A few years before both highways were removed from the <b>highway</b> <b>system,</b> M-135 was moved to use M-98's terminus with M-28. Since the 1970s, M-135 {{has been a part of}} the county-designated <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> and assigned the number H-33, a moniker it has borne since.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper uses both DEA-CCR and DEA-BBC {{models to}} make an {{empirical}} analysis of the relative efficiency of China's <b>highway</b> <b>systems</b> respectively with respect to freight and passenger transport productivity. The results reveal that 64. 5 % of provincial <b>highway</b> <b>systems</b> present decreasing returns to scale. The non-parametric test shows {{that there is no}} significant difference in regional management levels and that 45 % of provincial <b>highway</b> <b>systems</b> are not efficient in their management levels. Thus, the corresponding improvement target and direction are dealt with in the paper. In addition, a super-efficiency analysis is conducted to rank the efficiency of <b>highway</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, the management level efficiency and scale efficiency scores for these systems provide the management authorities with policy-making strategies of how to allocate resources so as to maximize the output efficiency of their systems...|$|R

The United States <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> was adopted on November 11, 1926, by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and included US730, traveling northeast along the Columbia River from US30 in Umatilla to US410 south of Wallula.|$|E

Designated as part of the Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> in 1957, I-475 construction was funded by the federal government.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. <b>Highway</b> <b>system</b> {{laid out}} in 1925 and {{finalized}} in late 1926, U.S. Route 410 connected Aberdeen with Clarkston, following the Olympic Highway (State Road 9) to Olympia, the Pacific Highway (State Road 1)—concurrent with US 99—to Tacoma, the National Park <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> (State Road 5) to Yakima, and the Inland Empire Highway (State Road 3) to Clarkston. This differed from present US 12 between Elma and Naches in that it followed the route through Olympia and Tacoma rather than along the Cowlitz River. However, despite {{being part of the}} state <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> since 1897, US 410's crossing of the Cascades, the first between the Columbia River Gorge and Snoqualmie Pass, was not opened to traffic until 1931. A shortcut from near Packwood east across White Pass to Naches, very close to the original plan for the east half of State Road 5, was added to the state <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> in 1931 as another branch of the highway. The roadway between Packwood and Cayuse Pass, added to the state <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> on a different alignment in 1905, was finally completed in 1940, and the White Pass Highway was dedicated on August 12, 1951, opening a shortcut between southwest Washington and Yakima.|$|E
5|$|Grand River Avenue {{originated}} as an Indian trail before Michigan statehood. It {{later was}} used as a wagon road across the state. The roadway was included in the State Trunkline <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> in 1919 as M-16 and later the United States Numbered <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> as US16. Construction of a freeway {{along the length of the}} corridor was proposed in the 1940s, and included as part of the Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> in the mid-1950s. This construction was started in 1956 and initially completed across the state to Detroit in 1962. The proposed route for the Jeffries Freeway in Detroit was moved in the 1960s; it was built in the 1970s. I-96 was completed on November 21, 1977, in the Detroit area, closing the last gap along the route. Since then, additional interchanges and lanes have been added in places to accommodate traffic needs.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} debut of the U.S. <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> in 1926, M-11 was {{designated}} from M-50 at Napoleon to US112 in Saline. The last section of this highway was fully paved between Bridgewater and Saline in late 1948 or early 1949. In the middle of 1954, M-92 was extended southward from Chelsea to Manchester. From there, that highway replaced M-11 west to Bridgewater before turning south to Clinton; at the same time, the remainder of M-11 {{was removed from the}} state <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> and the designation was decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Valley Drive, a narrow, {{winding road}} {{along the western}} bank of Skaneateles Creek {{in the town of}} Elbridge, was {{included}} in Route20, an unsigned legislative route extending from Rochester in the west to Elbridge in the east. The highway was gradually taken over by the state of New York, beginning with the segment between the Elbridge and Jordan village lines. This section of Valley Drive was legislatively designated as part of State Highway487 (SH487) and added to the state <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> on November2, 1908. The portion within Elbridge was included in the state <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> on December7, 1911, as part of SH5080. The Jordan segment was added to the state <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> as part of SH5630 sometime after 1920.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state <b>highway</b> <b>system</b> was first {{numbered}}, the east–west highway running through Reed City was numbered M-20, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> was created. The business loop was created after US10 was moved to bypass downtown Reed City in the late 1950s. This realignment was completed, and the business loop commissioned, by 1960. Until 1986, the western half of the loop along Chestnut Street ran concurrently with US131 until that highway was moved to its current freeway routing.|$|E
