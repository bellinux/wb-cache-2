He {{is the son of}} Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan [...] "Ted" [...] Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, July–September 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married at the London Borough of Hackney in 1969. He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He {{regularly}} played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary School and Chingford County High School. In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, [...] "At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What {{do you want to do}} when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do." [...] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish, and Beckham has referred to himself as [...] "half Jewish" [...] and wrote in his autobiography [...] "I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion". In his book Both Feet on the Ground, he stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.|$|E

The local authorities sent some armed horsemen to stop Lu Su and his party from leaving. When the riders caught up with them, Lu Su turned back and said, [...] "You're all men of courage, so you should understand the situation well. The country {{is now in a}} state of chaos. You won't be rewarded for your efforts (even if you succeed in stopping us), but neither will you be punished if you don't pursue us. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to force us (to fight)?" [...] He then placed a shield upright on the ground and fired an arrow at it, piercing through the shield. The horsemen agreed with what Lu Su said and knew they could not stop him, so they gave up and left. Lu Su then crossed the Yangtze River with Zhou Yu and arrived in Jiangdong, where they met Sun Ce, who felt that Lu Su was a special person. Lu Su settled in Qu'e County (曲阿縣; in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu). When his grandmother died, he returned to Dongcheng County to attend her funeral.|$|E

[...] It {{consists}} of three competing elements: 1) I will - the ability to <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> need to do; 2) I won’t - {{the other side of}} self-control; the inability to resist temptation; and 3) I want - your true want, the ability to remember the big picture of your life. Willpower is a resource that gets depleted, particularly when you are rundown or hungry. However, you may increase your capacity for willpower by engaging in activities such as mindfulness, meditation and exercise and/or by ensuring good nutrition and adequate sleep.|$|R
5000|$|McGonigal defines willpower as [...] "the {{ability to}} <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to <b>do</b> when part of <b>you</b> <b>really</b> doesn’t <b>want</b> to <b>do</b> it", {{and says that}} humans {{experience}} conflicts between impulse and self-control in personal and social contexts, giving examples such as: craving for sweet foods, the urge to be sarcastic or complaining, {{and the desire to}} procrastinate. Humans have evolved adaptations to control their instincts and successfully resist impulsive drives, because living in groups requires self-control and this—McGonigal says—means taking the harder option. According to McGonigal, willpower failure or success can spread through a group, because humans tend to mirror the behavior of those they are socially connected with.|$|R

40|$|Making {{the central}} bank an agency with the mandate and {{reputation}} for maintaining price stability is {{a means by which}} a government can choose the strength of its commit-ment to price stability. This article develops four measures of central bank indepen-dence and explores their relation with inflation outcomes. An aggregate legal index is developedforfour decades in 72 countries. Three indicators of actual independence are developed: the rate of turnover of central bank governors, an index based on a ques-tionnaire answered by specialists in 23 countries, and an aggregation of the legal index and the rate of turnover. Legal independence is inversely related to inflation in industrial, but not in develop-ing, countries. In developing countries the actual frequency of change of {{the chief executive officer of}} the bank is a better proxy for central bank independence. An inflation-based index of overall central bank independence contributes significantly to explaining cross-country variations in the rate of inflation.
