Self <b>directed</b> <b>support</b> enabled individuals, their families and their other informal supporters to identify their needs, lifestyles and aspirations, and set personal goals. By giving people with disabilities access to planning and case management, and control over their allocated funding, the program allowed them to be their own agents of change (Department of Communities, 2010 : 7). The Queensland Department of Communities selected two service providers from a negotiated tender process to implement the Self <b>Directed</b> <b>Support</b> pilot to two groups of people with disability – children and their families, and young adults. One was the Sunshine Coast Children’s Therapy Centre (SCCTC), which supports young children (0 - 6 years) with physical disabilities and their family carers and significant other informal supporters.

Portugal and the Ottoman Empire also joined the alliance against France.|$|E

This second report provides {{findings about}} the outcomes for participants and their families, implementation of the pilot, the process and cost analysis.

5|$|Indeed, the {{evacuation}} of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters {{on a number of}} occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition. Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor. Indeed, the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in <b>direct</b> <b>support</b> of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe, such as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. The French Republican position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. Chief among them were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien.

5|$|The Australian Army {{has used}} tanks from after the First World War, through the interwar period, the Second World War, the Cold War {{and to the}} present day. Throughout this period the Army has {{primarily}} been a light infantry force, with its tanks mainly {{being used in the}} <b>direct</b> <b>support</b> role. The Australian Army's tanks have seen combat during the Second World War and the Vietnam War, where they proved successful despite some of the designs employed being considered obsolete. The first Australian tanks were a small number of British medium and light tanks which were operated mainly for training purposes during the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
50|$|Unlike rockets, guns (or howitzers as some armies {{still call}} them) and mortars are {{suitable}} for delivering close supporting fire. However, they are all suitable for providing deep supporting fire although the limited range of many mortars tends to exclude them from the role. Their control arrangements and limited range also mean that mortars are most suited to <b>direct</b> <b>supporting</b> fire. Guns are used either for this or general supporting fire while rockets are mostly used for the latter. However, lighter rockets {{may be used for}} <b>direct</b> fire <b>support.</b> These rules of thumb apply to NATO armies.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} 3 RAR {{arrived in the}} theatre, the North Koreans had been broken and were in rapid retreat, with MacArthur's forces {{conducting}} a successful amphibious assault at Inchon and breaking out along the Naktong perimeter on {{the southern tip of}} the Korean peninsula. A steady advance began, driving the North Koreans northwards towards the 38th Parallel. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was airlifted from Taegu to Kimpo Airfield north of Seoul on 5 October, however its vehicles had to move by road, driving , and did not arrive until 9 October. It was subsequently attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division, under the command of Major General Hobart R. Gay. On 16 October the brigade took over from the US 7th Cavalry Regiment as the vanguard of the UN advance up the west coast, its axis intended to take it through Kaesong, Kumchon and Hungsu-ri to Sariwon, then through Hwangju to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. Although the North Koreans had suffered heavily in the preceding weeks, they continued to resist strongly, while a lack of accurate maps and the narrowness of the roads made rapid movement difficult for the advancing UN forces. During this time 3 RAR had a platoon of American M4 Sherman tanks attached and a battery of field guns in <b>direct</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March, 1944, the {{division}} {{was transferred to}} the 71st Rifle Corps, where it would remain {{for the duration of the}} conflict. At about the same time, the 31st Army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. In the initial stages of Operation Bagration, the front's immediate objective was the city of Orsha. The 331st had the <b>direct</b> <b>support</b> of the 959th SU Regiment (SU-76s) for its initial assault; this regiment had been assigned to support of the corps since the beginning of June. In recognition of the 331st's role in the liberation of Orsha, on June 27, it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class. The division went on to assist in the liberation of Borisov. While two divisions of the 8th Guards Rifle Corps of the 11th Guards Army attacked from the west and north, the 331st drove into the south of the city and it was cleared of German forces by 3:00 am on July 1. In the following days it took part in the liberation of Minsk, before joining the general advance to the 1941 Soviet-German frontier. In recognition of his successful command of {{the division}} in this operation, Major General Berestov was awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union on June 27, 1945.|$|E
