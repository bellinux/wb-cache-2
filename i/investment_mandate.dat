40|$|Problems with {{performance}} measurement using information ratios {{relative to a}} benchmark are exposed. Random portfolios (that obey constraints but disregard utility) are shown to measure investment skill effectively. <b>Investment</b> <b>mandates</b> can also be based on random portfolios—this allows active fund managers more freedom to implement their ideas, and provides the investor more flexibility to gain utility. The issue of the proper attitude towards tracking error is broached, but left largely undecided.

50|$|The {{process is}} {{structured}} {{in a way}} for clients capital to be invested in the specified strategies in the <b>investment</b> <b>mandate.</b> Clients choosing a specific strategy will get the same strategy - there is no investment tailoring for the client. This means clients monies will be pooled together and invested at the same time. The actual client account is segregated and the monies invested will be weighted to the individuals capital.

50|$|Bond {{indices are}} harder to {{replicate}} compared to stock market indices due to {{the large number of}} issues. Usually, portfolio managers define suitable benchmarks for their portfolios, and use an existing index or create blends of indices based on their <b>investment</b> <b>mandates.</b> They then purchase a subset of the issues available in their benchmark, and they use the index as a measure of the market portfolio's return to compare their own portfolio's performance against. Often the average duration of the market {{may not be the most}} appropriate duration for a given portfolio. Replication of an index's characteristics can be achieved by using bond futures to match the duration of the bond index.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model to}} explain the widely used <b>investment</b> <b>mandates</b> in the institutional asset management industry based on two insights: First, giving a manager more investment exibility weakens the link between fund performance and his e¤ort in the designated market, and thus increases agency cost. Second, presence of tail risk (i. e., an asset with negatively skewed return) can further increase the agency cost if the manager is incentivized to pursue outside opportunities. These e¤ects motivate narrow mandates to most fund managers except those with exceptional talents. Our model sheds light on capital immobility and market segmentation that are widely observed in nancial markets, and highlights important e¤ects of tail risk on institutional incentive structures...|$|R

5000|$|When such {{backward-looking}} {{approaches are}} used to forecast future returns or risks using the traditional mean-variance optimization approach to asset allocation of modern portfolio theory (MPT), the strategy is, in fact, predicting future risks and returns based on history.

Other, more subtle weaknesses include the [...] "butterfly effect", by which seemingly minor errors in forecasting lead to recommended allocations that are grossly skewed from <b>investment</b> <b>mandates</b> and/or impractical—often even violating an investment manager's [...] "common sense" [...] understanding of a tenable portfolio-allocation strategy.|$|R
40|$|The {{persistence}} of risk levels of local General Equity unit trusts is evaluated. Variations in absolute and market-adjusted returns are measured {{to determine whether}} investors can use historical risk {{as a proxy for}} future risk levels. The General Equity funds are fairly homogenous, and different funds should exhibit stable risk levels if the fund managers’ <b>investment</b> <b>mandates</b> and <b>investment</b> styles remain stable over time. The results indicate a degree of absolute and market-adjusted risk stability over time. The market-adjusted risk and return relationship remained stable through the 2008 global crises, indicating that, on average, the fund managers maintained their benchmark-related risk exposures. Both the absolute and market-adjusted results indicate no statistically significant relationship between risk and return for the 2000 to 2012 period...|$|R

50|$|In 2014, {{there was}} {{significant}} pressure {{leading to a}} parliament investigation {{as to whether the}} fund should divest its coal assets in line with it ethical <b>investment</b> <b>mandate.</b> This resulted the fund divesting from energy companies that derive more than 30% of their revenues from coal, 53 companies in total. There is evidence however, that investment into coal actually grew during this period by simply shifting money to those companies who derive <70% of their revenues from coal (i.e. Glencore, BHP and Rio Tinto). In the same year the fund also increased its stake in 59/90 oil and gas companies in which it holds shares in excess of US$30 billion.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of various strategy-specific and composite hedge fund indices. Given the flexible and nonlinear <b>investment</b> <b>mandates</b> of hedge funds, various risk metrics that take factors such as extreme events and losses with respect to previous peaks are considered. Our analysis compares the risk-adjusted performances of hedge fund indices among themselves, {{with respect to the}} overall equity market and over time. Special attention is given to the distinction between investable and non-investable hedge fund indices. We find that the risk-adjusted performances of most hedge fund indices deteriorate over time. Although many hedge fund indices outperform a broad equity index in the full sample period, most hedge fund indices have highly negative returns during market downturns which sheds suspicion over the diversification benefits of investing hedge funds. We also find that non-investable indices are superior performers with respect to their investable counterparts. Finally, the comparison of performance among various indices has little dependence on which particular risk metric is used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the spillover effects of sovereign rating news across countries and financial markets using daily data on sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) spreads, stock market indices and sub-indices for banking and insurance for selected European countries {{during the period}} 2007 - 2010. Our main finding is that sovereign rating downgrades have statistically significant spillover effects both across countries and financial markets implying that rating agencies announcements can have negative externalities leading to financial instability. Those spillover effects depend both on the source country experiencing the downgrade and the linkages between the source and destination country. We also find that on average, rating news related to downgrades have stronger spillover effects than revision of outlooks which {{could be explained by}} ratings-based triggers such as those in banking regulation, ECB collateral rules, CDS contracts or <b>investment</b> <b>mandates.</b> Announcements from different credit rating agencies have different spillover effects suggesting that credibility or communication play a role beyond the news...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{concentrates}} on value and size effects in country portfolios. It contributes to academic literature threefold. First, I provide fresh {{evidence that the}} value and size effects {{may be useful in}} explaining the cross-sectional variation in country returns. The computations are based on a broad sample of 66 countries in years 2000 - 2013. Second, I document that the country-level value and size effects are indifferent to currency conversions. Finally, I introduce an alternative macro-level Fama-French model, which, contrary to its prototype, employs country-based factors. I show that applying this modification makes the model more successful in evaluation of funds with global <b>investment</b> <b>mandate</b> than the standard CAPM and FF models. </p...|$|E

40|$|Preliminary, not for {{quotation}} This paper {{investigates the}} performance of 402 real estate mutual funds worldwide {{during the period from}} March 1997 through April 2007. With the exception of funds targeting Asia, these funds generally adhere to their stated <b>investment</b> <b>mandate,</b> while global funds are mostly invested in the United States and the United Kingdom. Between 72 percent and 92 percent of {{the performance of}} these funds can be attributed to investment style. Grouped per region, real estate mutual funds exhibit excess returns that are significantly different from their global and regional benchmarks. Most notable, investment managers of North American and Australian real estate mutual funds have negative risk-adjusted returns, whereas investment managers of Asian, European and global funds are able to create value for investors.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} of the internal control market and the external monitoring mechanism in the institutional investment industry. We investigate the role of managerial turnover in the termination of <b>investment</b> <b>mandates</b> by Australian pension plans. We also identify how mandate turnover contributes to the departure of top fund managers. Pension plans rescind the services provided by an investment management company {{as a result of the}} dismissal of a manager- surprisingly, without considering improvements in fund post-replacement performance. The probability of mandate termination is greater for larger funds, those that do not have the highest fund rating, and who also generate lower gross returns. Terminations of pension plan mandates increase the probability of a fund company dismissing the responsible fund manager. Long term objective-adjusted returns and the investment style of the fund are also significant managerial dismissal considerations. These results illustrate the joint effectiveness of internal and external control markets in the pension fund industry...|$|R
40|$|While India {{boasts a}} {{world-class}} equity market and increasingly important bank assets, its bond market has not kept up. The government bond market remains illiquid.
