The paper discusses five main topics related to financial system stability: (i) what is <b>financial</b> system <b>stability</b> and why it is important; (ii) central bank function in maintaining financial system stability; (iii) promoting <b>financial</b> system <b>stability</b> in practice. This topic elaborates research and surveillance activities on the financial system, covering financial institutions and markets, financial infrastructure, domestic finance and international finance; (iv) coordination and cooperation in maintaining financial stability; (v) financial safety nets and crisis management. The paper concludes by posing several key challenges faced by related authorities in creating and maintaning <b>financial</b> system <b>stability.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This study derives {{an optimal}} {{macroeconomic}} policy combination for <b>financial</b> sector <b>stability</b> in the United Kingdom by employing a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (NK-DSGE) framework. The empirical results obtained show that disciplined fiscal and accommodative monetary policies stance is optimal for <b>financial</b> sector <b>stability.</b> Furthermore, fiscal indiscipline countered by contractionary monetary stance adversely affects <b>financial</b> sector <b>stability.</b> <b>Financial</b> markets, e. g. stocks and Gilts show a short-term asymmetric response to macroeconomic policy interaction {{and to each}} other. The asymmetry {{is a reflection of}} portfolio adjustment. However in the long-run, the responses to suggested optimal policy combination had homogenous effects and there was evidence of co-movement in the stock and Gilt markets...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe role {{of credit}} default swaps (CDS) in the {{financial}} crisis has been debated among regulators, market participants and academics since early 2008. CDSs are derivative instruments which enable market participants to transfer or redistribute credit risk. However, {{the size of the}} CDS market, combined with its structural opacity, concentration and interconnectedness, may be a sign that the CDS market also poses a systemic risk to <b>financial</b> market <b>stability.</b> The purpose of the article is to investigate the role of credit default swaps on <b>financial</b> market <b>stability.</b> The impact of credit default swap markets on <b>financial</b> market <b>stability</b> crucially depends on market mechanisms, and capital- liquidity requirements in financial markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{definition}} for <b>financial</b> market <b>stability</b> and an econometric test. It analyzes {{the impact of}} systematic and systemic shocks on developed and emerging market stock indices in normal and extreme market conditions. <b>Financial</b> market <b>stability</b> {{is defined as a}} constant impact of systematic shocks in normal and extreme market situations. Empirical results show that the impact of systematic risk is significantly larger in extreme market conditions than in normal conditions in emerging markets. In contrast, this relationship is stable for developed markets. Hence, only developed markets meet an essential condition for <b>financial</b> market <b>stability.</b> Moreover, we show that an increased impact of systematic risk can also be interpreted as system-wide contagion...|$|R

5|$|Both studios now faced rival projects, {{which could}} {{undercut}} their own long-term <b>financial</b> <b>stability</b> and plans. Columbia had no consistent movie franchise, and had sought Spider-Man since 1989; MGM/UA’s only reliable source of theatrical income {{was a new}} James Bond film {{every two or three}} years. An alternate 007 series could diminish or even eliminate the power of MGM/UA’s long-running Bond series. Likewise, an MGM/UA Spider-Man film could negate Columbia’s plans to create an exclusive cash cow. Both sides seemed to have strong arguments for the rights to do such films.|$|E

40|$|This study {{argues that}} trade {{policies}} regarding financial services {{are an important}} - but typically neglected - determinant of capital flows and <b>financial</b> sector <b>stability.</b> <b>Financial</b> services trade liberalisation which promotes {{the use of a}} broad spectrum of financial instruments and allows the presence of foreign financial institutions whilst not unduly restricting their business practices, results in less distorted and less volatile capital flows, and promotes <b>financial</b> sector <b>stability.</b> The study finds significant evidence in favour of this claim through an empirical analysis of GATS commitments in 27 emerging markets. Even countries where the financial system is weak, and where immediate, full-fledged financial sector liberalisation is not advisable, can open up certain types of financial services trade, as such trade strengthens the financial system without provoking destabilising capital flows...|$|R

40|$|<b>Financial</b> system <b>stability</b> {{is defined}} in terms of the {{expected}} macroeconomic losses that arise from financial system disturbances. This captures both the probability of various financial disturbances {{and the size of the}} macroeconomic costs arising from such disturbances. Because of the links between the real sector of the economy and the financial sector, monetary policy needs to be cognisant of the potential for <b>financial</b> system <b>stability.</b> We develop a general framework for policy analysis which highlights the trade-off between <b>financial</b> system <b>stability</b> and efficiency. We use this framework to analyse the potential impact on stability and efficiency of three current pressures in the Australian financial system. Namely, consolidation among the largest banks, the formation of large financial conglomerates, and greater opportunities for smaller niche institutions provided by technological developments. We develop a simple model to show that consolidation might reduce system stability through a loss of diversification – which is important in the case of idiosyncratic shocks to individual financial institutions. Offsetting this effect, consolidation might increase system stability if contagion is an important source of failure of financial institutions. Conglomeration has two offsetting effects in terms of system stability: diversification across different financial services can reduce the probability of failure of an individual institution; and contamination, which can lead to contagion flowing from failure of an unhealthy arm of the conglomerate. <b>financial</b> system <b>stability</b> and efficiency; consolidation; conglomeration...|$|R
