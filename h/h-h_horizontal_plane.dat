Inside the area A delimited by the <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes,</b> the covariant formalism of Maxwell’s equations leads to an initial value problem that is solved for independent initial conditions satisfying the boundary conditions. Outside the area A, the fields are represented by Rayleigh expansions.

40|$|It can {{be argued}} that modern {{architecture}} has expelled the building’s relationship to the ground. Raised on pilotis, modern buildings constructed the platform as an artificial ground plane. Ultimately, the platform was a two-dimensional plane, flattened to aid our transition across the built environment. This <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> merely tolerated inhabitation. Unfortunately the language synonymous with this plane has been extended into contemporary architecture. It is proposed that the rigidity and stability expressed by the surface of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> has failed to reflect the body, stimulate interaction, or challenge the inhabitant of architecture. To free the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> from its rigid axis this thesis aims to break away from the conventional building typology inflicted by modern architecture. As the force of gravity restricts our inhabitation of the built environment to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> we directly engage with this surface of architecture. It provokes the question, how can the design of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> engage the body and challenge the inhabitant to intensify the experience of architecture? An exploration of the skin-to-skin relationship between the surface of the body and the surface of architecture directs this thesis toward a provocative design exploration and evokes an expressive <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane.</b> To challenge the restrictive conception of architecture’s <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> the program of inhabitation for this design project explores the practice of yoga. Now conceived as a dynamic force, the body can be activated by architecture’s <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane.</b> This surface provides an expressive canvas with the capacity to embody the dynamic movements of yoga. It aids, activates and challenges the participant’s body and amplifies the experience of yoga. An expressive <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane,</b> central to the inhabitation of a yoga centre, generates a dynamic space that provokes a dialogue of interaction between the inhabitant and the surface of architecture. A dynamic plane has emerged...|$|R

We measured the angle, {{in reference to}} the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane,</b> between the tympanic annulus, the oval window, and the internal auditory canal (IAC) in 20 normal temporal bones obtained from individuals between 1 day old and 76 years old. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> was defined as the plane sloped 30 ° infero-anteriorly from the <b>plane</b> of the <b>horizontal</b> canal in each specimen. The plane of the tympanic annulus changed from a nearly horizontal orientation (34. 2 ° from the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane)</b> in neonates to a more vertical orientation (63. 3 ° from the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane)</b> in adults. The tympanic annulus and oval window planes remained at the same angle to each other (11. 9 ° ± 5. 1 °) throughout postnatal development, as did the plane of the tympanic annulus and the IAC (68. 6 ° ± 5. 3 °).

40|$|In 1956 Shiffman [S] {{proved a}} {{beautiful}} theorem on minimal surfaces lying between two <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes</b> as follows. Let M be a minimal annulus in rt, P 1, P 2 <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes</b> such that ∂M = C 1 ∪ C 2, Ci ⊂ Pi, i = 1, 2. He showed that for any <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> P between P 1 and P 2, i) M ∩ P is a circle whenever C 1, C 2 are circles and ii) if C 1, C 2 are convex curves, so is M ∩P. For this theorem Shiffman {{may have been}} inspired by Riemann’s minimal surface. That is a complete periodic minimal surface R whose fundamental piece F, homeomorphic to an annulus and bounded by two parallel lines l 1, l 2, lies between two <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes</b> containing l 1, l 2 such that R is an infinite number of stacks of the translated copies of F. Riemann’s minimal surface has the characterizing property that it intersects every <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> along a circle or a line. Indeed, Hoffman-Karcher-Rosenberg [HKR] showed that a properly embedded minimal annulus bounded by a pair of parallel lines in a slab is the fundamental piece F of Riemann’s minimal surface. Moreover Fang [F 1] proved that a properly embedded minimal annulus bounded by a line and a circle, each lying in a <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane,</b> is also part of Riemann’s example. It is not by accident that the lines in Riemann’s minimal surface are all parallel: Toubiana [T] showed that the two lines boundin...|$|R

Similar research shows that people, in general, tend to allocate positive and negative concepts in upper and lower areas, respectively, in relation to the vertical plane. Further research shows a higher salience of the vertical <b>plane</b> over the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> in the performance of sensorimotor tasks. The aim of the paper is to examine whether there should be a dominance of the vertical <b>plane</b> over the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane,</b> not only at a sensorimotor level but also at a conceptual level. In Experiment 1, various participants from diverse linguistic backgrounds were asked to rate the words "up", "down", "left", and "right".

Results suggest that the vertical plane is more salient than the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> regarding the allocation of emotion words and positively-valenced words were placed in upper locations whereas negatively-valenced words were placed in lower locations. Together, the results lend support to the BSH while also suggesting a higher saliency of the vertical <b>plane</b> over the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> in the allocation of valenced words...|$|R

Six distinct phases were obtained {{in the space of}} the couplings. Three phases are commensurate with long-range ordering, planar Néel states in <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> (phase. I), planar states in the plane vertical to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> (phase. VI) and collinear states normal to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> (phase. II). However the other three, are infinitely degenerate due to the frustrating competition between the couplings, and characterized by a manifold of incommensurate wave-vectors. These phases are, planar helical states in <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> (phase. III), planar helical states in a vertical plane (phase. IV) and non-coplanar states (phase. V). Employing the linear spin-wave analysis, it is found that the quantum fluctuations select a set of symmetrically equivalent states in phase. III, through the quantum order-by-disorder mechanism. Based on some heuristic arguments is argued that the same scenario may also occur in the other two frustrated phases VI and V. Comment: 13 page...|$|R
