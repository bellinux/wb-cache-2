40|$|Rock shore platforms, {{present on}} {{at least half of}} the 20 500 km-long {{coastline}} of the British Isles, are usually backed by cliffs of varying heights. They form in a range of material types from soft cohesive sediment to sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of varying strengths to very resistant igneous rocks. Lithology influences <b>platform</b> <b>erosion</b> rates: glacial till > London Clay > chalk > schist > limestone > basalt and granite. Chalk <b>platform</b> <b>erosion</b> rates adjacent to engineering structures are significantly higher than elsewhere on the platform. There are no published reports of erosion rates on British platforms developed in igneous rocks such as basalt and granite because they have proved too resistant to record values using a micro-erosion meter. The most intensively studied shore platforms in the British Isles are on Blue Lias limestone in south Wales and Cretaceous chalk in SE England and there is a need for more detailed studies on additional rock types, particularly for understanding key controls on platform morphology and rates of erosion. The issue of whether the shore platforms exposed at present day mean sea-level are inherited from earlier periods remains. The role of <b>platform</b> <b>erosion</b> in helping to drive cliff retreat is understudied and evidence that engineering structures may enhance <b>platform</b> <b>erosion</b> rates comes from only one rock type. Predicted climate change and sea-level rise scenarios combined with more intensive management of coastal systems mean that it is important to improve understanding of platform systems and their link to cliffs.

This paper presents erosion rates, measured over a 10 [*]year period on notches and platforms developed on the Permian, Ratburi limestone at Phang Nga Bay, Thailand. In so doing it contributes to informing a particular knowledge gap {{in our understanding of}} the erosion dynamics of shore platform and tidal notch development in the tropics and subtropics – notch erosion rates on relatively hard, ancient limestones measured directly on the rock surface using a micro-erosion meter (MEM) over time periods of a decade or more. The average intertidal erosion rate of 0. 231 [*]mm/yr is lower than erosion rates measured over 2 – 3 years on recent, weaker carbonate rocks. Average erosion rates at Phang Nga vary according to location and site and are, in rank order from highest to lowest: Mid-platform (0. 324 [*]mm/yr) [*]>[*]Notch floor (0. 289 [*]mm/yr) [*]>[*]Rear notch wall (0. 228 [*]mm/yr) [*]>[*]Lower platform (0. 140 [*]mm/yr) [*]>[*]Notch roof (0. 107 [*]mm/yr) and Supratidal (0. 095 [*]mm/yr). The micro-relief of the eroding rock surfaces in each of these positions exhibits marked differences that are seemingly associated with differences in dominant physical and bio-erosion processes. The results begin to help inform knowledge of longer term shore <b>platform</b> <b>erosion</b> dynamics, models of marine notch development and have implications for the use of marine notches as indicators of changes in sea level and the duration of past sea levels.

40|$|Quantifying {{rates of}} erosion on cliffed coasts across {{a range of}} {{timescales}} is vital for understanding the drivers and processes of coastal change and for assessing risks posed by future cliff retreat. Historical records cover at best the last 150  years; cosmogenic isotopes, such as 10 Be could allow us to look further into the past to assess coastal change on millennial timescales. Cosmogenic isotopes accumulate in situ near the Earth surface and have been used extensively to quantify erosion rates, burial dates and surface exposure ages in terrestrial landscapes over the last 3 decades. More recently, applications in rocky coast settings have quantified the timing of mass wasting events, determined long-term averaged rates of cliff retreat and revealed the exposure history of shore platforms. In this contribution, we develop and explore a numerical model for the accumulation of 10 Be on eroding shore platforms. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigated the influence of topographic and water shielding, dynamic <b>platform</b> <b>erosion</b> processes, the presence and variation in beach cover, and heterogeneous distribution of erosion on the distribution of 10 Be across shore platforms. Results demonstrate that, taking into account relative sea level change and tides, the concentration of 10 Be is sensitive to rates of cliff retreat. Factors such as topographic shielding and beach cover act to reduce 10 Be concentrations on the platform and may result in overestimation of cliff retreat rates if not accounted for. The shape of the distribution of 10 Be across a shore platform can potentially reveal whether cliff retreat rates are declining or accelerating through time. Measurement of 10 Be in shore platforms has great potential to allow us to quantify long-term rates of cliff retreat and <b>platform</b> <b>erosion...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Japanese islands, {{situated}} in a tectonically unstable region with a highly variable geology, are exposed to high wave energy and microtidal environments in most locations. Rocky coasts are common, most having a steep cliff with coastal recession being primarily driven by wave erosion. A fundamental relationship between recession and wave force is obtained through reanalysis of previous laboratory data. On {{the basis of this}} relation amodel is constructed for the development of type B platforms, that is, horizontal or subhorizontal platforms that have a steep scarp at the seaward edge. The process of wave attenuation on this type of platform and weathering-induced strength reduction of rocks are incorporated into the model. The model is applied to the southwestern coast of the Kii Peninsula and a platform at Ebisu-jima of the Izu Peninsula. Long-term development rates of platforms in the former area are examined: the model indicates that the rate of <b>erosion</b> when <b>platforms</b> were initiated at 6000 years BP is two orders of magnitude greater than present. At the Ebisu-jima <b>platform,</b> wave-induced <b>erosion</b> processes are explored on a daily basis: the model provides a description of temporal variations in platform growth, although the result is not fully satisfactory.

In March 2009, we gathered rock spalling observations at Mesnil Val, NW France, {{to document the}} effect of frost on platform lowering in macro-tidal environments. Six epochs of frost were recorded in two months, the two longest lasted 16 and 8 days, with minimum air temperature dropping to- 9. 5 °C. Semi-diurnal tides flood the entire platform, imposing up to 25 freeze-thaw cycles below- 2. 5 °C, the freezing temperature of seawater. 19 cycles occurred at neap tidal elevation lasting at most 3. 5 hrs. Our integrated observations indicate that these frost cycles were responsible for a platform lowering of about 0. 8 ± 0. 5 mm during a single winter. No clear spatial trend appears, nor do macroscopic chalk types clearly stand out as being more susceptible to erosion.

40|$|International audienceCoastal {{platforms}} and cliffs compose an inter-dependant dynamic system. To understand how cliffed coast evolve, {{it is therefore}} crucial to quantify the magnitude and dependence of their processes. Here we question the role of erosion by waves at platform steps, often linked to lithological discontinuities. Along the French chalky coast of the English Channel, we determine, by comparison of aerial photographs at 23 yr interval that the mesoscale steps are retreating {{at a rate of}} ~ 2 cm/yr, ca. 10 % cliff retreat rate. This corresponds to an average erosion rate of 0. 32 ± 0. 08 mm/a, quite uniform across the study area, suggesting that the geology has more of a control on erosion processes than the position in the tidal frame. In reality, erosion occurs only where platform surface is not shielded by debris fallen from the cliff. We study their size distribution (16 % of the platform) and location and draw the conclusion that small falls are quickly erased by wave action while far reaching fans may cover the entire platform width. The peak shielding by fan debris occurs at a distance of ~ 40 m from the cliff. Step erosion by block quarrying is the process likely responsible for 20 % to 100 % of <b>platform</b> <b>erosion...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{waves are}} active morphologic agents capable of shaping the small shore {{platforms}} {{that characterize the}} rocky coast of NW Italy. Two study areas have been selected along this coastal tract: Calafuria (Livorno) and Lerici-Tellaro (La Spezia), located ca. 120 km apart, the first being shaped in sandstone and the second in dolomite bedrock. Propagation of waves in the nearshore has been simulated by numerical modeling. From wave model results, validated with data from an offshore wave meter buoy, it is inferred that waves break directly on the coast or very close to it at Calafuria, whereas for Lerici-Tellaro shores, waves mostly break up to 150 m seaward of the shore platform. This implies {{that the amount of}} energy delivered on the platform is much greater in the first case than in the second case. Given breaking depths and the height of breakers, maximum pressure and shear stress released at the breaking point were calculated for both areas. The results showed that wave forces released onto the shore platforms both at Calafuria and at Lerici-Tellaro never exceeded the compressive strength of the platform rocks, assessed using the Schmidt hammer test. It is concluded that, in the study area and with the present oceanographic conditions, wave forces are not directly capable of causing <b>erosion</b> on shore <b>platforms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Geomorphic {{modelling}} {{is a key}} {{method to}} understand the soft cliff recession process to predict future rates of retreat and responses to climate change. A range of process-based models have been used; however the influence of varied vertical lithology {{has yet to be}} quantified. This paper describes modifications to the 2 D SCAPE (Soft Cliff and <b>Platform</b> <b>Erosion)</b> model, carried out to explore such interactions between vertical changes in cliff resistive strength and prevailing coastal conditions. As expected, weaker (/more resistant) layers lead to more (/less) rapid retreat. However, this effect is strongly influenced by the position of such layers relative to mean sea level, where the erosive potential is greatest. Moreover, model simulations reveal that layers of variable resistance give an asymmetric response in terms of both rates of retreat and the timeframe for the effect to be realised. For example, a reduction of material strength of 1 / 5 (in comparison to the remainder of the cliff) about mean sea level results in a rapid 130 % increase in the rate of retreat in comparison to the introduction of a five times more resistant layer of the same characteristics. This variation in response {{can be attributed to the}} different magnitudes of feedback governing profile reshaping associated with the change in lithology. For example, the introduction of a weaker layer amplifies erosion through its greater erosive potential combined with steepening of the overlying section. The results have important implications for the management of coastal cliffs exhibiting variable stratigraphy, combined with the potential for future interactions with sea-level rise...|$|R
40|$|Understanding soft cliff {{systems is}} a {{significant}} challenge owing to the complex recession process {{and the need to}} quantify future responses to climate change. Process-based geomorphic modelling provides a key method for developing our understanding. However, existing models are frequently criticised for their simplified treatment of the cliff. Therefore, the overriding aim of this research was to contribute towards the development of a more integrated model. To facilitate this, this research has applied, evaluated and refined the SCAPE (Soft Cliff and <b>Platform</b> <b>Erosion)</b> model to a study frontage of variable lithology and coastal planshape on the south west coast of the Isle of Wight (UK). The initial model appraisal highlighted the need to further understand and quantify the role of variable material strength on shore platform geomorphology and rates of cliff toe retreat. The model was subsequently refined and demonstrated that outcropping layers of variable material resistance about mean sea level are a key control on the rates of cliff erosion, particularly for low sediment frontages. Weaker layers were found to result in an asymmetric increase in retreat in comparison to a more resistant layer of the same characteristics owing to the contrasting effects on the shore platform slope. This emphasises the importance of not extrapolating historic rates of retreat across frontages of variable lithology. Coastal management studies must consider relative changes in material resistance up the cliff face, the thickness of variable layers and the rate of sea-level rise to determine the magnitude of impact and duration of exposure...|$|R
40|$|The French Basque Coast is an {{actively}} eroding rocky coast. In {{the study}} area it is made of flysch with a circa 40 degrees-dip; it is exposed to an average significant wave height of 1. 8 m and peak  period of 9. 6 s. It is mesotidal (spring tide of ~ 4 m). The current rocky shore platform is carved into the flysch layering. We focus on sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus contribution to rock shore erosion. Indeed, this sea urchin has a burrowing behaviour. An ecological study has been conducted for stock assessment, from shore to 10 m-deep. It indicates that sea urchins are burying their own shelter and are not reusing former ones. Below the depth of 10 m, sea urchins densities are very low and burial behavior is considered insignificant. Estimates of sea urchin density, and biomass are provided, making possible to evaluate the average erosion rate along this coast due to burying. It is {{of the order of}} 0. 17 mm/yr between 0 and 3  m below sea level, ~ 0. 05 mm/a between 3 and 5 m-deep, ~ 0. 02 mm/a between 5 and 8 m below sea level, and finally drops to negligible under 8 meters below sea-level. Close to the 0 level, it is thus between 30 and 5 % of the expected value (evaluated to be 0. 5 - 3 mm/a after 5 - 10 cm/a cliff retreat rate and a 1 - 2 degrees platform dip).

[...] This thesis research targets the Teloloapan subterrane and is aimed at establishing its stratigraphy, sedimentology, petrography and geochemistry as the basis for an improved understanding of its tectonic history. The Teloloapan subterrane contains a thick Lower Cretaceous age sequence of volcanic, volcaniclastic, and carbonate rocks (the arc-related succession), which is covered by Upper Cretaceous mostly deep-water siliciclastic rocks (the sedimentary cover successions). All rocks are strongly deformed. [...] The arc-related succession contains three formations (Villa Ayala, Acapetlahuaya and Teloloapan formations) showing concordant and transitional boundaries. Facies analysis of the Villa Ayala and Acapetlahuaya formations (Berriasian-Late Aptian) records the construction of volcanic build-ups and their destruction by gravity-current processes that formed slope-apron deposits. Carbonate rocks of the Teloloapan Formation developed on top of extinct volcanoes and formed an Aptian-Albian carbonate platform. [...] The Miahuatepec and Mezcala formations constitute the sedimentary cover succession. The Mezcala Formation is comprised of interbedded sandstone and shale with minor thin-bedded limestone and calcareous breccias. The Miahuatepec Formation is a thick sequence of interbedded sandstone and shale with minor thin-bedded limestone. Facies analysis shows both units were deposited by low- to high- concentration turbidity currents on the middle to lower parts of submarine fans. [...] Volcaniclastic and epiclastic sandstones from the arc-related succession are rich in volcanic lithic grains derived from contemporaneous volcanic source. They have an undissected to transitional arc provenance (terminology of W. R. Dickinson). Geochemical data indicate a mafic to felsic volcanic source with a calc-alkaline affinity. REE patterns {{are similar to those of}} evolved intraoceanic arcs. [...] Sandstones from the Mezcala Formation show quartzolithic and carbonate-rich petrofacies, while the sandstones of the Miahuatepec Formation are mainly quartzolithic. Both formations were derived by erosion of volcanic sources and have a transitional to dissected arc provenance. The Mezcala Formation also has a coeval formations contribution from the <b>erosion</b> of <b>platform</b> carbonates of the Teloloapan Formation. Geochemistry of the Miahuatepec Formation supports a calc-alkaline volcanic source with REE pattems similar to those of evolved intraoceanic arcs.

Boulders were repeatedly entrained, transported and deposited, and in some cases broken down (n = 1) or quarried (n = 3), during the most intense days of the storm.

These data firmly demonstrate rock coasts are dynamic and vulnerable under storm conditions. No statistically significant relationship was found between boulder size (mass) and net transport distance. Graphical analyses suggest that boulder size limits the maximum longshore transport distance but that for the majority of boulders lying under this threshold, other factors influence transport distance. Paired analysis of 20 similar sized and shaped boulders in different morphogenic zones demonstrates that geomorphological control affects entrainment and transport distance – where net transport distances were up to 39 times less where geomorphological control was greatest.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} on coastal processes {{is not only}} of basic and practical importance (for instance in engineering applications) but also of socio-economic relevance. Crenulated coasts are complex geomorphic environments where both erosive (into headlands) and depositional processes (in embayed beaches) occur simultaneously. Waves represent an important morphogenic factor {{and the most important}} source of energy to coastal zones. However, field data reporting the interaction between waves and rocky coastal features is still scarce, leading to a poor understanding on rates and drivers of surf attenuation at rocky shores. Waves abrasion and <b>erosion</b> on shore <b>platforms</b> depend on the platform properties, morphology of the adjacent continental shelf, and water depth upon the platform surface, which is controlled by tides, available sediment and wave climate (e. g.,Stephenson and Kirk, 2000; Marshall and Stephenson, 2011). Shore platforms extending in the intertidal zone at the rocky cliffs’ toe are natural morphological barriers to wave propagation and energy attenuation (Ogawa et al., 2011). Over short time scales the beaches in a crenulated coast are modified mainly by waves causing setup and set down in the surf zone leading to a very complex pattern and circulation modified by the interaction between the currents induced by waves and the incident waves. The mechanisms involved in morphological modifications in those environments are still not well understood (Silva et al., 2010). This work aims to compare the waves behavior both on a shore platform and adjacent pocket beach in response to exactly the same offshore wave conditions.

40|$|Reef fronts have {{traditionally}} been regarded as comprising debris derived by contemporaneous erosion of ‘the reef’. However, evidence from wave transport indicates that on present-day reefs {{the bulk of the}} debris generated in this way accumulates in the back-reef area, with only finer-grained sediment carried off-reef by retreating flows or by overwash. Nevertheless, in contrast to this observation, ‘fore-reef’ debris slopes are commonly considered “characteristic” of Phanerozoic reefs. This apparent error reflects the conflation of processes defining contemporary growth and accretion of the reef, and the corresponding long-term accretion of the carbonate platform on which it rests. Present-day reefs are commonly (although not exclusively) additions to long-lived carbonate platforms. Growth of the latter is intermittent and has been moderated by changes in sea-level that, for recent reefs, have been on time scales of less than 100 ka. During low sea-level stands, growth ceases or is translated downslope and earlier deposits are subject to lithification and subaerial erosion. Similar changes are applied on a larger scale to the aggrading growth of carbonate platforms, but the bulk accretion of these includes quite different processes and reflects far longer timescales. During low sea-level stands, the margins of platforms commonly become unstable, with instability reflected in slope failure and in the shedding of blocks, ranging from metres to kilometres in diameter, associated with the generation of debris flows and turbidites. It is argued that these are the materials that are commonly described as ‘reef talus’ in ancient structures, although their formation is largely independent of any contemporary reef growth.

40|$|The Anarak, Jandaq and Posht-e-Badam {{metamorphic}} complexes {{occupy the}} NW {{part of the}} Central-East Iranian Microcontinent and are juxtaposed with the Great Kavir block and Sanandaj-Sirjan zone. Our recent findings redefine the origin of these complexes, so far attributed to the Precambrian-Early Paleozoic orogenic episodes, and now {{directly related to the}} tectonic evolution of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. This tectonic evolution was initiated by Late Ordovician-Early Devonian rifting events and terminated in the Triassic by the Eocimmerian collision event due to the docking of the Cimmerian blocks with the Asiatic Turan block. The ``Variscan accretionary complex'' is a new name we proposed for the most widely distributed metamorphic rocks connected to the Anarak and Jandaq complexes. This accretionary complex exposed from SW of Jandaq to the Anarak and Kabudan areas is a thick and fine grain siliciclastic sequence accompanied by marginal-sea ophiolitic remnants, including gabbro-basalts with a supra-subduction-geochemical signature. New Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 ages are obtained as 333 - 320 Ma for the metamorphism of this sequence under greenschist to amphibolite facies. Moreover, the limy intercalations in the volcano-sedimentary part of this complex in Godar-e-Siah yielded Upper Devonian-Tournaisian conodonts. The northeastern part of this complex in the Jandaq area was intruded by 215 +/- 15 Ma arc to collisional granite and pegmatites dated by ID-TIMS and its metamorphic rocks are characterized by Some Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 radiometric ages of 163 - 156 Ma. The ``Variscan'' accretionary complex was northwardly accreted to the Airekan granitic terrane dated at 549 +/- 15 Ma. Later, from the Late Carboniferous to Triassic, huge amounts of oceanic material were accreted to its southern side and penetrated by several seamounts such as the Anarak and Kabudan. This new period of accretion is supported by the 280 - 230 Ma Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 ages for the Anarak mild high-pressure metamorphic rocks and a 262 Ma U-Pb age for the trondhjemite-rhyolite association of that area. The Triassic Bayazeh flysch filled the foreland basin during the final closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and was partly deposited and/or thrusted onto the Cimmerian Yazd block. The Paleo-Tethys magmatic arc products have been well-preserved in the Late Devonian-Carboniferous Godar-e-Siah intra-arc deposits and the Triassic Nakhlak fore-arc succession. On the passive margin of the Cimmerian block, in the Yazd region, the nearly continuous Upper Paleozoic platform-type deposition was totally interrupted during the Middle to Late Triassic. Local erosion, down to Lower Paleozoic levels, may be related to flexural bulge <b>erosion.</b> The <b>platform</b> was finally unconformably covered by Liassic continental molassic deposits of the Shemshak. One of the extensional periods related to Neo-Tethyan back-arc rifting in Late Cretaceous time finally separated parts of the Eocimmerian collisional domain from the Eurasian Turan domain. The opening and closing of this new ocean, characterized by the Nain and Sabzevar ophiolitic melanges, finally transported the Anarak-Jandaq composite terrane to Central Iran, accompanied by large scale rotation of the Central-East Iranian Microcontinent (CEIM). Due to many similarities between the Posht-e-Badam metamorphic complex and the Anarak-Jandaq composite terrane, the former could be part of the latter, if it was transported further south during Tertiary time.

40|$|A Jurassic- Cretaceous {{carbonate}} succession crops {{out along}} the Zyghosti Rema, Kozani (Northern Greece). The substratum consists of the ophiolitic succession of the Vourinos Massif (Pelagonian Domain) : serpentinites tectonically overlain by basalts, with thin lenses of radiolarian cherts of middle Bathonian age. The contact with the overlying Jurassic limestones is tectonic. Eight informal units have been distinguished within the Mesozoic limestones, from the base upwards. (A) bioclastic, intraclastic and oolitic packstone (Callovian- Oxfordian). (B) bioclastic packstone and coral boundstone (Oxfordian). (C) bioclastic and oncoidal wackestone with Clypeina jurassica (Oxfordian- Upper Kimmeridgian). (D) (Upper Kimmeridgian- Portlandian) : oncoidal packstone and rudstone (facies D 1); intraclastic and bioclastic grainstone and packstone (facies D 2); neptunian dykes with intraclastic and bioclastic wackestone and packstone filling (facies D 3); neptunian dykes with Fe-Mn rich laterite filling and with pink silty filling of early Late Cretaceous age. An unconformity surface, due to emersion and <b>erosion</b> of the <b>platform</b> during the latest Jurassic- Early Cretaceous, is overlain by (E) intraclastic, bioclastic packstone and grainstone (Cenomanian). (F) massive body of debrites with coral, echinoderm, algae and rudist large clasts (facies F 1) (Cenomanian); turbiditic beds of bioclastic, intraclastic and lithoclastic rudstone and grainstone (facies F 2). (G) thin bedded bioclastic mudstone and wackestone with planktonic foraminifers and radiolarians, alternating with turbiditic beds of bioclastic, intraclastic packstone and rudstone and with conglomeratic levels and slumped beds of the previous turbidites (upper Santonian- lower Campanian). (H) : bioclastic packstone with planktonic foraminifers (facies H 1) (lower Campanian - ?Maastrichtian); amalgamated turbiditic beds of bioclastic wackestone and packstone with planktonic foraminifers (facies H 2); turbiditic beds of bioclastic packstone and rudstone (facies H 3). These features allow to recognise the following sequence of events: 1) development of a carbonate platform in the Middle and Late Jurassic; 2) its overthrusting onto the ophiolites and its emersion starting from latest Jurassic time, with erosion and deposition of laterites; 3) marine transgression on the Jurassic platform and on the ophiolites during the early Late Cretaceous, and 4) extensional tectonism and platform demise starting in the Cenomanian, with sedimentation of gravity flows and turbidity currents deposits from the Cenomanian to the Campanian- ?Maastrichtian. </p...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a regional scale assessment of coastal erosion undertaken {{during the period}} 2000 - 2100 for a 30 -km length of soft-rock coast between Weybourne and Happisburgh, northeast Norfolk. This coastline comprises large lengths of soft, erodible, cliffs, which will be vulnerable to increases in sea level and storminess under future changes in climate. The magnitude of erosion during the next century is of concern to scientists, policymakers and the general public, especially with the expectation of acceleration in sea-level rise. The regional-scale assessment considers combined scenarios of sea-level rise, changing wave climate and coastal management, by successfully integrating a number of modelled elements for the first time: 1. Broad scale modelling of shoreline erosion and profile evolution using the process-based SCAPE (Soft Cliff and <b>Platform</b> <b>Erosion)</b> model; 2. A probabilistic model of cliff-top position derived from SCAPE outputs; 3. Nearshore wave climate modelling. SCAPE describes the functioning and emergent behaviour of the coastal system at a regional scale, and provides a detailed dataset for analysis of risk and responses to future coastal erosion. The SCAPE model outputs have been linked with a flexible GIS tool (SCAPEGIS), developed to provide visualisation and interpretation of the model results. Outputs {{are available in the}} form of maps, dynamic visualisation, and descriptive statistics of key parameters such as cliff toe and cliff top position. It also allows analysis with other datasets such as land use and building location for impact evaluation, and hence could be used in shoreline management and cliff-top land use planning. This research seeks to address a shortfall in coastal erosion research in the UK, whereby analysis of risks and responses to erosion at the coast is hindered by limited knowledge of the size and location of erosion hazard zones. Through the process of considering potential impacts of sea level rise and changing wave climates on rates of soft shore recession a number of questions have been raised concerning the relative importance of shore platform lowering; the extent to which relative sea level rise is controlling continuous cliff retreat; {{and the nature of the}} relationship between offshore seabed morphology and coastal evolution. The modelling philosophy adopted by SCAPE offers considerable scope for addressing questions such as these, and thereby provides an important step in improving our understanding of coastal risk from climatic change. Using the approach developed here, planners are provided with a method for examining broad-level system response with combined management and climate-change scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} geomorphic modelling of {{the main}} Norfolk study area, the 50 km of the coast between Blakeney Spit and Winterton Ness, specifically the eroding cliffs, shore platforms, beaches, dunes and coast protection structures. The models represent both the natural eroding coastal system and past and future management interventions. Numerical experiments are also used to explore the possible dynamics of this coast if it were in a natural state. The ‘reduced complexity’ modelling tool Soft Cliff and <b>Platform</b> <b>Erosion</b> (SCAPE) is core to the analyses. It is described, along {{with the development of}} the quasi-three-dimensional Norfolk model. This model links marine hydrodynamic models to those of cliff failure, coastal flooding and economic risk. These links are described, along with the cliff instability module, the representation of beach fluctuation and beach nourishment (both natural and artificial). Results are shown to illustrate processes operating at a range of scales, including (millennial scale) emergence of the shore profile and beach volumes; (century scale) foreshore lowering, sensitivity to variations in rock strength, sediment transport potential and rate of sea-level rise; and (decadal scale) growth of wave impact forces, emergence of large-scale sand waves, probability density functions of beach volume, probabilistic cliff recession and the effects of beach nourishment. The benefits of such ‘reduced complexity’ modelling in general are highlighted. These include {{a deeper understanding of the}} coastal geomorphology, improved predictability, long-term model stability and ready coupling to other models. The approach is also relatively quick to apply and so can be implemented in practitioner studies, and the results are informing coastal planning in North Norfolk. Important features of the work include its large scale, which the coastal management process greatly needs, and the potential to use probabilistic methods, which allow economic risk to be derived to inform management decision-making. In terms of the Tyndall Coastal Simulator, the SCAPE model was a key element in linking the offshore conditions to human consequences (flood and erosion risk). It stresses the mediating role of coastal geomorphology in this link. Depending on how the coast is managed, those geomorphic processes can enhance (via erosion) or reduce (via accretion) these risks. The beach volumes were a direct input to the inundation analysis (Chap. 8), which together with the clifftop position informed the risk analysis (Chap. 9) ...|$|R
40|$|Shore {{platforms}} on the Kaikoura Peninsula {{have been}} examined to determine the roles of marine and sub aerial weathering processes in <b>platform</b> evolution. <b>Erosion</b> was measured to assess rates of development and processes of erosion. Lowering rates on platforms are presented from two years of monitoring using a traversing micro-erosion meter. Cliff retreats were calculated using aerial photographic interpretation. Marine processes were investigated by using deep water wave data, by measuring waves on shore platforms and by analysing measured tidal data. Weathering processes were investigated using tidal data, climate data, the Schmidt Hammer test, and a laboratory experiment on wetting and drying. Lowering rates over two years ranged from 0. 07 to 19. 80 mm, and annual rates ranged from 0. 154 to 9. 194 mm/yr. Rates of erosion varied with lithology {{and the type of}} <b>platform.</b> <b>Erosion</b> on Type A mudstone platforms was 1. 98 mm/yr; on Type B mudstone <b>platforms</b> <b>erosion</b> was 0. 733 mm/yr; and on limestone platforms it was 0. 88 mm/yr. The grand mean lowering rate for all shore platforms was 1. 13 mm/yr. These rates fall {{in the middle of the}} range of published rates from previous studies at Kaikoura and at locations around the world. For the first time, erosion data from a traversing micro-erosion meter were presented as volumes of material eroded. The total volume of rock eroded from study sites having, each with an area of 45. 4 cm 2, ranged from 1. 20 to 92. 50 cm 3. A significant finding was that rock surfaces swell up as indicated by a rise in surface level rather than lowering from erosion. The maximum measured swelling was 8. 90 mm. At some measurement sites as much as 90 per cent of measurements showed swelling over a period of 98 days. Values for erosion and swelling were higher during summer months. Both erosion and swelling were shown to be statistically related to season, suggesting that weathering is the group of processes causing both erosion and swelling. Summer provides better conditions for wetting and drying, which is thought to be the most important weathering process on shore platforms. Horizontal retreat rates were calculated over 52 years for cliffs, beaches and lagoon deposits backing shore platforms at Kaikoura, these ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 91 m/yr. Investigation of marine processes showed that the deep water wave environment off the Kaikoura Peninsula is very energetic, but the amount of wave energy delivered to platforms is very low. A comparison of deep water wave energy flux with wave energy flux at the landward cliff of platforms, showed that there was a reduction by as much as five orders of magnitude. An analysis of the role of breaking waves revealed that these were ineffective as an erosional agent because the depth of water offshore causes breaking well before waves arrive on platform surfaces. Shear stresses and dynamic forces under waves were calculated from waves measured on shore platforms. This showed that these forces never exceeded the compressive strength the platform rocks at Kaikoura. It was concluded that wave forces are not directly capable of causing erosion. Evidence of weathering on shore platforms came from a number of distinctive surface morphologies on platforms: honeycombs, salt crystal growths, water layer weathering; and slaking. Schmidt Hammer test data showed: firstly, that weathering had occurred; and secondly, that rock strength was reduced through weathering by as much as 50 per cent. Weathering processes on shore platforms rely on repeated wetting and drying, and for this reason the number of wetting and drying cycles was estimated. The number of cycles ranged from 104 to 379 per year, the variation was due to tidal influences and the growth of algae during winter months. At elevations low in the tide range fewer cycles occurred; the greatest number occurring between the peaks of spring and neap tides, where rainfall adds to the number. Most cycles were estimated to occur between 0. 6 and 0. 9 m above mean sea level on the more landward margins of platforms. It was at these elevations and locations that the highest rates of erosion were measured. Laboratory experiments on wetting and drying showed that only one cycle was needed to cause erosion. Waves were shown not to cause erosion, while sub aerial weathering does. Statistical analysis showed significant relationships between erosion, and wetting and drying and elevation. Based on these results it was concluded that the development of shore platforms at Kaikoura relies on weathering resulting from repeated wetting and drying. This is contrary to recent work which proposed that shore platforms result from marine erosion. Published mathematical models of shore platform development were found to be invalid at Kaikoura, because they were designed on the assumption that platforms are indeed wave cut features. This assumption is incorrect for shore platform development at Kaikoura. An empirical model is presented to explain platform evolution and the differences in platform morphology. A separation between platform types is presented based on the ability of weathering to cause erosion and on compressive strength. This is contrary to a published demarcation between types based on the erosive force of waves and on compressive strength. The type of equilibrium that platforms tend towards is considered. It is proposed that there are two ways to consider equilibrium. First, platforms may be lowered to an as-yet-unidentified elevation; this was viewed as being a static form of equilibrium. Secondly, platforms may continuously widen because weathering is an ongoing process. It was proposed that there is no equilibrium width for shore platforms...|$|R
40|$|The {{sphalerite}} deposit at Newfoundland Zinc Mines near Daniels Harbour, western Newfoundland {{is situated}} in {{the upper part of}} the Lower Ordovician St. George Group, a complex of dolostones, limestones and breccias in the middle of a Lower Paleozoic shallow-water, carbonate platform sequence. It is a zinc-dominated Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) deposit, a subtype of MVTs that is characteristic of the Appalachians. This study shows that zinc mineralization occurred during one phase of a complex history of repeated dolomitization and fracturing of the host carbonates along northeast-trending lineaments. This history is interpreted through an integrated analysis of the sedimentologic, stratigraphic and structural framework, petrography, cathodoluminescence and geochemistry. [...] The upper St. George Group carbonates were deposited along the edge of the tropical Iapetus Ocean during Early to early Middle Ordovician time when the passive continental margin began to experience the initial effects of plate convergence. Shallow subtidal muddy carbonates (Catoche Formation) shallowed upwards into restricted-water, rhythmically interbedded peloidal grainstones and mudstones (Peloidal or Costa Bay Member) and peritidal laminites and burrow-mottled mudstones (Aguathuna Formation). Deformation and fragmentation of the platform and marine regression during early Middle Ordovician time resulted in the regional St. George Unconformity and the formation of rock-matrix breccias from subsurface karst. The mine stratigraphy records a minimum of 5 stages of faulting, subsurface dissolution and <b>erosion</b> of the <b>platform</b> at this time. The platform was gradually flooded during Middle Ordovician time as the upper member of the Aguathuna Formation and limestones of the Table Point Formation were deposited over the St. George Unconformity. Continued convergence of the continental margin caused collapse of the platform and generation of a foreland basin in which a thick sequence of siliciclastic flysch was deposited and eventually overridden by Taconic thrust sheets. [...] Seven dolomite crystal types or generations (I through VII) crystallized in four major settings. Microcrystalline, syngenetic dolostones (I) with enriched ¹HO replaced subtidal to peritidal mudstones at or near the surface. Some of these dolostones were then incorporated as clasts in conglomerates and solution breccias. Composite diagenetic crystals (II) grew during burial forming turbid, replacive cores near surface and clear rims at depths where pressure solution (> 300 m) was active. Pore-filling, clear, zoned dolomite cements (III) sealed most remaining porosity in early dolostones. [...] Epigenetic coarse dolostone/sphalerite (D/S) complexes overprinted the earlier dolomites. They formed around fracture systems as extensive stratabound bodies within, and local discordant bodies across the Catoche Formation. Their development occurred in 5 main stages: (1) Regional compression generated linear, stratabound fracture zones along faults and around rock-matrix breccias, (2) Xenotopic pre-ore dolomites (IV) replaced dolostone-mottled limestones and formed zebra fabrics along fractures. (3) Hydrothermal (140 ﾟC mode) ore fluids caused extensive dissolution of carbonates. (4) Sulphides precipitated in two stages along fracture zones as fracturing, faulting and dissolution continued. (5) Post-ore hydrothermal dolomites (V, VI), dominated by replacive and pore-filling saddle dolomites with depleted ¹HO, crystallized around widespread, dilatant fractures forming spar breccias, pseudobreccias and coarse sparry dolostones. Faults associated with regional uplift displaced the D/S complexes and formed fluid conduits creating a fourth and final environment for late fault-related, turbid dolomites (VII) which replaced limestones. [...] The genesis of epigenetic dolostones and sulphides is interpreted to be the result of regional fracturing during the initial stages of the Siluro-Devonian Acadian Orogeny. Rising geothermal gradients generated by structural thickening of the crust probably caused warming of basinal fluids, the release of metals and sulphur from minerals in the sediments and basement and the formation of hydrothermal convection in the sedimentary pile. Steep fractures penetrated the base of the sedimentary pile and enabled fluids to rise directly from basement depths of 4 to 6 km. At the deposit site the warm, buoyant fluids rose to the top of fracture aquifers where they displaced cooler formation waters. Cooling, loss of CO₂, sulphate reduction and/or increased pH probably accounted for sulphide precipitation...|$|R
40|$|The Capertee High in the Mudgee-Capertee {{region was}} a Late Silurian to {{earliest}} Middle Devonian shallow marine to subaerial palaeogeographic unit {{to the east}} of the Hill End Trough, north-east Lachlan Fold Belt, southeastern Australia. Rocks of the Capertee High occur in structurally-complex sequences along with Ordovician basement, thick Late Devonian siliciclastic sequences, and Middle Carboniferous granitic intrusions. Flat-lying Permian-Mesozoic sequences overlap the High in the east and north. Early Devonian sequences associated with the Capertee High can be broadly subdivided into two categories: (a) Platform sequences, which were deposited on the shallow marine to subaerial platform areas of the Capertee High and have been collectively defined as the approximately 4000 m thick Kandos Group; and (b) Western Platform Margin Sequences, which were deposited in slope and base-of-slope settings along the western margin of the Capertee High platform and have been subdivided into the Queens Pinch and Limekilns Groups. The latter sequences are transitional westwards with strata of the eastern Hill End Trough. This thesis focuses on: (a) elucidating the stratigraphy, depositional processes and environments, and palaeogeography of the Kandos Group (particularly in the Rylstone-Cudgegong area); (b) establishing a biochronological framework for the Early Devonian succession by obtaining conodont faunas from the carbonates; (c) attempting correlation of the Kandos Group with platform margin units and Hill End Trough sequences; and (d) producing a synthesis of Early Devonian sedimentation and volcanism on the Capertee High and eastern Hill End Trough. Results show that the Kandos Group spans almost the entire Early Devonian and is separated from Late Silurian sequences by a widespread unconformity. The Kandos Group can be accurately correlated with the western platform margin sequences which are also dated by conodonts; however, correlation with the Hill End Trough succession is imprecise and relies on a small number of SHRIMP U/Pb zircon dates (which are inaccurately aligned with conodont zones) and rare macrofaunas. The Lochkovian portion of the Kandos Group is a transgressive to regressive shallow marine sequence deposited on a west- to southwest-sloping shelf flanked to the east by eroding sedimentary basement and active silicic volcanoes, and passing to the west into deepwater facies along the western margin of the High (basal Mullamuddy Formation) and in the eastern Hill End Trough (upper Crudine Group). Sedimentation in the Kandos Group began in the early Lochkovian woschmidti Zone and comprised (in ascending order) : a transgressive sequence of wave-dominated, fan-deltaic elastics (Warrah Conglomerate); a unit of transgressive biostromal to biohermal carbonates (Clandulla Limestone; woschmidti to eurekaensis Zones); a transgressive to regressive muddy, storm-influenced shelf deposit (Yellowmans Creek Formation; eurekaensis to delta Zones); and a thick regressive unit of storm-dominated siliciclastics deposited in middle shelf to nearshore settings (Roxburgh Formation; delta to pesavis or early sulcatus Zones). Facies prograded west during the late Lochkovian regression, culminating in shelf exposure and some erosion in the east. The early Lochkovian transgression may reflect a eustatic sea-level rise, whereas the late Lochkovian regression more likely indicates uplift of nearshore areas ahead of increasingly proximal volcanism. Thick sequences of dacitic to rhyolitic pyroclastics and volcaniclastics (Riversdale Volcanics and Huntingdale Volcanics) demonstrate that the Capertee High was dominated by subaerial silicic pyroclastic volcanism during the early to mid Pragian sulcatus and kindlei Zones. Medium-scale calderas, centred southeast of Cudgegong and in the eastern Capertee Valley, were flanked by extensive, shallowly-dipping sheets o f silicic ignimbrites and epiclastics which probably overlapped, forming a continuous sheet. Short-lived transgressions on the platform resulted in minor carbonate deposition during volcanically quiescent periods. Huge volumes of volcanic detritus were transported to the west and deposited as lowstand fans and aprons along the margin of the Capertee High (Mullamuddy and Kingsford Formations) and in the Hill End Trough (Merrions Formation). The Carwell Creek Formation overlies the Riversdale Volcanics and represents a possibly eustatic transgression in the latest Pragian to earliest Emsian (pireneae to dehiscens Zones) which initially reworked then drowned the existing volcanic topography, creating a broad southwest-sloping shelf with local eroding volcanic islands. Sedimentation in this setting was dominated by a laterally and temporally extensive regime of storm- and tidally-influenced nearshore to shelf siliciclastic sequences deposited in barrier island settings, along with local biostromal and biohermal carbonate buildups deposited in lagoonal and open-marine environments (Carwell Creek Formation, Myrtle Grove Formation and basal Mt Frome Limestone). Transgression cut off the supply of clastic detritus from slope and basin areas, and condensed mudstone sequences were deposited along the margin of the Capertee High (Warratra Mudstone and 2 ̆ 7 Rosedale Shale 2 ̆ 7) and in the Hill End Trough (basal Cunningham Formation). A transgressive pulse in the perbonus Zone was followed by regression, local <b>platform</b> exposure and <b>erosion</b> of <b>platform</b> areas in the middle Emsian (late perbonus to inversus Zones), and a number of carbonate aprons developed along the western margin of the High (basal Sutchers Creek Formation and Inglebum Formation). A transgression (possibly eustatic) resulted in further deposition of carbonates on the Capertee High during the late Emsian serotinus Zone (middle to upper Mt Frome Limestone and unpreserved equivalents). Regression later in the serotinus Zone resulted in erosion of some of these platform carbonates and redeposition in fans along the western margin of the Capertee High (Jesse Limestone and upper Sutchers Creek Formation). This regression probably continued into the earliest Eifelian partitus Zone, when carbonates of the Mt Frome Limestone were replaced by wave-dominated shoreline and shelf elastics of the Boogledie Formation. Deposition of this clastic sequence continued for an unknown length o f time into the early Eifelian before it was terminated by uplift and regression related to the mildly manifested Middle Devonian Tabberabberan deformation which effectively ended the depositional history of the Capertee High. Modem analogues for the Early Devonian Capertee High-Hill End Trough-Molong High exist in the Sumisu Rift (off the southeast coast of Japan), the southern Havre Trough (north of New Zealand), and the Sulu Sea (between Borneo and the Philippines). The Tertiary Waitemata interarc basin (north of Auckland, New Zealand) displays gross similarities in facies, palaeogeography and scale compared to the Early Devonian Hill End Trough and its flanking highs...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the geological-morphological survey on the marine and {{transitional}} terraces of the coastal belt within the Straits of Magellan (Estrecho de Magallanes) between Porvenir and Puerto Yartoú (Tierra del Fuego) are reported. 	The information is mainly from the mapping and field sampling carried out during the 1991, 1994 and 2003 Italian expeditions which were organized by the “Dipartimento di Scienze Geologiche, Ambientali e Marine” of the “Università di Trieste”, within the P. N. R. A. (Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide) - Magellan Project (Coordinator: Antonio Brambati) and by the "Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra" of the "Università di Cagliari" within the cooperation poject PVS - Regione Autonoma della Sardegna - Chile (Coordinator: Sandro DeMuro). 	Previous studies, carried out on the Straits of Magellan were mainly directed at sedimentological research on the sea bottoms and coastal belt of the eastern section (Atlantic opening). Similar wide ranging research was carried out also on the coastal belt of the western section of the Straits (Pacific opening) from seavessels, since it was inaccessible by land which is typically sheer (fiords). The first coastal studies were connected with the sedimentological analysis of the bottom, but were limited to research on the source and transport of the sediments {{as well as a}} regional definition of vast morphostructural units. Subsequent research was carried out in greater detail with mapping of morphological units in the coastal belt (collection of morphostructural, stratigraphic, micropaleontological and sedimentological data, study of active cliffs, palaeo-cliffs, littoral dynamics, dunes, etc.). 	 	During this second phase, greater attention was given to the study of palaeo-shorelines and different terrace orders of presumed marine origin. On the basis of the initial geological, sedimentological and geomorphological results obtained, we made a zoning of the coastal belts along the Atlantic opening of the Straits. 	The map shows the distribution of the youngest terraces (prevalently Holocene), from which four orders have been mapped starting from the average sea-level. The three youngest orders are certainly of coastal origin while for the oldest a transitional origin may be feasible. 	Generally, they are mostly depositional bodies, but very ocasionally they are just simple marine <b>erosion</b> surfaces (palaeo-abrasion <b>platforms)</b> formed either on glacial and/or glacifluvial deposits, or on the Meso-Cenozoic bedrock. On the whole, they follow the current coastline, being apparently genetically connected to it, although in detail, they present an ancient configuration different from the present Straits. 	Bahía Inútil is a marine morphological unit located in an original Quaternary glacial valley, and its morphogenesis is probably linked to several of the latter glaciations. It became marine dominated just {{at the end of the}} last glaciation. 	In the surveyed area, from the zone North of Porvenir to South of Punta Yartoú, for about 200 km., the coasts of the bay impinge on the local Meso-Cenozoic basement, the glacial cover s. l., or marine-transitional terraced deposits. 	The Meso-Cenozoic basement, which is well represented along the whole coast, is mainly formed from the sediments of the Grupo Bahía Inútil units or of Agua Fresca, Chorrillo Chico or Cerro Cuchilla formations. In the southern area of the bay, up to Puerto Arturo, it is formed from a sequence of folds, sometimes faulted with axial direction West North West - East South East (E. N. A. P., 1977; Mapa Geológico de Chile - Instituto de Investigacion Geológicas, 1980). 	Glacial deposits s. l. result from superimposition of the latter glaciations or just local episodes of them. They are part of continental geomorphological units, both depositional and erosive. These units are expressed by: moraines (ground, terminal or lateral), drumlins, erratics, kame terraces, fluvial terraces, kettle holes, marginal and submarginal channels, etc., which evidence advancement of the glaciers towards Bahía S. Sebastián (East). They are intimately connected to broad, frequent glacifluvial inter-morainal or alluvial plains at different heights, which represent either simple erosion surfaces or depositional bodies. Altogether, these glacial and alluvial deposits are formed from gravels, sands and well laminated pelites often affected by tectonics due to the ancient glacier actions. 	The terraced marine and transitional deposits belong basically to four orders, and they are mainly represented by depositional bodies, but sometimes only by erosion surfaces lying on the Meso-Cenozoic basement (abrasion palaeo-platforms) or on Quaternary glacial and glacifluvial deposits. Their sequence is evident in the vicinity of Porvenir. 	The First, more ancient Order, shows terraces generally located between 18 and 25 m above p. s. l., mostly around 20 m., constituted by sands and pelites characterized by an intense stratification and parallel lamination. There is no proof that it belongs to a marine environment, although its strict distribution along the present coast and not beyond it, suggests this. Landwards, especially in the eastern area of the bay and to the North East of Cabo Boquerón, where it shows an inner step, its upper surface connects with palaeo-alluvial fans. It suggests, on the whole, a transitional environment. There are neither absolute nor relative chronological data. Its superimposition on last glaciation deposits suggests that it belongs to the lowest stage of the Holocene or, perhaps, to the upper Pleistocene. 	Second-Order terraces are definitely coastal marine, as proved by lithology and biofacies. At Bahía Inútil and in its neighbourhood, they are mainly made up of gravels and sands. They are mainly located around 10 m, ranging from 6 to 11 m above p. s. l.; to the north of Porvenir they are higher, containing there or at Cabo Boquerón, some inner steps. According to the bibliography, their Holocene age has been confirmed by dating with radiocarbon and by their superimposition on last glaciation deposits and the current fauna. 	Third-Order terraces run mostly parallel with the present coast, with the exception of the ancient deltaic areas, where they follow a landward tendency, becoming transitional terraces in the contact zones. They are much more evident than they seem on this map, because of the scale, especially in small inlets to the mouths of creeks. They are mainly made up of fossiliferous gravels (gasteropods, bivalves etc.), and locally, sands and laminated pelites. They are distributed between 3 and 5 m above p. s. l. 	The Fourth Order shows itself to be distribuited at a height of betwen 1 to 2 metres. The Fourth Order is composed of raised palaeo-beaches containing a rich faunas of gasteropods, bivalves and balanids as recognized by C 14 dating. 	From the evolutional palaeo-geographic point of view, all four terrace orders are post last-glacial. The First Order is probably bound to the morphological situation at the beginning of the last glaciation, whereas the Second, the Third and the Fourth Orders belong to pauses in the isostatic uplift, together with a positive eustatic component subsequent to the glacial phase and currently considered of minor importance to the isostatic component. The presence of contemporary tectonic movements cannot be exluded. Detailed studies aimed at distinguishing the eustatic effect from the isostatic and tectonic ones are in course. 	The present morphologic conditions support the described palaeo-geographic evolution since they repeat the conditions of the past shown by the terraces. 	In this sector also, many of the coastal lakes were connected, in their first phase of formation only, to glacial morphogenesis; subsequently, their evolution in an advanced phase of deglaciation (the last) was strictly linked to marine action and thus closely linked to the formations of the terraces. The lakes were, in fact, trapped between those terraces following their isostatic uplift (Cabo Monmouth, Laguna Barrosa, Puerto Nuevo, Caleta Josefina, Laguna Ema, Puerto Yartoú) ...|$|R
