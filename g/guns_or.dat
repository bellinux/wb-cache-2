5|$|During {{the night}} of 20/21 September, the 16th and the 19th Divisions marched {{to the west of}} Nablus, under Liman von Sanders orders, where they linked up with von Oppen's Asia Corps. The next morning, von Oppen reorganised the Asia Corps by amalgamating the {{remnants}} of the 702nd and 703rd Battalions into one, with a rifle company, a machine gun company and a trench mortar detachment, while the 701st Battalion with its machine gun company, six guns, a troop of cavalry, an infantry-artillery platoon with two mountain <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> howitzers and a trench mortar section with four mortars and a cavalry squadron, remained intact.|$|E
5|$|Kleist's II Corps {{numbered}} 13,500 men while Kaptzevich's X Corps counted 6,500 soldiers. There {{were also}} the 1,500 troops from IX Corps who survived the Battle of Champaubert. These were grouped into three or four temporary battalions and an artillery battery. The rump of IX Corps lost 600 men {{and all of its}} guns on the evening of 14 February. The II Corps had eight 6-pound batteries and two 12-pound batteries. Each battery had eight <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> a total of 80 cannons. There was also a howitzer battery of unknown strength. The X Corps had three batteries attached.|$|E

5|$|The Eyeshield 21 anime {{adaptation}} was co-produced by TV Tokyo, NAS, and Gallop, and {{was directed}} by Masayoshi Nishida until episode 103, and by Shin Katagai from 104 to 145. The series of 145 television episodes aired in Japan from April 6, 2005 to March 19, 2008 on TV Tokyo. In Japan, Bandai Visual distributed the anime in DVD format; thirty-six volumes were released between July 26, 2006 and June 26, 2007. Some changes were done {{in comparison to the}} manga; for example, swearings and <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> gambling references were reduced.|$|E
5|$|Training started {{immediately}} {{and concentrated on}} physical fitness, weapons training, movement across country including cliff climbing, obstacle crossing and raiding operations. Weapons training was limited {{by the lack of}} anything other than the personal weapons (rifles and pistols) that each man had brought with him. Machine <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> anything heavier were not available at the time. In August 1940, some officers and non-commissioned officers (NCO) were sent to Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands on a commando course. These men were then responsible for teaching the rest of the unit.|$|E
5|$|By 11 May 1942, the Red Army {{was able}} to {{allocate}} six armies under two fronts, amongst other units. The Soviet Southwestern Front had the 21st Army, 28th Army, 38th Army and the 6th Army. By 11 May, the 21st Tank Corps had been moved into the region with the 23rd Tank Corps, with another 269 tanks. There were also three independent rifle divisions and a rifle regiment from the 270th Rifle Division, concentrated in the area, supported by the 2nd Cavalry Corps in Bogdanovka. The Soviet Southern Front had the 57th and 9th armies, along with thirty rifle divisions, a rifle brigade and the 24th Tank Corps, the 5th Cavalry Corps and three Guards rifle divisions. At its height, the Southern Front could operate eleven <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> mortars per kilometer of front.|$|E

5|$|During the night, the Asia Corps {{lost touch}} with the 16th and 19th Divisions, but {{following}} the direct orders of Liman von Sanders, these divisions withdrew {{to the west of}} Nablus. Here von Oppen got in contact with them during the morning of 21 September. At that time the remains of the 702nd and 703rd Battalions were reformed into one battalion, supported by a rifle company, a machine gun company and a trench mortar detachment. The 701st Battalion with its machine gun company of six guns, a troop of cavalry, an infantry-artillery platoon with two mountain <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> howitzers and a trench mortar section with four mortars and a cavalry squadron, remained intact.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutionary War with France {{broke out}} in 1793, leading to the {{extensive}} modernisation of the castle. Repairs were carried out in 1794 {{at a cost of}} £647, followed by a review of the defences the next year by the Master-General of the Ordnance. The 16th-century castle was still strongly fortified {{by the standards of the}} time, but it could not support the heavier <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> batteries of artillery required to tackle enemy warships. Instead, two new gun batteries, each armed with five 36-pounder (16.3kg) guns, were built alongside the castle in 1795, with a further eighteen 9-pounder (4kg) guns mounted in the old fort; the guns concerned had all been captured from the French.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{departed for}} the Western Front in June 1918 {{to join the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF). The division's advance detachment reached Brest, France on 8 June. In late September, the29th received orders to join the U.S. First Army's Meuse-Argonne Offensive {{as part of the}} French XVII Corps. During its 21 days in combat, the 29th Division advanced seven kilometers, captured 2,148 prisoners, and knocked out over 250 machine <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> artillery pieces. Thirty percent of the division became casualties—170 officers and 5,691 enlisted men were killed or wounded. Shortly thereafter the Armistice with Germany was signed on November 11, 1918, ending hostilities between the Central Powers and the Allied Powers. The division returned to the United States in May 1919. It demobilized on 30 May at Camp Dix, New Jersey, though it remained an active National Guard unit.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, the badnjak {{ceremony}} {{begins on}} Christmas Eve, {{but there are}} many regional variations surrounding the details. Early in the morning the head of each family, usually accompanied by several male relatives, selects and fells the tree from which a log will be cut for their household. The group announces its departure by firing <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> small celebratory mortars called prangija. The Turkey oak is the most popular species of tree selected in most regions, but other oaks are also chosen. Beech, pear, quince, hornbeam, and plum trees are used in eastern Serbia, although less frequently than oak trees. In some areas of Montenegrin Littoral where oaks do not grow, olives, bay laurels, elms, or strawberry trees are used instead. Young, straight, and undamaged specimens are preferred. The badnjak may be more valued if it is felled stealthily in someone else's rather than in one's own woods.|$|E
5|$|Usually, when {{a gunman}} {{was hired by}} a town as town marshal, they {{received}} {{the full support of}} the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate {{it was time for a}} change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he could keep his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Bevin {{criticized the}} Affordable Care Act {{and called for}} {{repealing}} it in its entirety. His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping damages awarded for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states {{to allow them to}} cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E

5|$|In October 1957, Hergé {{sent his}} publisher, Casterman, {{the cover of}} his {{completed}} nineteenth Tintin adventure, The Red Sea Sharks, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his next story. Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, Tintin in America, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé {{came to believe that}} retracing old ground would be a step backwards. Another idea had Tintin striving to prove that Haddock's butler Nestor was framed for a crime committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, but kept the idea of an adventure with no <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> violence—the only Tintin story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus to save them from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, but kept the setting in a snowy environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.|$|E
5|$|With about 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman {{soldiers}} of the 16th and 19th Divisions, von Oppen succeeded in retreating towards Beisan via Mount Ebal during 21 September but {{was forced to leave}} behind all <b>guns</b> <b>or</b> baggage. They suffered some casualties when fired on by artillery, before bivouacking that night at Tammun with the 16th and 19th Divisions at Tubas, unaware that Desert Mounted Corps had already occupied Beisan. They were moving northwards from Tubas towards Beisan when von Oppen learned it had already been captured. He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders would order a strong rearguard action. However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army ordered him to cross the Jordan instead; he successfully got all the Germans and some of the Ottoman soldiers across before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked and captured the remainder, to finalise the capture of Afulah and Beisan. Liman von Sanders was very critical of Jevad's intervention which considerably weakened the Samakh position, but von Oppen would have had to break through a whole cavalry division to get there.|$|E
