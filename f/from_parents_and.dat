5|$|The {{cause of}} {{rumination}} syndrome is unknown. However, studies have drawn {{a correlation between}} hypothesized causes {{and the history of}} patients with the disorder. In infants and the cognitively impaired, the disease has normally been attributed to over-stimulation and under-stimulation <b>from</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> caregivers, causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli. The disorder has also commonly been attributed to a bout of illness, a period of stress in the individual's recent past, and to changes in medication.|$|E

25|$|Women's {{property}} {{rights in the}} Quran are <b>from</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> near relatives. A woman, according to Islamic tradition, {{does not have to}} give her pre-marriage possessions to her husband and receive a mahr (dower) which she then owns. Furthermore, any earnings that a woman receives through employment or business, after marriage, is hers to keep and need not contribute towards family expenses. This is because, once the marriage is consummated, in exchange for tamkin (sexual submission), a woman is entitled to nafaqa– namely, the financial responsibility for reasonable housing, food and other household expenses for the family, including the spouse, falls entirely on the husband. In traditional Islamic law, a woman is also not responsible for the upkeep of the home and may demand payment for any work she does in the domestic sphere.|$|E
25|$|Learning {{in early}} life is {{apparently}} important to all parrots, {{and much of}} that learning is social learning. Social interactions are often practised with siblings, and in several species, creches are formed with several broods, and these, too, are important for learning social skills. Foraging behaviour is generally learnt <b>from</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> {{can be a very}} protracted affair. Suprageneralists and specialists generally become independent of their parents much quicker than partly specialised species who may have to learn skills over long periods as various resources become seasonally available. Play forms a large part of learning in parrots; it can be solitary, and related to motor skills, or social. Species may engage in play fights or wild flights to practice predator evasion. An absence of stimuli can delay the development of young birds, as demonstrated by a group of vasa parrots kept in tiny cages with domesticated chickens from the age of 3 months; at 9 months, these birds still behaved {{in the same way as}} 3-month-olds, but had adopted some chicken behaviour. In a similar fashion, captive birds in zoo collections or pets can, if deprived of stimuli, develop stereotyped behaviours and harmful behaviours like self plucking. Aviculturists working with parrots have identified the need for environmental enrichment to keep parrots stimulated.|$|E

He also holds children {{have the right to}} run away <b>from</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so. He asserted that parents have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a [...] "flourishing free market in children". He believes that selling children as consumer goods in accord with market forces, while [...] "superficially monstrous", will benefit [...] "everyone" [...] involved in the market: [...] "the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing".|$|E
