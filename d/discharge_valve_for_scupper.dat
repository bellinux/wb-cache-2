40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} large-eddy simulation (LES) to predict the performance of hermetic reciprocating compressors utilized in refrigeration. In such devices the pressure difference between the suction/discharge chamber and the cylinder, established by the piston motion, is responsible <b>for</b> the <b>valve</b> opening. Once the valves are open, the flow dictates the pressure distribution on the valve reed surface and, consequently, the resultant force that will govern the valve dynamics and its displacement from the seat.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the dynamic response of a pressurized water pipeline system {{is important for the}} design and also the integrity monitoring of these systems. An efficient method for summarizing the behavior of a pipeline system is through the determination of their system response functions. These functions can be extracted by injecting a pressure signal with a wide bandwidth that persists over the length of a pipeline system. Unlike electrical and mechanical systems, generating such signals in pressurized water systems is difficult. Valves capable of generating a signal against the system back-pressure often lack the necessary maneuverability to ensure the signal is sharp and hence with high-frequency content and the generated transient is often large in amplitude, risking damage to the system. A method for generating a small amplitude transient signal with a wide band of frequencies is desirable. This paper presents the design <b>for</b> a side <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> <b>for</b> generating a pseudorandom binary sequence of pressure changes that are of a small magnitude in relation to the steady state head of the pipeline. The pseudorandom pressure sequence is used to provide an estimate of the system response function. The continuous form of the signal allows the amplitude of each individual pulse within the signal to be small while maintaining the same signal bandwidth. The valve has been tested experimentally and was found to provide a good match with the theoretical response of the pipeline. The method provides a practical alternative to frequency sweeping using sinusoidal signals or sharp <b>valve</b> closures <b>for</b> the extraction of the response functions. Once determined, the system response function can be utilized to detect system faults such as leaks and blockages. Pedro J. Lee; John P. Vítkovský; Martin F. Lambert; and Angus R. Simpso...|$|R
40|$|In principle, a {{reciprocating}} compressor stage {{consists of a}} cylinder, the working volume which varies periodically due to a piston moving inside a liner. Latter is sealed by two sets of valves. On the one hand the suction <b>valve</b> <b>for</b> admitting the gas to be compressed {{and on the other}} the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> <b>for</b> allowing the high pressure gas to be delivered to the downstream process. The typical type of valves used within compressors for refrigeration plants are reed valves. The key feature of these mentioned valves - simultaneously affecting both their sealing performance as well as the reliability - is that they are not actuated. They are held close by elastic forces and they open and close automatically, in accordance to the balance of gas pressure forces as well as the previously mentioned elastic ones. The former is primarily characterized by the static pressure difference across the closed valve and the aerodynamic drag brought about by the gas flow impinging onto the sealing reed in a partially or fully open valve. Evidently, a high degree of coupling between the gas flow and the sealing element motion, today referred to as fluid-structure interaction (FSI), can be expected. The reed and the absence of a reliable guide that would provide for the plan-parallel motion give rise to non-parallel impacts with other parts of the valve assembly, leading to dynamic stress effects. This not only complicates the prediction of the reed valve dynamics, it also causes premature sealing element fracture, decreases the compressor efficiency and ultimately leads to unscheduled maintenance shutdowns. Consequently pursuing the optimization of the reed valve movement is a necessity. The measurements of reed valve dynamics as well as their movement in compressors can be performed by commercial proximity sensors, strain gauges or in house developed sensors. Although timing and lift information is available through these methods, other modes of fluttering such as torsional movement are more difficult to be observed. This work tries to address these aspects by providing real operation data obtained in a test rig. An in-depth comparative analysis of three measurement methodologies, represented by an optical, resistive as well as an eddy current sensor system will be carried out regarding their possible adoption in a state-of-the-art refrigeration compressor. Furthermore, the acquired data will be evaluated with respect to its potential application for collecting mentioned torsional movements. In the end a comparison against a numerical approach shall be conducted...|$|R

50|$|In piston {{aircraft}} engines, continuous-flow {{fuel injection}} {{is the most}} common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all mechanical, requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the TCM system. The Bendix system is a direct descendant of the pressure carburetor. However, instead of having a <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> in the barrel, it uses a flow divider mounted on top of the engine, which controls the discharge rate and evenly distributes the fuel to stainless steel injection lines to the intake ports of each cylinder. The TCM system is even more simple. It has no venturi, no pressure chambers, no diaphragms, and no <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b> The control unit is fed by a constant-pressure fuel pump. The control unit simply uses a butterfly <b>valve</b> <b>for</b> the air, which is linked by a mechanical linkage to a rotary <b>valve</b> <b>for</b> the fuel. Inside the control unit is another restriction, which controls the fuel mixture. The pressure drop across the restrictions in the control unit controls the amount of fuel flow, so that fuel flow is directly proportional to the pressure at the flow divider. In fact, most aircraft that use the TCM fuel injection system feature a fuel flow gauge that is actually a pressure gauge calibrated in gallons per hour or pounds per hour of fuel.|$|R

In order to predict the <b>valve</b> behavior <b>for</b> compressor optimization, flow characteristics and valve system dynamics are key factors.

40|$|In {{refrigeration}} compressors, the suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> {{are responsible}} <b>for</b> {{the retention of}} the refrigerant from the suction chamber to the cylinder and passage from the cylinder to the discharge chamber. As the opening and closing of the valves are caused by the forces produced by the refrigerant flow, {{the understanding of the}} flow through the valve is of fundamental importance in order to enhance the efficiency of the valve system. The numerical simulation of the flow is an efficient method to perform this task. Due to the complex geometry usually found in this type of valve, simplified geometries have been used to represent the valve, particularly the radial diffuser. This work presents a numerical simulation of the unsteady flow through a more realistic geometric model <b>for</b> the suction <b>valve</b> including the movement of the reed. An Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) with the Multi-Direct Forcing Scheme is used to represent the valve geometry and to solve the 3 D unsteady flow for an imposed angular movement of the reed. An adaptive mesh dynamically refined is used for representing the flow domain. The governing equations are solved by a projection method, using a semi-implicit second-order scheme for time integration. The systems of algebraic equations are solved by a Multigrid-Multilevel technique. Results for pressure profiles on the reed surface are shown for a Reynolds number equal to 1, 000.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an analytical investigation on the practicability of using mechanically operated <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> in conjunction with a manually operated intake control for improving the performance of N.

These valves, which may be either of the oscillating or rotating type, are placed in the discharge opening of the supercharger and are so shaped and synchronized with the supercharger impellers that they do not open until the air has been compressed to the delivery pressure. The intake control limits the quantity of air compressed to engine requirements by permitting the excess air to escape from the compression chamber before compression begins. The percentage power saving and the actual horsepower saved were computed for altitudes from 0 to 20, 000 feet. These computations are based on the pressure-volume cards for the conventional and the modified roots type superchargers and on the results of laboratory tests of the conventional type. The use of <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> shows a power saving of approximately 26 per cent at a critical altitude of 20, 000 feet.

40|$|The {{opening delay}} of a <b>discharge</b> reed <b>valve</b> <b>for</b> {{compressors}} {{caused by the}} stiction force of the oil film between the reed and the valve seat is investigated. The coupling simulation algorithm including models of cavitation in the oil film is developed. In order to check the validity, the numerical simulation is performed under several conditions of a model experiment. The coupling model consists of the reed deformation, the gas flow, and the oil film flow with cavitation. The two-dimensional reed deformation is expressed by expanding natural modes that are obtained by the finite element method using shell elements. The gas flow is expressed by the thermodynamic model under the assumption of the internal reversible process. The two-dimensional oil film pressure distribution is obtained by solving numerically the Reynolds’ equation through the finite volume method. On the model of cavitation in the oil film, {{in addition to the}} case in which cavitation is not taken into account, two cavitation models are tested; the static cavitation model (Reynolds’ condition) in which the minimum oil pressure is set to absolute zero, and the dynamic cavitation model in which the oil film pressure can fall to the absolute negative (tensile in the liquid) due to the direct simulation of the bubble expansion. Comparisons on the opening delay time between simulation results and the experimental result show that the static cavitation model gives the earlier delay time than that in the experiment, and the dynamic cavitation model which simulates the absolute negative pressure in the oil film reproduces accurately the experimental delay time. The simulation through the dynamic cavitation model also reproduces well behaviors of cavitation and blow-by flow (oil film rupture) in the oil film captured by the high-speed camera in the experiment. The relation among the pressure, the thickness, and the cavitation area of the oil film that are obtained in the simulation shows the mechanism of the oil film rupture (valve opening), i. e., the cavitation bubbles promote the increase of the oil film thickness during the stiction and the increased oil film thickness causes the recovery of the oil film pressure, and the subsequent blow-by flow (oil film rupture) ...|$|R
