5|$|Beauchamp's {{defense team}} {{attempted}} to <b>discredit</b> Patrick Darby by stressing {{his association with}} the Old Court and suggesting the murder was politically motivated.

5000|$|Pimelite was <b>discredited</b> as {{a mineral}} species by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA) in 2006, {{in an article}} which {{suggests}} that “pimelite” specimens are probably willemseite (which is approved), or kerolite (which is also <b>discredited).</b> This was a mass discreditation, and not based on any re-examination of the type material (assuming any exists). [...] Nevertheless, {{a considerable number of}} papers have been written, verifying that pimelite is a nickel-dominant smectite. [...] It is always possible to redefine a mineral wrongly <b>discredited.</b>|$|R

5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to <b>discredit</b> Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} absence of any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E
5|$|Historian George Ostrogorsky {{believed}} that volunteers were gathered through {{the reorganization of}} Anatolia into four themes, where the volunteers were given inalienable grants of land {{on the condition of}} hereditary military service.

5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to <b>discredit</b> Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to <b>discredit</b> the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E

5|$|A major {{corrective}} opportunity {{this year}} involved the rerelease {{of one of}} the earliest malicious biographies of Mrs. Eddy, The Life of Mary Baker G.

The current publisher, after much correspondence with our office, instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias. The book has received almost no attention in the public, proving if Truth isn't spoken, nothing is said.|$|E

5|$|An {{internal}} {{attempt was}} made to <b>discredit</b> Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and he tolerated it until the societal damage wrecked by the Moczar movement had become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis in Czechoslovakia and not inclined to support personal changes in the Polish leadership.|$|E
5|$|Charles Cardell (1892–1977) was {{the founder}} of a Pagan Witchcraft {{tradition}} that rivalled that of Gerald Gardner's in southern England during the 1950s. A psychologist and stage conjurer, Cardell ran a company named Dumblecott Magick Productions {{from his home in}} Charlwood, Surrey, from where he also controlled a local coven that was spied on by the press, leading to a well-publicised court case. Having been involved with Spiritualism as well as Pagan Witchcraft, Cardell initially befriended Gardner, but in 1958 they had an argument, and in 1964 Cardell tried to <b>discredit</b> him by publishing much of the then-secret Gardnerian Book of Shadows.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald died in 640, and {{according}} to most versions of the Kentish Royal Legend was succeeded solely by his son Eorcenberht. However, an early text (Caligula A.xiv) refers to Eormenred as 'king', suggesting either he was a junior king under Eorcenberht, or had a shared kingship. One suggestion is that the some other version {{of events in the}} 'legend', which give him no title, may have been an attempt to <b>discredit</b> royal claimants from Eormenred's line.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{analyzes}} the move of <b>discrediting</b> the opponent {{as a means}} to persuasion in political debates.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on <b>discrediting</b> texts on the personalities of Czechoslovak dissidents in years 1977 - 1979 and 1985 - 1988. It studies the {{historical}} background of these years and describes this problem {{in the way of}} critical discourse analysis. Therefore, there is used description of the historical period with analysis of texts in three newspapers, called Rude Právo, Mladá Fronta and Lidová Demokracie. The objective of the work is collection of texts of the newspapers in mentioned period and demonstration of typical <b>discrediting</b> text. First of all, there is pointed what it means "dissent". There are described groups and people, who were connected with these activities. Secondly, there is shown special cause about lawsuit with Václav Havel and Tomáš Řezáč. The perspective {{is focused on}} exceptional and special action which was linked with <b>discrediting</b> texts and official law. After that are summarized aspects and significance of <b>discrediting</b> texts. There is hope that this thesis dispels the complex problem of <b>discrediting</b> texts, and that the case for ideology developed through media is clear...|$|R

5|$|FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} cases {{linked to}} the paranormal, called X-Files.

Undeterred, Mulder continues and comes closer to the truth about extraterrestrial life than ever before, only to have his progress taken away from him again.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could <b>discredit</b> him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E

In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E

The villagers, {{conditioned}} by long-term prejudice against Dalits, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers, shaming them into accepting Kachra.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI {{special agent}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is summoned {{to a meeting}} with Division Chief Scott Blevins (Charles Cioffi) and a {{seemingly}} anonymous government official, The Smoking Man (William B.

Blevins has assigned Scully for the implicit purpose of using her scientific knowledge to <b>discredit</b> Mulder's work, although Blevins never directly tells Scully this and is evasive when she asks if such is his intent.|$|E
5|$|On the way back, {{they stayed}} again at Thebes from March to September, making many new drawing and {{paintings}} of the monuments there. Here, at the Valley of the Kings the expedition moved into the tomb of Ramesses IV (of the 20th dynasty), where the air was cooler.

It was here that Champollion first received news of Young's campaign to vindicate himself as the decipherer of the hieroglyphs and to <b>discredit</b> Champollion's decipherments.
