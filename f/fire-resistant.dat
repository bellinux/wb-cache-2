5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A <b>fire-resistant</b> stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|Skye {{tries to}} defend them both, {{but when the}} team finds {{evidence}} that Lydon was paid substantially for the information, she turns on him and cooperates with the agents. The team tracks the buyer, Raina, to a Project Centipede facility in Hong Kong, where they are draining Chan's <b>fire-resistant</b> platelets against his will, to use as stabilizers for the extremis serum within their super-soldiers. Chan, angry with this betrayal and with S.H.I.E.L.D. for constricting him, attacks both. He kills, among others, Quan and the Centipede head doctor Debbie. Realizing that Chan can't be reasoned with, Coulson and May inject him with a large dose of extremis, causing him to explode. Lydon, convinced that what he did is harming people, helps by using his hacking skills to direct the blast through the ventilation and out {{the top of the}} building, while the others escape to safety.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of <b>fire-resistant</b> materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E
5|$|To {{remedy the}} causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II {{spacecraft}} and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials. The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug-type hatch cover with a quick-release, outward opening door. NASA discontinued the manned Block I program, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, <b>fire-resistant</b> A7L Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.|$|E
5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the <b>fire-resistant</b> saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{advice for}} people to stay put until rescued relied {{on the assumption that}} construction standards such as concrete and <b>fire-resistant</b> doors would allow fire services to contain a fire within one or a few affected flats. However, at Grenfell the fire was spread rapidly via the building's exterior cladding.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{products}} used was Arconic's Reynobond, which is available with different types of core material—polyethylene, as reportedly used in Grenfell Tower (Reynobond PE), or a more <b>fire-resistant</b> material (Reynobond FR). The Reynobond cladding reportedly cost £24 per square metre for the fire-retardant version, and £22 for the combustible version.|$|E
25|$|The Police wears black uniforms {{marked with}} {{traditional}} {{black and white}} checked markings and the Police star. The working uniform varies from a traditional service uniform (shirt and trousers) to tactical overalls. The old traditional Icelandic service uniform is now used as a dress uniform. The trousers patrol officers use are made from a <b>fire-resistant</b> material.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fire-resistant</b> plants suffer little damage {{during a}} {{characteristic}} fire regime. These include large trees whose flammable parts are high above surface fires. Mature ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) {{is an example}} of a tree species that suffers virtually no crown damage under a naturally mild fire regime, because it sheds its lower, vulnerable branches as it matures.|$|E
25|$|Because {{plutonium}} is chemically reactive it {{is common}} to plate the completed pit with a thin layer of inert metal, which also reduces the toxic hazard. The gadget used galvanic silver plating; afterwards, nickel deposited from nickel tetracarbonyl vapors was used, gold was preferred for many years. Recent designs improve safety by plating pits with vanadium to make the pits more <b>fire-resistant.</b>|$|E
25|$|Less often seen, but {{formally}} in {{frequent use}} during rioting incidents is the <b>fire-resistant</b> {{version of the}} combat dress, which feature zipper breast pockets and on the trousers. Gurkha officers may also wear the jungle dress, with camouflage-coloured uniforms based on the British Army DPM and jockey cap or khaki-coloured beret, and complemented by various forms of webbing for paramilitary and military training, duties in rural and forested areas, combat fitness training and when dispatched out of Singapore for overseas exercises.|$|E
25|$|Olea europaea is very hardy: drought-, disease- and <b>fire-resistant,</b> it {{can live}} {{to a great}} age. Its root system is robust and capable of {{regenerating}} the tree even if the above-ground structure is destroyed. The older the olive tree, the broader and more gnarled the trunk becomes. Many olive trees in the groves around the Mediterranean {{are said to be}} hundreds of years old, while an age of 2,000 years is claimed for a number of individual trees; in some cases, this has been scientifically verified. See paragraph dealing with the topic.|$|E
25|$|After {{the great}} fire of 1601 (Keichō 6), the shogunate {{mandated}} that thatched roofs be modified into shingle roofs. Later, tiled roofs became fashionable among buildings inside luxurious daimyo residences and were also adopted in some chōnin residences. However, after the Great Fire of Meireki, a policy change banned {{the use of}} tiled roofs because the <b>fire-resistant</b> tiles fell from roofs and caused many injuries. Instead, flammable thatched roofs were required to be covered with earth to prevent fire from spreading. In 1661 (Kanbun 1), the use of thatched roofs in new buildings was also banned, making shingle roofs the only permitted choice.|$|E
25|$|Savannas {{are subject}} to regular {{wildfires}} and the ecosystem {{appears to be the}} result of human use of fire. For example, Native Americans created the Pre-Columbian savannas of North America by periodically burning where <b>fire-resistant</b> plants were the dominant species. Pine barrens in scattered locations from New Jersey to coastal New England are remnants of these savannas. Aboriginal burning appears to have been responsible for the widespread occurrence of savanna in tropical Australia and New Guinea, and savannas in India are a result of human fire use. The maquis shrub savannas of the Mediterranean region were likewise created and maintained by anthropogenic fire.|$|E
25|$|About {{this time}} the US Government {{tightened}} the fire regulations for ships entering ports in the USA. Andes was almost 30 years old and {{nearing the end of}} her career, but RML decided to have her upgraded to the new standards. In May 1967 she returned to Belfast, where Harland and Wolff undertook the first phase of her final refit. She resumed cruising for the summer and autumn, but her 1967–68 Christmas cruise was cancelled to allow her builders to complete the work. The refit added new <b>fire-resistant</b> bulkheads, doors and ceilings. At the same time the opportunity was taken to replace her boiler tubes.|$|E
500|$|In the 16 {{electrical}} transformers at the Center, silicone fluid {{is used as}} a coolant [...] "with less risk of ignition" [...] than hydrocarbon coolant. The native flammable chaparral was removed and <b>fire-resistant</b> poverty weed was added to the slopes around the Center. Each year, a herd of goats is rented to clear brush on the surrounding hills.|$|E
500|$|In 1892, {{management}} {{decided to}} expand the factory's capacity by adding a second tank. The new tank would add approximately 50 pots of capacity. [...] In early April, construction of the facilities for the new tank began. [...] "Modern and improved methods in all departments of the works" [...] were used, improving the efficiency in manufacturing and shipping. [...] The new buildings were made <b>fire-resistant</b> by using stone, brick, and iron for construction materials. They were also well ventilated, which made the work environment more comfortable for the glass workers. [...] The expansion increased total capacity to about 90 pots. [...] This made the works the second-largest glass factory in the United States. Expenditures necessary to finance the expansion were $100,000 (over $2.5 million in 2012 dollars).|$|E
500|$|The red-backed fairywren is {{endemic to}} Australia {{and can be}} seen along rivers and the coast from Cape Keraudren in {{northern}} Western Australia through the Kimberleys, Arnhem Land and the Gulf Country and into Cape York, with the Selwyn Range and {{upper reaches of the}} Flinders River as a southern limit. It is also found on the nearby offshore islands Groote Eylandt, Sir Edmund Pellew, Fraser, Melville and Bathurst Islands. It then occurs {{all the way down the}} east coast east of the Great Dividing Range to the Hunter River in New South Wales, [...] preferring wet, grassy tropical or sub-tropical areas, with tall grasses such as bladygrass (Imperata cylindrica), species of Sorghum, and Eulalia. It is not a true migrant, although it may be locally nomadic due to the changes in vegetation, and may leave its territory after the breeding season. The species will retreat to <b>fire-resistant</b> cover at times of fire.|$|E
500|$|Around 6million {{people moved}} to South Florida between 1940 and 1965. With a {{thousand}} people moving to Miami each week, urban development quadrupled. As the human population grew rapidly, the problem of exotic {{plant and animal species}} also grew. Many species of plants were brought into South Florida from Asia, Central America, or Australia as decorative landscaping. Exotic animals imported by the pet trade have escaped or been released. Biological controls that keep invasive species smaller in size and fewer in number in their native lands often do not exist in the Everglades, and they compete with the embattled native species for food and space. Of imported plant species, melaleuca trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia) have caused the most problems. Melaleucas grow on average [...] in the Everglades, as opposed to [...] in their native Australia. They were brought to southern Florida as windbreaks and deliberately seeded in marsh areas because they absorb vast amounts of water. In a region that is regularly shaped by fire, melaleucas are <b>fire-resistant</b> and their seeds are more efficiently spread by fire. They are too dense for wading birds with large wingspans to nest in, and they choke out native vegetation. Costs of controlling melaleucas topped $2million in 1998 for Everglades National Park. In Big Cypress National Preserve, melaleucas covered [...] at their most pervasive in the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|By region, {{studies have}} {{revealed}} specific details {{that have helped}} outline the {{series of events that}} led to the extinction of the local megafauna. [...] In the Central Highlands, dense forests existed until 1600 CE, with lingering patches persisting until the 19th and 20th centuries. [...] Today, small fragments stand isolated among vast expanses of human-created savanna, despite an average annual rainfall that is sufficient to sustain the evergreen forests once found there. [...] Deliberately set fires were the cause of the deforestation, and forest regrowth is restricted by soil erosion and the presence of <b>fire-resistant,</b> exotic grasses. [...] In the southeast, an extended drought dating to 950 cal yr BP led to fires and transition of open grasslands. [...] The drought may also have pushed humans populations to rely more heavily on bushmeat. [...] Had humans not been present, the subfossil lemur populations might have adjusted to the new conditions and recovered. [...] Had the drought not reduced the population of the subfossil lemurs, the pressure from the small number of people living in the region at the time might not have been enough to cause the extinctions. [...] As in the past, all of the factors that {{have played a role in}} past extinctions are still present and active today. [...] As a result, the extinction event that claimed Madagascar's giant subfossil lemurs has not fully concluded.|$|E
500|$|Pine rocklands (also called pinelands) {{are found}} on uneven {{limestone}} substrates that contain pinnacles and solution holes. There are three primary locations of pine rocklands: the Miami Ridge, which runs from Miami into Long Pine Key near {{the main entrance}} of Everglades National Park; the lower Florida Keys; and the Big Cypress Swamp. The most significant feature of the pine rockland ecosystem is the South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliotti var densa; also called Dade County pine) that reaches a height of [...] Pine rockland communities require fire for maintenance; they have adapted to promote and resist fire at the same time.

2500|$|The Il-86 {{prototype}} {{was displayed}} at the Paris Salon International de l'Aéronautique in 1977. It was noted that its interior used patented <b>fire-resistant</b> materials and hydraulics employed a <b>fire-resistant</b> fluid. At that time a version without the [...] "luggage at hand" [...] system was offered, seating 375 or alternatively weighing 3,000kg (6,600lb) less and having longer range. This version offered 7% lower seat-mile operational costs. The type was again displayed at Paris in 1979, 1981, 1983 and 1985, the Farnborough Air Show in 1984 and other world air events.|$|E
2500|$|The last {{bridge on}} the site was built in 1896, just 29 days after the {{destruction}} of the previous wooden bridge. A steel truss bridge made of [...] long prefabricated sections, it carried a single railroad track for the PRR, as well as a two-lane roadway. It was designed to be <b>fire-resistant</b> and flood/ice-resistant, elements that had destroyed previous wooden structures. Like the previous bridges, tolls were collected for passage to recover a portion of the half million dollar investment.|$|E
2500|$|Fire safety {{experts have}} said that the building's new {{external}} cladding was a possible cause of the rapid spread of the fire. Experts said the gap between the cladding and the insulation worked like a chimney to spread the fire. The cladding could be seen burning and melting, causing additional speculation that it was not made of <b>fire-resistant</b> material. One resident said: [...] "The whole one side of the building was on fire. The cladding went up like a matchstick." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{non-flammable}} fire curtains; other {{openings in}} the proscenium wall required self-closing <b>fire-resistant</b> doors. Heat activated sprinkling systems were required for the fly space above the stage. At this time in New York City, uniformed fire department officers became permanent attendees of every theatrical production. These 'Theatre Detail Officers' were required {{to be in the}} theatre a half-hour before the performance, test the fire alarms, inspect fire wall doors and the fire curtain, and, during performances, ensure that aisles, passageways and fire exits remain clear and accessible.|$|E
2500|$|After the fire, {{volunteer}} {{people and}} groups worked {{to help those}} made homeless and without possessions. The volunteers criticised council officials for doing little to coordinate these efforts. There were calls to jail {{those responsible for the}} fire. Deborah Orr wrote, [...] "We know that fire-safe cladding was available. The idea of being energy efficient and safe was not impossible, or even undesirable in theory. But <b>fire-resistant</b> cladding would have raised the cost for the whole building by an estimated £5,000. That sum may be what people died for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dense {{distribution}} of buildings built from flammable materials {{was an important}} factor that allowed fires to evolve from small to great. Once one building caught fire, the neighboring ones would soon ignite before any firefighters could respond. For this reason, {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Fire of Meireki, structures made with non-flammable materials were promoted in Edo to enhance the city's defense against fires. Fire barrier zones called [...] and [...] were set up in various places in Edo. Adoption of <b>fire-resistant</b> materials including tiled roofs and earthen houses became mandatory.|$|E
2500|$|Officials {{from the}} San Diego Wild Animal Park said that {{its more than}} 3,500 animals were safe staying in their {{enclosures}} where they were protected by the park's fire break and irrigated areas. If the weather conditions worsened, the animals could retreat to their watering holes. However, many critically endangered animals such as the California condor were moved to the park's veterinary hospital, which is <b>fire-resistant</b> and fully equipped with sprinklers. Park spokesperson Yadira Galindo said that the animals were [...] "alert but not showing any concerned behavior." ...|$|E
2500|$|Container sizes {{range from}} [...] "nanos", {{particularly}} magnetic nanos, {{which can be}} smaller than the tip of finger and have only enough room to store the log sheet, to 20-liter (5 gallon) buckets or even larger containers, such as entire trucks. The most common cache containers in rural areas are lunch-box-sized plastic storage containers or surplus military ammunition cans. Ammo cans are considered the gold standard of containers because they are very sturdy, waterproof, animal- and <b>fire-resistant,</b> relatively cheap, and have {{plenty of room for}} trade items. Smaller containers are more common in urban areas because they can be more easily hidden.|$|E
2500|$|For equipment, UNGERIN {{basically}} uses commercial scuba diver equipment. All operatives also {{equipped with}} lightweight PRO-TEC helmets, <b>fire-resistant</b> Nomex coveralls, or BDUs (battle dress uniform), Plate Carrier for carrying ammunition and specialist equipment, tactical gloves, balaclava or protective face covering, protective eye goggles, Gas mask, flashlight (usually a Surefire or Heckler & Koch brand), combat steel reinforced boots, flexi-cuffs, and thigh ammo. Ballistic vests including rigid plate inserts, are standard issue. These vests are labelled with [...] "POLICE", RMP insignia, or not labelled, {{to allow for}} easy identification. They often use drop leg holsters, while some officers prefer hip holsters.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{different}} species of trees Lukens studied, the knobcone pine was the best choice he believed, for its <b>fire-resistant</b> properties. The cones, which are embedded in the tree, only open and release seeds after a wildfire. He learned how to open the cones by boiling them and the method of watering and care that produced seedlings. The cone is sealed by a glaze-like resin and only opens after melting from heat of at least 200°F (93°C). The knobcone is well suited for reforestation as it grows on rocky hillsides in serpentine or granitic soil. Botanist Willis Linn Jepson observed that the knobcone grows on sites that are the [...] "most hopelessly inhospitable in the California mountains".|$|E
2500|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is characteristic}} of tropical lowland evergreen and semi-evergreen rain forests, with the dominant family of Dipterocarpaceae, genera of Hopea, Shorea and Vatica, and the individual species of [...] Anisoptera thurifera, Hopea gregaria, Hopea iriana, Hopea novoguineensis, Shorea assamica, Shorea montigena, Shorea selanica and Vatica rassak. Some of these trees may grow to more than [...] and are usually bound by thick lianas and other epiphytes. Open forest, woodland, and savanna areas also exist on Buru. The <b>fire-resistant</b> paper bark tree (Melaleuca cajuputi) is common in dry areas. The northwestern {{part of the island}} has steep limestone cliffs covered by mixed forests that include Shorea trees, and stunted Dacrydium novo-guineense is present at the mountain tops.|$|E
2500|$|Habitat {{restoration}} is not {{a simple}} matter, not only must one fight against hundreds of years of ecological degradation, manifested in the form of altered drainage patterns, hard to eradicate pastures, compacted soils, exhausted seed banks, diminished adult and propagule stocks, proliferation of <b>fire-resistant</b> and unpalatable weeds from the old world tropics and sub-tropics, et cetera, but also one is faced with the difficulties of changing a culture which coevolved with, profited from and can become miserable with such a system.

2500|$|Ionization smoke {{detectors}} were first {{sold in the}} United States in 1951; they were used only in major commercial and industrial facilities {{in the next several}} years due to their large size and cost. In 1955 simple home [...] "fire detectors" [...] for homes were developed, detecting high temperatures. The United States Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC) granted the first license to distribute {{smoke detectors}} using radioactive material in 1963. The first low-cost smoke detector for domestic use was developed by Duane D. Pearsall in 1965, an individual replaceable battery-powered unit that could be easily installed. The [...] "SmokeGard 700" [...] was a beehive-shaped, strong <b>fire-resistant</b> steel unit. The company began mass-producing these units in 1975. Studies in the 1960s determined that smoke detectors respond to fires much faster than heat detectors.|$|E
2500|$|In {{chaparral}} {{communities in}} Southern California, for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire [...] This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) {{and the young}} plants can then capitalize {{on the lack of}} competition in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire-activated buds. The cones of the Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds. Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy that will let in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves. Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire-intolerant, fire-tolerant or <b>fire-resistant.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{designers}} of Arleigh Burke incorporated {{lessons learned from}} the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers, the latter which was deemed too expensive to continue building and too difficult to further upgrade. With the Arleigh Burke class, the U.S. Navy also returned to all-steel construction. An earlier generation had combined a steel hull with an innovative superstructure made of lighter aluminum to reduce top weight, but the lighter metal proved vulnerable to cracking. Aluminum is also less <b>fire-resistant</b> than steel; a 1975 fire aboard [...] gutted her aluminum superstructure. Battle damage to Royal Navy ships exacerbated by their aluminum superstructures during the 1982 Falklands War supported the decision to use steel. Another lesson from the Falklands War led the navy to protect the ship's vital spaces with double-spaced steel armor (creating a buffer for modern rockets) and kevlar spall liners.|$|E
