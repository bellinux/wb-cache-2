40|$|In this paper, by {{assuming}} as correct <b>equilibrium</b> <b>temperatures</b> of RRab Lyrae variables those defined from Carney, Storm & Jones (1992, CSJ), {{we show that}} temperatures derived from (B-V) colour (mean colour over the pulsational cycle calculated on the magnitude scale) by Bessel, Castelli & Plez 1998 (BCP) transformations, are consistent with CSJ <b>equilibrium</b> <b>temperatures</b> within a probable error of δ T_e = ± 0. 003. As a consequence it is shown that the pulsational temperature scale, temperature-period-blue amplitude (T_eff=f(P,A_B)), provided by De Santis (1996, DS 96) by (B-V) colour of about 70 stars of Lub's sample, is a suitable relation, reddening and metallicity free, to calculate <b>equilibrium</b> <b>temperatures</b> for RRab variables. This relation is independent from variable mass and luminosity within a large range of period-shift from the mean period-amplitude relation valid for the Lub's sample of variables. On the contrary, it is also shown that a temperature-amplitude-metallicity relation is strictly dependent from the period-amplitude relation of the sample used for calibrating it: we prove this means that it is dependent from both mass and luminosity variations of variables.

Kepler-4b's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however an independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12, and a later reanalysis of the light curve discovered a secondary eclipse with depth 7.47 ± 1.82ppm at a phase of about 0.7.|$|E

25|$|Earth {{receives}} {{energy from}} the Sun {{in the form of}} ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared radiation. Of the total amount of solar energy available {{at the top of the}} atmosphere, about 26% is reflected to space by the atmosphere and clouds and 19% is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. Most of the remaining energy is absorbed at the surface of Earth. Because the Earth's surface is colder than the photosphere of the Sun, it radiates at wavelengths that are much longer than the wavelengths that were absorbed. Most of this thermal radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, thereby warming it. In addition to the absorption of solar and thermal radiation, the atmosphere gains heat by sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface. The atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the part radiated downwards is absorbed by the surface of Earth.

25|$|Energy from {{a nuclear}} {{explosive}} is initially released in several forms of penetrating radiation. When {{there is a}} surrounding material such as air, rock, or water, this radiation interacts with and rapidly heats it to an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>temperature</b> (i.e. so that the matter {{is at the same}} temperature as the atomic bomb's matter). This causes vaporization of surrounding material resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shockwave. When a nuclear detonation occurs in air near sea level, much of the released energy interacts with the atmosphere and creates a shockwave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball and if the burst is low enough, it is often associated with a mushroom cloud. In a burst at high altitude, where the air density is low, more energy is released as ionizing gamma radiation and x-rays than an atmosphere-displacing shockwave.|$|E
25|$|Mercury's {{equatorial}} plane is inclined less than 2° to its orbital plane (Klaasen, 1976; Murray and others, 1981, p. 28); its rotation period of 58.64 terrestrial days is in two- thirds resonance with its orbital period of 87.97 terrestrial days (Colombo, 1965; Colombo and Shapiro, 1966). The resulting lag and orbital eccentricity create {{a variation of}} mean temperature not only with latitude, as on the Earth, but also with longitude. However, because of Mercury's relatively slow rotational period, diurnal variations in temperature probably greatly exceed mean-temperature variations along latitude and longitude, even in the high latitudes. Its pronounced orbital eccentricity (0.2563) causes the apparent solar intensity at Mercury to vary {{by more than a}} factor of 2 throughout a Mercurian year, corresponding to about a 20 percent change in <b>equilibrium</b> <b>temperature.</b> Further, conservation of orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit coupling cause considerable variation in the length of daylight. Dawns and sunsets are prolonged by the long transit time of the Mercurian horizon across the solar disk, so that daylight is lengthened and nighttime reduced by several terrestrial days at sunset and vice versa at sunrise (Robert Wildey, U.S. Geological Survey, oral commun., 1982).
