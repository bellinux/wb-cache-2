40|$|Objective: To {{assess and}} explain {{deviations}} from recommended practice in National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines {{in relation to}} fetal <b>heart</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Design: Qualitative study. Setting: Large teaching hospital in the UK. Sample: Sixty-six hours of observation of 25 labours and interviews with 20 midwives of varying grades. Methods: Structured observations of labour and semistructured interviews with midwives. Interviews were undertaken using a prompt guide, audiotaped, and transcribed verbatim. Analysis {{was based on the}} constant comparative method, assisted by QSR N 5 software. Main outcome measures: Deviations from recommended practice in relation to fetal monitoring and insights into why these occur. Results: All babies involved in the study were safely delivered, but 243 deviations from recommended practice in relation to NICE guidelines on fetal monitoring were identified, with the majority (80 %) of these occurring in relation to documentation. Other deviations from recommended practice included indications for use of electronic fetal <b>heart</b> <b>monitoring</b> and conduct of fetal <b>heart</b> <b>monitoring.</b> There is evidence of difficulties with availability and maintenance of equipment, and some deficits in staff knowledge and skill. Differing orientations towards fetal monitoring were reported by midwives, which were likely to have impacts on practice. The initiation, management, and interpretation of fetal <b>heart</b> <b>monitoring</b> is complex and distributed across time, space, and professional boundaries, and practices in relation to fetal <b>heart</b> <b>monitoring</b> need to be understood within an organisational and social context. Conclusion: Some deviations from best practice guidelines may be rectified through straightforward interventions including improved systems for managing equipment and training. Other deviations from recommended practice need to be understood as the outcomes of complex processes that are likely to defy easy resolution. © RCOG 2006...|$|R

40|$|Triathlon, a {{sport that}} {{consists}} of swimming, biking and running, is growing in popularity {{throughout the country and}} the world. There is a large percentage of athletes that rely on the use of a <b>heart</b> rate <b>monitor</b> to gauge effort, {{but there is also a}} group of athletes that do not use this technology. The purpose of this research was to determine if personality, specifically neuroticism, played a role in determining which athletes use <b>heart</b> rate <b>monitors</b> and whether these variables had any effect on performance. Ninety-eight triathletes were surveyed from 2 half iron distance triathlons in the summer of 2010.

2500|$|... 1988 {{also saw}} the debut of Telenet Japan's Exile, a series of action-platform RPGs, {{beginning}} with XZR: Idols of Apostate. The series was controversial for its plot, which revolves around a time-traveling Crusades-era Syrian Islamic Assassin who assassinates various religious/historical figures as well as modern-day political leaders, with similarities to the present-day Assassin's Creed action game series. The gameplay of Exile included both overhead exploration and side-scrolling combat, featured a <b>heart</b> <b>monitor</b> to represent the player's Attack Power and Armour Class statistics, and another controversial aspect of the game involved taking drugs (instead of potions) that increase/decrease attributes but with side-effects such as affecting the heart-rate or causing death. An early attempt at incorporating a point-and-click interface in a real-time overhead action RPG was Silver Ghost, a 1988 NEC PC-8801 game by Kure Software Koubou. It was an action-strategy RPG where characters could be controlled using a cursor. It was cited by Camelot Software Planning's Hiroyuki Takahashi as inspiration for the Shining series of tactical RPGs. According to Takahashi, Silver Ghost was [...] "a simulation action type of game where you had to direct, oversee and command multiple characters." [...] Unlike later tactical RPGs, however, Silver Ghost was not turn-based, but instead used real-time strategy and action role-playing game elements. A similar game released by Kure Software Koubou that same year was First Queen, a unique hybrid between a real-time strategy, action RPG, and strategy RPG. Like an RPG, the player can explore the world, purchase items, and level up, and like a strategy video game, it focuses on recruiting soldiers and fighting against large armies rather than small parties. The game's [...] "Gochyakyara" [...] ("Multiple Characters") system let the player control one character at a time while the others are controlled by computer AI that follow the leader, and where battles are large-scale with characters sometimes filling an entire screen.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Final Fantasy Adventure, {{the first}} in the Mana series, {{featured}} the ability to kill townspeople. The most important RPG that year, however, was Final Fantasy IV, one of the first role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot, placing a much greater emphasis on character development, personal relationships, and dramatic storytelling. It also introduced a new battle system: the [...] "Active Time Battle" [...] system, developed by Hiroyuki Ito, where the time-keeping system does not stop. On the battle screen, each character has an ATB meter that gradually fills, and the player is allowed to issue a command to that character once the meter is full. The fact that enemies can attack or be attacked at any time is credited with injecting urgency and excitement into the combat system. The ATB combat system was considered revolutionary for being a hybrid between turn-based and real-time combat, with its requirement of faster reactions from players appealing to those who were more used to action games. That same year, 's Metal Max was an early non-linear, open-ended, post-apocalyptic, vehicle combat RPG that lacked a predetermined story path and instead allowed the player to choose which missions to follow in whatever order while being able to visit any place in the game world. The ending also can be determined by the player's actions, while they can continue playing the game even after the ending. The game also allowed the player to choose the character classes for each player character as well as create and modify the tanks used in battle. The Metal Max series continued to allow tank customization and open-ended gameplay, while also allowing the player to obtain an ending at almost any time, particularly Metal Saga, which could be completed with an ending scenario just minutes into the game, making it the shortest possible RPG. Telenet Japan released a console remake of its 1988 action-platform RPG Exile, which was controversial, with a plot revolving around a time-traveling Crusades-era Syrian Islamic Assassin who assassinates various religious/historical figures as well as modern-day political leaders, with similarities to the present-day Assassin's Creed action game series, while the gameplay of Exile involved taking drugs that increase or decrease statistics and affect the player's heart-rate, displayed using a <b>heart</b> <b>monitor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Electrocardiogram (ECG) {{signals are}} widely used to examine heart rhythms and general health conditions. However, the {{majority}} of commercial ECG kits are generic and their normal ranges are set based on the averages obtained from a large population of people with normal heart conditions. This averaging ignores the extreme inherent variability of normal heart signals. As such, many false alarms are generated if the thresholds are selected too strict and true alarms are missed if the thresholds are set too loose. Furthermore, false alarms may arise due to the high physical activity of the test person. In this paper, we developed a prototype for patient-specific <b>heart</b> <b>monitoring</b> kit, which learns the properties of a patient's normal ECG signal over time and reports significant deviations from this normal behavior, in addition to presenting significant violations from the global norms. Further, false alarms due to high physical activity levels are eliminated through processing the utilized accelerometer signal. This personalized remote <b>heart</b> <b>monitoring</b> kit with the proposed signal processing and self-tuning capabilities and wireless connectivity provides more detailed information and insightful interpretations of ECG signals compared to generic devices, therefore {{can be used for}} remote <b>heart</b> <b>monitoring</b> of high-risk people...|$|R
