2500|$|... "Stairway to Heaven" [...] isn't the {{greatest}} rock {{song of the}} 1970s; it is {{the greatest}} spell of the 1970s. Think about it: we are all sick of the thing, but in some primordial way it is still number one. Everyone knows it... Even our dislike and mockery is ritualistic. The dumb parodies; the Wayne's World-inspired folklore about guitar shops demanding customers not play it; even Robert Plant's public disavowal of the song—all of these just prove the rule. [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] is not just number one. It is the One, the quintessence, the closest AOR will ever <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> absolute.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jonas, [...] "I'll hook the oxen on, and we'll soon <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land. Isaiah, {{you take}} your horse out of the sleigh." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now {{a plague}} on thy gruff tongue," [...] said Erling angrily, as {{he raised the}} woman's head on his knee. [...] "Did you not see that the weight was already more than she could bear? <b>Get</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spring for water, man, as quickly as may be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how {{on earth}} am I to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> street?" [...] Barton inquired, very naturally. [...] "Even if you could bear being carried, I could not lift you over the boarding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't talk in {{a crowded}} station," [...] said Derek irritably. [...] "Let me <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> taxi and {{take you to the}} hotel.... What {{do you want to know}} about Jill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Larson, we'll <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main shore {{as soon as}} we can; that is, {{providing}} the lady who has hired this sloop is willing to go on without stopping here. I reckon this young man is your friend?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No {{subject of}} mirth, certainly," [...] said Charles, {{composing}} his features; [...] "but great matter of wonder.--Come, cease this mouthing, and prancing, and mummery.--If {{there be a}} jest, come out with it, man; and if not, even <b>get</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beaffet, and drink a cup of wine <b>to</b> refresh <b>thee</b> after thy close lodging." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay," [...] he answered; [...] "you {{have eaten}} of my salt, and {{to kill you}} would be murder. <b>Get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tent of the princess of Baalbec yonder, for there you will see nothing {{of the death of}} these Franks, your fellow-worshippers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen,' he said; 'I'll talk slow, so {{that you}} can understand. Suppose you fell off a pier, and a girl took a great deal of trouble to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore, would you say, [...] "Much obliged, but you needn't have been so officious. I can swim {{perfectly}} well?"' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Steuben {{shook her}} head rather dreamily. [...] "Well, it's no trouble for we of the Sooth to be quiet. There's a kind of languor in our blood. Besides, {{we have to be}} to-day. But I've got to show some energy to-night. I've got to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of Pennsylvania Avenue." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{best way}} <b>to</b> visit <b>the</b> well from Islamabad {{is to reach}} Shah Allah Ditta town (adjacent and west of Islamabad's D-12 Sector). From there <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> metalled road towards the Margalla Hills. The caves of Shah Allah Ditta are {{at the base of}} the {{mountain}} and continuing on the road up <b>the</b> hill <b>gets</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Losar Baoli. Look for the road construction sign (see picture) as the landmark where the baoli is located.|$|R
5000|$|Rhys {{said of his}} character, [...] "He's a sort of gift of a part in that he's very sort of layered and multi-faceted. And {{when you}} meet him, he's at this great turning {{point in his life}} where everything's {{changing}} for him. <b>You</b> just <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do everything. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do <b>the</b> kung fu, and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do <b>the</b> emotional scenes, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do <b>the</b> disguises. It's the full package for an actor. It's a dream." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Gordon, [...] "it's quite a nice clean slice, and I guess it's {{not going}} to trouble you much, though you won't walk very far {{for a week or}} two. As soon as we can <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dam, I'll put a proper {{dressing}} on." [...] Then he looked up sharply. [...] "In the meanwhile, I don't quite see how you cut yourself like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I won't. There's the dog-cart at {{the door}} for you. My groom will <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station in no time. Benjamin, drive like mad! Jump in. If Mr. Merriman misses the train you lose your place. Hold fast, Merriman, {{and if you are}} upset trust to the devil to save his own." [...] With that parting benediction the baronet turned about and walked back to the library.|$|E
6000|$|His soldierly, though tyrannical, {{head was}} clear in an instant. He didn't waste one word, even of surprise. [...] "Order the guard," [...] says he, [...] "to draw off quietly into the Fort." [...] (They called the {{enclosure}} I have before mentioned, the Fort, {{though it was}} not much of that.) [...] "Then <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fort as quick as you can, rouse up every soul there, and fasten the gate. I will bring in all those who are at the Signal Hill. If we are surrounded before we can join you, you must make a sally and cut us out if you can. The word among our men is, 'Women and children!'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Rhys {{spoke about}} what {{attracted}} him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> role of Philip: [...] "He's {{a sort of}} gift of a part in that he's very sort of layered and multi-faceted. And when you meet him, he's at this great turning {{point in his life}} where everything's changing for him. <b>You</b> just <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do everything. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do <b>the</b> kung fu, and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do <b>the</b> emotional scenes, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do <b>the</b> disguises. It's the full package for an actor. It's a dream." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a similar}} vein, Noel Hinners related the following: Rocco {{could be a}} tyrant in the formal meetings. On one {{occasion}} he demanded I tell him {{if it was a}} Phillips-head or a straight-head screw in box. I annoyingly responded, 'How the hell would I know?' Years later I deduced that this was Rocco’s technique for <b>getting</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where you’d best say, 'I don’t know,' rather than try to fake it and was part of his 'pay attention to detail' mentality.|$|R
6000|$|... "This Thursday accordingly, by 10 in the morning, in the Old South Meeting-house, Boston is assembled, and country-people to {{the number}} of 2,000;--and Rotch never was in such a company of human Friends before. They are not uncivil to him (cautious people, heedful of the verge of the Law); but they are peremptory, to the extent of--Rotch may shudder to think what. [...] "I went to the Custom-house yesterday,' said Rotch, 'your Committee of Ten can bear me witness; and demanded {{clearance}} and leave to depart; but they would not; were forbidden, they said!' 'Go, then, sir; <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Governor himself; a clearance, and out of harbor this day: had n't you better?' Rotch is well aware that he had; hastens off to the Governor (who has vanished to his Country-house, on purpose); Old South Meeting-house adjourning till 3 P.M., for Rotch's return with clearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hugh," [...] {{it began}} simply, [...] "Clement the Pope will not void my false {{marriage}} unless I appear before him, and this as yet I cannot do {{because of the}} French wars. Moreover, he sets {{the curse of the}} Church upon me and any man with whom I shall dare to re-marry until this be done. For myself I would defy the Church, but not for you or for children that might come to us. Moreover, the holy father, Sir Andrew, forbids it, saying that God will right all in His season and that we must not make Him wroth. Therefore, Hugh, lover you are, but husband you may not be while de Noyon lives or until the Pope gives his dispensation of divorce, which latter may be long in winning, for the knave de Noyon has been whispering in his ear. Hugh, this is my counsel: <b>Get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King again and crave his leave to follow de Noyon, for if once you twain can come face to face I know well how the fray will end. Then, when he is dead, return to one who waits for you through this world and the next.|$|E

50|$|Sugarloaf Knob {{is easily}} {{accessible}} by a park road which {{takes you to}} just below the summit. A short bushwhack from there will <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the mountain.|$|E
50|$|Granite Flat Spur also {{provides}} access to the summit. It can be accessed by 4WD either from Eskdale, or by continuing on from Camp Creek Gap around the 4WD track, which is only possible outside of winter. An hour beyond Camp Creek Gap by 4WD will <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the 4WD track, from which it takes about 1.5 hrs walk to the summit (i.e. it is no quicker than walking up the Eskdale, but you walk less, and drive further).|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] {{she said}} sharply, [...] "are Lyddy's things all ready {{there by the}} door, so's not to keep Ezra Perkins waitin'? You know he always grumbles so. And then he <b>gets</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cars so't <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> wait {{half an hour before}} they start." [...] She {{continued}} to pin and pull at details of Lydia's dress, to which she descended from her hat. [...] "It sets real nice on you, Lyddy. I guess you'll think of the time we had gettin' it made up, when you wear it out there." [...] Miss Maria Latham laughed nervously.|$|R
