5|$|<b>Dazzle</b> {{attracted}} {{the notice of}} artists such as Picasso, who claimed that Cubists like himself had invented it. Edward Wadsworth, who supervised the camouflaging of over 2,000 ships during the First World War, painted a series of canvases of <b>dazzle</b> ships after the war, based on his wartime work. Arthur Lismer similarly painted a series of <b>dazzle</b> ship canvases.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion <b>dazzle,</b> requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. Motion <b>dazzle</b> may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Motion <b>dazzle</b> distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, motion <b>dazzle</b> had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied. Since motion <b>dazzle</b> patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to see when stationary, {{there would be an}} evolutionary trade-off between motion <b>dazzle</b> and crypsis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dazzle</b> {{camouflage}}, {{also known}} as razzle <b>dazzle</b> (in the U.S.) or <b>dazzle</b> painting, was a family of ship camouflage used extensively in World War I, {{and to a lesser}} extent in World War II and afterwards. Credited to the British marine artist Norman Wilkinson, though with a rejected prior claim by the zoologist John Graham Kerr, it consisted of complex patterns of geometric shapes in contrasting colours, interrupting and intersecting each other.|$|E
40|$|International audienceLaser {{sources have}} evolved towards lower cost and higher power, {{and the risk}} of imaging system {{disturbance}} due to laser <b>dazzling</b> effects can no more be ignored. In this paper we first present an experimental bench which has been developed specifically to perform <b>dazzling</b> experiments on infrared focal plane arrays. With this breadboard, <b>dazzling</b> experiments have been conducted on various types of focal plane arrays. We will focus on results obtained on a standard microbolometer array. The main parameters affecting <b>dazzling</b> phenomena were varied and conclusions on the <b>dazzling</b> phenomena are proposed. Since the major impact of laser pulses on microbolometer focal plane is due to heating, a first and simple phenomenological model of laser <b>dazzling</b> of these uncooled detectors is presented. Moreover thanks to the high level of performance of this breadboard, a new method is described for the direct measurement of the thermal time constant of the microbolometer array...|$|R

5|$|<b>Dazzle</b> {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's <b>dazzle</b> pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of <b>dazzle</b> schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle's {{effectiveness}} {{was highly}} uncertain {{at the time}} of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. <b>Dazzle</b> ships were attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, <b>dazzle</b> was not attempting to make ships hard to see. Suggestively, of the ships that were struck by torpedoes, 43% of the <b>dazzle</b> ships sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the <b>dazzle</b> ships were struck amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. However, the ships painted in <b>dazzle</b> were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them being over 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable.|$|E
5|$|Disrupting the attacker's {{perception}} of the target's motion was the main intended purpose of <b>dazzle</b> camouflage as used on ships in the First World War, though its effectiveness is disputed. This type of <b>dazzle</b> {{does not appear to}} be used by animals.|$|E

5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into <b>dazzle</b> camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in <b>dazzle</b> patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, <b>dazzle</b> was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other forms}} of camouflage, the {{intention}} of <b>dazzle</b> is not to conceal but to {{make it difficult to}} estimate a target's range, speed, and heading. Norman Wilkinson explained in 1919 that he had intended <b>dazzle</b> primarily to mislead the enemy about a ship's course and so to take up a poor firing position.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson's <b>Dazzle</b> {{camouflage}} {{was accepted}} by the Admiralty, even without practical visual assessment protocols for improving performance by modifying designs and colours. The <b>dazzle</b> camouflage strategy was adopted by other navies. This led to more scientific studies of colour options which might enhance camouflage effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|Over 4000 British {{merchant}} {{ships and}} some 400 naval vessels were painted in <b>dazzle</b> camouflage during 1917–1918.|$|E
5|$|The United States Navy {{implemented}} a camouflage painting program in World War II, and applied it to many ship classes, from patrol craft and auxiliaries to battleships and some s. The designs (known as Measures, each {{identified with a}} number) were not arbitrary, but were standardised in a process which involved a planning stage, then a review, and then fleet-wide implementation. Not all United States Navy measures involved <b>dazzle</b> patterns; some were simple or even totally unsophisticated, such as a false bow wave on traditional Haze Gray, or Deck Blue replacing grey over part {{or all of the}} ship (the latter to counter the kamikaze threat). <b>Dazzle</b> measures were used until 1945; in February 1945 the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet decided to repaint its ships in non-dazzle measures against the kamikaze threat, while the Atlantic Fleet continued to use <b>dazzle,</b> ships being repainted if transferred to the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage can be {{achieved}} by different methods, described below. Most of the methods contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion <b>dazzle</b> protect without hiding. Methods may be applied on their own or in combination.|$|E

5|$|Deceptive {{measures}} {{other than}} <b>dazzle</b> included the fitting of anti-rangefinder baffles to the masts and yards of battleships such as HMS Emperor of India in 1917. Deceptive mimicry was also practised, with heavily armed Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|German Kriegsmarine ships {{before the}} Second World War were either light gray overall or had dark gray hulls, and many {{retained}} this scheme during the war. The cruiser Deutschland, for instance, had a gray hull and light gray superstructure in 1934. Others had <b>dazzle</b> camouflage, usually in combinations of pale gray, dark gray and sea blue. For example, {{the hull of}} the battleship Scharnhorst had a <b>dazzle</b> pattern of stripes on a gray background in 1940, but some of these were later painted out, and the bows forward of the main guns painted black. Scharnhorst was not camouflaged against air observation, her decks fore and aft bearing large black on white swastikas on a red field; her main gun turrets had red (in the Baltic) or yellow tops for air recognition. The battleship Bismarck set out to Norway in <b>dazzle</b> camouflage; this was painted out with gray for her final trip to the Atlantic. The cruiser Admiral Scheer wore a low contrast pattern of irregular dark gray marks on light gray for her superstructure, with a dark gray hull, black waterline and, away from air support while out raiding in 1941, dark gray turret tops.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} <b>dazzle</b> camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. <b>Dazzle,</b> Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E

5|$|Some prey {{animals such as}} zebra {{are marked}} with high-contrast {{patterns}} which possibly help to confuse their predators, such as lions, during a chase. The bold stripes of a herd of running Zebra have been claimed {{make it difficult for}} predators to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, or to identify individual animals, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Since <b>dazzle</b> patterns (such as the Zebra's stripes) make animals harder to catch when moving, but easier to detect when stationary, there is an evolutionary trade-off between <b>dazzle</b> and camouflage. Another theory is that the zebra's stripes could provide some protection from flies and biting insects.|$|E
5|$|However {{effective}} <b>dazzle</b> camouflage {{may have}} been in World War I, it became less useful as rangefinders and especially aircraft became more advanced, and, {{by the time it was}} put to use again in World War II, radar further reduced its effectiveness. However, it may still have confounded enemy submarines.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{ships of}} Mussolini's navy {{retained}} its pre-war scheme of light gray overall for its smaller ships, but the larger units mostly had <b>dazzle</b> camouflage of dark gray, light sea blue, light sea green and light gray.
