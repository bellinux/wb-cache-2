5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation <b>for</b> <b>healing,</b> most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth {{has led to a}} significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the success}} of Calyx, Lucienne Day was {{commissioned}} Tom Worthington, Heal Fabrics’ managing director, to design up to six new furnishing fabrics each year. Over {{the course of their}} 25-year partnership, Lucienne created more than seventy designs <b>for</b> <b>Heal’s.</b> Although she designed for other firms as well during this period, her textiles <b>for</b> <b>Heal’s</b> form the core of her creative opus and include a string of patterns which typify the forward-looking post-war era, such as Dandelion Clocks (1953), Spectators (1953), Graphica (1953), Ticker Tape (1953), Trio (1954), Herb Antony (1956) and Script (1956).|$|R

5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential <b>for</b> <b>healing</b> in the fragment.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was born}} on February 3, 1920, in Charleston, West Virginia, {{the son of an}} {{executive}} at a steel company, George E. Miller, and Florence (Armitage) Miller. Soon after, his parents divorced. He grew up with only his mother during the Great Depression, attended public school, and graduated from Charleston High School in 1937. He relocated with his mother and stepfather to Washington D.C., and was at George Washington University for a year. His family practiced Christian Science, which required turning to prayer, rather than medical science, <b>for</b> <b>healing.</b> After his stepfather was transferred to Birmingham, Alabama, Miller transferred to the University of Alabama.|$|E
5|$|The four {{churches of}} the IRSSA– the United, Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian churches– agreed to {{participate}} in the reconciliation process between Indigenous and settler Canadians. They have been involved in funding various projects and services that assist former residential school students and their families in healing from the trauma caused by the schools. The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund in the 1990s to respond to the ongoing need <b>for</b> <b>healing</b> related to residential schools. In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and Reconciliation Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing & Reconciliation Program.|$|E
25|$|Pentecostals {{believe that}} prayer is central in {{receiving}} healing. Pentecostals look to scriptures such as James 5:13–16 <b>for</b> direction regarding <b>healing</b> prayer. One can pray <b>for</b> one's own <b>healing</b> (verse 13) and <b>for</b> the <b>healing</b> of others (verse 16); no special gift or clerical status is necessary. Verses 14–16 supply the framework <b>for</b> congregational <b>healing</b> prayer. The sick person expresses {{his or her}} faith by calling for the elders of the church who pray over and anoint the sick with olive oil. The oil {{is a symbol of}} the Holy Spirit.|$|R

5|$|The rector of this Church of England parish as of 2011 is the Rev Neil Batcock. The {{benefice}} rotates {{its services}} among its five constituent churches, with typically five services in total on Sundays, and two mid-week Holy Communions. As with most Anglican churches in England, the congregation is mainly elderly, {{although there are}} monthly family services focussed on children. There is also a monthly laying on of hands <b>for</b> <b>healing,</b> and sometimes other variants from the standard format involving music or Taizé-influenced worship. The parish accepts the diocese's guidance on permitting baptism and marriage in church after a divorce, and claims {{to work closely with}} its Catholic and Methodist neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Magical healing spells, {{which were}} used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an {{important}} portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with Horus so {{that he or she}} can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions <b>for</b> <b>healing</b> rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.|$|E
5|$|Numerous fady protect {{wilderness}} areas, particularly {{including the}} Ankarana massif. Excessive cutting of mangrove trees for wood or {{the setting of}} bush fires are both prohibited, as {{is the use of}} nets with holes less than 15 millimeters to prevent catching immature fish. Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo for a girl to wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, surgery or modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used <b>for</b> <b>healing.</b> These taboos are most strongly applied in the center of Antankarana territory around the village of Ambatoharaña and less so in the villages at the periphery of the region.|$|E

5|$|Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which Project M modifies, is a {{fighting}} game with an unconventional battle system. Players battle in arenas of varying sizes {{and levels of}} complexity, controlling characters {{with a variety of}} play styles. They can attack one another with their own repertoires of special moves, or with a basic attack. Attacks can be avoided by jumping or using a short-lived shield move. Unlike most fighting games, Brawl does not include standard health gauges, but a percentage counter; there is no point at which a character is automatically knocked out from the counter getting too high, but they will be knocked farther with increasing damage. Being knocked off the screen—or falling off oneself—causes a knock-out. Players may use items for offensive purposes, such as guns and swords, or <b>for</b> <b>healing</b> purposes, such as food and heart containers. The stages, characters, and items are drawn from Nintendo's video game franchises such as Mario, Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid, along with Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series and Konami's Metal Gear series. The victor of a match has no standard determining factor. Rather, depending on the settings, victory may be reached, for example, by being the last player alive using a stock system, or by achieving the most KOs after a set amount of time.|$|E
