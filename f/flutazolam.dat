5000|$|<b>Flutazolam</b> (Coreminal, MS-4101) {{is a drug}} {{which is}} a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. It was invented in Japan, {{and this is the}} main country in which it has been used medically. It has sedative, muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic effects similar to those produced by other benzodiazepine derivatives, and though it's around the same potency as diazepam, it produces a more marked sedation and impaired coordination. It is indicated for the treatment of insomnia.|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} CPU {{time and the}} wall clock time of the Raffenetti's P file {{algorithm}} with the usual algorithm on the two electron integrals storing with four suffixes of the ab initio Hartree-Fock calculations. The calculations are performed with the flutoprazepam, triazolam, clotiazepam, etizolam, and <b>flutazolam</b> molecules. These molecules are all minor-tranquilizers with the benzodiazepine or thienodiazepine backbone. The 3 - 21 G basis sets ａｒｅ employed. Almost in all cases, P file algorithm gave slower speed than the usual algorithm. The number of two electron integrals increases almost two {{times larger than the}} usual algorithms. In a large molecule, the matrix of the two electron integrals becomes very sparse and the recombination of the integrals just increases the total number of the integrals. It is concluded that the P method sometimes calculates faster but sometimes does not. In a large scale calculation, it should be suggested to perform a test calculation to confirm which method is faster prior to the real calculations.
