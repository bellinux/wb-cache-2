40|$|We {{investigate}} quasar outflows at z ≥ 6 {{by performing}} zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. By employing the SPH code GADGET- 3, we zoom in the 2 R_ 200 region around a 2 × 10 ^ 12 M_ halo at z = 6, inside a (500 Mpc) ^ 3 comoving volume. We compare {{the results of}} our AGN runs with a control simulation in which only stellar/SN feedback is considered. Seeding 10 ^ 5 M_ BHs at the centers of 10 ^ 9 M_ halos, we find the following results. BHs accrete gas at the Eddington rate over z = 9 - 6. At z = 6, our most-massive BH has grown to M_ BH = 4 × 10 ^ 9 M_. Fast (v_r > 1000 km/s), powerful (Ṁ_ out∼ 2000 M_/yr) outflows of shock-heated low-density gas form at z ∼ 7, and propagate up to hundreds kpc. Star-formation is quenched over z = 8 - 6, and the total SFR (SFR surface density near the galaxy center) is reduced by a factor of 5 (1000). We analyse the relative contribution of multiple physical process: (i) disrupting cosmic filamentary cold gas <b>inflows,</b> (<b>ii)</b> reducing central gas density, (iii) ejecting gas outside the galaxy; and find that AGN feedback has the following effects at z = 6. The inflowing gas mass fraction is reduced by ∼ 12 %, the high-density gas fraction is lowered by ∼ 13 %, and ∼ 20 % of the gas outflows at a speed larger than the escape velocity (500 km/s). We conclude that quasar-host galaxies at z ≥ 6 are accreting non-negligible amount of cosmic gas, nevertheless AGN feedback quenches their star formation dominantly by powerful outflows ejecting gas out of the host galaxy halo.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes {{contracts and}} organizational form {{decisions in the}} empirical setting of venture capital investments. The first chapter asks how entrepreneurs and venture capital investors are affected by a specific design feature of investment contracts. Participating preferred rights, which are venture capital contract terms that give investors returns greater than their intrinsic ownership, are used extensively despite possible deleterious effects on founder incentives. Using a novel data set of venture capital investment contracts from 2004 - 2009, I ask three fundamental questions about these rights: when are they used, who uses them, and what are their consequences? The findings indicate that (i) lower inflows of venture capital funding increase the use of participating preferred rights; (ii) less experienced investors and certain industry sectors utilize participating preferred rights more often; and (iii) firms with participating preferred rights {{are less likely to}} raise a subsequent financing at a higher valuation and less likely to exit through an IPO or acquisition, suggesting that the incentive implications of these rights may affect firm performance. These results are robust to specifications that attempt to control for the endogeneity of the contract right. The findings provide important insights for entrepreneurs and investors who are weighing the consequences of certain contractual forms. The second chapter broadens the analysis to other contractual rights to asks how investors and entrepreneurs allocate ownership and venture capital investment rights in competitive markets. Using the same data set of venture capital financings from 2004 - 2009, I find that changes in market competition, or venture capital supply, affect contractual terms in significant ways. Competition not only affects firm valuations, but how actual firm ownership is divided between entrepreneurs and investors. Additionally, certain contractual rights shift in response to venture capital scarcity. Specifically, the results suggest that (i) entrepreneurs own more of the firm in periods of high venture capital <b>inflows,</b> (<b>ii)</b> entrepreneurs give up cash flow rights in periods of low venture capital inflows, and (iii) the incidence of control rights are not significantly affected by venture capital inflows. Similarly, the results are robust to specifications that attempt to control for the endogeneity of venture capital inflows. The third chapter (co-authored with Eric J. Allen) focuses on a potential inefficiency of organizational design, specifically when a startup chooses to organize as a C-corporation rather than as a limited liability company (LLC). We examine the previously documented anomaly of loss-generating startup firms organizing as C-Corporations, as opposed to the theoretically more tax efficient alternative - the LLC. While prior research examines the potential reasons for this divergence between theory and practice, this is the first study that actually attempts to quantify the foregone tax benefits incurred by the current system. We examine a sample of venture backed firms that reached the Initial Public Offering stage between 1996 and 2008. We find {{that the vast majority of}} these firms have accumulated tax losses at issuance, on average $ 33 million, and that the associated potential tax benefit is significant. We also examine a subsample of firms that were, at one time, organized as pass-through entities prior to going public. We find that, while the majority switched to the C-Corporate form upon the entrance of a venture capital investor, a small number were allowed to retain their pass-through status until issuance. Their existence provides further evidence that the alternative form's lack of adoption must be attributable to some aspect other than technical limitations that would prevent venture capital investment...|$|E

We consider gas with so small angular momentum that, {{if not for the}} effects of MHD, the flow would accrete directly onto a BH. We find that after an initial transient, the flow settles into a configuration with four components: (i) a radial equatorial <b>inflow,</b> (<b>ii)</b> a bipolar outflow, (iii) polar funnel outflow, and (iv) polar funnel inflow. We focus our analysis on the second flow component which is a simple yet robust example of a well-organized inflow/outflow {{solution to the problem of}} MHD jet formation. The jet is heavy, highly magnetized, and driven by magnetic and centrifugal forces. A significant fraction of the total energy in the jet is carried out by a large scale magnetic field. We review previous simulations, where specific angular momentum was higher than that assumed here, and conclude that our bipolar outflow develops for a wide range of the properties of the flow near the equator and near the poles.

It is argued here that not only does corruption reduce foreign direct investment inflows to a country, but also different forms of corruption have separately identifiable effects on the variable in question. Using data from Global Competitiveness report of the World Economic Forum, it is manifested in a cross sectional setting that (i) corruption has a negative and {{significant impact on the}} foreign direct investment <b>inflows,</b> and (<b>ii)</b> corruption in the field of import/export permits has a positive and significant impact on FDI inflows, whereas corruption in the fields of annual tax payments, access to public utilities and judicial decisions are strong deterrents against FDI.

40|$|The Republic of Korea has {{recently}} experienced: (i) large capital inflows, in particular {{a surge in}} portfolio <b>inflows,</b> and (<b>ii)</b> an appreciation of asset prices, including stock prices, land prices, and nominal and real exchange rates. We first document the recent trend in capital inflows and asset prices in Korea, and review how a surge in capital inflows can increase asset prices. Then, we empirically investigate the effects of capital inflows on asset prices using a VAR model. The empirical results suggest that capital inflows shocks increased the stock prices but not land prices. The effects on the nominal and real exchange rates are limited, and this {{is related to the}} accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. A catch-all solution to the problems that capital inflows present does not seem to exist. Therefore, the most should be made of the available instruments at hand...|$|R

After {{the first}} wave, it {{can no longer}} be projected to all current recipients because new entries to UB II are not included. Thus Subsample 1 is refreshed each year to include new entries into UB II (i.e., households with at least one benefit unit on the reference date of the current wave and no benefit unit on any of the previous reference dates). All respondents who (still or again) receive benefits on the current reference date can thus be projected to all current recipients in Germany. Furthermore, the refreshment samples can be used to analyse entry cohorts separately or to identify determinants of <b>inflows</b> into UB <b>II</b> (cf. Trappmann et al., 2010, 2011).|$|R

Our results show that (i) there is a negative relationship between exchange rate volatility and tourist <b>inflows</b> into Turkey; (<b>ii)</b> there is a negative impact of the relative price ratio on the tourist flows indicating that relatively expensive places deter tourist arrivals, given the keen international competition among alternative destinations; (iii) GDP per capita at tourist origin, measured in Purchasing Power Parities, exerts positive influence on tourist flows.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} supersonic mixing layers and jets {{have been carried}} out to study the scalar mixing characteristics of supersonic shear flows. A precursor two dimensional mixing layer study, including a splitter plate with zero thickness under supersonic conditions, showed no upstream propagation of flow information. This is in contrast with subsonic cases in which a feedback mechanism is observed and leads to self-sustained vortical structures. Simulations of mixing layers and jets were carried out for (i) planar <b>inflow,</b> for (<b>ii)</b> flow with spanwise sinusoidal variation and for (iii) the spanwise sinusoidal variation with a forced streamwise vortex. Only the latter (iii) case showed enhanced mixing, this is observed from the simulations, which were run up to a near self-similar state as seen in the collapse of the mean streamwise velocity profiles into a common form for all three cases. The streamwise vortex cases showed a scalar probability density function (pdf) with a preferred mixed fluid composition, compared with planar and sinusoidal cases. Finally, a case study was made with a practical injector geometry at two inflow Reynolds numbers of Re = 600 and Re = 1200 respectively. The results showed that rapid mixing occurred immediately downstream of the injector. This case study shows a highly diffusive flow, which is seen in the small change of the mean scalar profile obtained across the mixed region. With an increase in inflow Reynolds number, there is an increase in the three dimensionality of the flow, seen in the higher lateral and spanwise turbulence intensities when compared with the lower Reynolds number case...|$|R
40|$|Meteorite impacts cause {{conversion}} of kinetic energy into thermal energy. Part of this thermal energy {{is used to}} form a melt sheet, part is dissipated to heat the target rocks and these together with the hot rocks that elastically rebound from the depth of several kilometres (central uplift) activate hydrothermal circulation. Impact-generated hydrothermal systems have been documented from several impact structures world-wide. Three Australian examples—Shoemaker, Woodleigh and Yarrabubba—provide evidence of hydrothermal fluid flow both within and around the structures. Field observations, and petrographic and geochemical data suggest a common evolutionary trend of post-impact hydrothermal activity from early high-temperature alkali metasomatism to a later lower temperature H + metasomatism, resulting in the overprinting by hydrous mineral assemblages. Hydrothermal systems activated by meteorite-impact events are important because they may also form economic mineral deposits, as is documented for several impact structures in the world. A working model of hydrothermal circulation in terrestrial impact structures posits two main stages: (i) initial high-temperature fluids percolate downward causing widespread alkali metasomatism of the shattered target rocks below the melt sheet, resulting in their modification to rocks of syenitic affinity; and (<b>ii)</b> <b>inflow</b> of meteoric water and progressive cooling of the melt sheet leads to a lower temperature stage, in which hydrothermal fluid flow tends to move upward, resulting in mineral assemblages and alteration patterns that resemble those of epithermal systems. In addition, these fluids can discharge at the surface as hot springs. ...|$|R
40|$|We combine {{samples of}} nearby galaxies with Herschel {{photometry}} selected on their dust, metal, HI and stellar mass content, and compare these to chemical evolution models {{in order to}} discriminate between different dust sources. In a companion paper, we used an HI-selected sample of nearby galaxies to reveal a subsample of very gas-rich (gas fraction > 80 per cent) sources with dust masses significantly below predictions from simple chemical evolution models, and well below M-d/M-* and M-d/M-gas scaling relations seen in dust and stellar-selected samples of local galaxies. We use a chemical evolution model to explain these dust-poor, but gas-rich, sources {{as well as the}} observed star formation rates (SFRs) and dust-to-gas ratios. We find that (i) a delayed star formation history is required to model the observed SFRs; (<b>ii)</b> <b>inflows</b> and outflows are required to model the observed metallicities at low gas fractions; (iii) a reduced contribution of dust from supernovae (SNe) is needed to explain the dust-poor sources with high gas fractions. These dust-poor, low stellar mass galaxies require a typical core-collapse SN to produce 0. 01 - 0. 16 M-circle dot of dust. To match the observed dust masses at lower gas fractions, significant grain growth is required to counteract the reduced contribution from dust in SNe and dust destruction from SN shocks. These findings are statistically robust, though due to intrinsic scatter it is not always possible to find one single model that successfully describes all the data. We also show that the dust-to-metal ratio decreases towards lower metallicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{velocities}} of the [O III] 5007 {{and optical}} Fe II emission lines, measured {{relative to the}} systemic redshifts of 2265 QSOs by Hu et al. (2008), show the signature of a disklike BLR structure with polar outflows. Objects with large [O III] outflows show no Fe II offset velocity and are seen pole-on. Objects with large Fe <b>II</b> <b>inflow</b> show no [O III] offset velocity and are seen edge-on. This interpretation {{is supported by the}} morphology of the radio-loud objects within the sample and by previous determinations of the geometry of the broad and narrow line regions. Analysis of the objects with neither Fe II or [O III] velocity offsets, however, show that the two groups also differ in Eddington ratio, and, within this subset, corresponding groups with high and low Eddington ratio but with the opposite orientation can be identified. Using these four subsets of the sample, the effects of orientation and Eddington ratio can be separated, and, in some cases, quantified. The changes in apparent continuum luminosity and broad H-beta width and strength suggest a model in which both continuum and H-beta are emitted {{from the surface of the}} disk, which is less flattened in high Eddington ratio objects. The effects of orientation on the derived properties, black hole mass and Eddington ratio, are significant, though not large. The [O III] outflow appears to influence the width of that line, as well as its centroid. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I took a {{combined}} sample of dust-selected galaxies (from Clark et al. 2015) and HI-selected galaxies (from De Vis et al. 2016). The dust selected sample contains a large fraction of intriguing galaxies dubbed the ‘Blue And Dusty Gas Rich Sources’ (BADGRS), while the HI selected sources revealed another population {{of blue and}} gas rich systems which are instead dust-poor. I investigated whether the unique properties of these galaxies {{could be explained by}} variations in their recent star formation activity. I showed that the BADGRS are younger, and have typically experienced more recent bursts of star formation compared to the non-BADGRS. Splitting the sample into dust-rich and dust-poor sources showed that both subpopulations are of similar age, although the dust-rich sources have experienced a burst of star formation more recently. I took the chemical evolution model of Morgan & Edmunds (2003), used more recently used in Rowlands et al. (2014), and updated many of the functions and libraries in line with recent literature. I then produced a suite of models to investigate the dust and metal properties of 425 Herschel sources. These models showed (i) a delayed star formation history is required to match the observed star formation rates; (<b>ii)</b> <b>inflows</b> and outflows are required to explain the observed metallicities at low gas fractions; (iii) a significantly reduced contribution of dust from supernovae is necessary to explain the dust poor sources with high gas fractions. We also showed the dust-to-metal ratio is not definitively constant in all galaxies, and that there is evidence for a decrease in the dust-to-metals ratio towards lower metallicity. This thesis proposes a model in which the dust, gas, metals and stars can be modelled in a consistent and coherent manner, and gains insight into the dust-to-gas evolution at early epochs...|$|R
40|$|We use cosmological {{hydrodynamic}} simulations {{to study}} the impact of out-flows and radiative feedback on high-redshift galaxies. For outflows, we consider simulations that assume (i) no winds, (ii) a. constant-wind. model in which the mass-loading factor and outflow speed are constant, and (iii) "momentum driven" winds in which both parameters vary smoothly with mass. In order to treat radiative feedback, we develop a moment-based radiative transfer technique that operates in both post-processing and coupled radiative hydrodynamic modes. We first ask how outflows impact the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of six observed reionization-epoch galaxies. Simulations reproduce five regardless of the outflow prescription, while the sixth suggests an unusually bursty star formation history. We conclude that (i) simulations broadly account for available constraints on reionization-epoch galaxies, (ii) individual SEDs do not constrain outflows, and (iii) SED comparisons efficiently isolate objects that challenge simulations. We next study how outflows impact the galaxy mass metallicity relation (MZR). Momentum-driven outflows uniquely reproduce observations at z = 2. In this scenario, galaxies obey two equilibria: (i) The rate at which a galaxy processes gas into stars and outflows tracks its <b>inflow</b> rate; and (<b>ii)</b> The gas enrichment rate owing to star formation balances the dilution rate owing to inflows. Combining these conditions indicates that the MZR {{is dominated by the}} (instantaneous) variation of outflows with mass, with more-massive galaxies driving less gas into outflows per unit stellar mass formed. Turning to radiative feedback, we use post-processing simulations {{to study the}} topology of reionization. Reionization begins in overdensities and then. leaks. directly into voids, with filaments reionizing last owing to their high density and low emissivity. This result conflicts with previous findings that voids ionize last. We argue that it owes to the uniqely-biased emissivity field produced by our star formation prescriptions, which have previously been shown to reproduce numerous post-reionization constraints. Finally, preliminary results from coupled radiative hydrodynamic simulations indicate that reionization suppresses the star formation rate density by at most 10. 20 % by z = 5. This is much less than previous estimates, which we attribute to our unique reionization topology although confirmation will have to await more detailed modeling...|$|R
40|$|Furrow {{irrigation}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} techniques of surface irrigation and is the most popular method for the irrigation of row crops. In Australia the method is widely used for the irrigation of cotton and in some years it has accounted for about 95 % of the total production. The furrow system is however often associated with high labour requirement and low water used e�ciency. In furrow irrigation the soil is used both as a medium for infiltration and also for conveyance of water from one end of field to the other. However, the spatial and temporal soil infiltration variability causes non-uniformity in water absorption rates and furrow stream advance rates. This significantly reduces water use e�ciency because current design and management practices do not take this variability into account. Most operations in the furrow system are undertaken manually, and are hence labour-intensive. Real time optimisation and control of furrow irrigation has been proposed for the management of infiltration variability. The system estimates the soil infiltration characteristics in real time and uses the data to control the same irrigation, potentially leading to improvement of water use e�ciency. The major goal of this research was therefore to develop, prove and demonstrate an automated system for real time optimisation of furrow irrigation. The hypotheses of the research were that: (i) use of real time optimisation and control in furrow irrigation can lead to signi�cant improvement in irrigation performance, and (ii) automation of furrow irrigation is feasible. The system developed in this research is an integration of a simulation model and associated automation hardware and consists of �five main components: (i) a water delivery system, (<b>ii)</b> an <b>inflow</b> measurement system, (<b>ii)</b> a water sensor to monitor advance of water along the furrow, (iv) computer running the simulation model (AutoFurrow), and (v) a radio telemetry system to facilitate communication among the system components. AutoFurrow uses a scaling technique to adjust the soil infiltration characteristic and determine the soil conditions prevailing for the particular irrigation. Hence it optimises the current irrigation to satisfy the soil moisture deficit and other user-defined objectives (for example target effi�ciency, uniformity and run-o�) and determines the time to end the irrigation in suffi�cient time for effective control of the irrigation. Trials to test and prove the new system were undertaken on two separate commercial cotton properties over two consecutive irrigation seasons. The system implemented for the field trials was not fully automated, and operations such as starting and cutting of flow was achieved manually. Apart from evaluations of the optimisation system, full advance data and other measurements were taken for all trials to enable a post-irrigation complete (actual) irrigation evaluation to be undertaken. Performances expected as per the grower's irrigation management practices were also evaluated. The SISCO simulation model was used for analysis of data. The results suggested that the optimisation system was successful in delivering irrigation performance significantly better than achieved by the grower. However, in the 2010 / 11 irrigation season this performance (predicted by the optimisation system) was found to be slightly higher than the actual performance and much less than that suggested by a post irrigation optimisation undertaken using the full measured data for each irrigation. This suggested that the system had not reached its full potential and further improvements were necessary. Factors investigated for their possible contribution to performance of the real time optimisation system were: flow rate, objective function, selection of the model curve, and the infiltration scaling process. The investigations involved an exhaustive series of simulations using the SISCO model, varying each of these factors in turn. The key changes in the evaluation methodology effected as a result of these investigations and used for the 2011 / 12 irrigation season trials were: the adoption of a simpler objective function consisting only of RE, and (ii) taking the average shape of the previous in�filtrations curves and using it as the model curve. The benefit of these changes was clearly evident in the results obtained from the 2011 / 12 trials - the performance of the optimisation system improved and the difference between the actual performance predicted by the optimisation system was reduced to � 4 %. This research has therefore achieved its overall goal of designing and testing a real time optimisation system for furrow irrigation. It has also successfully demonstrated the potential benefits of real time optimisation and shown that the automation of the furrow system is feasible. Further research has been recommended including a comprehensive economic analysis and the trialling of the system in bay irrigation. ...|$|R
