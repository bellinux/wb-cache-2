5|$|Both of {{the latest}} bailout {{programme}} audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed that even after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012, {{there was a new}} forecast <b>financing</b> <b>gap</b> of: €5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016. The new forecast financing gaps will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to the bond market during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra financing gaps with additional private capital. A total of €6.1bn was received from the sale of three-year and five-year bonds in 2014, and the Greek government now plans to cover its forecast <b>financing</b> <b>gap</b> for 2015 with additional sales of seven-year and ten-year bonds in 2015.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of 2014, the Greek {{government}} again negotiated with the Troika. The negotiations were this time about how to comply with the programme requirements, to ensure activation of the payment of its last scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in December 2014, and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 2015–16. When calculating the impact of the 2015 fiscal budget presented by the Greek government, there was a disagreement, with the calculations of the Greek government showing it fully complied with the goals of its agreed [...] "Midterm fiscal plan 2013–16", while the Troika calculations were less optimistic and returned a not covered <b>financing</b> <b>gap</b> at €2.5bn (being required to be covered by additional austerity measures). As the Greek government insisted their calculations were more accurate than those presented by the Troika, they submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill on 21 November, to be voted for by the parliament on 7 December. The Eurogroup was scheduled to meet and discuss the updated review of the Greek bailout programme on 8 December (to be published on the same day), and the potential adjustments to the remaining programme for 2015–16. There were rumours in the press that the Greek government has proposed immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 2015–16, replacing it with the transfer of €11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), along with establishment of a new precautionary Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) issued by the European Stability Mechanism. The ECCL instrument is often used as a follow-up precautionary measure, when a state has exited its sovereign bailout programme, with transfers only taking place if adverse financial/economic circumstances materialize, but with the positive effect that it help calm down financial markets as the presence of this extra backup guarantee mechanism makes the environment safer for investors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how a <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> for small firms might {{be addressed by}} means of government policy to support informal financing initiatives. A review of both the finance and the government policy literature provides the basis for discussing and conceptualising the financing difficulties faced by small firms, the role of informal financing in alleviating certain of these difficulties and the areas where public policy is currently usefully employed in addressing such financing problems. A questionnaire survey is undertaken to collect data concerning small business awareness and use of informal finance and to identify issues concerning difficulties encountered in gaining access to finance. The results suggest that a debt <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> may exist for a minority of firms, though an equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> may represent a more significant issue for small firms. Four categories of policy action emerge from the study towards the achievement {{of economic and social}} policy objectives. These are legislation/regulation, information provision, direct funding and network provision. MANAGERIAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS •	Over the decades, the presence and nature of a small firm <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> has been an important preoccupation of policy-makers, the finance industry and of course the small firm manager. This gap may be filled by means of quasi-commercial, or QCOM, finance. •	It appears that only a minority of small business managers encounter a debt <b>finance</b> <b>gap,</b> though a more serious problem is presented by the presence of a significant and widespread equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap.</b> •	There exists a range of policy prescriptions to address the debt and equity <b>financing</b> <b>gaps</b> experienced by small firms. Those initiatives aiming to address the former are aligned to the government’s more recent agenda concerning social inclusion and community development whilst those aiming to address the latter are aligned to existing government economic policy objectives, particularly the continued emphasis on ‘picking winners’. •	Policy action directed at addressing the small firm debt <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> might include legislation to enable the growth of business credit unions; better information provision regarding sources of debt and appropriate support services; direct funding of agencies such as the Princes Trust; and network support for collectivist financing initiatives such as mutual guarantee societies and credit unions. •	Policy action directed at addressing the equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> might include legislation and deregulation to further encourage private equity investment; information to promote informal venture capital opportunities; the establishment of government funds to extend informal equity investment; and enhanced support for new and existing venture capital networks...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} how the United Kingdom (UK) government has addressed the equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> since {{the onset of}} the recent financial crisis.

Using recent demand-side and supply-side research evidence alongside existing literature, the chapter focuses on the following five principles and lessons: (i) government has a justified, catalytic role in addressing the equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> to stimulate research & development (R & D) investment; (ii) the management of funds should be private sector led and governments should resist the temptation to over-engineer; (iii) funds need to recognize the long lead times and investment horizons for sensible exit timescales, sustainability and encouragement for future private VC activity; (iv) government VC funds require the size, scale and flexibility to provide follow-on funding and achieve optimal outcomes for funds and their portfolio businesses; and (v) a global perspective encourages inward investment and foreign VC collaborations opening up overseas markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} UK {{public policy}} addressing the seed and {{early stage equity}} <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Drawing on lessons learned from recent studies of UK and international government equity schemes, two contemporary models of government backed equity finance are examined. The {{focus is on the}} Enterprise Capital Funds (ECFs) and the Angel Co-investment Fund (ACF), the UK government’s main schemes operating in the sub-£ 2 m equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> to address the capital requirements for developing the UK’s young, potential high growth businesses. The paper highlights the shortcomings of traditional interim fund performance analysis and presents current demand and supply side evidence that establishes that these schemes are making attributable impacts on their portfolio businesses and the wider UK economy. It also demonstrates that they are playing important roles in the establishment of a new post GFC UK finance escalator. However, whilst these schemes were found to be currently complementary and effective, their future roles within the UK’s evolving post GFC seed and early stage equity markets are also considered.
