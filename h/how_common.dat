5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from <b>how</b> <b>common</b> it is.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize <b>how</b> <b>common</b> archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores <b>how</b> <b>commons</b> {{reproduce}} {{over time}} and introduces the concept of commoning to discuss rural continuities and change. The point of departure is that commons are essential for local community development in {{that they have an}} important role for mediating social change and for local identity production. Through an ethnographic and historical study of a number of commons systems from the village of Ängersjö in the Midwest of Sweden, the paper argues for a more historically and socially grounded understanding of <b>how</b> <b>commons</b> evolve. The paper examines Ängersjö’s commons within two broad historical time frames – the pre-industrial (4 th to 20 th century)  and the post-industrial time periods (20 th century to the present) – in order to understand commons, not just as arenas for resource extraction and resource struggles, but also as important contexts for identity formation, local mobilisation and for shaping rural change. The paper reveals <b>how</b> the <b>commons</b> have co-evolved with changes in society at large and how the meanings and functions of the commons have changed throughout history – from being important economic resources – to cultural and symbolic resources that have created new avenues for collective action.

5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{was known}} to the ancients, such as Galen, and various theories were proposed about {{its role in the}} body, but major clues as to the actual function of the gland were not advanced until the late 19th century, when acromegaly due to pituitary tumors was described. The first known report of hypopituitarism was made by the German physician and pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds. He described the condition on autopsy in a 46-year-old woman who had suffered severe puerperal fever eleven years earlier, and subsequently suffered amenorrhea, weakness, signs of rapid aging and anemia. The pituitary gland was very small and there were few remnants of both the anterior and the posterior pituitary. The eponym Simmonds' syndrome is used infrequently for acquired hypopituitarism, especially when cachexia (general ill health and malnutrition) predominates. Most of the classic causes of hypopituitarism were described in the 20th century; the early 21st century saw the recognition of <b>how</b> <b>common</b> hypopituitarism could be in previous head injury victims.|$|E
5|$|When {{bound to}} a protein, NAD and NADH are usually held within a {{structural}} motif {{known as the}} Rossmann fold. The motif is named after Michael Rossmann {{who was the first}} scientist to notice <b>how</b> <b>common</b> this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins. This fold contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide, binding domains for NAD consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each fold binding one of the two nucleotides of the cofactor. However, this fold is not universal among NAD-dependent enzymes, since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme, but lack this motif.|$|E

The paper begins with a brief discussion of <b>how</b> the <b>commons</b> framework and its application in traditional commons and proceeds to a discussion of urban commons. Subsequently we seek to delineate a small set of characteristics that seem relevant in many of the studied cases and which seem to derive from characteristics of the urban setting. We argue that a careful consideration of these characteristics will provide input to a much-needed understanding of how shared resources in an urban setting can be collaboratively managed and developed...|$|R
