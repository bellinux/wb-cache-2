40|$|This {{study was}} a {{numerical}} and experimental investigation of low-temperature auto-ignitions behindreflected shock waves in which a shock tube was employed as the experimental system. We used ahigh-speed video camera and the Schlieren method to visualize the ignition phenomena. Experimentswere performed over a temperature range from 549 ± 10 to 1349 ± 11 K and a pressure range from 56 ± 2 to 203 ± 13 kPa, and a non-diluted stoichiometric acetylene–oxygen mixture was chosen as thecombustible gas. We introduced a numerical simulation {{to help us understand}} the disturbed temperaturedistribution behind bifurcated shock waves due to interference between reflected shock waves and theboundary layer developed behind incident shock waves. Additionally, we experimentally observed andevaluated quantitatively a tendency for ignition positions to be located farther from the reflecting wallas the temperature decreased behind reflected shock waves. To focus our attention on the ignition positions,we classified the <b>ignition</b> <b>types</b> behind reflected shock waves as near-wall ignition and far-wallignition by 4. 7 mm distance from reflecting wall. The criterion for these <b>ignition</b> <b>types</b> was estimatedto be - 1. 0 ≦(∂ti/∂T 5 t) p 5 t≦- 0. 5. As a main object in this manuscript, we proposed an ignition modelin which local ignition is induced at some distance from reflecting wall based on the numerical simulationand results; the local ignitions at a point distant from the reflecting wall are induced by the temperaturerise, with the distance from the reflecting wall, immediately behind concave reflected shock wavesdue to developing of bifurcated shock waves.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the inside structure of one-dimensional reaction-diffusion traveling fronts. The reaction terms {{are of the}} monostable, bistable or <b>ignition</b> <b>types.</b> As-suming that the fronts are made of several components with identical diffusion and growth rates, we analyze the spreading properties of each component. In the monos-table case, the fronts are classified as pulled or pushed ones, depending on the prop-agation speed. We prove that any localized component of a pulled front converges locally to 0 at large times in the moving frame of the front, while any component of a pushed front converges to a well determined positive proportion of the front in the moving frame. These results give {{a new and more}} complete interpretation of the pulled/pushed terminology which extends the previous definitions to the case of gen-eral transition waves. In particular, in the bistable and ignition cases, the fronts are proved to be pushed as they share the same inside structure as the pushed monostable critical fronts. Uniform convergence results and precise estimates of the left and right spreading speeds of the components of pulled and pushed fronts are also established. ...|$|R

40|$|Variations in area burnt by fire {{are governed}} by four processes: biomass growth, {{availability}} to burn, fire weather and ignitions. Insight into these how these processes are shaped by biophysical and human influences is required to underpin the development of effective management strategies. Patterns of natural and arson ignitions were examined within the densely populated Sydney region of south-eastern Australia {{to determine the extent}} to which management can alter the risk of ignition. Arson ignitions were more likely on ridges in association with human infrastructure, i. e. roads and houses. Lightning ignitions also occurred more frequently on ridges, but at greater distances from human infrastructure. These patterns are consistent with those reported in studies from forested regions in the northern hemisphere. Fuel age had a variable effect with lightning more likely in older fuels (3 ̆e 25 years) and arson more likely in younger fuels (3 ̆c 10 3 ̆eyears). Probability of both <b>ignition</b> <b>types</b> increased under more severe fire weather.

40|$|In western North America, the carbon-rich {{boreal forest}} is {{experiencing}} warmer temperatures, drier conditions and {{larger and more}} frequent wildfires. However, the fire regime is also affected by direct human activities through suppression, ignition, and land use changes. Models are important predictive tools for understanding future conditions but {{they are based on}} regional generalizations of wildfire behavior and weather that do not adequately account for the complexity of human–fire interactions. To achieve {{a better understanding of the}} intensity of human influence on fires in this sparsely populated area and to quantify differences between human and lightning fires, we analyzed fires by both <b>ignition</b> <b>types</b> in regard to human proximity in urban (the Fairbanks subregion) and rural areas of interior Alaska using spatial (Geographic Information Systems) and quantitative analysis methods. We found substantial differences in drivers of wildfire: while increases in fire ignitions and area burned were caused by lightning in rural interior Alaska, in the Fairbanks subregion these increases were due to human fires, especially in the wildland urban interface. Lightning fires are starting earlier and fires are burning longer, which is much more pronounced in the Fairbanks subregion than in rural areas. Human fires differed from lightning fires in several ways: they started closer to settlements and highways, burned for a shorter duration, were concentrated in the Fairbanks subregion, and often occurred outside the brief seasonal window for lightning fires. This study provides important insights that improve our understanding of the direct human influence on recently observed changes in wildfire regime with implications for both fire modeling and fire management...|$|R
