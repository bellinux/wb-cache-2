25|$|The sport {{underwent}} several organisational changes, {{most notably}} in Australia and in South Africa (where competing organisations fought {{for control of the}} sport), but the game has changed little since that time and <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> in several nations. Under the auspices of the World Indoor Cricket Federation the sport has reached a point where is played according to the same standard rules in major competitions throughout the world.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{being brought}} to the United States from Europe, ten-pin bowling (a modern version of the game of skittles) <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> as its {{technology}} has improved. The sport is most popular in the United Kingdom and the United States. Both nations maintain national regulatory organizations that govern the sport's rules and conduct, {{and many of those}} countries' best players participate in tournaments on both the national and international stage. Because of the rise in popularity, many companies began making bowling balls and apparel for professionals as well as for recreational bowlers. Bowling has also become more prevalent in the media in recent years, with the continued popularity of bowling publications and the appearance of films centered around the culture of the sport. [...] However, the sport continues to face challenges in garnering mainstream coverage of the athletic aspects of the game.|$|E

25|$|As social {{networking}} sites <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> over the past years, people have been spending an excessive amount {{of time on the}} Internet in general and {{social networking}} sites in specific.

2500|$|The {{legacy of}} riot grrrl is clearly visible in {{numerous}} {{girls and women}} worldwide who cite the movement as an interest or an influence on their lives and/or their work. Some of them are self-proclaimed riot grrrls while others consider themselves simply admirers or fans. [...] There are many fansites and message boards for riot grrrl on the internet. In an age where Internet is the most accessible platform for individuals to express themselves, the Riot Grrrl online community <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> in recent years. Not only do these online platforms capture discussion regarding larger topics of systemic oppression, but they also provide space for girls to express smaller issues—the successes and challenges of their everyday lives. It is a forum that allows for self-determined feminism and genuine, open expression, a core part of the Riot Grrrl message that’s greatest power is giving girls the room to decide for themselves who they are. As both a purported musical genre and as a subculture, riot grrrl has been acclaimed as an influence on contemporary groups as varied as Kitten Forever, Skating Polly, The Shondes and The Ethical Debating Society. Besides that, the Riot Grrrl movement has been a strong influence {{not only for the}} punk-rock scene but also for other kinds of music.|$|E

50|$|Amazon.com was {{a virtual}} {{business}} pioneer. As an online bookstore, it delivered and brokered bookstore services without a physical retail store presence; efficiently connecting {{buyers and sellers}} without the overhead of a brick-and-mortar location. As Web 2.0 services <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity,</b> many businesses <b>have</b> begun to use these communicative and collaborative technologies to reach their customers. With heightened security, PCI DSS compliance regulations, and more stringent monitoring abilities, credit card transactions via the Internet are even more secure than other options such as phone or fax. Along with connecting customers with physical products, virtual businesses are starting to provide important services as well. Recently, the online delivery of professional services such as administration, design, and marketing services <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity.</b> Such companies <b>have</b> refined their offerings to include services such as a Virtual Assistant, in which the person providing the service works out of his/her own office and provides services via the Internet or other technology.|$|R

50|$|Garlic {{was long}} frowned upon for causing halitosis, so has never played {{a large role}} in {{traditional}} German cuisine, but <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> in recent decades due to the influence of French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, and Turkish cuisines.

John Clarke aka Fred Dagg joked about rural life. From the 1990s onwards the Naked Samoans expressed a Polynesian sense of humour to the nation, and Raybon Kan is a prominent Asian comic and columnist. The Topp Twins are an off-beat comic/country music duo, and Flight of the Conchords have become famous throughout the English-speaking world for their self-effacing show.|$|R
50|$|Variable-flow systems <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> {{primarily}} because they reduce a system’s energy consumption. They use variable-speed, inverter-driven pumps, {{the speed of}} which is changed to match the load. 2-port, motorized control valves are often used to control flows to terminal fan-coil units, or thermostatic radiator valves are used to regulate flow to radiators in heating-only systems. Current solutions in variable-flow systems also include a combination of differential-pressure control valves (DPCVs) {{which can be used}} on branches and/or across air-handling units, with double regulating valves to proportionately balance and limit flows to all terminal valves.|$|R

40|$|Distributed {{computing}} infrastructures <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> {{over the}} past decade, however resource allocation on these—largely federated—systems remains a practically unsolved problem. Previous attempts have either relied upon central management of resources, which is infeasible in a federated model, and market-based economies which we classify into systems using global, transferrable currency and systems using local, transferrable currency. We present an alternate approach which represents pair-wise, tit-for-tat relationships as local, non-transferrable currency. This approach promises to provide a solution that {{does not require a}} globally trusted third party and is easier to deploy and maintain than previous systems. 1. PROBLEM DEFINITIO...|$|R

40|$|Mixed {{compensatory}} systems <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> <b>in</b> recent years. Under such systems, single-seat districts elect {{only the}} leader of the local suffrage, but the systems nevertheless produce (nearly) proportional outcomes overall, via compensatory mandates. Elections in Albania, Italy, Lesotho, and Venezuela, however, demonstrate a particular loophole for such systems: strategic voting, organized by political parties. Large parties can achieve over-representation by encouraging their voters to split their votes. In this way, they outsmart the compensatory mechanism designed to lead to proportional results. These disproportional results are particularly controversial, since they are deliberate and strategic. This article takes the 2005 Albanian elections as its main case study, and uses simulations to illustrate its political consequences...|$|R

50|$|Rock {{music of}} Belarus arose in Perestroika times. Bands like Bi-2 (currently living in Russia), Lyapis Trubetskoy, Krama and ULIS were {{founded in the}} late 1980s or early 1990s.

50|$|Other festivities which <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> <b>in</b> {{recent years}} are the {{so-called}} 'water balloon fights'.

These water balloon fights have been going on for several years, each year with a new twist. On the last official school day in 2014, balloons were prepared early in the morning, some with glitter or ink. These 'fights' are often harmless and enjoyable. Bottles are also filled with water and emptied on laughing or surprised students as a second resort for balloons.|$|R
40|$|Multimedia {{applications}} on mobile devices <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>popularity</b> {{over the}} last few years. One important application is the transmission and display of digital images. Mobile devices are still limited regarding bandwidth, computing power and screen size, however. The research area of demand-driven image communication deals with overcoming these limitations. Based on prior {{research in the area of}} mobile image communication, this thesis introduces an image transmission system especially designed for use on mobile devices. It utilizes the current standards JPEG 2000 and JPIP for demand-driven image transmission, saving bandwidth and computing resources. It can be used to implement a diverse number of display and browsing techniques designed for mobile devices. To demonstrate the function of the system, it was used to implement several well-known display techniques...|$|R
