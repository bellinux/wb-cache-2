5000|$|XBRL Versioning - This module {{achieved}} Recommendation status 27 February 2013. This specification enables {{creation of}} Versioning Report {{which can be}} used by the authors of XBRL taxonomies to provide documentation of the changes between two taxonomies. Many large taxonomies (such as the <b>IFRS</b> <b>taxonomy)</b> change every year.|$|E
5000|$|The IFRS Foundation also {{develops}} {{and maintains}} the <b>IFRS</b> <b>Taxonomy,</b> {{which is the}} representation of the IFRSs in eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), via its XBRL team. The team is supported by the XBRL Advisory Council and the XBRL Quality Review Team, which respectively provide strategic advice and reviews developed taxonomies. Additionally, in 2012 the foundation issued a call for industry participants in a project to develop [...] "common industry practice concepts" [...] for the taxonomy.|$|E
5000|$|XBRL {{provides}} a [...] "common, electronic format {{for business and}} financial reporting", which {{will contribute to the}} global convergence of accounting standards towards IFRS; the director of XBRL activities at the IFRS Foundation, Olivier Servais, hopes that [...] "everybody will be using it" [...] in future. As of March 2012, the IFRS Taxonomies have [...] "considerably fewer" [...] tags than GAAP taxonomies, and the Security and Exchange Commission has not approved the <b>IFRS</b> <b>Taxonomy</b> for use in XBRL filings in the United States.|$|E
50|$|A wiki {{repository}} of XBRL projects {{is available to}} be freely explored and updated. Within the last ten years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States, the United Kingdom's HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and Companies House, Singapore had begun to require companies to use it, and other regulators were following suit. Development of the SEC's initial US GAAP Taxonomy was led by XBRL US and was accepted and deployed for use by public companies in 2008 in phases, with the largest filers going first: foreign companies which use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are expected to submit their financial returns to the SEC using XBRL once the <b>IFRS</b> <b>taxonomy</b> has been accepted by the SEC. In the UK in 2011, both HMRC and Companies House accepted XBRL in the iXBRL format. XBRL {{was adopted by the}} Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) of India for filing financial and costing information with the Central Government.|$|E
40|$|We have {{to stress}} that these dates are very loose {{estimates}} and release of the new taxonomies relies on events outside of HMRC control. We will keep {{you up to date}} with any new information as work progresses on the taxonomies. Interim filing arrangements Until the new FRS taxonomies are available, early adopters should tag using the most suitable items from the current UK <b>IFRS</b> <b>taxonomy,</b> Tagging to identify early adopters On 15 April we issued instruction...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} {{represents}} an academic contribution for the dis-cussion regarding the comparability between different IFRS financial statements and analyzes potential paths {{to the construction}} of more reliable, transparent and comparable financial information. This, by evaluating the processes and taxonomy related with eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and its contribution for reduc-ing the lack of accounting comparability. The document results on academic recommendations on how to enhance the current <b>IFRS</b> <b>taxonomy</b> and potential strategies for reaching a broad comparability scenario in the near future...|$|E
