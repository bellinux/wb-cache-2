40|$|This paper {{describes}} a research effort designed {{to advance the}} state-of-the-art {{in our understanding of}} how best to incorporate haptics technologies into training systems. Most modem military platforms require that humans monitor and interact with systems through control panels. While these tasks are largely cognitive in nature, they also require a sensorimotor-based interface. There has been virtually no research performed on the role of haptics in learning to interact with such systems in virtual environments, either in learning the sensorimotor or cognitive skills. Because haptics is difficult to simulate well and adds expense to training systems, the first question we asked was whether, in a simple reaction time task, the addition of <b>haptics</b> <b>feedback</b> contributes to performance or learning of the task versus another type of feedback, simpler to implement, such as auditory stimulatio...|$|E
40|$|<b>Haptics</b> <b>feedback</b> is a {{potential}} enhancement for surgeon's performance in robotic surgery. In this paper, we attempted to tackle the challenges in this application from three aspects: haptic information acquisition, design of a haptics enabled master console and system control. Taking the MASTER (Master And Slave Transluminal Endoscopic Robot) system as an example, we shared our solutions and concerns in designing a haptic enabled robotic system specifically for NOTES. By analyzing the driving mechanism of the system, a method was proposed to estimate the forces at the distal end (end-effectors) by measuring the forces at the proximal end (actuator housing). To implement this method, a force transmission model was developed for tendon-sheath actuation with unknown arbitrary configurations. With the presence of haptic feedback, {{it appears that the}} position control of the system also could be improved. It is hoped that this robotic system enhanced with haptic feedback could help to pave the way to the introduction of clinical NOTES. © 2011 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This paper presents a human factors experiment in which teleoperated task performance and control effort are assessed for a typical (dis-) assembly task in a hard-to-hard environment, well known to the operator.

The results show that overall task performance and control effort are primarily improved by providing low-frequency <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> (specifically by improvements in constrained translational and constrained rotational tasks), while further <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> quality improvements yield only marginal performance increases and control effort decreases, even if a full natural spectrum of <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> is provided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> system for an arm {{in order to}} obtain the {{sensation}} of stiffness and the boundary of virtual objects. Powerful haptic displays are large and heavy, interfering with movement in the virtual environment. Here, we focus on an illusion called pseudo-haptic feedback, which provides the results of <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> using only visual impressions. Since pseudo-haptic feedback is known to be inappropriate for applications requiring strong force, a combination of pseudo-haptic <b>feedback</b> and real <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> is proposed for a compact haptic display. This study examines the effectiveness of this combination by comparing the stiffness of two walls. Pseudo-haptic and real <b>haptic</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are applied to one wall, and only real <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> is applied to the other wall.

40|$|Laparo-Endoscopic Single Site (LESS) Robotics Surgery is an {{advanced}} {{technology in the}} field of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). The LESS surgical robots significantly improve the surgeon’s accuracy, dexterity and visualization, and reduce the invasiveness of surgical procedure results in faster recovery time and improved cosmetic results. In a standard robotic endosurgery, the palpation of tissues is performed by laparoscopic graspers located at the end effectors. The master-slave configuration in robotic surgery leads in remote access to the operation site. Therefore, surgeon’s ability to perceive valuable sensory information is severely diminished. Sensory information such as haptics, which is essential for safe tissue and organ palpation, is not possible due to absence of direct access. Therefore, unknowingly excessive grasping forces are exerted by the laparoscopic graspers could lead to tissue trauma and vital tissues and organs damage. This thesis presents the several aspects of haptic feedback system including a design and analysis of force sensing forearm to measure grasping forces exerting on tissues during palpation tasks, 4 -CH bilateral teleoperated Impedance-Impedance based robotic control architecture for haptics and design and developments of Surgical Haptics-User Interface Devices (H-UID). The entire <b>haptics</b> <b>feedback</b> system has been implemented in miniature in vivo surgical robots and tested in animal surgeries at University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). The results of bench-tops and animal surgeries in the presence of haptics were discussed.

40|$|Several web sites, such as {{e-learning}} platforms, online museums, etc. {{are available}} via the web, and allow users and visitors to learn at a distance. Several e-learning platforms or in general informative web sites (such as museum web sites) have also {{started to make}} their web site “accessible”, making them more navigable for (visually) impaired users. However, accessibility in the current conception concerns navigation within the site, {{but does not help}} to effectively peruse the content in the site itself. For specific learning contexts, such as geography, math, history, or in museum web sites, access to images and graphics that carry significant meanings which are hardly translatable into words is barren to visually impaired users. In this case, providing a textual alternative like it is suggested in the accessibility guidelines may not prove sufficient, let alone satisfactory for the user. A solution to this problem is offering the image information in a multimodal way, enriching the graphical information with haptic (tactile) feedback and with aural (audio) cues. In a multimodal version of an image, it could be possible to allow feature identification with a correlation to vibrational patterns, with corresponding voice annotations, so when for example the user hovers on a city in a map, the corresponding tactile cue is felt, and a voice reads the name of the city.

Additionally, the surgeons’ perspective on the potential benefits of <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> should be assessed to ascertain the clinical interest of enhanced <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback.</b> A questionnaire was designed to determine surgeons’ use and preferences for laparoscopic instruments and expectations about enhanced <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback.</b> Surgeons were also asked whether they experience physical complaints related to laparoscopic instruments. The questionnaire was distributed to a group of laparoscopic surgeons based in Europe. From the 279 contacted subjects, 98 completed the questionnaire (response rate 35  %). Of all respondents, 77  % reported physical complaints directly attributable to the use of laparoscopic instruments. No evident similarity in the main preference for graspers was found, either with or without <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback.</b> According to respondents, the added value of <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> could be of particular use in feeling differences in tissue consistencies, feeling the applied pressure, locating a tumor or enlarged lymph node, feeling arterial pulse, and limiting strain in the surgeon’s hand.

Furthermore, the potential benefits of enhanced <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> in laparoscopic surgery are recognized by laparoscopic specialists.

40|$|Abstract — Although it is {{reported}} in the literature that <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> leads to improved performance in kinesthetic collaborative tasks, it has not been investigated so far whether this advantage is accompanied by a higher physical workload. This paper is an initial effort to examine efficiency in haptic interaction: We relate physical effort to a performance outcome in a virtual pursuit tracking task. An experimental study is conducted to compare efficiency in a collaborative mutual <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> condition to three control conditions, where participants either acted alone or collaboratively without <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> from the partner. Results show that reciprocal <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> does not improve efficiency, although participants’ performance was generally improved when doing the task with a partner, relative to executing it alone.

40|$|Background—The {{benefits}} of <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> in laparoscopic surgery training simulators {{is a topic}} of debate in the literature. It is hypothesized that novice surgeons may not benefit from the haptic information, especially during the initial phase of learning a new task. Therefore, providing <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> to novice trainees in the early stage of training may be distracting and detrimental to learning.

For this purpose, an introduction of the background was carried out, including touch screens, technologies producing <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback,</b> the sense of touch and users in a driving situation. From this, two conclusions were taken. First, the kind of touch screen that most suits an in-vehicle environment is a multicapacitive touch screen. Also, that the best technology to produce navigation <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> is the texture surface changing. Taking these results into consideration a prototype was implemented. This prototype was tested in a usability study. The main problem found out during the usability study is the long learnability time needed by the participants due to the new way of interaction introduced to be able to navigate. From the information of the usability study the following results have been extracted. The actions that were helped by the introduction of navigation <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> were navigation across items and level selectors.

While the usefulness of <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> in no-delay teleoperation has been previously established, this paper investigates whether <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> helps to improve task performance in the presence of delay. We consider peg-in-the-hole insertion, which is a dexterous manipulation task requiring high force levels at certain points during the task execution. Through a user study involving unilateral and bilateral teleoperation experiments under different delays, it is observed that in both unilateral and bilateral teleoperation, the task completion time increases as delay increases. It is also seen that <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> helps reduce the amount and rate of energy transfer to the environment and the occurrence of larger robot/environment interaction forces. However, with the users mindful of minimizing contact forces, <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> causes the task to take more time compared to no <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> regardless of the time delay. Thus, for tasks where low completion times are crucial given a tolerance for larger forces, unilateral feedback may be sufficient. I...|$|R

It {{is important to recognize}} that grasping a physical object and pantomime-grasping differ not only in terms of their spatial properties but also with respect to the availability of <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback.</b> Thus, the objective of this dissertation was to investigate how terminal <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> influences the underlying mechanisms that support goal-directed grasping in visual- and tactile-based settings. In Chapter Two I sought to determine whether absolute <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> influences tactile-based cues supporting grasps performed to the location previously occupied by an object. Results demonstrated that when <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> was presented at the end of the response absolute haptic signals were incorporated in grasp production. Such a finding indicates that <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> supports the absolute calibration between a tactile defined object and the required motor output. In Chapter Three I examined whether <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> influences the information supporting visually guided no-target pantomime-grasps in a manner similar to tactile-guided grasping. Results showed that haptic sensory signals support no-target pantomime-grasping when provided at the end of the response. Accordingly, my findings demonstrated that a visuo-haptic calibration supports the absolute specification of object size and highlights the role of multisensory integration in no-target pantomime-grasping. Importantly, however, Chapter Four demonstrated that a priori knowledge of <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> is necessary to support the aforementioned calibration process. In Chapter Five I demonstrates that, unlike no-target pantomime-grasps, spatially dissociated pantomime-grasps precluded a visuo-haptic calibration. Accordingly, I propose that the top-down demands of decoupling stimulus-response relations in spatially dissociated pantomime-grasping renders aperture shaping via a visual percept that is immutable to the integration of <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback.</b> In turn, the decreased top-down demands of no-target pantomime-grasps allows <b>haptic</b> <b>feedback</b> to serve as a reliable sensory resource supporting an absolute visuo-haptic calibration...|$|R
