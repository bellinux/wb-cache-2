5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|A {{network of}} roads {{developed}} in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's roads, between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century and a series of military roads were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite Risings in the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This was the beginning of a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads. There was an attempt improve agriculture, resulting in new crops, techniques and enclosures began to <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> run rig system and free pasture.|$|E

5|$|Downburst winds {{can produce}} {{numerous}} hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, {{and are often}} mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Bell's {{affiliation}} with the Steelers, he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the franchise from him. Compounding Bell's problems, Arch Ward organized the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1944 to <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> NFL's sovereignty in professional football. Ward's AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league, which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically. In Bill Dudley's contract proceedings with the Steelers, he attributed Bell's anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC. Furthermore, {{by the end of}} 1945, the Steelers were in their most economically perilous situation in its history.|$|E
5|$|Allemand's {{expedition}} of 1805, {{often referred}} to as the Escadre invisible (invisible squadron) in French sources, was an important French naval expedition during the Napoleonic Wars, which formed a major diversion to the ongoing Trafalgar Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean. With the French Mediterranean Fleet at sea, Emperor Napoleon I hoped to unite it with the French Atlantic Fleet and together form a force powerful enough to temporarily <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> British Royal Navy Channel Fleet for long enough to allow an invasion force to cross the English Channel and land in Britain. In support of this plan, the French squadron based at Rochefort put to sea in July 1805, initially with the intention that they would join the Atlantic Fleet from Brest. When this fleet failed to put to sea, the Rochefort squadron, under Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, went on an extended raiding cruise across the Atlantic, both to intercept British trade left lightly defended by the concentration of British forces in European waters and with the intention of eventually combining with the French Mediterranean Fleet then blockaded in Spanish harbours.|$|E

30|$|In {{immiscible}} displacement, {{occurrence of}} viscous fingering is {{believe to be}} due to the instability of the interface between <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> and <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> fluid when <b>the</b> mobility ratio is usually greater than 1 (Chuoke et al. 1959). This might occur when the viscosity of <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> fluid is much larger than the viscosity of <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> fluid or/and when the effective permeability of <b>the</b> <b>displacing</b> fluid is larger than the effective permeability of <b>the</b> <b>displaced</b> fluid. <b>The</b> differences in physical properties between two immiscible phases are the main trigger for frontal instability. The forces exist at the interface affecting the frontal stability includes gravity, viscosity, and (for immiscible fluids) surface or interfacial tension (Homsy 1987).|$|R

Contacts with England led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> runrig system and free pasture. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep. However, although some estate holders improved {{the quality of life of}} their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad.|$|E

5|$|From 1872 until 1879, the nationalities {{forming the}} bulk of the new {{settlers}} were composed of Portuguese (31.2%), Italians (25.8%), Germans (8.1%) and Spanish (1.9%). In the 1880s, Italians would surpass the Portuguese (61.8% to 23.3% respectively), and the Spanish would <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> Germans (6.7% to 4.2% respectively). Other, smaller groups also arrived, including Russians, Poles and Hungarians. Since nearly all European immigrants settled in the southeastern and southern areas of the Empire, ethnic distribution, already unequal before the mass immigration, became even more divergent between regions. For a nation that had a small, widely scattered population (4,000,000 in 1823 and 14,333,915 in 1890), the immigration of more than 1,380,000 Europeans had a tremendous effect upon the country's ethnic composition. In 1872, the year of the first reliable national census, white Brazilians represented just over a third (38.1%) of the total population; in 1890, they had increased to a little under half (44.0%) of all Brazilians.|$|E

5|$|Named for British anesthetist Brian Arthur Sellick (1918–1996) {{who first}} {{described}} the procedure in 1961, {{the goal of}} cricoid pressure is to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Cricoid pressure has been widely used during RSI for nearly fifty years, {{despite a lack of}} compelling evidence to support this practice. The initial article by Sellick was based on a small sample size at a time when high tidal volumes, head-down positioning and barbiturate anesthesia were the rule. Beginning around 2000, a significant body of evidence has accumulated which questions the effectiveness of cricoid pressure. The application of cricoid pressure may in fact <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> esophagus laterally instead of compressing it as described by Sellick. Cricoid pressure may also compress the glottis, which can obstruct the view of the laryngoscopist and actually cause a delay in securing the airway.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite National Park has {{documented}} more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.|$|E

New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.

5|$|The HV and {{the special}} police {{suffered}} 174211 killed or missing, while the ARSK had 560 soldiers killed. Four UN peacekeepers were also killed. The HV captured 4,000 prisoners of war. The number of Serb civilian deaths is disputedCroatia claims that 214 were killed, while Serbian sources cite 1,192 civilians killed or missing. During and after the offensive, 150,000–200,000 Serbs—or nearly the entire Serb population of the area formerly held by the ARSK—fled {{and a variety of}} crimes were committed against the remaining civilians there. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later tried three Croatian generals charged with war crimes and partaking in a joint criminal enterprise designed to force the Serb population out of Croatia, although all three were ultimately acquitted and the tribunal refuted charges of a criminal enterprise. In 2010, Serbia sued Croatia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that the offensive constituted a genocide. In 2015, the court ruled that it was not genocidal, and it affirmed that the Serb population fled {{as a direct result of}} the offensive, although Croatia did not have the specific intent to <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> country's Serb minority, nor was it found that ethnic cleansing or civilian targeting took place.

5|$|The Navy {{decided that}} a Hawaiian base was a necessity, {{considering}} the Army field at Ford Island an ideal candidate. Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor, consisting of nine officers and fifty-five men, was commissioned on December 19, 1919. Although the Navy attempted to <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> Army from the island and designate it solely for naval use, U.S. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker divided the island equally between the military branches. The Army received {{the west side of}} the island, and the Navy the southeastern side. Lieutenant Commander Robert D.

Kirk-Patrick's men had two Curtiss HS2L flying boats and two N-9 planes salvaged from World War I, which they stored in two large canvas hangars across the harbor from the island. After the naval hangars were commissioned on January 17, 1923, by Lieutenant Commander John Rodgers, the detachment moved onto Ford Island and received Naval Aircraft Factory TS, Felixstowe F5L, Curtiss H-16, Keystone PK-1 and Douglas DT type aircraft. To accommodate ship berthing the Navy built a concrete-and-stone quay around the entire island, and in 1926, they received Vought FU, Vought VE-7 and Vought VE-9 biplanes.|$|E
