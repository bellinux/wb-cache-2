500|$|By February 1671, John Churchill {{was back}} in London and duelling with Sir John Fenwick. Churchill's {{handsome}} features and manner – described by Lord Chesterfield as [...] "irresistible to either man or woman" [...] – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions {{of one of the}} King's most noteworthy mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon the King's appearance Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid in the cupboard, but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill, who promptly fell to his knees. [...] "You are a rascal", said Charles, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>you</b> because you do it to get your bread". The story may be apocryphal – another version has Churchill jumping out of the window – but it is widely accepted that he was the father of Cleveland's daughter, Barbara, born on 16 July 1672 (O.S.). However, Churchill never formally acknowledged her.|$|E
500|$|The character's {{accidental}} pregnancy storyline received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly deemed it [...] "a good dramatic twist", but hoped {{that it would}} not be a long-lasting storyline. Reviews of her storyline became increasingly negative, though Agron was praised for her dramatic acting during the confrontation scene with Quinn's parents in [...] "Ballad". Gerrick D. Kennedy, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was critical of the ongoing pregnancy plot in the episode [...] "Hairography", and noted that he cringed whenever Quinn appeared on screen. Conversely, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed Quinn in the episode, and wrote: [...] "I love that she can keep her Mean Girls edge while being heartbreakingly sad or as joyful as she was singing [...] "Papa Don't Preach". Reviewing the episode [...] "Journey to Regionals", Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich called Quinn's birthing scenes—interspersed with Vocal Adrenaline performing Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody"—both [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "terrible". He wrote, [...] "If nothing else, it was definitely the most visually arresting way to represent the birthing process I've ever seen outside of The Miracle of Life. But I kind of liked it. Somewhere, Freddie Mercury is nodding proudly, and saying, 'World, <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>you</b> for We Will Rock You.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lutherans {{differ from}} other Protestants as they {{practice}} [...] "confession and absolution" [...] (in two forms). They, like Roman Catholics and many Anglicans, see [...] and [...] as biblical evidence for confession. The first form of confession and absolution is {{done at the}} Divine Service with the assembled congregation (similar to the Anglican tradition). Here, the entire congregation pauses {{for a moment of}} silent confession, recites the confiteor, and receives God's forgiveness through the pastor as he says the following (or similar): [...] "Upon this your confession and in the stead and by the command of my Lord Jesus Christ, <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>you</b> all your sins {{in the name of the}} Father and of [...] the Son and of the Holy Spirit." ...|$|E

6000|$|SHE: [...] "Nonsense! Then <b>I</b> should <b>forgive</b> <b>you</b> without thinking." [...] After {{a season}} of reflection: [...] "No, <b>I</b> CAN'T <b>forgive</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> never could <b>forgive</b> eavesdropping. It's TOO low." ...|$|R
2500|$|The second form of {{confession}} and absolution {{is known as}} [...] "Holy Absolution", which is done privately to the pastor (commonly only upon request). Here the person confessing (known as the [...] "penitent") confesses individual their sins and makes an act of contrition as the pastor, acting in persona Christi, announces this following formula of absolution (or similar): [...] "In the stead and by the command of my Lord Jesus Christ <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>you</b> all your sins {{in the name of}} the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." [...] In the Lutheran Church, the pastor is bound by the Seal of the Confessional (similar to the Roman Catholic tradition). Luther's Small Catechism says [...] "the pastor is pledged not to tell anyone else of sins to him in private confession, for those sins have been removed.|$|E
2500|$|Adalgisa tells Norma she {{has fallen}} in love with a Roman, whom she does not name. As she {{describes}} how she fell in love while waiting at the temple and seeing [...] "his handsome face" [...] appear, Norma recalls (as an aside) her own feelings for Pollione ("my passions, too, burned like this"), and more and more, their experiences of falling in love run parallel: (Norma and Adalgisa, duet: Sola, furtiva al tempio / [...] "Often I would wait for him, At the temple, alone and in secret"). Adalgisa pleads for help and forgiveness, and Norma pledges that she will do that and will also free her from her vows as a priestess: (Norma: Ah! sì, fa core, abbracciami, Perdono e ti compiango / [...] "Yes, take heart, embrace me. <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>you,</b> and sympathise with you". Adalgisa: Ripeti, o ciel, ripetimi / [...] "Say that again, heavens, say again, Such wonderful words: Through you my long suffering is calmed.") ...|$|E
