5|$|Things {{changed in}} the early 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 Minuteman {{missiles}} and 54 Titan IIs. This meant that the Air Force could not respond to new Soviet missiles simply by building more of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions {{about the need for}} any ground-based ICBM. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> force was going to carry out this mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet attack for a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance.|$|E
5|$|Five SAO Krajina police {{officers}} were prosecuted by Knin District Court in 1992 {{for the murder of}} the Rakić family. The investigation was spurred on by requests from relatives of the victims, who threatened the RSK authorities that they would notify the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) unless the RSK authorities continued searching, which led Đuro Kresović, president of Knin District Court to write to the Minister of the Interior of the RSK asking for instructions on how to proceed, stating that any attempt to retrieve the bodies of the Rakić family would uncover numerous other bodies in the Golubnjača Pit. He requested instructions on how to proceed with the investigation and what to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> UNPROFOR found out about the bodies in the pit. Even though the RSK investigation was completed, trial of those suspected of involvement in the murders did not begin before 2010 in Belgrade. The trial and the appeals process were concluded in 2013, resulting in four convictions: Čedo Budisavljević was sentenced to thirteen years in prison, while Mirko Malinović, Milan Bogunović and Bogdan Gruičić were sentenced to twelve, ten, and eight years in prison respectively.|$|E
5|$|Kasche had not {{received}} a reply to his telegram of 17 March, so he sent a further telegram to von Ribbentrop on 26 March. In it he advised that two Partisan representatives had arrived in Zagreb for negotiations, and named them using their aliases. He {{pointed out that the}} Partisan interest in an armistice had increased, and emphasised that he considered this a significant development. By this time, Đilas and Velebit had returned to Zagreb, where they reiterated that the Partisans wanted recognition as a regular belligerent, and emphasised the futility of continued fighting. They effectively asked to be left alone to fight the Chetniks. According to Pavlowitch, it is not clear which side posed the question of what the Partisans would <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> British were to land in Yugoslavia without Partisan authorisation, but Đilas and Velebit said they would fight them as well as the Germans. They stated that their propaganda had been slanted towards the Soviet Union because {{they did not want to}} communicate with London. Their determination to fight the British if they landed was because they believed that the British would try to thwart their objective of seizing power in Yugoslavia. They further stated that the Chetniks would not fight the British because such a landing was exactly what they were waiting for.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} threatened another dissolution if {{the bill}} for the Parliament Act were not passed, and followed through on their threat when opposition in the Lords did not diminish. The general election of December produced little change from January. The calling of a second dissolution of parliament now {{seems to have been}} contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, was asked if he would be prepared to create sufficient peers, which he would only <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King did, however, demand that the bill would have to be rejected at least once by the Lords before his intervention. Two amendments made by the Lords were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led Asquith to declare the King's intention to overcome the majority in the House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in the Lords by 131 votes to 114 votes, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.|$|E

25|$|Congress did {{not deal}} with the problem of what to do if a President were alive but {{incapacitated}} as Garfield was.

It was not until the Twenty-fifth Amendment was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> president became incapacitated.|$|E

25|$|A new {{signal was}} {{introduced}} instructing squadron commanders to act independently as they thought best while still supporting the main fleet, particularly for use when circumstances {{would make it}} difficult to send detailed orders. The description stressed that this was not intended to be the only time commanders might take independent action, but was intended to make plain times when they definitely should. Similarly, instructions on what to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away {{with the rest of the}} fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer's destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy.|$|E
25|$|The {{moratorium}} on commercial whaling led Iceland to withdraw in protest from IWC, {{as it had}} threatened to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> moratorium was extended. Both Japan and Norway also threatened to leave the organisation. In April 1992, the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) was established by the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, and Norway under the Agreement on Cooperation in Research, Conservation and Management of Marine Mammals in the North Atlantic. The document clearly responded to what the drafters regarded as inappropriate whale protectionist tendencies of the IWC. Guðmundur Eiríksson of Iceland stated at NAMMCO's inaugural meeting that the organisation was established in part out of dissatisfaction with the IWC's zero-catch quota. Although NAMMCO does not conflict directly with the obligations of membership states under the IWC, it nonetheless presented {{a challenge to the}} legitimacy of the IWC.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{mentions}} that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons {{as they had}} been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.|$|E

500|$|The Kriegsmarine (German navy) had {{at least}} three surface ships in the Loire estuary: a destroyer, an armed trawler and a Sperrbrecher (minesweeper), the latter being the guard ship for the port. On {{the night of the}} raid there were also four harbour defence boats and ten ships from the 16th and 42nd Minesweeper flotillas berthed in the basin, while two tankers were berthed inside the Normandie dock. [...] The 6th and 7th U-boat flotillas, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Georg-Wilhelm Schulz and Korvettenkapitän Herbert Sohler respectively, were permanently based in the port. It is not known how many submarines were present {{on the day of the}} raid. The submarine base had been inspected by the U-boat Commander in Chief, Vizeadmiral Karl Dönitz, the day before the raid. He asked what would they <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> base was subject to an attack by British Commandos. Sohler replied that [...] "an attack on the base would be hazardous and highly improbable".|$|E
500|$|Statements {{regarding}} Jesuit-encouraged plots against Queen Elizabeth {{were read}} to the court, {{as well as some}} of the plotters' confessions. Garnet defended his use of equivocation with his own treatise on the doctrine. He had denied his conversation with Oldcorne as it was a secret, but said that in matters of faith, equivocation could never be lawful. When asked by Salisbury what he would <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> pope excommunicated King James, he [...] "denied to answer". His defence of equivocation was scorned by Coke, who called it [...] "open and broad lying and forswearing". [...] As for Tesimond's confession, the planned assassination had not at that point happened and so Salisbury said that Garnet could easily have alerted the government. [...] Salisbury attacked the idea that it had ever been made under the seal of the confessional, and claimed anyway that Garnet could have warned the authorities after his more ordinary conversation with Catesby about the death of innocents; the priest replied by saying that at the time, he did not understand the relevance of Catesby's questions. The Earl of Northampton said, in Latin, [...] "quod non-prohibet cum potest, jubet" [...] (what a man does not forbid when he can, he orders). Garnet's defence, that he had forbidden Catesby from proceeding, was futile.|$|E

500|$|Although the State Opening of Parliament {{was planned}} for February 1605, {{concern over the}} plague delayed it until 3October. A {{contemporaneous}} government account has the plotters engaged in digging a tunnel beneath Parliament by December 1604, but no other evidence exists to prove this, and no trace of a tunnel has since been found. If the story is true, the plotters ceased their efforts when the tenancy to the undercroft beneath the House of Lords became available. Several months later, early in June 1605, Catesby met the principal Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet, on Thames Street in London. While discussing the war in Flanders, Catesby asked about the morality of [...] "killing innocents". Garnet said that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account during a second meeting in July he showed Catesby {{a letter from the}} pope which forbade rebellion. Catesby replied, [...] "Whatever I mean to <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Pope knew, he would not hinder for the general good of our country." [...] Father Garnet's protestations prompted Catesby's next reply, [...] "I am not bound to take knowledge by you of the Pope's will." [...] Soon after, Father Tesimond told Father Garnet that while taking Catesby's confession he had learned of the plot. Father Garnet met with Catesby a third time on 24July at White Webbs in Enfield Chase, the home of Catesby's wealthy relative Anne Vaux, and a house long suspected by the government of harbouring Jesuit priests. Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, the priest tried in vain to dissuade Catesby from his course.|$|E
