5|$|Six months later, Barbree joined NBC as a {{part-time}} space program reporter, eventually moving up to full-time. Over the years, Barbree had been offered the opportunity to move to Washington, D.C., or New York City, but he turned <b>down</b> <b>every</b> offer, preferring to stay and report on what had quickly become his passion, spaceflight.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy <b>down</b> <b>every</b> play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1949 Street & Smith, {{one of the largest}} pulp publishers, had shut <b>down</b> <b>every</b> one of their pulps. This format was dying out, though it took several more years before the pulps {{completely}} disappeared from the newsstands. Both Thrilling Wonder and Startling went quarterly in 1954, {{and at the end of}} that year Mines left. The magazines did not survive him for long; only two more issues of Thrilling Wonder appeared, both edited by Alexander Samalman. After the beginning of 1955, Thrilling Wonder was merged with Startling, which itself ceased publication at the end of 1955.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon) discovers a {{communication}} burst {{coming from the}} North Sea, believing a Russian submarine is entering British waters unannounced {{to carry out a}} mission. After learning that Alexander Beletsky (Georg Nikoloff), a man with connections to Kachimov, is going to shut down his company's servers, Malcolm confirms his suspicions; the Russians are planning a cyber attack against Britain by breaking into a submarine communications cable and shutting <b>down</b> <b>every</b> computer system in the country. Harry urges Dolby to temporarily shut down the Internet, but is once again denied. Later, Ros breaks into Lucas' flat while he is away, and discovers Lucas is a double agent, feeding the Russians news that MI5 know about their planned attack. Ros tasers Lucas and brings him back to Thames House. Lucas admits he is spying for the Russians because Kachimov promised he would be released from prison sooner if he would, but also reveals he intends to bring Kachimov down by making him trust Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} music career took off, began {{receiving}} offers for acting roles. He turned <b>down</b> <b>every</b> request until 1994, {{when he was}} offered a bit part in the star-studded comedy film Maverick. Although the part required very little actual acting, after the movie's release Black received {{an increasing number of}} calls from directors who thought he would be perfect for a particular role. Black has appeared in several television shows, including Wings and The Larry Sanders Show. He has since starred in the 1998 television film, Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack, based on the rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of double murders in Haughton, Louisiana in 1967. Lisa Hartman Black portrayed Ponder I. Favor, Jack's wife. Black had a major role in another television movie Going Home, and appeared briefly in the 2003 film Anger Management.|$|E

25|$|In August 1913, Jupiters trials almost ended {{before they}} began. While {{underway}} off the coaling station in Tiburon, California {{in preparation for}} its shakedown cruise, Jupiter took evasive action to avoid an accidental collision with a passing submarine. During the sudden maneuver, a fuse on the main electrical panel blew, shutting <b>down</b> <b>every</b> piece of machinery on the ship, including its steering. With only four minutes before the ship would run aground, Robinson restored power; Jupiter got underway with 30 seconds to spare.|$|E
25|$|Orr {{attempts}} {{to escape the}} war in two main ways. His first {{goal is to get}} a whore to knock him unconscious, so that he can be grounded. When this fails, Orr plans to crash land in the sea and make his way to a neutral country where he can wait out the war. Orr practices this second goal by getting shot <b>down</b> <b>every</b> mission he flies, and so becomes an expert in crash landings, without losing a single crewman.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} {{the sheer number of}} dams in the project, more than would at first appear needed, is maintenance. Dams need to be cleaned from the debris carried with the water flow. After a while the dam becomes {{obsolete}} as water flow slows down to inadequate levels. The dams will be shut <b>down</b> <b>every</b> 5 to 10 years for fall maintenance (also called fall cleanup). Water levels are normally lowest in fall. The extra dams are placed in service during this maintenance period.|$|E

In the 1941 origin story and in Tales of Suspense #63, Kruger dies when running into machinery but is not killed by Rogers; in the Captain America #109 and #255 revisions, Rogers causes the spy's death by punching him into machinery.|$|E
25|$|After {{putting his}} title {{defenses}} on hold {{due to an}} injury, Rutten returned to the ring in a rematch against Maurice Smith. Overwhelmed by Rutten's strikes, Smith opted for taking him <b>down</b> <b>every</b> time possible, but Rutten ended up performing a half guard sweep into a rear naked choke for the tap out. His next time would be against the man he debuted against in Pancrase, Ryushi Yanagisawa, {{and this time the}} match lasted 27:35. Despite breaking his hand during the match, Rutten scored three consecutive submissions through the affair before ending it with another rear naked choke.|$|E

After a falling-out between YouTube and Warner Music Group in early 2009, Warner pulled <b>down</b> <b>every</b> video on YouTube that contained any of their material. This included a complete purging of Madonna's YouTube account and all her videos, including the official music video to 4 Minutes as well as Madonna's message to YouTube. However, because Corey's claim had legally won in 2008, {{they were unable to}} remove his video. It currently has over 4 million views. Madonna’s response video has since been restored.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} lack of linguistic information on Genie from the previous six months left some ambiguities about the rate and timeline of Genie's early vocabulary and grammar acquisition. Curtiss and Fromkin quickly decided that Genie's linguistic abilities were not yet at a usefully testable level, so {{for the rest of}} Genie's stay at Children's Hospital Curtiss met with her almost every day for observations. They soon realized existing linguistic tests would not yield meaningful results, so although they also incorporated a few existing tests, including the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, into their exams, they designed a set of 26 new tests from which they extrapolated most of their data. Curtiss also wrote <b>down</b> <b>every</b> spontaneous utterance she heard from Genie, ultimately recording approximately a few thousand.|$|E
25|$|Lagrange was a {{favourite}} of the king, {{who used}} frequently to discourse {{to him on}} the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson went home, and thenceforth Lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines, and found by experiment the exact amount of work which he was able to do without breaking <b>down.</b> <b>Every</b> night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or in the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them, and usually wrote them straight off without a single erasure or correction.|$|E

25|$|The NGO Human Rights First {{claimed that}} over 90% {{of the light}} weapons {{currently}} being imported by Sudan and used in the conflict are from China. Human rights advocates and opponents of the Sudanese government portray China's role in providing weapons and aircraft as a cynical attempt to obtain oil, just as colonial powers once supplied African chieftains with the military means to maintain control as they extracted natural resources. According to China's critics, China threatened to use its veto on the U.N. Security Council to protect Khartoum from sanctions {{and was able to}} water <b>down</b> <b>every</b> resolution on Darfur in order to protect its interests. Accusations of the supply of weapons from China, which were then transferred to Darfur by the Sudanese government in violation of the UN arms embargo, continued in 2010.|$|E
25|$|According to Pasternak, {{during the}} 1937 show trial of General Iona Yakir and Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, the Union of Soviet Writers {{requested}} all members to add {{their names to}} a statement supporting {{the death penalty for}} the defendants. They demanded Pasternak's signature as well, but he refused to give it. Vladimir Stavski, the chairman of the Union, was terrified that he would be punished for Pasternak's dissent. The leadership of the Union travelled to Pasternak's dacha at Peredelkino and severely threatened the writer, who refused to sign the statement and returned to his dacha. Hearing this, Zinaida Pasternak, who was pregnant, was terribly upset, accusing him of risking the destruction of their family. Pasternak went to bed. He and Zinaida expected to be arrested that evening. They later learned that an NKVD agent was hiding in the bushes outside their window and wrote <b>down</b> <b>every</b> word they said to each other.|$|E
25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown <b>down</b> <b>every</b> {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E
