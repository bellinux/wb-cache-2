60|$|He {{took out}} the morocco case, opened it, {{and looked at the}} photograph. 'I wonder?' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|E

60|$|Charley {{began to}} consider. 'Westminster Abbey,' <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'In that {{chest is}} the crown that has waited {{for you for}} many years,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'and <b>at</b> <b>last</b> you have come for it.' And he stooped down to unlock the box.|$|R
6000|$|Lawyer Watson sat {{opposite}} his {{old friend}} for some moments in thoughtful silence. [...] "The child is impossible." [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I admit," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "that I admire your daughter; but she spurned my advances, and we parted {{yesterday}} forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{congratulate you}} on your engagement," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> looking up with a face that seemed to Bernard hard and unnatural.|$|E
6000|$|The ostler hesitated, {{and glanced}} at the others to reply. [...] "There ARE folks," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> lazily, <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "ez beleeves that Hennicker ain't much better nor the crowd we're hunting; but they don't say it TO Hennicker. We needn't let on what we're after." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Snooks," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> very moodily, [...] "remove this d---- mutton, give me {{my writing}} things, and some hot brandy-and-water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This unfortunate affair, Mr. Ducaine," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{looking up}} <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "remains of course between {{ourselves}} and Ray--and the woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Nam-Bok," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> {{and at the}} {{conviction}} in his voice the women wailed apprehensively and drew farther away.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{manuscript}} {{to which}} you refer," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "was stolen from my study at Martinhoe under somewhat peculiar conditions." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick {{buried his}} face in his hands. [...] "God forgive me," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> [...] "I cannot hate her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Meantime {{the other}} lay back upon the {{cylindrical}} bolsters, looking thoughtfully at him. [...] "How old art thou?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose,' <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> {{speaking}} very excellent French, 'that you are {{not able}} to suggest a rhyme for the word Covilha.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "since {{you will}} have it, I'll give you what Bob Thorogood has named:--THE SCHOOLBOY'S STORY.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wentworth {{maintained}} {{for a while}} a silence more expressive than a deep-drawn sigh. [...] "You have no children," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, nay!' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> 'You did not {{understand}} the boy. A freeman was a little hurt, by pure mischance, at the hunting.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “How funny,” <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> {{with the}} utmost seriousness, and was making for the door, when the voice of his friend stopped him.|$|E
6000|$|... "So," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "my {{dreams are}} over; {{prospects}} gone; hopes collapsed--all vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no toast I {{would more}} gladly drink," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "if I {{considered}} it availing. But--alas--you propose it over-late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{the roof}} doesn't give way," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> calmly <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> when <b>he</b> {{returned}} {{once more to}} her, [...] "and if we can only let them know we're alive in the tunnel, they may possibly dig us out before we choke. There's air enough here for eighteen hours for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Smithson sat {{staring at}} him. [...] "I heard," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> with an effort... "I heard that Digson was paying her attentions." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her husband swallowed. [...] "You—you don’t {{understand}} ’ow {{these things}} are done," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> [...] "It takes time. We ought to ne—negotiate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good God,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> 'what {{is there}} in the man {{that he should have}} made you forget love and honour and common decency!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course not,' <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> half unconsciously. And then, {{in sudden}} dread of having {{committed}} himself, {{he looked up}} fiercely at the Jew.|$|R
6000|$|The Inspector stared {{about him}} in bewilderment. [...] "Oh, come now, Mr. Holmes," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "I'm sure you don't really mean to--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have given}} {{yourself}} away, Burger!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> [...] "Your words can only apply to one thing. You {{have discovered a}} new catacomb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even {{if nothing}} new appears," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "the mere beating down and discrediting of the militarist system leaves a world released...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{leave it}} to me. I'll {{see to it that}} {{something}} happens to him," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> with calm ferocity. Lingard smiled faintly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} was inevitable," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> [...] "You were bound to accept the highest bidder. When {{are you going to}} marry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have spoken}} her name," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> in an altered and tremulous tone; [...] "tell me, now, {{all that you}} know of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sirrah," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> with a {{shade of}} impatience, [...] "hast thou naught to say? Meseems thou takest {{all this with}} marvellous coolness." ...|$|R
6000|$|He breathed heavily {{while he}} devoured his food. [...] "It's a middlin' goodish way you've come," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> [...] "Likely the stage left yesternight." ...|$|R
