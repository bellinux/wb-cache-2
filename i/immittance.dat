This paper focuses on some possible refinements of such 1 D wave propagation models, {{especially in the case}} of smooth horns. Four key points are examined: a refined curvilinear 1 D horn equation, the smooth connection of constant-flared acoustic pipes, a radiation model consistent with spherical wavefronts, the effect of visco-thermal losses at the wall. They allow to define a complete model, from which a standard matrix formalism is recovered, as for plane or spherical waves. The comparison with measurements shows that each of these refinements proves relevant, making one-dimensional models useful and efficient even for the quite sensitive case of brass instruments.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{addresses}} the computation of acoustics <b>immittances</b> of axisymmetric waveguides, {{the shape of}} which is C 1 -regular (i. e. continuous and with a continuous derivative {{with respect to the}} space variable). With this intention, a refined version of the "Webster" horn equation is considered, namely, the "Webster-Lokshin equation with curvilinear abscissa", as well as simplified models of mouthpieces and well-suited radiation impedances. The geometric assumptions used to derive this uni-dimensional model (quasi-sphericity of isobars near the wall) are weaker than the usual ones (plane waves, spherical waves or fixed wavefronts). Moreover, visco-thermal losses at the wall are taken into account. For this model, exact solutions of the acoustic waves can be derived in the Laplace or the Fourier's domains for a family of parametrized shapes. An overall C 1 -regular bore can be described by connecting such pieces of shapes under the constrain that junctions are C 1 -regular. In this case and if the length of the bore is fixed, a description with N pieces precisely has 2 N+ 1 degrees of freedom. An algorithm which optimizes those parameters to obtain a target shape has been built. It yields accurate C 1 -regular descriptions of the target even with a few number of pieces. A standard formalism based on acoustic transfer matrices (deduced from the exact acoustic solutions) and their products make the computation of the input impedance, the transmittance (and other <b>immittances)</b> possible. This yields accurate analytic acoustic representations described with a few parameters. The paper is organized as follows. First, some recalls {{on the history of the}} "Webster" horn equation and of the modeling of visco-thermal losses at the wall are given. The "Webster-Lokshin model" under consideration is established. Second, the family of parametrized shapes is detailed and the associated acoustic transfer matrices are given. Third, the algorithm which estimates the optimal parameters of the C 1 -regular model of target shapes is presented. Finally, input impedances obtained using this algorithm (and the Webster-Lokshin model) are compared to measured impedances (e. g. that of a trombone) and to results of other methods based on the concatenation of straight or conical pipes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} the problem of {{simultaneous}} signal and noise match at the input port of low noise amplifiers; feedback LNAs are considered because previous works show that they can achieve the simultaneous match condition. The investigation analyses the influence of both parallel and series feedback elements on the amplifier. Matrices are used to describe signal and noise parameters of each component of the model - parallel admittance, series impedance, active device. This approach allows the analysis {{to be applied to}} a wide range of networks, as long as noise and signal matrices are available. For this reason, the results are not limited to active devices in the microwave region of the spectrum but they are applicable to any linear 2 -port circuit. The noise parameters of feedback networks are investigated thoroughly. Analytical expressions are worked out as functions of the feedback <b>immittances</b> and have been used to support experimental evidence previously published. A duality property for feedback networks is pointed out; new circles for constant equivalent noise resistance are devised; optimum values for the feedback impedance are determined; an investigation of a well-known noise model is carried out and its validity is extended. Based on the closed form expressions of the noise parameters, an original analytical procedure for the design of the optimum noise source reflection coefficient is presented. To the author's knowledge, no technique was available before. The design for simultaneous signal and noise match is now possible, because the input reflection coefficient can be set independently by properly choosing the load. Different devices are considered and their different behaviour is highlighted. A remarkable feature of the new design technique is to avoid the need of input matching when designing low noise amplifiers. Finally, experimental results are also presented and the performance of aI GHz single stage BJT LNA is shown. The fundamental achievement is that the noise figure of the LNA is equal to its minimum value within the measurement uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} work described in this dissertation was a explore available methods for the synthesis of networks from non-ideal elements and {{to find a new}} theory upon which a practically tractable synthesis procedure can be founded for circuits with arbitrarily distributed losses. Since the theory providing the basis for this novel design method turned out to be closely related to the insertion loss synthesis technique, a detailed explanation of the latter was required. It has been provided in Chapter I. Apart from some new derivations involving the relation between the form of the characteristic function and the circuit configuration, and the approximating synthesis procedure for filter-combinations, the fundamental theory described in the first chapter is available in the literature. The construction of realizable transfer functions for some practical requirements is treated in Chapter II. There the proof of the non-realizability of a quasielliptic response, some realizability-considerations involving elliptic filters, the Section on harmonic suppression filter-sets and the step-by-step design method for Chebyshev pass-band filters are original; the rest of Chapter II recapitulates existing theory. Chapter III provides a summary of miscellaneous analysis and synthesis methods which take into account the effects of non-ideal elements. The improved temperature-compensation procedure is new; the other results have been previously published. The derivations contained in Para. III. 2. c. have been worked out by the writer, at least one of them, however, probably duplicates Darlington's original (unpublished) calculations. The new synthesis method and its supporting theorems are described in Chapter IV. First, a large variety of formulae are obtained for the derivatives of various network parameters. These formulae are utilized in the derivation of the main theory; they are also directly applicable to circuit analysis. The formulae can be deduced from the determinant forms of the driving-point and transfer <b>immittances.</b> The effects of losses on the transfer characteristics are then studied indirectly by examining the changes in various parameters of the transfer function (natural frequencies, attenuation poles, proportionality factor) due to the added dissipation. Using series expansions, from the variation of these parameters the increment of the transfer function itself could be found to a first-order approximation. These results were used to find expressions, in which contributions of individual lossy elements to the distortion of the ideal characteristics were displayed. Even more important, they led to a relatively simple synthesis procedure allowing precorrection (often called predistortion) for the detrimental effects of individual losses. Since the calculations giving rise to the final formulae involve series expansions and terms containing powers of loss factors greater than unity are omitted, the accuracy decreases with increasing losses. Even for quality-factors in the order of 10, however, examples proved the results to be sufficiently exact for any practical purposes. Using some special properties of the lossy ladder-networks found {{in the course of this}} investigation the general expressions were simplified for this important configuration. For the import-art case of semi-homogeneous loss distribution (all coils have identical quality-factors, and so do all capacitors, but the quality-factors of the two groups differ), topological considerations were applied to achieve extremely compact formulae. Procedures to improve the accuracy for extreme cases (large losses, sharply changing response) have been developed; however these are seldom needed. Some alternative procedures applicable in special cases have also been derived. Finally, the theory was tested with excellent results by applying it to a large number of design problems, a representative cross-section of which has been included in Chapter IV to illustrate the simplicity and usefulness of the method...|$|R

40|$|D. Ing. Alternating current systems {{employing}} single-frequency sinusoidal waveforms render optimal service {{when the}} currents in that system are also sinusoidal {{and have a}} fixed phase relationship to the voltages that drive them. Under unity- power factor conditions, the currents are in phase with the voltages and optimal net-energy transfer takes place under minimum loading conditions, i. e. with the lowest effective values of current and voltage in the system. The above conditions were realised in the earlier years, because supply authorities generated 50 Hz sinusoidal voltages and consumers drew 50 Hz sinusoidal currents with fixed phase relationships to these voltages. Static and rotating electrical equipment like transformers, motors, heating and lighting equipment were equally compatible with this requirement and well-behaved AC networks were more the rule than the exception. The fact that three-phase systems conveyed {{the bulk of the}} power from one topographical location to the next did not constrain the utilisation of that concept at all, even though poly-phase transmission systems were necessary to increase the economy of transmission and to furnish non-pulsating power transfer. Also, additional theory had to be developed to handle unbalanced conditions in these multi-phase systems and to take care of complex network analysis and fault conditions. Difficulties begin to manifest themselves when equipment not meeting these requirements is connected to the network and when the currents it draws are not sinusoidal. An increasing number of applications demand DC-voltage supplies from which DC-currents are to be drawn. Because power transmission is carried out by means of AC networks, the DC is furnished by converting or rectifying the AC-supply. Power-electronic circuits, of which the R 2 P 2 power supplies the AEC employs are no exception, employ line-commutated AC/DC converters in their front-ends, and fall into that category. Although these line-commutated, phase-controlled AC/DC converters are capable of handling giga-watt power levels, line-frequency commutation causes the currents they draw on the AC-side to be distorted, even though still to be periodic. These non-sinusoidal currents, drawn from the source, along the transmission lines and through other distribution system <b>immittances,</b> also give rise to non-sinusoidal voltage drops between the source and the load, which results in distorted voltage waveforms at other nodes and at the load. Harmonic penetration studies are essential to evaluate the performance of transmission systems in the presence of current distortion sources. These sources do not only bring about voltage distortion within the confines of their own borders, but extend their influence outside into those of other consumers as well. Supplyutilities are wary of the distortion introduced into their networks by consumers and initial recommendations have now given way to rigid standards for curbing harmonic pollution by consumers Because conventional steady-state alternating current circuit theory fails in the presence of distortion there are only two ways in which harmonic penetration studies can be carried out. Numerical integration methods are mandatory in the study of transient performance of electrical networks during switching and similar occurrences, but become cumbersome when the networks contain more than just a few nodes and are impossible to use when several tens or hundreds of nodes are encountered. Fortunately, harmonic penetration studies can be confined to steady-state operating conditions in a network in which voltages and currents are distorted but remain periodic and are therefore Fourier transformable. When viewed in the frequency-domain, non-sinusoidal but periodic current and voltage waveforms can be represented by discrete frequency spectra. Frequency-domain analysis offers a number of advantages. From the frequency-domain point of view, distortion can be quantified in terms of complex phasor values of voltages and currents at discrete harmonic frequencies that individually lend themselves to conventional circuit theory, permitting calculations to be carried out in extensive networks. Solutions that apply to these individual harmonic frequencies can then be summated across the spectrum to furnish aggregate or joint parameters of currents, voltages and powers and can also be transformed back into the time-domain for the reconstruction of the relevant time-dependent waveforms. Both the frequency and time-domain waveforms, of voltage and current, constructed in the above manner are concise and convey the same numerical information. When attempting, however, to quantify the circuit behaviour in terms of the classical definitions of active, reactive and apparent power, it is soon discovered that different definitions are possible. The different definitions, unfortunately, lead to divergent results and it is impossible to assess the utility of each different theory on a general basis. Only by applying the different theories in dedicated measurements, can their relative worth be established in terms of specific circumstances. That is the main theme of this dissertation...|$|R
