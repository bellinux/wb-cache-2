The nucleotide sequence {{analysis of a}} HincII-HincII 3129 bp fragment was performed showing that the FXII promoter region contains neither CAAT and TATA regulatory elements, nor <b>GC</b> <b>islands,</b> but revealing the presence of two tandemly repeated sequences in opposite orientation, two LF-A 1 elements typical of the liver specific genes and one estrogen responsive element, that substantiates the observation of Factor XII gene modulation by estrogens...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} pulsed-field gel {{electrophoresis}} to study the short arm of the Y chromosome by using a pseudoautosomal probe (MIC 2 Y) and adjacent Y-specific sequences 27 a and 47 z (DSXY 5) in XX males and XY females, in order to detect chromosomal breakpoints which may {{have given rise to}} these individuals. The preliminary published long-range restriction map was used as a basis for this study. Our data confirm the reported fragment sizes and resolve some discrepancies. In addition, the recently cloned ZFY locus, pDP 1007, the putative sex-determining locus, has been used to extend this long-range restriction map on Yp. Thus far, the X and Y copy of this sequence appear to have conserved <b>GC</b> <b>islands</b> around this locus, since it is found on a 280 -kb fragment in males and females by using SacII, BssHII, NarI, and NotI. Only two Y-specific sequences of 50 and 70 kb have been detected at the pulsed-field level by using SfiI and NaeI, respectively. No translocation breakpoints have been detected in any of the patients studied. One XX male, GM 1889, however, does not have any of the Y-specific fragments detected using conventional or {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}}. This {{is one of the few}} typical XX males who therefore does not have the ZFY copy of the TDF clone. Since all the other XX males hybridized to 47 z, which is centromeric to ZFY, a series of DNA loci that are centromeric to 47 z need to be studied in order to detect chromosomal breakpoints...|$|E

40|$|Five {{avirulence}} {{genes from}} Leptosphaeria maculans, the causal agent of blackleg of canola (Brassica napus), {{have been identified}} previously through map-based cloning. In this study, a comparative genomic approach was used to clone the previously mapped AvrLm 2. Given {{the lack of a}} presence-absence gene polymorphism coincident with the AvrLm 2 phenotype, 36 L. maculans isolates were resequenced and analysed for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in predicted small secreted protein-encoding genes present within the map interval. Three SNPs coincident with the AvrLm 2 phenotype were identified within LmCys 1, previously identified as a putative effector-coding gene. Complementation of a virulent isolate with LmCys 1, as the candidate AvrLm 2 allele, restored the avirulent phenotype on Rlm 2 -containing B. napus lines. AvrLm 2 encodes a small cysteine-rich protein with low similarity to other proteins in the public databases. Unlike other avirulence genes, AvrLm 2 resides in a small <b>GC</b> <b>island</b> within an AT-rich isochore of the genome, and was never found to be deleted completely in virulent isolates...|$|R
50|$|Known as utilitarianism, {{and later}} as {{philosophical}} radicalism, it promoted the idea of democracy and individual liberty. This philosophy sponsored {{the idea of the}} trusteeship, i.e., that new territories would be considered trusts, and would receive all the benefits of British liberalism. These philosophical abstractions were put into practical use with the recommendations of a commission, led by W.M.G. Colebrooke and C.H. Cameron. Their Colebrooke Report (1831-32) was an important document {{in the history of the}} <b>island.</b> <b>G.C.</b> Mendis, considered by many to be the doyen of modern Sri Lankan history, considers the Colebrooke-Cameron reforms to be the dividing line between the past and present in Sri Lanka.|$|R
40|$|CpG <b>islands</b> are <b>GC</b> rich {{sequences}} {{that are}} found in the promoters of many genes in higher eukaryotes. They contain a high frequency of CG dinucleotides, which are substrates for DNA methylases. Methylation leads to transcriptional silencing of promoters. Owing to their high <b>GC</b> content CpG <b>islands</b> exhibit strong base–base interactions, which lead to superstructures and consequently to regions with higher melting temperatures. Therefore, Taq polymerases (especially sequenases) fall off their templates, causing premature termination of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or sequencing reactions. The results from such reactions are thus insufficient for further analysis. Therefore, we have evaluated the use of 7 -deaza- 2 `-deoxyguanosine for PCR amplification of the human p 16 INK 4 A promoter and sequencing of HUMARA exon 1 PCR products. Our results show that the addition of 7 -deaza- 2 `-deoxyguanosine significantly improves results, particularly when small amounts of poor quality DNA are available as starting material...|$|R
40|$|Positional cloning is a {{powerful}} method for the identifi-cation of genes. Using genetic and physical mapping methods the genomic region within which a particular gene is located can relatively easily be narrowed down to a comparatively small area contained within cosmid, PAC or BAC clones. It is then a matter of identifying genes within these clones. Here we describe the appli-cation of a technique, which has been successfully used for the bulk purification of CpG islands from whole genomes, to the isolation of CpG island sequences from such clones. As CpG islands overlap transcription units {{they can be used}} to isolate full-length cDNAs for associated genes, either by probing cDNA libraries or by searching databases. CpG islands are linked with ∼ 60 % of human genes and because their isolation is independent of the expression profile of these genes this approach would complement other expression-based methods of gene identification. By applying this technique to a cosmid clone known to contain the PAX 6 gene we successfully isolated the CpG island for this gene along with other CpG island-like sequences. Closer examination revealed that an extensive genomic region around the 5 ′-end of PAX 6 is unusual with regard to methylation and <b>GC</b> content. CpG <b>island</b> sequences were also successfully isolated from a PAC clone carrying the MBD 1 gene. These included the complete CpG island containing the first exon and regulatory sequences from MBD 1...|$|R
40|$|The 20 – 25 m thick trachyphonolitic Ayagaures {{ignimbrite}} {{cooling unit}} [(AY); 11. 8 Ma] exposed over 250 km 2 (onshore volume ca. 4. 5 km 3 DRE) is the uppermost and most Voluminous cooling {{unit of the}} Middle Fataga Formation (MFF), part of the Fataga Group (ca. 13. 3 –ca. 9 Ma) on Gran Canaria (<b>GC),</b> Canary <b>Islands</b> (28 ° 00 ? N, 15 ° 35 ? W). Up to 19 flow units (named b–t) subdividing the AY have been identified {{throughout most of the}} area from proximally to the caldera wall to distally as far as 14 km away. Individual flow units were distinguished from each other and logged using mainly chemical criteria. Single and/or packages of flow units (A, B and C) are tentatively interpreted to correspond to compositionally distinct magma bodies erupted from the same magma reservoir. These source-controlled flow units are interpreted to reflect successive eruptive pulses during incremental subsidence of Tejeda caldera. We subdivided AY cooling unit into four welding facies. Tentative correlation with a major syn-ignimbrite turbidite drilled during ODP Leg 157 suggests a total DRE volume of N 50 km 3. The cooling unit as a whole becomes less evolved upwards as shown by major elements, trace elements and REE of bulk rock and phenocrysts. All phenocryst phases, dominantly sanidine–anorthoclase (up to 20 vol. %), with minor biotite, augite, titanite, haüyne and apatite, are unzoned and show an incremental compositional zoning in the stratigraphy. The shallow level parent magma reservoir is interpreted to have undergone strong mixing prior to starting its final compositional zoning in a thermodynamically equilibrated reservoir. Compositional zoning resulted in three main bodies. This compositional and physical layering may have been triggered by rapid growth of alkali feldspar and biotite throughout the erupted part of the magma chamber. Abundant titanite and haüyne phenocrysts in basal flow units and in a locally preserved, highly evolved fallout tephra are interpreted to reflect initial Evacuation of a small volume, highly fractionated cupola. AY represents the most evolved part of a large, partially evacuated magma reservoir. Progressive downward tapping of the reservoir is interpreted to have been Controlled by incremental caldera collapse. Absence of less evolved magmas suggests that the magma chamber was only partially evacuated. Incremental compositional zoning of the cooling unit, but unzoned phenocrysts and evacuation reversals show that mixing did not occur following initiation of alkali feldspar growth...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the distal half of the long arm of chromosome 21, the proximal half of approximately 20 megabases of DNA, including 21 q 11 – 21 bands, is low in <b>GC</b> content, CpG <b>islands,</b> and identified genes. Despite intensive searches, very few genes and cDNAs {{have been found in}} this region. Since the 21 q 11 – 21 region is associated with certain Down syndrome pathologies like mental retardation, the identification of relevant genes in this region is important. We used a different approach by constructing microdissection libraries specifically for this region and isolating unique sequence microclones for detailed molecular analysis. We found that this region is enriched with middle and low-copy repetitive sequences, and is also heavily methylated. By sequencing and homology analysis, we identified a significant number of genes/cDNAs, most of which appear to belong to gene families. In addition, we used unique sequence microclones in direct screening of cDNA libraries and isolated 12 cDNAs for this region. Thus, although the 21 q 11 – 21 region is gene poor, it is not completely devoid of genes/cDNAs. The presence of high proportions of middle and low-copy repetitive sequences in this region may have evolutionary significance in the genome organization and function of this region. Since 21 q 11 – 21 is heavily methylated, the expression of genes in this region may be regulated by a delicate balance of methylation and demethylation, and the presence of an additional copy of chromosome 21 may seriously disturb this balance and cause specific Down syndrome anomalies including mental retardation...|$|R
40|$|Seven linker histone H 1 {{variants}} {{are present}} in human somatic cells with distinct prevalence across cell types. Despite being key structural components of chromatin, {{it is not known}} whether the different variants have specific roles in the regulation of nuclear processes or are differentially distributed throughout the genome. Using variant-specific antibodies to H 1 and hemagglutinin (HA) -tagged recombinant H 1 variants expressed in breast cancer cells, we have investigated the distribution of six H 1 variants in promoters and genome-wide. H 1 is depleted at promoters depending on its transcriptional status and differs between variants. Notably, H 1. 2 is less abundant than other variants at the transcription start sites of inactive genes, and promoters enriched in H 1. 2 are different from those enriched in other variants and tend to be repressed. Additionally, H 1. 2 is enriched at chromosomal domains characterized by low guanine-cytosine (GC) content and is associated with lamina-associated domains. Meanwhile, other variants are associated with higher <b>GC</b> content, CpG <b>islands</b> and gene-rich domains. For instance, H 1. 0 and H 1 X are enriched at gene-rich chromosomes, whereas H 1. 2 is depleted. In short, histone H 1 is not uniformly distributed along the genome and there are differences between variants, H 1. 2 being the one showing the most specific pattern and strongest correlation with low gene expression. © 2014 The Author(s).
