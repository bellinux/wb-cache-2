6000|$|But {{one might}} take a horse to water----! <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> before her, but I couldn't make her look at it. [...] "How {{do you know what}} I mayn't, or may, have liked?" ...|$|E
60|$|Here I put out my {{hand and}} felt in the dust, and {{presently}} my fingers touched something. It was a human tooth, very yellow, but sound. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{and showed it to}} Ayesha, who laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] I said, {{throwing}} a blanket over my shoulders, {{for the air}} was chilly, [...] "now let us talk," [...] and taking the lantern which Hans had thoughtfully lighted, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and contemplated them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Act, by all means, now and always, {{when you}} have a chance," [...] I answered. [...] "But don't take things too hard, now or ever. Your long {{confinement}} makes you think the world better worth knowing than you are likely to find it. A man with as good a head and heart as yours has a very ample world within himself, and I am no believer in art for art, nor in what's called 'life' for life's sake. Nevertheless, take your plunge, and come and tell me whether you have found the pearl of wisdom." [...] He frowned a little, as if he thought my sympathy a trifle meagre. I shook him by the hand and laughed. [...] "The pearl of wisdom," [...] I cried, [...] "is love; honest love in the most convenient concentration of experience! I advise you to fall in love." [...] He gave me no smile in response, but drew from his pocket the letter of which <b>I</b> have spoken, <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and shook <b>it</b> solemnly. [...] "What is it?" [...] I asked.|$|R
60|$|We travell'd {{along the}} Sea-shore five Days together, the Weather {{exceeding}} hot, {{and did not}} doubt but we should so disguise ourselves as to be taken for Spaniards; but our better Fortune provided otherwise for us, for the sixth Day of our March we found a Canoe lying on the Shore with no one in her: We found, however, several Things in her, which told us plainly that she belong'd to some Englishmen who were on Shore; so we resolv'd to sit down by her and wait: By and by we heard the Englishmen, who were seven in Number, and were coming back to their Boat, having been up the Country to an Ingenio, where they had gotten great Quantities of Provision, and were bringing it down to their Boat which they had left on the Shore, (with the Help of five Indians, of whom they had bought it) not thinking there was any People thereabouts: When they saw us, not knowing who we were, they {{were just going to}} fire at us; when <b>I,</b> perceiving <b>it,</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> a white Flag as high as I could reach it, which was, in short, only a Piece of an old Linnen Wastcoat which I had on, and pull'd it off for the Occasion; upon this, however, they forbore firing at us, and when they came nearer to us, they could easily see that we were their own Countrymen: They enquir'd of us what we came there for; we told them, we had travell'd from Campeachy, where being tir'd with the Hardships of our Fortune, and not getting any Vessel to carry us where we durst go, we were even desperate, and cared not what became of us; so that had not they came to us thus happily, we should have put our selves into the Hands of the Spaniards rather than have perish'd where we were.|$|R
6000|$|An {{hour or more}} {{must have}} passed, when, putting the glass over her lips again, I saw no mark on <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> closer and closer. I dulled it accidentally with my own breath, and cleaned <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> over her again. Oh, Mary, Mary, the doctor was right! I ought to have only thought of you in heaven! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was," [...] {{he said in}} a matter-of-fact tone, [...] "a golden, {{transparent}} liquid. Very golden, like a warm-tinted Chablis. When {{water was}} added it became streaked and opalescent, with a kind of living quiver in it. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the light." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, I had to {{eat that}} {{precious}} thing up, every bit of it, before I sighted the reef, {{and some of the}} mouthfuls were beastly unpleasant. I left the third one alone. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the light, but the shell was too thick for me to get any notion of what might be happening inside; and though I fancied I heard blood pulsing, {{it might have been the}} rustle in my own ears, like what you listen to in a seashell.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{when the}} boat was about fifteen yards from the reef, on which crowds were standing, they began (why I know not) to shoot at us.-- (Another letter adds) 300 or 400 people on the reef, and five or six canoes being round us, they began to shoot at us.--I had not shipped the rudder, so <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> hoping it might shield off any arrows that came straight, the boat being end on, and the stern, having been backed into the reef, was nearest to them.|$|E
60|$|He {{did not ask}} by whom, {{for with}} his quick eye he {{perceived}} that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> in my hand.|$|R
60|$|The waiter {{brought the}} bottle, and Cronshaw <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the light.|$|R
60|$|He {{struck a}} match on his boot and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> against the wall.|$|R
60|$|I {{stretched}} my {{hand along}} the wall and I came upon a man's naked foot. It was as high as my face, and yet, so far as I could feel, {{it had nothing to}} support it. I staggered back in amazement. Then I took a tinder-box from my pocket and struck a light. At the first flash a man seemed to be floating in the air in front of me, and I dropped the box in my amazement. Again with tremulous fingers I struck the flint against the steel, and this time I lit not only the tinder but the wax taper. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and if my amazement was lessened my horror was increased by that which it revealed.|$|E
6000|$|My watch was a gold one--a naval chronometer: {{the inside}} of the case was {{burnished}} and bright. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> straight in the bright beams of the moon, and as Frank's face turned for a moment in the direction where I stood, or rather crouched under cover of the pinnacle, I flashed the light full in his eyes from the reflecting surface. Thank heaven! Thank heaven! he started and observed it. I signalled three rapid flashes for attention. Frank flashed me back, yes, from his own pocket mirror. My hands shook so that I could hardly hold the watch aright: but with tremulous fingers I managed somehow to spell out the words, [...] "Come quick. Bring sailors. Steal cautiously round the dark corner. There's foul play on. Kalaua means to make Kea leap into the crater as a bride to Pélé's son at the moment of totality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know I have an {{excessive}} objection to being watched. I have had nothing on hand lately, {{at any rate}} nothing that has come off, but I might have had, you know. Well, yesterday I was going down to see my man in the marshes, and {{to tell him that}} likely enough I should bring something down to him next week. I got out of the train at Tilbury, and, as you know, there are not a dozen houses anywhere near the station. Now, I have a habit of keeping my eyes open, and I saw a man sitting on an old boat. What called my attention particularly to him was that he was turned half round watching the entrance to the station as I came out. You can always tell whether a man is watching for someone, or whether he is merely looking generally in that direction, and this man was certainly watching for someone. The instant his eye fell upon me he turned round and stared at the river. The path to the public house lay just behind him. Now, it would be natural that hearing a footstep a man doing nothing would look round and perhaps say a word--ask the time, or something of that sort. Well, he didn't turn round. Now, it is my habit, and a very useful one, always to carry a glass of {{about the size of a}} folded letter in my pocket. Instead of going on to the public house I turned off from the path and walked away from the river. When I had got some little distance I took out my glass, and still walking along, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> so that I could see in it what was going on behind. The man was standing up, watching me. I put the glass in my pocket and dropped my handkerchief. I stooped down to pick it up, of course partly turning as I did so, and saw that he had instantly dropped into a sitting position again, with his back to me.|$|E
60|$|I rose, {{and taking}} a guinea-piece from my pocket, <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> before him.|$|R
60|$|I gave a pull. Ye gods! The tooth, was loose! Out {{it came on}} the instant. I was jubilant as <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> aloft in the forceps.|$|R
60|$|He swung round {{his little}} wallet as he spoke, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to view.|$|R
60|$|When {{the sponge}} was lit he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{to the mouth}} of the balloon.|$|R
6000|$|I gat some gear wi' mickle care, [...] <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> weel thegither; [...] But now it's gane, and {{something}} mair-- [...] I'll go {{and be a}} sodger! ...|$|R
6000|$|This pledge attentively I view'd, [...] And {{sparkling}} as <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> near, [...] Methought one {{drop the}} stone bedew'd, [...] And ever since I've lov'd a tear.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a {{difficult}} job. Pressing back the flesh with my finger, I succeeded, at last, in getting the hook under the bullet. This <b>I</b> <b>held</b> firmly against <b>it,</b> and to my delight felt, as I raised finger and hook together, that the bullet was coming. A few seconds later, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> triumphantly between my fingers.|$|R
60|$|I {{took her}} hand in mine, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{in the air above}} her head solemnly.|$|R
60|$|Harry {{stretched}} out one {{hand for the}} pistol, opened <b>it,</b> and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in the moonlight.|$|R
60|$|To {{give his}} {{argument}} more force, Reggie North took a sixpence {{from his pocket}} and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|The rector {{smiled and}} shook his head. Mr. Parr {{selected}} a diminutive, yellow cigar and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|When he {{was near}} the girl again he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and the light fell full on her face.|$|R
60|$|Lord Chelsford {{poured himself}} out {{a glass of}} wine, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the light for a moment.|$|R
60|$|The planter was {{the first}} to act; he sprang to the intruding missile, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to view.|$|R
60|$|The {{matter was}} {{discussed}} for a moment, and then Tom tied his handkerchief to {{a stick and}} <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|I took a {{glass of}} wine and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the light to show that my hand was steady.|$|R
60|$|Alison <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and {{displayed}} a large rusty stain across the palm {{and part of}} the back of it.|$|R
60|$|The {{sergeant}} {{went into}} his quarters and {{came out with a}} lantern. He <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and examined the horse.|$|R
60|$|He {{plucked a}} berry which chanced {{to be growing}} near his hand, as he spoke, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to view.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood for}} a long time, staring ahead. Slowly, {{he reached for the}} {{newspaper}} and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the light.|$|R
60|$|The child {{fished out}} {{a strip of}} folded paper from somewhere about her {{diminutive}} person, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to him.|$|R
