40|$|A {{study to}} find out the bird {{diversity}} at the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), Bhopal, was carried out over a period of nine months from July 2012 to March 2013. IIFM is located on a hill facing Bhadbhada barrage in Bhopal. Physiographically the area is classified as Vindhayan Hills. A total of 106 bird species belonging to 52 families were recorded during the study covering an area of about 93 hectares. The study area was divided into three major habitat types: open scrub, dry deciduous, and urbanized. Bird species were classified into eight feeding guilds: carnivore, ground <b>insectivore,</b> sallying <b>insectivore,</b> canopy and bark <b>insectivore,</b> nectar <b>insectivore,</b> general <b>insectivore,</b> frugivore and water birds. Of the total 106 species observed, 27 species were recorded as winter visitors. Density analysis was done using DISTANCE software and density was found out to be 32. 7 birds per hectare. Rank abundance curve was used for assessing species composition in different habitats and during different seasons. In terms of both richness and evenness, open scrub scored the highest rank (72 species, and most even distribution of species). Higher species richness with lower species evenness was recorded during winter season for all the habitats...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of spatial variation in river channels and habitats on the distribution of fish communities in the headwater streams of the Ja√∫ River System, a blackwater tributary of the Negro River. Collections and measurements were made in 34 headwater streams during the period of November- December, 1998. Fish were captured with fish traps and hand nets along standard reaches of two meanders. Data on benthic habitat structure, stream depth and width were collected along lateral transects in each sample reach. A total of 66 fish species from 24 families were collected and classified into seven trophic guilds: allocthonous <b>insectivore,</b> autochthonous <b>insectivore,</b> general <b>insectivore,</b> piscivore, detritivorous planktivore, detritivorous <b>insectivore</b> and insectivorous piscivore. Variations in the distribution and diversity of bottom substrates were important factors influencing fish community structures in these systems. Also, variation in stream size explained the observed variability in fish communities...|$|R

5|$|Recent {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} vampire bats arose from <b>insectivores,</b> which discount the frugivore, carnivore, and nectarivore hypotheses of origin.
