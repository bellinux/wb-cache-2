40|$|The {{power system}} {{has to deal with}} three main sources of {{uncertainty}}: demand uncertainty and load prediction errors, failure of power plants and uncertainty of wind. The growing share of wind and other intermittent generation sources in the European supply increases the uncertainty about power production in day-ahead and longer-term predictions. As EU member states increase the deployment of wind power and other intermittent renewable energy sources, the <b>intraday</b> and balancing <b>market</b> will gain more interest, as additional demand for reserve and response operations is needed. Hence, it becomes relevant to analyse the effect of wind power forecasting errors on intraday power prices. A higher forecast error will increase the need of <b>intraday</b> <b>markets</b> to balance out the oversupply or deficit of wind power on an hourly basis. This oversupply or deficit can be corrected though flexible hydropower plants; however the power price is highly influenced by the fluctuations in the reservoir level (Huisman et. al [2013]).

This paper analyzes the participation of renewable generators in the Spanish <b>intraday</b> <b>market.</b> First, {{the organization of the}} <b>intraday</b> <b>market</b> and the short-term market mechanisms influencing intraday trading are described. After that, day-ahead and <b>intraday</b> <b>market</b> prices, as well as intraday trading volumes, are used to study the behavior of market agents in the Spanish <b>intraday</b> <b>market.</b> Regarding renewable generators, the influence of support schemes on the behavior of these agents in the <b>intraday</b> <b>market</b> is also analyzed. This paper shows that the Spanish <b>intraday</b> <b>market</b> has effectively contributed to renewable generation balancing. Despite this, market distortions have incentivized some renewable generators to arbitrate between the day-ahead and intraday markets, giving rise to higher system costs. Based on the presented analysis, it is argued that these distortions need to be removed from short-term markets to incentivize market parties, especially intermittent generators, to reduce forecast errors over time, improving economic efficiency and avoiding the use of costly balancing actions performed by the System Operator. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

This paper presents a stochastic programming model to achieve optimal management taking into account price variation in day-ahead and <b>intraday</b> electricity <b>markets,</b> together with regulating reserve margins. In this model, first-stage decisions determine day-ahead energy purchases and sales and the upward and downward reserve margins committed. Second-stage decisions correspond to <b>intraday</b> <b>markets</b> and deal with reserve requirements and several possible scenarios for vehicle staying pattern. The design of the objective function prioritizes supplying energy to EV batteries while minimizing the net expected energy cost at the EV charging point. A case study describing a parking for 50 EVs is analyzed. The case includes household, commercial and mixed EV staying patterns with several intraday arrival and departure scenarios. Pure and hybrid EVs are included, taking into account their respective energy characteristics.

30|$|Secondly, due to {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} to the electricity market, an <b>intraday</b> <b>market</b> is considered between {{the closure of the}} day-ahead market and the beginning of energy delivery time to make it possible to take corrective actions. The <b>intraday</b> <b>market</b> is a trading floor with a planning horizon {{similar to that of the}} day-ahead market, where the retailer participates in order to make final adjustments to the energy previously traded for each period of the next day. Intermittency of power output for wind resources is strongly dependent on the magnitude of the time interval up to its realization. The <b>intraday</b> <b>market</b> takes place 10 – 60 minutes prior to energy delivery horizon; therefore, this market allows intermittent DG-owning retailer to incorporate into their offers the certainty gained on generation availability during the time interval between day-ahead market and energy delivery time by updating its production/consumption forecasts and hence, reducing the associated uncertainties. In addition, the retailer can modify its production/consumption pattern in response to unforeseen events, e.g. unexpected DG failures or sudden changes in clients’ behavior. In this study, the corrective actions in the <b>intraday</b> <b>market</b> are interpreted as second stage of stochastic programming approach.

Large amounts of wind power will have impacts on bulk power system markets and electricity prices.

However, experiences so far from Denmark, Germany, Spain, and Ireland are such that the average market prices have decreased because of wind power. This reduction may result in additional revenue insufficiency, which may be corrected with a capacity market, yet capacity markets are difficult to design.

This fall is interpreted as derived from the expected release of press communication from U. S. companies. While in U.
