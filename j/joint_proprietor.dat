50|$|In 1654, an English {{expedition}} {{under the}} command of Major General Robert Sedgwick captured the forts of Saint John, Port Royal, and the settlement of Penobscot adding Acadia to the British dominions. La Tour was taken prisoner to England, and it was not until 1656 that he was granted an audience with Oliver Cromwell to request the return of his property. Recognized as a baronet of Nova Scotia, as his father's heir, Cromwell granted his request on the condition that he accept English allegiance and pay both the amount he owed Boston merchants and the cost of the English garrison maintained at Saint John. In an effort to raise funds to cover these funds, he took on William Crowne and Colonel William Temple as <b>joint</b> <b>proprietors</b> of Acadia. Soon afterwards he sold his rights to his two partners, retaining {{only a small percentage of}} the profit. La Tour then retired to Cap de Sable (present-day Port La Tour, Nova Scotia), with his wife, where he died in 1666.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{research}} is litigation qualitate qua. Or, more accurately: the legal concept by which a person litigates on behalf of another person or other persons, thereby acting as a procedural party. This form of legal representation has surprisingly many applications. The ‘usual suspects’ are the trustee in bankruptcy, the guardian, and the parent litigating {{on behalf of the}} minor. Other applications include the group respresentative filing a class action claim on behalf of consumers, the copyright collecting agency litigating on behalf of the associated authors, the reciprocal mandate that the law bestows on <b>joint</b> <b>proprietors</b> and married couples as to the community property, some types of third party funding, … The Belgian doctrine tends to focus solely on the specific applications of this legal concept, bypassing the concept as such. This fragmented approach is not without risk. There is indeed a real threat of contradictions and inconsistencies, which in turn undermines legal certainty and transparency. Moreover, there seems to be doubt about the legal rules governing this form of litigation. Quite often, doctrine and case law refer to the substantive law rules on agency. However, these rules are not always easily applicable to the specific context of legal proceedings. The central aim of this research is to transcend the particular applications and to work out some degree of coherence. To what extent can a general procedural framework be created that encompasses the many manifestations of litigation qualitate qua? And how would that procedural framework relate to the general (substantive) rules on agency?status: publishe...|$|R

60|$|Charteris and Welch were conversing in {{the study}} of which they were the <b>joint</b> <b>proprietors.</b> That is to say, Charteris was talking and playing the banjo alternately, while Welch was deep in a book and refused to be drawn out of it under any pretext. Charteris' banjo was the joy of his fellows and the bane of his House-master. Being of a musical turn and owning a good deal of pocket-money, he had, {{at the end of the}} summer holidays, {{introduced}} the delights of a phonograph into the House. This being vetoed by the House-master, he had returned at the beginning of the following term with a penny whistle, which had suffered a similar fate. Upon this he had invested in a banjo, and the dazed Merevale, feeling that matters were getting beyond his grip, had effected a compromise with him. Having ascertained that there was no specific rule at St Austin's against the use of musical instruments, he had informed Charteris that if he saw fit to play the banjo before prep, only, and regarded the hours between seven and eleven as a close time, all should be forgiven, and he might play, if so disposed, till the crack of doom. To this reasonable request Charteris had promptly acceded, and peace had been restored. Charteris and Welch were a curious pair. Welch spoke very little. Charteris was seldom silent. They were both in the Sixth--Welch high up, Charteris rather low down. In games, Welch was one of those fortunate individuals who are good at everything. He was captain of cricket, and not only captain, but also the best all-round man in the team, which is often a very different matter. He was the best wing three-quarter the School possessed; played fives and racquets like a professor, and only the day before had shared Tony's glory by winning the silver medal for fencing in the Aldershot competition.|$|R
50|$|In July 1891, Taylor {{was ready}} for further {{business}} ventures elsewhere and he sold the School to two partners, Alfred Hall and Will Gosman, as <b>joint</b> <b>proprietors.</b> Enrolments declined once the Victorian land bubble unexpectedly burst in the early 1890s; by 1896-97 numbers had fallen to a meagre thirty-three boys and Mr Gosman had moved on, leaving Hall (affectionately known as the ‘Boss”, later the “Old Boss’) as the sole proprietor and headmaster {{for the next three}} decades, a school record. The straitened School was forced back to St. John’s in 1897, where in the following year nostalgic old boys met to form a club - there were only 363 potential members, but the formation of this social group was a testament to the affection that the School had already nurtured amongst its alumni. Affairs improved sufficiently by 1908 for another shift (the third in twenty-two years) to a more substantial Burke Road property just south of Rathmines Road and close to St Mark’s, a church that would become the School’s spiritual rock, destined to play a significant part {{in the life of the}} Camberwell Grammar to the present day. The Hall years laid the foundation of the modern Camberwell Grammar, a confident, friendly but focused institution that gradually grew in public estimation whilst many of its rival schools fell away. An Old Camberwell Grammarians’ Association was formed in 1910 to formalise that earlier club and by 1915 the School also had its own magazine, eventually known as the Grammarian, and Hall continued to guide his boys through the Great War (which claimed the lives of around forty of them) and into the 1920s, retiring in 1926, having sold his interest in the School to the Church of England. The School was now governed by a Council from 1 January 1926 and accordingly, Camberwell Grammar was declared to be an Anglican “Public School” at St Mark’s in May 1927, by which time it had a new headmaster, Dr M.A. Buntine and a new ‘mitre’ badge. The numbers were healthy, just short of 300 boys, but there was no avoiding the Great Depression and Buntine soon left for greener pastures in WA, disconsolate at the deteriorating physical condition of the Burke Road facilities. By 1933 the School was in danger of a rapid decline with many parents refusing to guarantee the return of their sons to these increasingly cramped and decrepit buildings. It was either move or perish, but the School was strapped for funds. A saviour appeared in the form of William Angliss, brother-in-law of a prominent Council member. In April 1934, Angliss, the ‘white knight’ of CGS, provided the funds for the purchase of the “Roystead” property of 7.5 acres, 52 Mont Albert Road as it then was, where the School now stands.|$|R

40|$|Described by Manning Clark as 'Australia's {{greatest}} native son', William Charles Wentworth led {{a life of}} firsts.

Together with John Abraham Heraud he was <b>joint</b> editor and <b>proprietor</b> of the New Monthly Magazine from 1 July 1839 to 26 May 1840, when he retired from the editorship, with permission 'to contribute two sheets of matter to each number of the magazine, retaining exclusive property in his own articles'. During the fourteen years of his home in London, Barham's most extensive literary undertaking was the preparation of a new edition of Jeremy Collier's Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain. The study of oriental languages kindled in him a great love for philology, and his intense spiritual aspirations led him to attempt to found a new form of religion, which he called [...] "Alism". He describes it as [...] the supreme central doctrine which combines and harmonizes all partial sections of truth in one divine universal system. After very prolonged and arduous researches at last discovered this supreme central doctrine, and gave it the name of Alism, a name derived from A, Al, or Alah, the most ancient and universal title of Deity in the Hebrew scripture. By Alism I therefore mean that eternal divinity, pure and universal, which includes and reconciles all divine truths whatsoever to be found in scripture or nature, in theology, theosophy, philosophy, science, or art.|$|R
