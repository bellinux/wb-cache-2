500|$|In September 1942, MacArthur {{decided to}} outflank Japanese {{troops on the}} Kokoda Trail by sending an American regimental combat team over the Owen Stanley Range. Two {{alternate}} means of crossing the mountains seemed possible. One, the Kapa Kapa Trail was known to climb to elevations above [...] and present formidable obstacles. The other, known as the Abau Trail held the possibility. Casey and Sverdrup took charge of investigating the Abau Trail. They reached Abau on 18 September. Casey explored the harbor, taking depth soundings from a native canoe. Sverdrup set out for Jaure with a party of one American, two Australians from the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, ten native police from the Royal Papuan Constabulary and 26 native carriers. After eight days on the trail, scaling heights of , Sverdrup concluded {{that it would not}} be practical for troops to traverse the route and turned back, reaching Abau on 3 October. Meanwhile Casey had concluded that the harbor was too shallow even for lighters. However, the trip was not a total loss, for Sverdrup had sighted a plateau north of the Owen Stanley Range that he believed could be suitable for airstrips, allowing troops to be flown across the Owen Stanley Range. His opinion was supported by Cecil Abel, a missionary who knew the area well, who recommended establishing an airstrip at Fasari in the Musa River valley. Abel was flown to Fasari to make a start on an airstrip on 11 October, while Sverdrup set out from Abau with 190 men, including Flight Lieutenant M. J. Leahy, an expert on Papua, who knew many of the tribal chiefs personally. They reached Fasari on 18 October. Abel had cleared the site by burning and all that remained was some stumping and <b>grubbing.</b> A DC-3 was able to land the next day on the strip, which became known as Abel's Landing. Sverdrup and Leahy set out on 20 October to explore further north and found another suitable airstrip site near the village of Embessa and Kinjaki, which Sverdrup had cleared. A message dropped by air instructed him to go to Pongani, where he found troops of Company C, 114th Engineer Battalion that had flown to Wanigela airstrip and had made their way to Pongani by travelling along the coast by boat. Sverdrup supervised the construction of Pongani airstrip. All three airstrips were soon in use. In December 1942, Sverdrup made a third trip, from the Australian base at Bena Bena through the Markham Valley to the vicinity of the Japanese base at Lae. On each expedition he submitted detailed reports on the possibility of construction in the area. Sverdrup was awarded the Silver Star. His citation read: ...|$|E

2500|$|This ballad {{is part of}} a {{group of}} ballads about Robin Hood that in turn, like many of the popular ballads {{collected}} by Francis James Child, were in their time considered a threat to the Protestant religion. Puritan writers, like Edward Dering writing in 1572, considered such tales [...] "'childish follye'" [...] and [...] "'witless devices.'" [...] Writing of the Robin Hood ballads after A Gest of Robyn Hode, their Victorian collector Francis Child claimed that variations on the [...] "'Robin met with his match'" [...] theme, such as this ballad, are [...] "sometimes wearisome, sometimes sickening," [...] and that [...] "a considerable part of the Robin Hood poetry looks like char-work done for the petty press, and should be judged as such." [...] Child had also called the Roxburghe and Pepys collections (in which some of these ballads are included) [...] "veritable dung-hills , in which only after a great deal of sickening <b>grubbing,</b> one finds a very moderate jewel.'" [...] However, as folklorist and ethnomusicologist Mary Ellen Brown has pointed out, Child's denigration of the later Robin Hood ballads is evidence of an ideological view he shared with many other scholars of his time who wanted to exclude cheap printed ballads such as these from their pedigree of the oral tradition and early literature. Child and others were reluctant to include such broadsides in their collections because they thought they [...] "regularized the text, rather than reflecting and/or participating in tradition, which fostered multiformity." [...] On the other hand, the broadsides are significant in themselves as showing, as English jurist and legal scholar John Selden (1584–1654) puts it, [...] "'how the wind sits. As take a straw and throw it up in the air; you shall see by that which way the wind is, which you shall not do by casting up a stone. More solid things do not show the complexion of the times so well as ballads and libels.'" [...] Even though the broadsides are cultural ephemera, unlike weightier tomes, they are important because they are markers of contemporary [...] "current events and popular trends." [...] It has been speculated that in his time Robin Hood represented a figure of peasant revolt, but the English medieval historian J.C. Holt has argued that the tales developed among the gentry, that he is a yeoman rather than a peasant, and that the tales do not mention peasants' complaints, such as oppressive taxes. Moreover, he does not seem to rebel against societal standards but to uphold them by being munificent, devout, and affable. Other scholars have seen the literature around Robin Hood as reflecting the interests of the common people against feudalism. The latter interpretation supports Selden's view that popular ballads provide a valuable window onto the thoughts and feelings of the common people on topical matters: for the peasantry, Robin Hood may have been a redemptive figure.|$|E

30|$|The soil-dwelling larvae {{of several}} Scarabaeidae species (white <b>grubs),</b> like the {{cockchafer}} (Melolontha melolontha) {{and the garden}} chafer (Phyllopertha horticola), are serious pests in European cultivated grassland, reducing grass yield and destroying the turf by root-feeding. Nevertheless, the factors responsible {{for the development of}} large <b>grub</b> populations and the associated damage risk are poorly understood. The objectives of the study were to survey <b>grub</b> densities in grassland sites with different damage histories and find correlations with environmental and management variables. Data on <b>grub</b> densities were collected at 10 farms in the eastern Austrian Alps in September and October 2011. At each farm, one recently damaged site (high risk) and one site at which <b>grub</b> damage had never been observed by the farmers (undamaged site[*]=[*]low risk; each site: 500  m 2) were sampled. All sites were dominated by P. horticola (99 % of 1, 422 collected individuals; maximum density 303 grubs/m 2), which indicates that <b>grub</b> damage there is mainly caused by that species. Recently damaged sites tended to higher <b>grub</b> densities than undamaged sites. However, 3 out of 10 undamaged sites harbored high <b>grub</b> populations as well. Humus content together with the depth of the A-horizon significantly explained 38 % of P. horticola <b>grub</b> density variance, with highest densities in deeper humus-rich soils. The risk of <b>grub</b> damage was positively connected to the humus content and negatively related to the cutting frequency. For the investigated mountainous grassland sites, these results suggest an important role of humus for the development of high <b>grub</b> densities and an effect of management intensity on <b>grub</b> damage.|$|R
30|$|Even {{though we}} {{considered}} various environmental and management parameters, the significant relationships with <b>grub</b> density were few and the correlations were weak. This suggests further unknown factors covering {{the relationship between}} <b>grub</b> density and the measured or recorded parameters, e.g. irregular fluctuations of <b>grub</b> populations due to predators, diseases or intraspecific competition (Milne 1984, Juen and Traugott 2007, Laznik et al. 2012). Humus content and cutting frequency might both affect <b>grub</b> density via their influence on soil temperature, a factor which is probably highly important for the soil-dwelling <b>grubs</b> (Laughlin 1964, 1957 a, Milne 1984). But soil temperature strongly depends from local weather, which might as well confound the relationship between actual <b>grub</b> densities and site characteristics.|$|R

They feed on the roots of seedling plants, causing them to wilt and die. True white <b>grubs</b> have a 3 -year life cycle and can reduce plant populations during 2 of these 3 years.
