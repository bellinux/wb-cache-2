5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in a solvent, it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solution.</b> As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals. Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is supersaturated and the solid compound nucleates.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this work}} {{the effect of}} {{electrolytes}} on hydrate formation was investigated. To do so, a new model was used in predicting the hydrate formation conditions in presence of both single and mixed <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions.</b> The new model {{is based on the}} van der Waals- Platteeuw hydrate equation of state. In order to evaluate the values for the activity of water in <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> the simplified version of the Ghotbi-Vera Mean Spherical Approximation (SGV-MSA) model was used. According to the SGV-MSA model the ions in the solutions are considered as charged hard spheres with different sizes. The values of the parameters for the SGV-MSA model are independent of temperature and depend only on the nature as well as concentration of electrolytes studied in this work. These parameters were obtained using the experimental data for the mean ionic activity coefficient of the single <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> at 298. 15 K. In the case of the mixed <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> a new mixing rule was introduced to obtain the activity of water in aqueous <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions.</b> The results show that the proposed model can predict the hydrate formation for the systems containing single or mixed <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> with good accuracy compared to the experimental data available in the literature. In addition, the results obtained from the proposed model were favorably compared with those obtained from the previously used models...|$|R
25|$|For <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solution</b> in {{a channel}} with a macro- or micro-scaled radius, surface charges {{at the wall}} attract counterions and repel co-ions due to {{electrostatic}} force. Therefore, an electrical double layer exists between the wall of channel and the solution. The dimension of the electrical double layer {{is determined by the}} Debye length in this system, which is typically much smaller than the channel radius. Most of the solution in the channel is electrically neutral due to the shielding effect of the electrical double layer.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem with}} Volta's {{batteries}} was short battery life (an hour's worth at best), which {{was caused by}} two phenomena. The first was that the current produced electrolysed the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solution,</b> resulting in a film of hydrogen bubbles forming on the copper, which steadily increased the internal resistance of the battery (this effect, called polarization, is counteracted in modern cells by additional measures). The other was a phenomenon called local action, wherein minute short-circuits would form around impurities in the zinc, causing the zinc to degrade. The latter problem was solved in 1835 by William Sturgeon, who found that amalgamated zinc, whose surface had been treated with some mercury, didn't suffer from local action.|$|E
25|$|The major {{disadvantage}} to the DSSC {{design is}} the use of the liquid electrolyte, which has temperature stability problems. At low temperatures the electrolyte can freeze, ending power production and potentially leading to physical damage. Higher temperatures cause the liquid to expand, making sealing the panels a serious problem. Another disadvantage is that costly ruthenium (dye), platinum (catalyst) and conducting glass or plastic (contact) are needed to produce a DSSC. A third major drawback is that the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solution</b> contains volatile organic compounds (or VOC's), solvents which must be carefully sealed as they are hazardous to human health and the environment. This, along {{with the fact that the}} solvents permeate plastics, has precluded large-scale outdoor application and integration into flexible structure.|$|E

Solidâ€“liquid equilibria of seven mixed electrolyte systems at 298. 15 K are successfully predicted using the modified MSA method with the parameters obtained from activity coefficient data of corresponding single <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions.</b> The total average absolute deviation between predicted and experimental values is 5. 58 %.

40|$|The {{removal of}} milk fouling {{deposits}} often requires {{the diffusion of}} <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> such as sodium hydroxide through a gel. Very often more than one single anion and one single cation are involved and thus the modelling of such diffusion requires a multicomponent description. Diffusion of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> through gels can be modelled using the Maxwell-Stefan equation. The driving forces for diffusion are the chemical potential gradients of ionic species and the diffusion potential, i. e., the electrostatic potential induced by diffusion of the ions. A model based on the Maxwell-Stefan equation was applied to <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> and <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> with a gel. When modelling the diffusion of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions,</b> the resulting equations {{were found to be}} a partial differential algebraic equation system with a differentiation index of two. The identification of this characteristic of the system enabled a solution method using the method of lines to be developed. When modelling the diffusion of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solutions</b> through a gel an explicit expression for diffusion potential was developed and hence the diffusion equations were solved. Numerical solutions were presented for a number of case studies and comparisons were made with solutions from literature and between different electrolyte systems. It was found that the results of diffusion of electrolytes were in good agreement with those of experiments and literature. In the case of diffusion of electrolytes through a gel, swelling of the gel was predicted. The model can be improved by adding thermodynamic factors and can be easily extended to multiple ion systems...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s it was {{discovered}} that illuminated organic dyes can generate electricity at oxide electrodes in electrochemical cells. In an effort to understand and simulate the primary processes in photosynthesis the phenomenon was studied at the University of California at Berkeley with chlorophyll extracted from spinach (bio-mimetic or bionic approach). On the basis of such experiments electric power generation via the dye sensitization solar cell (DSSC) principle was demonstrated and discussed in 1972. The instability of the dye solar cell was identified as a main challenge. Its efficiency could, during the following two decades, be improved by optimizing the porosity of the electrode prepared from fine oxide powder, but the instability remained a problem. A modern DSSC is composed of a porous layer of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, covered with a molecular dye that absorbs sunlight, like the chlorophyll in green leaves. The titanium dioxide is immersed under an <b>electrolyte</b> <b>solution,</b> above which is a platinum-based catalyst.
