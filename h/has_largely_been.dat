5|$|Calan Gaeaf, {{associated}} with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and Gŵyl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day).|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{hazardous}} nature of lead(II) nitrate, {{there is a}} preference for using alternatives in industrial applications. In the formerly major application of lead paints, it <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> replaced by titanium dioxide. Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, have declined or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for photothermographic paper, and in rodenticides.|$|E
5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location {{of many of these}} plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} days, the city's {{economic}} base comprised the lumber, railroad, and ranching industries. Today, that <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> replaced by tourism, education, government, and transportation. Some {{of the larger}} employers in Flagstaff are Northern Arizona University, the Flagstaff Medical Center, and the Flagstaff Unified School District. Tourism is a large contributor to the economy, as the city receives over 5 million visitors per year.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has {{an active}} program of {{organized}} amateur and professional sports. Tourism {{has become an}} important industry, especially in the Lake region. In the North Country, what had been an industrial area focused on mining and timber <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> transformed into a vacation destination. Popular interest in the environment and environmentalism, added to traditional interests in hunting and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience within driving range.|$|E
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E

5|$|Hollywood, a {{northern}} district of Los Angeles, California, {{is one of}} the leaders in motion picture production. The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Italy, Audisio's {{version of}} how Mussolini was {{executed}} <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> accepted and is uncontroversial. However, within Italy, the subject {{has been a}} matter of extensive debate and dispute since the late 1940s to the present and a variety of theories of how Mussolini died has proliferated. At least 12 different individuals have been identified at various times as being responsible for carrying out the shooting. Comparisons have been made with the John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories, and it has been described as the Italian equivalent of that speculation.|$|E
5|$|The Place de la Bastille still {{occupies}} most of {{the location}} of the Bastille, and the Opéra Bastille was built on the square in 1989 to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the storming of the prison. The surrounding area <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> redeveloped from its 19th-century industrial past. The ditch that originally linked the defences of the fortress to the River Seine had been dug out {{at the start of the}} 19th century to form the industrial harbour of the Bassin de l'Arsenal, linked to the Canal Saint Martin, but is now a marina for pleasure boats, while the Promenade Plantée links the square with redeveloped parklands to the east.|$|E

5|$|The Tri Nations {{was created}} between the SANZAR {{partners}} (along with the provincial Super 12 competition, now, Super Rugby). The tournament involves three southern hemisphere nations; Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The series {{was created to}} form a similar competition to the Six Nations Championship (then, the Five Nations). The first tournament was held in 1996, which New Zealand won. It has subsequently been held annually. The competition <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> dominated by New Zealand, who have won 10 championships, whereas Australia and South Africa have each won the series three times. New Zealand has won consecutive championships on three occasions (1996–97, 2002–03, and 2005–08) and Australia on one occasion (2000–01).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} organization into județe of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia (where {{they were}} termed ținuturi) {{dates back to}} at least the late 14th century. For {{most of the time}} since modern Romania was formed in 1859, the administrative division system has been similar to the French departments one. The system has been changed several times since then, and the number of counties has varied over time, from the 71 județe that existed before World War II to only 39 after 1968. The current format <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> in place since 1968 as only small changes have been made since then, the last of which was in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar (Panthera onca) {{is a big}} cat, a feline in the Panthera genus, and is {{the only}} extant Panthera species native to the Americas. The jaguar is the third-largest feline species after the tiger and the lion, and the largest in the Americas. The jaguar's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and {{northern}} Argentina. Though there are single cats now living within the western United States, the species <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Atlantic storms are {{becoming}} more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization, “recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions.” Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996–2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs. The most damaging single storm is the 1926 Miami hurricane, with $157billion of normalized damage.|$|E
5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenology is {{a method}} of inquiry that {{attempts}} to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world. This approach was first proposed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl, and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists. Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. In philosophy, phenomenology <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of intentionality ("aboutness"). In psychology, phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute {{in the early twentieth}} century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{ornamental}} woods {{within the}} grounds, Summercombe Wood and Luscombe Wood. Luscombe Wood covers an area {{south of the}} house, through the centre of which runs a private road known as The Terrace. The wood is made up primarily of deciduous trees, interspaced with laurels. It also includes an 18th-century pine plantation {{to the east of}} the woods. The north-west boundary of the woods is Haldon Lane and {{the other side of the}} road is Summercombe Wood. Summercombe <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> replanted in the latter half of the 20th century, but the original 19th century drive follows a stream through the valley past a pond to a stone bridge to two further areas of nearby woodland. At the west side of Summercombe Wood, there is a 19th-century lodge, Haldon Lodge.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn {{takes place}} in the fictional world of Hydaelyn, a planet filled with {{multiple}} environments and climates covering three large continents. The region in which the game is set is called Eorzea. The four major city-states in Eorzea feature a wide variety of climates and biomes: the forest nation of Gridania is surrounded by a dense thicket called the Black Shroud; Ul'dah is a sultanate with a predilection for commerce situated in the Thanalan Desert; the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa finds its home in La Noscea on the island of Vylbrand; and Ishgard is a theocracy built in the snowy mountains of Coerthas. Eorzea is connected to a larger continent to the northeast which <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> conquered by the militaristic Garlean Empire. Other political entities include the beastmen tribes who perennially assault the civilized nations; Sharlayan, a scholarly city to the northwest; and Ala Mhigo, a city-state which was occupied during the first Garlean invasion twenty years prior to the events of the game. The four major city-states formed the Eorzean Alliance to repel this invasion but Ishgard abruptly withdrew, leaving the remaining three allies in name only. This conflict also resulted in the desolation of Mor Dhona, a once-vibrant region {{in the center of the}} continent that is now a barren wasteland.|$|E
25|$|The {{scholarly}} conclusion <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> {{that the}} settlement of New Amsterdam is much more like current New York than previously thought. Cultural diversity and a mind-set that resembles the American Dream were already present {{in the first few}} years of this colony. Writers like Russell Shorto argue that the large influence of New Amsterdam on the American psyche <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> overlooked in the classic telling of American beginnings, because of animosity between the English victors and the conquered Dutch.|$|E
