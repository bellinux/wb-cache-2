40|$|Systems {{of bright}} rays are {{exhibited}} by many fresh craters {{on the moon}} and Mercury. Diameter/density distributions suggest that lunar-rayed craters represent the Class 1 craters, and that Mercurian rayed craters represent post-Caloris craters. Photogeological analyses of lunar imagery indicate that the ray systems are composed of finely divided material from the primary crater along with locally derived ejecta from secondary and tertiary craters. The primary ray material probably occurs in moderately thick (0. 1 - 1 meter) deposits. The rate of darkening may depend more on the thickness of the ray material than on the rates of various darkening processes. <b>Darkening</b> <b>rate</b> may also be a function of crater size. It is observed that rays of craters more than 1 b. y. old remain bright, whereas those older than Class 1 generally fade to imperceptibility...|$|E
30|$|Treatment with ozone, radiation, {{microwave}} and vacuum mixing {{were reported as}} the new technologies enhancing shelf life or quality of fresh noodles. Li et al. [2] investigated the effects of ozone treatment on the microorganism mortality in wheat flour and shelf life of fresh noodles. The {{results showed that the}} total plate count (TPC) can be largely reduced in wheat flour exposed to ozone gas for 30 and 60  min. Microbial growth and <b>darkening</b> <b>rate</b> of fresh noodles made from ozone-treated flour were delayed significantly. While Yang et al. [35] found that the optimal ozone treatment parameters for fresh fish noodle were ventilation of 6  L/min for 20  min then sterilizing for 10  min. Under the conditions, the shelf life of noodles treated by 100 % CO 2 in the package was 22  days at −  0.8  °C. Cai et al. [112] reported that the shelf life of fresh noodle increased to 10  days with the Co 60 γray treatment at 10  kGy, while significant extending of shelf life of fresh noodle was also observed under the treatment at 4  kGy [113]. Moreover, Xie and Li [114] found that the fresh noodle can be stored over 28  days with the 20  s microwave (700  W) treatment at 4  °C. As for the vacuum mixing, −  0.06  MPa was considered as the best degree for noodle production. In addition, vacuum mixing could promote the formation of bound water in the dough and effectively reduce water activity at certain moisture content, resulting in the extended shelf life of fresh noodle [33].|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of 157 nm {{as the next}} optical lithography wavelength has created a need for new soft (polymeric) or hard (quartz) pellicle materials optimized for this wavelength. Materials design and development of ultra transparent fluoropolymers suitable for 157 nm soft pellicle applications has produced a number of promising candidate materials with absorbances below 0. 03 /µm as is necessary to achieve pellicle transmissions above 95 %. We have developed 12 families of experimental TeflonAF ® (TAFx) materials which have sufficient transparency to produce transmissions above 95 %. For the successful fabrication of 157 nm pellicles from these materials, the fluoropolymers must have appropriate physical properties to permit the spin coating of thin polymer films and their lifting and adhesive mounting to pellicle frames, the processes which produce free standing pellicle membranes of micron scale thickness. Relevant physical properties include molecular weight, glass transition temperature, and mechanical strength and toughness. We have successfully developed various of the ultra transparent TAFx polymer families with these physical properties. Upon irradiation these 157 nm pellicle polymers undergo photochemical darkening, which reduces the 157 nm transmission of the material. Measurements of the photochemical <b>darkening</b> <b>rate</b> allow the estimation of the pellicle lifetime corresponding to a 10 % drop in 157 nm transmission. Increasing the 157 nm lifetime of fluoropolymers involves simultaneous optimization of the materials, the pellicles and the end use. Similar optimization was essential to achieve the desired radiation durability lifetimes for pellicles successfully developed for use with KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm) lithography...|$|E
50|$|While using {{hydroquinone}} as a lightening agent can {{be effective}} with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity. Using a daily sunscreen with a high PPD (persistent pigment <b>darkening)</b> <b>rating</b> {{reduces the risk of}} further damage. Hydroquinone is sometimes combined with alpha hydroxy acids that exfoliate the skin to quicken the lightening process. In the United States, topical treatments usually contain up to 2% in hydroquinone. Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2009 American Chemical SocietyDarkening {{in yellow}} {{alkaline}} noodles (YAN) was measured over 24 h {{in a high}} polyphenol oxidase (PPO) bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Tasman) and a very low PPO durum wheat (Triticum durum cv. Kamilaroi). Over 24 h non-PPO darkening occurred {{across a range of}} pH 3. 5 - 10. 5, and in Tasman this was overlaid by darkening from PPO activity. The <b>rate</b> of <b>darkening</b> in YAN was separated into two main time periods, 0 - 4 and 4 - 24 h. The first 4 h of darkening was further divided into two stages using a composite first-order rate equation. Several specific inhibitors that partially inhibited non-PPO darkening were identified. These inhibitors, as well as the PPO inhibitors SHAM and tropolone, were used to analyze YAN <b>darkening.</b> The <b>rate</b> of the early stage of darkening was not altered by any inhibitors used; however, the magnitude of darkening was reduced by inhibitors specific for non-PPO <b>darkening.</b> Both the <b>rate</b> and extent of non-PPO darkening of the second stage of darkening were decreased in Tasman and Kamilaroi by inhibitors specific for non-PPO darkening, whereas both PPO inhibitors only decreased darkening in Tasman. The second and third stages of darkening showed similar characteristics. The third stage of darkening was examined in YAN made from Kamilaroi over a temperature range from - 4 to 65 degrees C. It followed an Arrhenius relationship indicating non-PPO darkening during this stage was nonenzymatic. The inhibitor data suggested that the reactive component(s) was/were present in a reasonably high concentration(s) and that the soluble protein fraction was involved in the non-PPO darkening process.

40|$|The {{microclimate}} of {{the brown}} alga Feldmannia caespitula (J. Agardh) Knoepffler-Péguy interstitium was studied using microelectrode techniques. Zero water flow and irradiances of 170 and 1500 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1 cause steep O 2 gradients peaking 3 - 4 mm below the outer surface of the tufts at 310 and 506 % atmospheric saturation, respectively. The mean flux of O 2 from the interstitium to the surrounding bulk water were 87 ± 21 and 262 ± 68 nmol cm- 2 h- 1 at low and high quantum flux density. Except for the outer 2 - 4 mm thick margin, the alga interstitium became anoxic within 52 minutes after abrupt <b>darkening.</b> The <b>rate</b> of dark oxygen uptake was 52 ± 5 nmol cm- 2 h- 1. The tufts were populated by nine metazoan taxa: nematodes, harpacticoid copepods, ostracods, gastropods, bivalves, polychaetes, amphipods, isopods and halacarids. Our {{results suggest that the}} interstitium of fine-textured algal thalli is a microhabitat of variable water chemistry with temporary anoxia and hyperoxia in an otherwise relatively stable water column. Although the tufts are attractive for meiofauna by providing food and protection from currents and predators, rapid fluctuations in oxygen concentration probably cue temporal emigration of the algal infauna...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the mode of action of nisin against vegetative cells and spores of Clostridium botu-linum is different. However, clear explanation is not available. Therefore, nisin action against vegetative cells and spores of C. botulinum was investigated in this study. Nisin was added at various stages of spore-to-vegetative cell transition and changes to sensitivity to the bacteriocin were observed. Different nisin preparation (Nisaplin or pure nisin) was compared for their activity against different stages of spore transformation of C. botulinum ATCC 25763. Germination was measured by determining loss of heat resistance and observing phase darkening of spores under phase-contrast microscope. Nisin acted bactericidally against vegetative cells, but acted sporostati-cally against spores of C. botulinum under the same concentration. This bactericidal and sporostatic action of nisin was dependent on the concentration of nisin used. Presence of nisin during spore activation by heat increased subsequent phase <b>darkening</b> and germination <b>rates.</b> However, nisin inhibited the germination and the outgrowth, when it was added after heat activation stage. Findings from {{this study suggest that}} the time of addition of nisin is very important for the effective control of spores during the heating process of foods. In addition, {{it may be possible to}} apply nisin at the stage of processing that coincides with the most sensitive stage of spore transformation...|$|R
40|$|Quasi-periodic modulations of {{the stellar}} light curve {{may result from}} dark spots {{crossing}} the visible stellar disc. Due to differential rotation, spots at different latitudes generally have different rotation periods. Hence, by studying spot-induced modulations, one can learn about stellar surface (differential) rotation and magnetic activity. Recently, Reinhold & Arlt (2015) proposed a method based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of light curves to identify {{the sign of the}} differential rotation at the stellar surface. Our goal is to understand how the modulation of the stellar light curve due to the presence of spots and the corresponding periodogram are affected by both the stellar and spot properties. We generate synthetic light curves of stars with different properties (inclination angle, limb <b>darkening,</b> and rotation <b>rate)</b> and spot configurations (number of spots, latitude, intensity contrast, and size). By analysing their Lomb-Scargle periodograms, we compute the ratio between the heights of the second and first harmonics of the rotation period (peak-height-ratio). We find that the peak-height ratios are essentially a function of a single parameter, the fraction of time the spot is visible, which is related to the sinusoidality of the spot modulation. We identify the conditions under which the periodogram analysis can actually provide an estimate of the spot latitudes and/or the stellar inclination angle. We also identify possible sources of error in the identification of the sign of the differential rotation. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
40|$|Darkening {{in yellow}} {{alkaline}} noodles (YAN) was examined over a 24 h period in noodles made from 4 wheat varieties, including varieties with {{different levels of}} polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, selected to cover a range of protein levels. Noodles {{were made in the}} presence and absence of the PPO inhibitor, tropolone. The darkening was divided into two time periods: 0 - 4 h and 4 - 24 h. The first four hours was described by a composite rate equation, and this period was subdivided into two stages. The <b>rate</b> of <b>darkening</b> in the first stage was independent of both protein concentration and PPO activity. The amount of darkening (c), however, was highly dependent on protein concentration during this stage (-tropolone, r = 0. 902; +tropolone, r = 0. 905), but independent of PPO activity. The first stage darkening was a zero order reaction where additional protein does not increase the reaction rate, but when the protein supply has been depleted, the reaction stops. The <b>rate</b> of <b>darkening</b> during the first stage (k'(1) = 5. 6 +/- 1. 0) was similar to the rate of change in the protein structure (k'(1) = 6. 5 +/- 1. 3) as measured using the amide II band by infrared spectroscopy. This suggested that the first stage of darkening represents changes in light reflectance and absorbance caused by changes in hydrogen bonding rather than changes in covalent bonding. During the second stage of <b>darkening,</b> both the <b>rate</b> (k'(2)) and amount of darkening (DeltaL*(4 h-c)) were significantly correlated with protein concentration (-tropolone, r = 0. 465; +tropolone, r = 0. 813), {{and in the absence of}} tropolone the amount of darkening was increased by PPO activity. The amount of darkening (DeltaL*(24 h- 4 h)) during the second time period (4 - 24 h) (or third stage) was significantly correlated in the presence of tropolone (r = 0. 375) and in the absence of tropolone (r = 0. 428) with protein concentration. However, compared with earlier stages the response of non-PPO darkening during the third stage to change in protein concentration was smaller. Protein oxidation, or more specifically oxidation of tyrosine groups within the protein, appears to be the main mechanism involved in non-PPO darkening in YAN during the second and third stages with glutenin being the main reactant. Albumin and globulin are important substrates for PPO. No differences in darkening were detected in YAN made from the four varieties in the presence of tropolone; however, differences in YAN darkening were observed for the second and third stages due to site and year variation.
