25|$|At the tribunal, Caspar's {{case was}} heard first. Caspar was {{suspended}} for four weeks. Coleman's defence was simple: he had simply retaliated to two unprovoked punches from Caspar (for which Caspar had been suspended). The VFL at that time made no allowance for provocation, the Players' Advocate Dan Minogue was thought {{to have made a}} <b>good</b> <b>case</b> for Coleman by arguing that any man, if he were a man at all, would hit back after being hit. Both the boundary umpire, Herb Kent, and goal umpire Allen gave evidence that Coleman had retaliated only after he had been punched twice by Caspar.|$|E
40|$|In {{his paper}} “There It Is” and his précis “There It Was,” Benj Hellie {{develops}} a sophisticated semantics for perceptual justification {{according to which}} perceptions in <b>good</b> <b>cases</b> {{can be explained by}} intentional psychology and can justify beliefs, whereas bad cases of perception are defective and so cannot justify beliefs. Importantly, Hellie also affords consciousness a central role in rationality insofar as only those <b>good</b> <b>cases</b> of perception within consciousness can play a justificatory function. In this commentary, I reserve judgment regarding Hellie’s treatment of the rational difference between <b>good</b> and bad <b>cases,</b> but I argue there can be what he views as <b>good</b> <b>cases</b> of perceptual justification outside of consciousness...|$|R

The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a <b>good</b> <b>case.</b> Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner.

25|$|India's {{position}} on {{the establishment of the}} State of Israel was affected by many factors, including India's own partition on religious lines, and India's relationship with other nations. Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi believed the Jews had a <b>good</b> <b>case</b> and a prior claim for Israel, but opposed the creation of Israel on religious or mandated terms. India voted against the Partitioning of Palestine plan of 1947 and voted against Israel's admission to the United Nations in 1949. Various proponents of Hindu nationalism supported or sympathised with the creation of Israel. Hindu Mahasabha leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar supported the creation of Israel on both moral and political grounds, and condemned India's vote at the UN against Israel. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar admired Jewish nationalism and believed Palestine was the natural territory of the Jewish people, essential to their aspiration for nationhood.|$|E

25|$|Some areas once rich in mopane worms are now barren due to over-harvesting {{and lack}} of a proper {{sustainable}} approach to commercial mopane worm farming. A <b>good</b> <b>case</b> is in Nkayi District, Zimbabwe, where most mopane woodland areas once produced a high population of these worms; but the harvests have decreased drastically. Suggestions of how to reintroduce the worms to these areas include re-colonisation. As the adult moth lives only three to four days, during which it must mate and lay eggs, {{there is only a}} small window of opportunity to relocate them. If this stage was to be successfully completed, collaboration with local farmers and communities would be required to ensure that the caterpillars are not harvested for a set number of years. It would thus be ensured that the area is adequately repopulated, so that a sustainable harvest is created for the future.|$|E
25|$|James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) employs Kathy at The Dagmar wine bar, angering Pete, and {{the rift}} worsens {{when it becomes}} clear that James is romantically {{interested}} in Kathy. After work, James invites Kathy upstairs to his flat, but when he attempts to seduce her, Kathy tries to leave. James refuses to let her leave and his attempted seduction becomes rape. James is arrested and formally charged with rape. In the aftermath, Kathy becomes depressed and isolated from Pete, who never believes she is blameless so Kathy leaves him. James stands trial but tries bribing Kathy to withdraw her statement. Kathy pretends to take his hush money but tells the police so a listening DI tapes the conversation. She is forced to relive the rape for the trial, where a skillful barrister presents a <b>good</b> <b>case</b> for James. For a time it seems James could be acquitted, but to Kathy's relief, he is convicted and imprisoned for three years. During this time, Kathy finds unexpected support from Pete's first wife, Pat (Pam St. Clement), whom she had initially despised and they become close friends.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether Douds remains <b>good</b> <b>case</b> law. The Supreme Court {{distinguished}} the case but declined to overrule Douds in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951). In 1965, in United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Supreme Court essentially overturned Douds by holding that the Taft-Hartley Act's oath constituted a bill of attainder, but did not formally do so. Two years later, in United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967), the Court specifically declined to apply a balancing test to a law prohibiting members of the Communist Party from holding jobs in the defense industry. Although the law was based on the same rationale as Taft-Hartley (that membership in the Communist Party was a sure indication of future action), the Supreme Court said this was too heavy an infringement on the individual's First Amendment rights. Instead, the Court seemed to suggest a new, two-part test: Whether the governmental interests advanced are valid, and whether the statute is narrowly drawn to infringe on First Amendment rights in the most narrow way. The Court returned to the balancing test in Brandenberg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), but this time concluded that prohibiting mere advocacy of violence was too heavy a burden on the First Amendment. Such advocacy must produce imminent action for the speech to be punishable, the Court held.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the incentives of private actors {{to invest in}} cybersecurity. Prior analyses have examined investments in security goods, such as locks or safes that have the characteristics of private goods. The analysis in this paper extends this analysis to examine expenditures on security goods, such as information, that have the characteristics of public goods. In contrast to the private <b>goods</b> <b>case,</b> where individual uncoordinated security expenditures can lead to an overproduction of security, the public <b>goods</b> <b>case</b> can result in the underproduction of security expenditures, and incentives to free ride. Thus, the formation of collective organizations {{may be necessary to}} facilitate the production of public security goods, and the protection of information produced by the collective organization should be a central feature of such organizations...|$|R

25|$|Further {{illustrations}} are plentiful. In East v Maurer where Maurer lied that {{he would}} not set up a barber competing with the one he was selling to East, Maurer was liable for East's normal market lost profits, costs of improvements and the price paid minus the business' selling price. In Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd Smith New Court Ltd was deceitfully told there were close rival bids for shares in a company called Ferranti IS Inc. Smith New Court Ltd bought, but then it transpired that massive fraud had occurred. The Court of Appeal held that only £1.2m was recoverable, the difference between the market price at the time of purchase and the real price, but the House of Lords held that the full losses of £11.8m were recoverable (even though the fraud was unconnected to the misrepresentation) because that loss was one which Smith New Court Ltd had due to entering the transaction after being deceived. In practice, because an action for negligent misrepresentation has now been developed through Hedley Byrne and the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), it is often not beneficial to sue for deceit. The only certain difference is that the defence of contributory negligence is unavailable in a deceit action. But deceit is harder to prove, since evidence of a person's state of mind is needed. Because the charge can sink people's reputations, alleging deceit is also contrary to professional conduct rules at the bar, unless a <b>good</b> <b>case</b> exists. A large difference which is subject to debate, is that the causation and remoteness rules are more generous for deceit. Certainly this is true when comparing negligence and deceit. However, the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), which was modelled on the law as it stood when the Act was passed, has the same causation rules as for deceit (see below).|$|E

In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists James Clerk Maxwell and David Brewster played a major part {{in the development of the}} techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist Robert Adamson (1821–48) and artist David Octavius Hill (1821–48), who as Hill & Adamson formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 calotype images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography.|$|E

In fact there is a <b>good</b> <b>case</b> to believe that both Napoleon and Wellington thought that holding Hougoumont was key to winning the battle. Hougoumont {{was a part of}} the battlefield that Napoleon could see clearly, and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon (33battalions in all, 14,000troops). Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21battalions (12,000troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont, and later stated that [...] "the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont".|$|E

AIMS AND METHODS: Despite the importance of construction of <b>good</b> PBL <b>cases</b> to the success of a PBL programme, the art of construction of these cases is understudied or described in the literature.
