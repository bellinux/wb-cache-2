The uses of these materials have caused respiratory diseases, dermatological problems and allergies. Dentistry profession must not ignore the potential environmental risks and occupational health risk of any member of the team. The air in <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> is highly polluted with dust, which can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing serious damage. If the dental technicians do not use appropriate protection, dust and other filth, can damage their health as well as the environment. The types of dust in breathing air close to the workplace have been classified by size.

2500|$|In {{cases where}} the post space {{is not a good}} match for a {{prefabricated}} post, a cast post and core can be custom fabricated for the tooth. [...] A resin pattern is produced by placing a preformed plastic [...] "burnout" [...] post into the post space [...] and a resin material, such as Duralay resin, is used to build up the tooth to the proper dimensions. [...] When this is completed, the pattern resin/plastic post is removed from the tooth structure and attached to a sprue former, much {{in the same way as}} a is done with the wax pattern of a crown, and a single-unit cast post and core can thus be fabricated out of gold, titanium or another metal using the lost-wax technique. Where a metal post could be difficult to conceal a custom post made of zirconia oxide can be made; its tooth colour leaves less of a shadow under the final restoration. Alternatively, an impression can be taken of the post space and dental arch [...] using a plastic post and a polyvinyl siloxane impression material, and this used to construct a suitable post in the <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of a set}} of complete dentures is a challenge for any dentist/denturist. [...] There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. [...] In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. [...] One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. [...] The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. [...] An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture {{in his or her own}} laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory,</b> which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. [...] The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. [...] These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. [...] The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. [...] Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory</b> in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. [...] Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.|$|E

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of a clinically acceptable dental prosthesis requires proper {{communication between the}} dentist and the dental technician. Prosthodontic educators have been concerned with this interaction and communication. Fixed prosthodontics laboratories revealed that the technicians are often dissatisfied with the information provided in work authorizations. Objective: To evaluate the quality of communication between dentists and laboratory technicians via work authorizations for fixed prosthodontics in both governmental and private <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> in Riyadh area from the technician’s perspective. Methods: A sample of 66 <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories,</b> including all government <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> and a selected number of randomly chosen private <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> from each district of Riyadh (40 %), participated in the survey. A questionnaire was developed to include questions related to the following areas of work authorization: clarity and accuracy of instructions, patient information, type of prosthesis, choice of materials, design and shade of the prosthesis and type of porcelain glaze. The questionnaire was answered in a face-to-face interview by technicians who were qualified in fixed prosthetic work. Data were analyzed through parametric tests (T-test and one-way ANOVA) to identify significant values (P <  0. 05). Results: This survey showed a lack of communication between dentists and <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> regarding the following: marginal design, pontic design, staining diagram, type of porcelain and glaze needed for the prosthesis. Significant differences were observed {{between the government and}} private <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories.</b> There was a greater lack of communication between the dentists and government laboratory technicians in Riyadh. There was no statistically significant difference between private laboratories of different areas in Riyadh city (P <  0. 05).

Ten samples of pumice powder and slurry were randomly collected from 10 randomly selected <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Yazd, cultured on selective fungal and bacterial media in order to quantitatively analyze the total colony-forming units (CFU) and also determine the genus or species of the agents in the samples. Fungi were recovered both from the pumice powder (mean = 1050 cfu gG) and 1 pumice slurry (mean = 6350 CFU gG) and a wide range of bacteria was present in the pumice powder 1 (mean = 450 cfu gG) and pumice slurry (mean = 18700 CFU gG). Statistical paired samples t-test showed a 1 1 statistically significant difference between bacterial contamination of pumice slurry and pumice powder (p = 0. 015), but the difference in the fungal contamination was not significant (p = 0. 315). Pumice, especially in the form of slurry, which is used for polishing of dental prostheses is a potential source of bacterial and fungal contamination in <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> and therefore improved techniques are required for disinfecting and controlling possible microbial infections...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In view of {{the risk}} of {{infection}} of dental health care workers and patients, interruption of possible chains of infection is to be demanded. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was to}} assess infection control practice in private <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> in Riyadh City, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The study was conducted on thirty two private <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> in Riyadh City regarding infection control practiced by these laboratories. The instrument of the study consisted of ten open-ended questions that were asked from the laboratories directors. RESULTS: A large percentage of the surveyed laboratories (87. 5 %) did not implement any infection control protocol during their practice. The mean number of impressions received per week was 16. Most of the surveyed laboratories (90. 6 %) had no way of communication with the clinics regarding the disinfection procedures. The results indicated that 62. 5 % of the laboratories reported that they were aware that they may get infection from non-disinfected items. Only a small percentage (6. 2 %) of the laboratories added disinfecting agent to pumice slurry. Wearing laboratory coats was reported by 75 % of the laboratory workers. The use of gloves during work was reported by 59. 3 % of the laboratories while 56. 2 % reported the use protective eyewear. Only 21. 8 % of the laboratories use face masks during work. CONCLUSIONS: Construction of infection control manuals that contain updated and recommended guidelines to ensure aseptic practice in private <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> is highly recommended.
