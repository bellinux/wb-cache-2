The main goal {{of this paper is}} to describe how the actual LIT (Legal Interpreters and Translators) training programme at the KU Leuven Arts faculty in Antwerp is the result of a number of research programmes that were initiated by prof. dr. Erik Hertog in the late nineties of the last century and took place in collaboration with the European Commission, more specifically <b>DG</b> <b>Justice</b> and several partners in different EU Member States. We will show how the GROTIUS projects (started in 1998) have laid the foundations of the awareness that equal access to Justice is not an evidence, especially when people involved in criminal cases are not speaking the language of the judicial system where they will be heard. The idea that joint efforts and exchanging best practices to assure quality and quality control were the best way to move forward eventually gave shape to the AGIS projects and gave in 2009 birth to EULITA, the European Legal Interpreters and Translators Association. This ever-broadening European view and growing awareness on the professionalization of LITs made that many professionals involved in legal proceedings were not only willing to collaborate, but they also realized that future developments had to be taken in account. Research projects then start(ed) to focus on new technologies or further development and specialization in LITs training. The gained insights have been incorporated in the Antwerp training programme of LITs in more or less extensive formats or modules. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Gender {{relations}} have increasingly changed throughout the past decades, and European gender politics have productively accompanied these improvements. Still Europe {{is far from}} being a gender-equal society. For a long period gender equality policies have been contextualised mainly as a ’women’s issue’ – as women have been the driving force behind gender equality strategies and have been seen as the only ones who benefit from a more equal society. Men as the ‘other gender’ have been taken less into account in the context of gender equality. In the last decade, however, men and masculinities have increasingly become subjects of studies and gender policies in the EU. Under EU presidency, conferences on men, masculinities and equality took place in Sweden (2001) and Finland (2006). The Roadmap for equality between women and men 2006 - 20101 specifically encouraged men to take up care responsibilities and to share leave entitlements with women. A horizontal priority on gender roles including the need for involvement of men in gender equality policies and addressing inequalities affecting men, such as early school leaving, literacy and occupational health, is present in the current European Commission's Strategy for Equality between Women and Men (2010 - 2015) 2. Additionally, strategies like gender mainstreaming seem to have created an initial awareness of the issue of men in gender equality and the establishment of some pathways towards institutional practice.

40|$|In {{the area}} of legal interpreting, the use of {{videoconference}} technology is now being widely considered as a potential solution for gaining cost-effective and timely access to qualified legal interpreters. The Stockholm programme, the Procedural Rights Roadmap and the Directive {{on the right to}} translation and interpreting in criminal proceedings make explicit reference to videoconferencing as a means of gaining access to remotely located interpreters (‘remote interpreting’). Equally importantly, the increasing use of videoconferencing in criminal proceedings, especially cross-border proceedings, furthermore requires interpreters to work in videoconference situations in which the participants are distributed across two or more sites (‘videoconference interpreting’). The questions arising are how the technological mediation through videoconference affects the quality of interpreting; how this is related to the actual videoconference setting and locations of participants and interpreter; whether the emerging forms of video-mediated interpreting are reliable enough for achieving the specific goals of legal communication, and ultimately; {{what can be done to}} mitigate potential problems. Against this backdrop, this presentation will report the main findings of the AVIDICUS I project (2008 - 2011, co-funded by the <b>DG</b> <b>Justice),</b> which was set up to investigate the current extent and quality of video-mediated interpreting in criminal proceedings and with the wider aim of developing specific training (for interpreters and legal practitioners) and formulating initial recommendations for the use of video-mediated interpreting in criminal proceedings. The main findings of the project will be presented as a rationale for the recommendations, which will be subsequently explained. An important aim of this presentation is to highlight potential pitfalls in the process of implementing video-mediated interpretation and to draw attention to the need for co-operation and informed dialogue between all stakeholders in order to design viable solutions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Since Poulin (2004) {{argued that}} “courts should not extend their {{reliance}} on videoconferencing further and instead must undertake studies {{to explore the}} impact of the technology in criminal proceedings” (Poulin in Braun & Taylor: 36), numerous research has been conducted, not in the least through the <b>DG</b> <b>Justice</b> funded projects AVIDICUS 1, 2 and 3. While the first project explored whether the quality of videoconference interpreting (VCI) and remote interpreting (RI) is suitable for criminal proceedings, AVIDICUS 2 did further research on this combination of technological mediation through videoconference technology and linguistic-cultural mediation through an interpreter. AVIDICUS II focused on how this affects the specific goals of legal communication and also presented a chapter on training in its final publication. The main aim of AVIDICUS 3 is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the VC solutions used in different types of legal institutions across Europe in order to ascertain whether these solutions are suitable for bilingual communication. With the AVIDICUS (and other) research as a background, we want to present such a comprehensive assessment through a transcribed case study of a real-life VC testimony between Belgium and Austria with an interpreter for German and Dutch. A CA (conversation analysis) approach of the corpus will uncover social interaction through verbal and non-verbal conduct, while an additional critical discourse analysis (CDA) will look at the power relationships in the triadic exchange. Since the researchers master both of the languages spoken (German and Dutch), their analysis will also unmask possible transfer errors and deontological issues that will again be linked back to the CDA and CA. We will present the most significant shifts of the interpreter’s role according to the 3 D role-space model as presented in Llewellyn-Jones and Lee (2014). The role of the German-French interpreter in this case will be described along the three axes of the role-space model: presentation of self, interaction management and alignment. The ultimate goal is to compare this model to former, more static models describing the interpreter’s behavior/role and to confirm or to elaborate on the previous findings on video-conferencing in legal settings. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The war {{and crisis}} in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan {{in the last}} decade forced people to leave their country. This massive {{migration}} flow is unseen since the Yugoslav wars in the nineties of the last century. Now the world is looking helplessly at the influx of refugees and even Europe {{does not seem to be}} able to solve the problem and to find a solution for them. Among all these people are many children who next to physical pain are also suffering from mental problems and trauma. At the same time the level of xenophobia and intolerance has been increasing, which leads to violent and discriminatory incidents. Very often, the people fleeing from the above-mentioned countries speak only a couple of words of English. Their mother tongue is Syrian Arabic or Pashto and Dari. The question is whether countries where no proper training exists for legal interpreters can provide the necessary language assistance during interviews at Immigration Offices. There is a huge lack of trained interpreters, who could enable psychologists, authorities and social workers to communicate with these people and with traumatized children in the first place. For the latter category, a specific approach is required. The first question that we will try to answer is the following: how can we train interpreters in a language which is not a common, widespread language but a Language of Lesser Diffusion in a limited period of time? The TraiLLD project (Training in Languages of Lesser Diffusion) (JUST/ 2013 /JPEN/AG/ 4594) offers some solutions for the problem on how to properly train in a reasonable time span. The recently published TraiLLD manual deals with this problem and discusses various methodological options. The second question focuses on ensuring child-friendly and smooth communication with traumatized, vulnerable minors. The Co-Minor-IN/Quest project (Cooperation in interpreter-mediated questioning of minors) (JUST/ 2011 /JPEN/AG/ 2961) emphasizes the importance of specialized training for interpreters working in child interview settings, in close collaboration with child support workers, psychologists and governmental and legal authorities. The publication ‘Children and Justice: Overcoming Language Barriers Cooperation in interpreter-mediated questioning of minors’ focuses on these issues and offers handson solutions. These two main questions can be answered by the above-mentioned European projects financed by <b>DG</b> <b>Justice.</b> Based on their research outcomes, we willsuggest some hands-on solutions which can contribute to guaranteeing Equality under Law in the current international context. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|It is a self-evident {{fact that}} the 2010 / 64 /EU Directive {{on the right to}} {{translation}} and interpretation in criminal proceedings is a means of guaranteeing equality under law. Since Tampere {{has been one of the}} starting points for the EU (Tampere summit 1998) to establish in all EU Member States guarantees and mechanisms for compliance with procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings, the present conference offers a perfect opportunity to reflect on past and current accomplishments in this field. Although in the meantime a long <b>DG</b> <b>Justice</b> research tradition has been established for over 15 years (see EULITA [URL] the Status Questionis publication (Hertog & Van Gucht (eds.), 2008) was a first eye-opener. After almost 10 years of research, the Agis project wanted with this publication to map the provision of legal interpreting (and translation) in Europe. With 194 responses (out of 1119 questionnaires distributed) it showed not only that Member States were not really concerned with legal interpreting, but also that insights and recommendations of the research projects had not reached the users of legal interpreters, mainly legal actors and/or the institutions/authorities. Nevertheless, the EC itself has continued its efforts to improve procedural safeguards by issuing the 2010 / 64 /EU Directive. Now, the question is to know to what extent the EU Member States have implemented this important Directive. The 2014 CEPEJ (European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice) report entitled “European judicial systems – Edition 2014 (2012 data) : efficiency and quality of justice” ([URL] Evaluation-report-on-European-Judicial-. html) is not very promising. Chapter 16 (pp. 452 - 461) focuses on court interpreters and states that in not less than 13 states or entities the title of court interpreter is neither protected or regulated (p. 456), Belgium being one of them. Therefore, we want to show through a historical overview of the research done that there is an urgent need to work in a more interdisciplinary way. Although research has explored this path since decades, it apparently is still not the case when speaking about collaboration between interpreting, law and psychology research departments and police academies. Hence, research projects with different stakeholders involved like ImPLI, Co-Minor-IN/QUEST and TraiLLD recommend on the one hand joint training sessions with different professional groups and on the other hand closer cooperation with the authorities (Ministries of Justice and Home Affairs) in order to meet the changing needs. This presentation will be a step towards more effective interdisciplinary work and will discuss strategies to increase multidisciplinary cooperation: more effective dissemination by involving the interpreter users in research or organizing joint training, to name just a few. status: publishe...|$|E

With an EU-wide format of online training and testing, the project contributes towards facilitating transparent, cost-efficient criminal proceedings in EU courts, guaranteeing the rights of suspected and accused persons as stipulated in Directive 2010 / 64 /EU. In practice, the project focuses on developing translation memories and multilingual terminology, relevant for the translation of European Arrest Warrants, and on developing EU-wide training programmes and testing procedures for legal translators and practitioners. This will have a positive impact on the training of legal translators and practitioners because they will have to interact efficiently with beneficiaries of legal translation services such as police, prosecutors, court staff, judges, lawyers and professionals providing victim support. This paper focuses in particular on the training and assessment work streams of the project, and will present research-based core curricula and training materials for legal translators and legal practitioners, testing, evaluation and assessment procedures, and materials for professionals in specific working conditions related to the translation of European Arrest Warrants and Essential Documents.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study of the requirements for developing a Digital Competence Framework {{in the context of a}} digital marketplace in the EU. Consumer digital competence is defined as the competence consumers need to function actively, safely and assertively in the digital marketplace. This framework will define the skills, knowledge and attitudes that consumers need to navigate the complex digital environment. The research project to create the Digital Competence Framework for Consumers is a joint action of <b>DG</b> <b>Justice</b> and Consumers (JUST), and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the Commission’s science and knowledge service. The work, carried out between 2015 - 2016, aimed to achieve the goals set out by the European Commission in its two recent Communications: “A New Skills Agenda For Europe - Working together to strengthen human capital, employability and competitiveness” (European Commission, 2016) and “A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe” (European Commission, 2015). Both these Communications focus on the importance of citizens’ digital skills and their capacity to participate more deeply in our digital society and economy. The study presented in this report is designed to elicit user requirements in order to support the development of the Digital Competence Framework for Consumers. The study was commissioned by the Joint Research Centre and it is a result of collaborative work between the authors of the report. Further consultation on requirements was carried out with DG JUST in which experts on various topics gave their input and contributed to the text. The literature and the hot-button issues described in this report reflect the state-of-play in 2015, when the study was carried out. The methodology used to clarify the requirements for a consumer digital competence framework had four main steps. First, a ‘broad-but-shallow’ look into important emerging issues in the field of online shopping and advertisement was taken. In this phase of the study, a number of European Commission working documents on the issue were reviewed. The focus was also on current relevant literature, both academic and grey literature. Second, the existing terms and major work in consumer competence was reviewed and links were made to behavioural insights. It emerged that lack of digital competence can make consumers vulnerable in today’s complex digital environment. Third, part of the work consisted of testing the suitability of the existing Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp) in an expert workshop to further prompt requirements for the new framework. Lastly, to finalise the process of requirement gathering, a gap analysis was conducted on a number of prominent sources of educational material for consumer competence. The study found that the DigComp framework was a suitable starting point and confirms that it could be adapted to the new context of the digital marketplace. However, the analysis also showed that not all competencies are covered by the existing framework, in particular with regards to emerging digital trends and issues outlined. The final product of the project, the Digital Competence Framework for Consumers, is described in a JRC Science for Policy publication by Brecko & Ferrari (2016).
