25|$|At Brisbane, on a wicket {{that was}} the worst that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> the Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high {{deliveries}} of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, {{out of the way of}} the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and Hutton's display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> played.|$|E

40|$|How is it {{possible}} to justify a lengthy review of the physics of the magnetic monopole when nobody <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> one? In spite of the unfortunate lack of favorable experimental evidence, there are sound theoretical reasons for believing that the magnetic monopole must exist. The case for its existence is surely as strong as the case for any other undiscovered particle. Moreover, as of this writing (early 1984), it is not certain that nobody <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> one. What seems certain is that nobody <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> two...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Kanin began solo writing in earnest with Heat of Anger, about a strong, older woman lawyer played by Susan Hayward, {{and a younger}} male lawyer. At first Kanin was {{put off by the}} lack of an {{immediate}} reaction from an audience, but once she realized that more people had seen it in one night than would <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> it in theaters if it played for a year, she was hooked and wrote five more films for television.|$|E

I would hate to have a son or {{daughter}} of mine permitted to read it; it is so filthy and so dirty. But it comes from a Negro, and you cannot expect any better from a person of his type.|$|E
25|$|Bing Crosby {{served as}} an honorary {{director}} of the festival from 1949 to 1951. Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying “I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in my life.” Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper visited in 1962, attending two plays. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.|$|E
25|$|The city's neighborhoods make up {{the soul}} of Billings. The south side of Billings is {{probably}} the oldest residential area in the city, {{and it is the}} city's most culturally diverse Neighborhood. South Park is an old growth City park, host to several food fairs and festivals in the summer months. The Bottom Westend Historic District is home to many of Billings first mansions. Midtown, the most densely populated portion of the city {{is in the midst of}} gentrification on a level that few if any areas in Montana <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> New growth is mainly concentrated on Billings's West End. Shiloh Crossing is a new commercial development, anchored by Scheels, Montana's largest retail store. The West End is characterised by upper income. Denser, more urban growth is occurring in Josephine Crossing, one of Billings's many new contemporary neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|During the {{production}} of the 1916–17 series, it was observed that on one 2-cent plate, No. 7942, three of the 400 images had become noticeably worn. Two of these images were a vertical pair, appearing {{near the bottom of the}} top-left pane of 100; the remaining image appeared near the top of the bottom-right pane. When replacing these three images, the technician responsible (conceivably confused by the problems of working with mirror-image material, which can makes a 5 look like a 2) inadvertently transferred 5-cent images onto the three problem positions of the plate. This error was not noticed for several weeks, and eventually three different carmine-colored 5-cent stamps were distributed by the Post Office: the perforated 10 issue of 1916–17 (Scott #467), the imperforate issue of the same years (Scott #485), and the perforated 11 issue of 1917–20 (Scott #505). The imperforate version is by far the rarest of these, and few collectors <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> one.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E

25|$|I got my {{stopwatch}} {{going again}} {{to check the}} length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints {{of no more than}} 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check — and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport — something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front — and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.|$|E
500|$|Kenny also {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Gary, SpongeBob's meowing sea snail, and the narrator in the episode. According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention that the narrator be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, {{they found that the}} narrator [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to sound a little fun and playful." [...] Kenny said, [...] "'Eet ees the most amazing thing I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in my life.' We found that after a while we had to make the narrator a little more playful than that." ...|$|E

It was impossible for the Minnesota quarterback to handle Kipke's kicks. [...] Most of them went out of bounds some fifty yards from the line of scrimmage." ...|$|E
