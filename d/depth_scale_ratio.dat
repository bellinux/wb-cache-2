These new <b>depth</b> <b>scales</b> place coeval strata {{recovered in}} cores from different holes {{at a single}} site into a common stratigraphic framework. At Site 1150, double coring between Holes 1150 A and 1150 B occurred over only a short interval between ~ 703 and 713 meters below seafloor (mbsf), but this is sufficient to tie the upper portion of the stratigraphic section cored in Hole 1150 A to the lower portion cored in Hole 1150 B. The upper ~ 100 m of the sedimentary section at Site 1151 was double cored with the advanced piston corer and partially cored with the rotary core barrel, resulting in the complete recovery of this interval. The composite <b>depth</b> <b>scales</b> were constructed using Splicer software to vertically adjust the relative depths of various cores from one hole to the depths from another hole so as to align distinct physical properties measured on cores.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{previous}} studies have attempted to assess the sublimation <b>depth</b> <b>scales</b> of ice particles from clouds into clear air. Upon examining the sublimation <b>depth</b> <b>scales</b> in the Met Ofce Unied model (MetUM), {{it was found that}} the MetUM has evaporation <b>depth</b> <b>scales</b> of 23 times that of radar observations. Similar results can be seen in the ECMWF, RACMO and Météo-France models. In this study, we use radar simulation (converting model variables into radar observations) and 1 -dimensional explicit microphysics numerical modelling to test and diagnose the cause of the deep sublimation <b>depth</b> <b>scales</b> in the forecast model. The MetUM data and parametrization scheme is used to predict terminal velocity, which can be compared to the observed Doppler velocity. This can then be used to test the hypothesis for why the sublimation <b>depth</b> <b>scale</b> is too large within the MetUM. Turbulence could lead to dry air entrainment and higher evaporation rates; particle density may be wrong, particle capacitance may be too high and lead to incorrect evaporation rates or the humidity within the sublimating layer may be incorrectly represented. We show that the most likely cause of the deep sublimation zones is the incorrect representation of model humidity in the layer. This is tested further by using a 1 -dimensional explicit microphysics model, which tests the sensitivity of ice sublimation to key atmospheric variables and is capable of including sonde and radar measurements to simulate real cases. Results suggest that the MetUM grid resolution at ice cloud altitudes is not sufcient enough to maintain the sharp drop in humidity that is observed in the sublimatio...|$|R
