In the present investigation, basic studies were conducted using inclined pin-on-plate sliding tester {{to understand the}} effect of directionality of surface grinding marks of hard material on friction and transfer layer formation during sliding against soft materials. 080 M 40 steel plates were ground to attain different surface roughness with unidirectional grinding marks. Then pins made of soft materials such as pure Al, pure Mg and Al-Mg alloy were slid against the prepared steel plates. <b>Grinding</b> <b>angle</b> (i. e., the angle between direction of sliding and grinding marks) was varied between 0 degrees and 90 degrees in the tests. Experiments were conducted under both dry and lubricated conditions on each plate in ambient environment. It was observed that the transfer layer formation and the coefficient of friction, which has two components adhesion and plowing - depend primarily on the directionality of grinding marks of the harder mating surface, and independent of surface roughness of the harder mating surface. For the case of pure Mg, stick-slip phenomenon was observed under dry condition for all grinding angles and it was absent upto 20 degrees grinding angles under lubricated condition. However, for the case of Al, it was observed only under lubricated conditions for angles exceeding 20 degrees. As regards the alloy, namely, Al-Mg alloy, it, was absent in both conditions. For the case of pure Mg and Al, {{it was observed that}} the amplitude of stick-slip motion primarily depends on plowing component of friction.

Early ice spuds (before about 1925) often had wooden handles and a steel chisel fixed with a tang and collar or socket, similar to a carpenter's chisel. Ice spuds are still carried by many ice fishermen as a means to test ice thickness and safety; a single forceful thrust of the ice spud will often penetrate unsafe ice.|$|R

Firstly, we {{study the effects of}} the fiber dual tapered (DT) probe <b>grinding</b> <b>angle</b> on the SPR dynamic range. The results show that for larger grinding angles, the resonance wavelength increases, resulting in a higher testing sensitivity. By using this method, we can make the sensor operate in an optimal waveband. Secondly, {{on the basis of the}} results above, we grind the DT probe to be an asymmetric wedge shape to configure two grinding angles (6 &# 0176; and 17 &# 0176;) to realize the distributed sensing. Results show that, with the refractive index detecting a range of 1. 333 &# 8211; 1. 385, we can get two separated sensing zones, 591 &# 8211; 715 nm and 729 &# 8211; 966 nm, the testing sensitivity are 2385 nm/RIU and 4558 nm/RIU respectively. By using this method, we can detect multiple analytes in the same sensing area simultaneously, besides that we can also effectively compensate for the errors caused by background index interference, and the refractive index change resulting from the non-specific binding, or physical absorption and others. It worth to say that by using this method, we can adjust and control the resonance wavelength by changing the fiber <b>grinding</b> <b>angle,</b> while keeping the testing sensitivity is not reduced.

40|$|By {{combining}} a polymer-clad optic {{fiber and}} a vitreous-clad optic fiber, we proposed and fabricated a novel optic fiber surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor to conduct two-channel sensing {{at the same}} detection area. The traditional optic fiber SPR sensor has many disadvantages; for example, removing the cladding requires corrosion, operating it is dangerous, adjusting the dynamic response range is hard, and producing different resonance wavelengths in the sensing area to realize a multi-channel measurement is difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we skillfully used bare fiber grinding technology and reverse symmetry welding technology to remove the cladding in a multi-mode fiber and expose the evanescent field.

Present Situation and Development Trend of Grinding Equipment Grinding is a high power dissipation and inefficient operation, and the power of crushing operation accounting for 8 % to 12 %.

An empirical {{investigation into}} the transfer of prestress force from wire tendons to concrete in the end zones of pretensioned prestressed concrete beams was accomplished in this project. The experimental tests featured 56 small scale prestressed concrete beams. Some of the factors influencing prestress transfer which were considered in the current tests are as follows:(a) type of release - gradual, sudden or shock(b) surface condition of the wire - plain or indented(c) size of the wire(d) concrete compressive strength {{at the time of}} transfer(e) time dependent effectsMost of the tests involved gradual release of steel tendons with the prestressing force transferred in approximately ten equal increments. Sudden release in a single step was achieved by allowing the supporting abutments to retract rapidly. Shock release was implemented in some beams by <b>angle</b> <b>grinding</b> the wires. The type of release which gave the best quality of prestress transfer was gradual release. This was followed by sudden and shock releases respectively. There were four types of wires used in the laboratory tests: namely the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron indented, 7 mm dia. Plain and 7 mm dia. Belgian indented wires. Transmission lengths were determined from strain distributions for these wires. Pull-ins of the wire tendons at the ends of the beams were also measured. There was significant scatter in the experimental data. Different ranges of transmission lengths and pull-ins were obtained for the various types of wires used. Three equations were derived for the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron and 7 mm dia. Plain wires, which linearly correlated pull-ins to the transmission lengths. ++These relationships provide a qualitative and quantitative method of indirectly monitoring for the transmission lengths through the measurements of pull-in. Statistical inference tests proved that indented wires were superior in performance compared to plain wires, but the differences were more apparent for the pull-ins than for the transmission lengths. Comparisons on the influence of tendon size substantiated that greater pull-ins occurred for larger wires but the differences were not significant for the transmission lengths. For concrete strength at the time of transfer of less than 32 MPa, the transmission lengths and pull-ins were significantly larger than those for higher strengths. It is recommended that concrete strength at transfer be at least 32 MPa for pretensioned prestressed concrete. Apart from the maturity and strength of concrete, the quality of a mix also influenced the transmission length and there was limited data to suggest that a better grade mix despite having lower strength at a more tender age could outperform a lower grade mix with greater strength released after a longer curing period. Formulae for plain and indented wires were found by dimensional analysis which correlated the transmission length to the diameter of wire tendon and the stress/strength ratio of the prestressed beams. Pull-ins increased significantly over 6 months but the changes in the transmission lengths were small. Normalised longitudinal strain distributions did not indicate that transmission lengths would remain unchanged over time...|$|R
