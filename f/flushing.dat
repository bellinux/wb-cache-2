5|$|Another {{cause of}} concern for the censors was that Marion was shown <b>flushing</b> a toilet, with its {{contents}} (torn-up note paper) fully visible. No <b>flushing</b> toilet had appeared in mainstream film and television in the United States at that time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the west}} end of the {{platforms}} are the offices and dispatch tower for the IRT <b>Flushing</b> Line. Train crews report to the offices, while the dispatch tower dispatches trains and controls the <b>Flushing</b> Line. West of the station, the line rises from the tunnel via a portal at College Point Boulevard, and onto the elevated bridge across <b>Flushing</b> Creek.|$|E

50|$|In the deuce-to-five high , a 2-3-5 <b>flush</b> is {{the highest}} {{straight}} <b>flush</b> (higher than the 5-2-3 <b>flush</b> and any other trio except A-A-A). This variation makes sense as {{the odds of a}} straight <b>flush</b> is then evened up with the trio. This straight <b>flush</b> is normally referred as langdi.|$|R
25|$|<b>Flushes.</b> <b>Flushes,</b> {{because of}} their 'dog from every town' nature, {{frequently}} contain interesting fifteen-twos and runs, plus their count as a <b>flush.</b>|$|R
5|$|Even {{after the}} station opened in 1928, efforts {{to extend the}} line past <b>Flushing</b> persisted. In 1928, the New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) {{proposed}} allowing IRT trains to build a connection to use the Port Washington branch, but the IRT did not accept the offer since this would entail upgrading railroad crossings and the single-tracked line. Subsequently, the LIRR abandoned the branch in 1932. As part of the 1929 IND Second System plan, the <b>Flushing</b> Line would have had branches to College Point and Bayside east of Main Street. That plan was revived in 1939. The BOT kept proposing {{an extension of the}} <b>Flushing</b> Line past Main Street until 1945, when World War II ended and new budgets did not allow for a <b>Flushing</b> extension. Since then, several New York City Transit Authority proposals for an eastward extension have all failed.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Flushing</b> Line west of 103rd Street {{opened in}} 1917. The IRT agreed {{to operate the}} line under the {{condition}} that any loss of profits would be repaid by the city. As part of the agreement, the PSC would build the line eastward to at least <b>Flushing.</b> The station, as well as two other stations at Willets Point Boulevard and 111th Street, was approved in 1921 as part of an extension of the <b>Flushing</b> Line past 103rd Street. Construction of the station and the double-deck bridge over the <b>Flushing</b> Creek began on April 21, 1923, with the station built via cut-and-cover methods. The bridge was completed in 1927, and the station opened on January 21, 1928, over a decade after the line initially began operation.|$|E

50|$|Poker hands: Straights, <b>flushes,</b> full houses, and {{straight}} <b>flushes</b> may be played during five-card tricks. Each hand thus played must beat the previous hand according to standard poker rules (four-of-a-kind beats straight <b>flush</b> beats full house beats <b>flush</b> beats straight).|$|R
5|$|At Roosevelt Avenue {{a branch}} would be {{constructed}} off the IRT <b>Flushing</b> Line to Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown <b>Flushing</b> was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, <b>Flushing</b> community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in <b>Flushing</b> into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated <b>Flushing</b> Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E

25|$|Dual <b>flush</b> toilets {{allow the}} user to select between a <b>flush</b> for urine or feces, saving a {{significant}} amount of water over conventional units. The <b>flush</b> handle on some of these toilets is pushed up for one kind of <b>flush</b> and down for the other. In other designs, a segmented <b>flush</b> pushbutton is used; pressing the smaller section releases less water.|$|R
50|$|When ace-low {{straight}}s and ace-low straight <b>flushes</b> are not counted, the {{probabilities of}} each are reduced: straights and straight <b>flushes</b> each become 9/10 {{as common as}} they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight <b>flushes</b> become <b>flushes</b> and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.|$|R
50|$|A <b>flush</b> draw, or four <b>flush,</b> is a {{hand with}} four cards {{of the same}} suit that may improve to a <b>flush.</b> For example, K♣ 9♣ 8♣ 5♣ x. A <b>flush</b> draw has nine outs (thirteen cards of the suit less the four already in the hand). If you have a <b>flush</b> draw in Hold'em, the {{probability}} to <b>flush</b> the hand in the end is 34.97 percent if there are two more cards to come, and 19.56 percent (9 live cards divided by 46 unseen cards) if {{there is only one}} more card to come.|$|R
5|$|From April 1939 to October 1940, the Queens Boulevard Line {{served the}} 1939 New York World's Fair via the World's Fair Railroad. The World's Fair line ran via a {{connection}} through the Jamaica Yard and through <b>Flushing</b> Meadows–Corona Park along the current right-of-way of the Van Wyck Expressway. After calls from public officials such as Queens Borough President George Harvey {{to make the}} line a permanent connection to <b>Flushing</b> and northern Queens, the line was demolished in 1941.|$|E

40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) {{seems to}} be {{involved}} in hot <b>flushes</b> in women and in castrated men. Therefore, we studied whether the plasma concentrations of CGRP changed during <b>flushes</b> in a group of healthy aging men. Twelve men (49 - 71 years) with no history of current or former prostate cancer or hormonal treatment reporting greater than= 20 flushes/week were investigated. Blood samples were drawn during and between <b>flushes</b> for analysis of CGRP and also androgen concentrations, that is, testosterone and bioavailable testosterone were analysed. Skin temperature and skin conductance were monitored. Thirty-five <b>flushes</b> were reported by 10 men. The plasma concentrations of CGRP did not increase during <b>flushes.</b> No significant change in skin temperature or conductance was found. CGRP is probably not involved in the mechanisms of <b>flushes</b> in healthy aging men. Therefore, <b>flushes</b> in aging healthy men seem to be different from <b>flushes</b> in men and women deprived of sex steroids where CGRP increases during <b>flushes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ace-high {{straight}} <b>flush</b> or royal <b>flush</b> {{is slightly}} more frequent (4324) than the lower straight <b>flushes</b> (4140 each) because {{the remaining two}} cards can have any value; a King-high straight <b>flush,</b> for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as {{that would make it}} ace-high instead).|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to organized beagling, beagles {{have been used}} for hunting or <b>flushing</b> to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including snowshoe hare, cottontail rabbits, game birds, roe deer, red deer, bobcat, coyote, wild boar and foxes, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt stoat. In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, <b>flushing</b> game for hunter's guns.|$|E
