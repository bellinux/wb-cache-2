40|$|Based on the {{fundamental}} understanding of ink removal and fiber loss mechanism in flotation deinking process, we developed this innovative technology using surfactant spray {{to improve the}} ink removal efficiency, reduce the water and fiber loss, reduce the chemical consumption and carry over in the flotation deinking. The innovative flotation deinking process uses a spray to deliver the <b>frothing</b> <b>agent</b> during flotation deinking to control several key process variables. The spray can control the foam stability and structure and modify the fluid dynamics to reduce the fibers entrapped in the froth layer. The froth formed at the top part of the flotation column will act as a physical filter to prevent the penetration of <b>frothing</b> <b>agent</b> into the pulp suspension to eliminate fiber contamination and unfavorable deinking surface chemistry modification due to surfactant adsorption on the fiber surface. Because of the filter effect, frothing agents will be better utilized. Under the sponsorships of the US Dept. of Energy (DOE) and the member companies of the Institute of Paper Science and Technology, we studied the chem-mechanical mechanism of surfactant spray for flotation deinking using different furnishes, chemicals, and flotation devices {{in the past four}} years. In the final year of the project, we successfully conducted mill trials at Abitibi-Consolidated, Inc., Snowflake paper recycling operation of 100 % mixture of ONP/OMG. Results from laboratory, pilot-plant and mill trials indicated that surfactant spray technology can significantly reduce fiber loss in flotation deinking.

40|$|In froth {{flotation}} valuable particles are captured by bubbles {{and transferred to}} a froth layer where bubbles are in close proximity. Bubble coalescence frequently occurs in flotation, especially in the froth layer. The coalescence of two bubbles causes a release of energy, which may expel particles from the bubble surface. A series of experiments were carried out {{to determine the effect}} of bubble interfacial properties on the detachment of particles upon the coalescence of capillary-held bubbles of 2 mm in size. The interfacial properties of the bubbles were changed by the addition of low molecular weight alcohols, namely 1 -pentanol or methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC). Using esterified glass particles (θ = 43 °) with a 10 % and 90 % cumulative passing diameter of 47. 2 and 92. 5 μm, respectively, as model particles, it was found a certain concentration of frother, different for each additive, is needed in order to observe a reduction in the detachment of particles. In the presence of frother, the detachment was evaluated at approximately 65 % which was a considerable reduction in the detachment compared with the value of approximately 85 % found in the absence of frother. Frother molecules changed the properties of the air-water interface. Upon the coalescence of two bubbles, the release of energy caused the merged bubble to oscillate; effectively resulting in the detachment of particles. The addition of <b>frothing</b> <b>agents</b> augmented the elasticity of the bubbles, which appeared {{to be related to the}} detachment of particles. Whereas <b>frothing</b> <b>agents</b> are generally used to prevent bubble coalescence and stabilise the froth phase, only transient stability is imparted. The results suggested that an additional role of frothers in flotation is to decrease the detachment of particles from bubble surfaces. The type and concentration of frother can be strategically selected to improve metallurgical recovery as an economic incentive...|$|R
40|$|Coal, in India and Worldwide, is cleaned {{predominantly}} by {{dense medium}} separations and jigging. But {{when it comes}} to cleaning of fine coals such as mine dust, slack coal, washing rejects and slurries, froth flotation method of coal cleaning has better efficiency and handling. In this method of wet cleaning, froth is made in a flotation cell by bubbling air through water in presence of frothing agents; on addition, pure and light coal adhere to air bubble while the dirtier part sinks to bottom of the cell. Thus clean coal is recovered from the collected froth amount. Density and wettability can be termed as the two bases of separation which are the inherent properties of the coal. In this current project froth flotation was being carried in a fixed froth flotation cell used in the laboratory. Runs of froth flotation have been carried out using the same stock of coal but varying the size of coal fines, concentration of coal slurries and different doses of collecting agents and of their mixtures. In order to quantitatively measure the effect, ash rejection, combustible recovery and efficiency were calculated. Effect of size of particles in slurry was very much visible while the combustible recovery and ash rejection was enhanced when higher dose of collecting agents were used. Use of advanced <b>frothing</b> <b>agents</b> and pH controllers can be studied further in this direction...|$|R
40|$|The mineral {{processing}} industry {{relies heavily on}} froth flotation to beneficiate complex minerals. The performance of the process depends on a multitude of chemical reagents affecting the solid mineral particles {{as well as the}} air bubbles used to collect the valuable mineral particles. In flotation, bubbles and froths are transiently stable by the use of a <b>frothing</b> <b>agent</b> or the presence of inorganic electrolytes in the process water. This review presents the primary stages characterizing bubble coalescence. The effect of flotation reagents and inorganic electrolytes on the stability of bubbles and the mechanisms which delay the coalescence of bubbles are discussed. Recently it had been proposed that solid particles external to the flotation system may be intentionally added to stabilize the froth phase, which has attracted attention from the flotation community. This gave rise to additional studies on the topic. The final section of the paper was therefore designed to capture the progress made on this particular subject. The use of solid flotation aids offers a promising future to increase the recovery of valuable particles as these external particles may be customized. The advantage of solid particles over soluble reagents is that they may be recovered and re-used making them environmentally and economically attractive...|$|E
40|$|Coarse {{particles}} {{are more difficult}} to float. One of the factors that contributes to poor floatability is the stability of froth. The froth formed in industrial flotation cells is typically not strong enough to provide adequate support for coarse and dense particles. The present study investigates how the presence of hydrophobic submicron particles at low concentration increases the recovery of relatively coarse particles through improvement in the froth stability. Silica particles with d 80 of approximately 230 μm were floated in a laboratory mechanical flotation cell in a collector-free environment in the presence of poly(propylene glycol) 425 as a <b>frothing</b> <b>agent.</b> The hydrophobicity of the feed particles was modified through an esterification process with different alcohols ranging from 3 to 8 hydrocarbon groups to form a coating of intermediate hydrophobicity. Hydrophobised silica submicron particles of 300 nm in size were added to the flotation cell at 0. 01 and 0. 1 wt% concentration. The effect of electrolyte, sodium chloride, in the concentration range 10 ⁻⁵– 10 ⁻¹ M on the recovery of coarse particles was also investigated. For the feed employed, 1 -butanol was found to provide relatively good flotation properties with a possibility for improvement by stabilising the froth phase. Both additives slightly stabilised the froth phase, which resulted in an increase in the maximum recovery of up to approximately 8 %. It appeared that the additives had no significant effect on the first-order flotation rate constant...|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} methods for the {{separation}} of cenospheres from CFA. Traditionally, cenospheres were removed from CFA via float-sink in settling lagoons. This simple procedure allows potentially toxic elements to be leached and requires a large space and significant time (Hirajima et al. 2010). Alternatively, a triboelectric separation system was used (Gurupira et al. 2001) but this technique requires that the spheres have a specific gravity ≤ 1. Some solid silica particles with specific gravity of ≥ 1 may contain gas bubbles which over their specific gravity so that they mimic cenospheres during this process, rendering it less effective and attractive. Other studies that {{have looked at the}} extraction of cenospheres on a wet basis. In US Patent No. 4121945 (1978), CFA is mixed with water to form a slurry then a <b>frothing</b> <b>agent</b> is added and cenospheres lighter than water are skimmed. US Patent No. 4652433 (1987) looked at another method where CFA is separated into fine and coarse fractions and the coarse fraction is then mixed with water, subsequently the cenospheres are removed by skimming. These methods have some disadvantages. Wet processing caused environmental problems and imposed space restrictions. In addition, these methods only collect cenospheres with specific gravity ≤ 1.0; those that float on water. Also, these processes are not suitable for CFA that contains 10  % or more lime because high Ca bearing CFA (such as ASTM C 618 Class C fly ash) has cementations properties when mixed with water and when pozolanic reactions occur the material may harden. When using these wet methods many cenospheres can be trapped in agglomerated and/or hardened masses before flotation occurs. This problem was solved by a few recent US Patents (No. 0190327 A 1 2008, No. 8074804 B 2 2011, and No. 0050519 A 1 2012) where cenospheres were separated from CFA in a dry state by using air as the fluid media for the separation. In one of the processes, CFA is separated into narrow particle size fractions, followed by density separation using a fluidized bed of air, preferable in the absence of water by dry screening, and then an optional further particle size separation. The advantages of this technique are that it can yield nearly 100  % cenospheres and it avoids agglomeration of ash having high Ca content.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} study aims {{to identify the}} best way of processing colemanite concentrates, which is sometimes characterised by a high content of As sulphides, finely disseminated in the matrix of the boron mineral. Scanning Electron Microscopy analyses have been carried out to identify all the mineralogical constituents and to evaluate their distribution, frequency and mutual relationships. Colemanite concentrates are mainly used by chemical plants producing boric acid and gypsum. A high As content is unacceptable for further use of tailings coming from the leaching process and is very dangerous if the tailings are released into the environment. Grinding tests were conducted under dry and wet conditions in order to assess how As sulphide minerals are released from colemanite minerals. Some of the difficulties involved in obtaining selective liberation of As sulphides from colemanite minerals were overcome, although a certain decrease in As grade in the higher size classes was registered. All comminution products have been analysed by SEM, monitoring the degree of liberation of the mineralogical constituents. Flotation tests have been carried out, following different comminution flow sheets and adopting different modulating conditions in order to evaluate the influence of the following parameters: ! collector concentration versus contaminants concentration (As minerals) in the froths; ! kind and quantity of the <b>frothing</b> <b>agent</b> to maximise mineral recovery in the froths; ! kind and quantity of the modulating agents to maximise the selectivity of the process; ! conditioning modalities in order to obtain a suitable dispersion of fines and avoid segregation of Asbearing particles together with colemanite ones; ! solid/liquid ratio of the pulp to minimise the water flow into the plant. Information obtained from SEM analysis has been adopted to evaluate segregation phenomena in pulp and in flotation products. The influence of the chemical characteristics of industrial waters flowing in the flotation process has been investigated. On the basis of the results of all the experiments, performed under optimum operating conditions, it has been possible to model different process flow sheets with the objective of maximising of boron recovery and minimisation of both As recovery and As grade in the colemanite product. Results demonstrate how to obtain a level of As in the colemanite product suitable to yield, after the chemical process, a gypsum characterised by an As content acceptable for further industrial uses...|$|E
40|$|Activated carbon {{is widely}} used in the gold {{processing}} industry as an adsorbent for the gold cyanide complex, [Au(CN) (subscript) 2]. However, many other processing reagents are also adsorbed (termed fouling), which compete with the gold cyanide complex for active sites on the carbon. So far {{the only way of}} assessing the amount of fouling due to organic compounds that has adsorbed on the carbon is through the use of thermogravimetry (TG). Unfortunately, thermogravimetry only gives the percentage total of organic fouling agents adsorbed and no information can be obtained on the identity of the individual organic fouling agents. Thus this current work reports the development of analytical methods capable of identifying specific fouling agents. In this thesis the identification of two types of common organic fouling agents adsorbed on activated carbon during gold processing has been established using three thermal analysis techniques, namely thermal desorption-pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-py-GC-MS), thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS), and thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) spectroscopy. TD-py-GC-MS was used to identify the individual decomposition gases of each sample. TG-MS and TG-FTIR were used to obtain the decomposition temperatures of the fouling agents, and to identify/monitor the gases evolved as a function of temperature. All analyses were performed in an inert atmosphere. The organic fouling agents studied were xanthates and frothing agents, which are used as flotation reagents. The xanthates studied were sodium ethyl xanthate (SEX), sodium isobutyl xanthate (SiBX), potassium ethyl xanthate (PEX), and potassium amyl xanthate (PAX). The frothing agents studied were polypropylene glycol (PPG), polypropylene glycol methyl ether (PPGME), alpha-terpineol, and methyl isobutyl carbinol (MiBC). The thermal decomposition of ++each pure reagent was studied, and then the reagents were individually adsorbed on an activated carbon (Haycarb, - 45 mu m) and their thermal decomposition reinvestigated. These pure systems were then compared to the thermal decomposition of activated carbon samples taken from two gold processing plants. Between seven and sixteen gases were identified via TD-py-GC-MS for the decomposition of each xanthate. Common gases and types of gases identified included carbonyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, thiols, alcohols, carbonates, sulfides, disulfides, and carbonothioic acid, O,S, dialkyl esters. The thermogravimetric curve of each xanthate displayed two mass losses. The mass losses and their corresponding temperatures were dependent on the alkyl chain and alkali cation of the xanthate. TG-MS and TG-FTIR showed carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide were the most significant gases evolved from the decomposition of each xanthate. Each xanthate was adsorbed on activated carbon, and its thermal decomposition characteristics reinvestigated. On heating, similar gases were evolved to those detected for the xanthate alone. However, the TG curves displayed three mass losses compared to two with the xanthates not adsorbed on activated carbon. The first mass loss of each sample was attributed to a hydrolysis reaction between water retained in the activated carbon and the xanthate. TG-MS and TG-FTIR analyses showed carbon disulfide and carbonyl sulfide were the most significant gases evolved during the first mass loss and second mass losses respectively, and consequently these gases could be used as indicators of xanthate fouling on plant samples. The TD-Py-GC-MS, TG-MS, and TG-FTIR analyses of the frothing agents showed these compounds mainly boiled with little indication of thermal decomposition. The thermogravimetric curve of each frother displayed one mass loss. Upon reinvestigation of ++the frothing agents individually adsorbed on activated carbon, a number of different gases were identified by the TD-py-GC-MS analyses. For all adsorbed frothing agents (except MiBC) these included propanal, 2 -ethyl- 4 -methyl 1, 3 -dioxolane, 3, 3 -oxybis- 2 -butanol, and dioxanes. Each TG curve displayed one mass loss due to the decomposition of the <b>frothing</b> <b>agent.</b> The TG-MS and TG-FTIR analyses showed propanal was the most significant gas evolved for the PPG and PPGME. For alpha-terpineol, propene was also a significant gas, although this gas was not detected by TG-FTIR. The TD-py-GC-MS and TG-FTIR analyses of the MiBC showed it mainly boiled off the carbon without significant alteration. Four activated carbon samples were obtained from different parts of the process circuit in the Three Mile Hill plant in Western Australia. Nine to twelve gases were identified by TD-py-GC-MS analysis of each sample. Common gases included butene, 2 -methyl-I-butene, and butanol. The TG curve of each sample displayed one mass loss due to the presence of fouling agents. TG-MS analyses showed butene was the most significant gas evolved for this mass loss. TG-FTIR analyses showed that carbonyl sulfide had also evolved during this mass loss. Thus it was concluded from the detection of carbonyl sulfide and its temperature of evolution, that fouling of the activated carbon by a xanthate had occurred. Five activated carbon samples were obtained from the Salsigne plant in France. Nine to fourteen gases were identified by TD-py-GC-MS analysis of each sample. Common gases included cyclopropane, butene, propanal, isobutanol, isoarnyl alcohol, and 2, 5 and 2, 6 -dimethyl dioxene. The TG curve of each sample displayed one mass loss due to the decomposition of fouling agents, in the same temperature region as the Three Mile Hill samples. TG-MS analyses showed cyclopropane was the most significant gas evolved ++for this mass loss. TG-FTIR analyses showed that carbonyl sulfide had also evolved during this mass loss. Thus it was concluded from the detection of propanal, carbonyl sulfide, and their temperatures of evolution that fouling of the activated carbon by a xanthate and a <b>frothing</b> <b>agent</b> had occurred respectively. A comparison of the techniques showed that TD-py-GC-MS analysis was essential for unambiguous identification of the complex gas mixture obtained from decomposition of organic fouling agents. Unfortunately TD-py-GC-MS provided no information on mass losses or temperatures of gas evolution. TG-MS permitted the monitoring of evolved gases versus temperature via their molecular ions. However the molecular ion signals were affected by overlapping fragment and/or isotope ion signals. The TG-FTIR was most useful when the evolved gases gave an infrared adsorption that was very characteristic of the molecule, as for the identification of carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide. This work was successful as a combination of the analytical techniques enabled identification of fouling agents adsorbed on plant samples...|$|E
