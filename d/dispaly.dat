It is commonly believed that the coarse-scale configurational information in a lexical context is more familiar to readers and therefore facilitates the identification of its component letters. Aiming at reassessing the character superiority effect in the Chinese language, this thesis first reports an empirical study determining the fundamental factor of stimulus presentation size by establishing the optimal retinal image size in normal Chinese reading. It then presents a series of experiments which examined if the Chinese character superiority can be obtained by using the stringent Reicher-Wheeler task and carefully manipulated stimulus conditions which featured impairment of spatial configuration information of characters to various degrees. The thesis further presents a study which investigated the character superiority effect in lateralized display and its neural correlates by comparing the event-related potenials (ERPs) to characters versus character-like stimuli. The findings show the character superiority over pseudocharacters and several types of character-like stimuli in central and lateralized <b>dispaly.</b> More importantly, a temporal-spatial profile was established for Chinese character recognition.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which the slow phase {{velocity}} (SPV) of nystagmus elicited by a vertical optokinetic stimulation with constant velocity could be modulated by sinusoidal angular motion in the vertical plane was investigated under normal gravity condition and during the microgravity period of parabolic flight. In normal gravity, when the angular head motion and the optokinetic stimulation were in the same direction, the peak SPV was slower than the velocity of the optokinetic display. When the head motion and the optokinetic stimulation were in opposite directions, the peak SPV was equal to the velocity of the optokinetic display. In microgravity, the peak SPV was approximately equal to the velocity of the optokinetic display when head rotation and optokinetic stimulation were in the same direction, and was faster than the velocity of the optokinetic <b>dispaly</b> when head rotation and optokinetic stimulation were in opposite directions.

40|$|The Streptococcus genus {{includes}} several pathogenic species, such as S. mutans, the main responsible of dental caries, and the non pathogen S. thermophilus, {{used for the}} manufacture of dairy products. These fermenting bacteria are facultative anaerobes, as they tolerate moderate oxygen concentrations; however, Streptococci possess some crucial enzymes for the defence against ROS. The thioredoxin system is the key element for repairing cellulardamages caused by ROS, as it preserves the reduced state of cytosolic proteins. This work addresses the molecular and functional characterization of the thioredoxin components in S. mutans and S. thermophilus, to evaluate how this repairing system works in these sources. Usually, the thioredoxin system is composed by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) and its natural substrate thioredoxin (TrxA) and uses NADPH as electron donor. The redundant putative genes encoding TrxB and TrxA in the S. mutans and S. thermophilus genome were analysed and the corresponding recombinant proteins were purified. In particular, a single TrxB was obtained from either S. mutans (SmTrxB) or S. thermophilus (StTrxB 1), whereas two TrxA were prepared from either S. mutans (SmTrxA and SmTrxH 1) or S. thermophilus (StTrxA 1 and StTrxA 2). The functionality of the recombinant enzymes was tested through specific biochemical assays. Indeed, both SmTrxB and StTrxB 1 reduced the synthetic substrate DTNB {{in the presence of}} NADPH; conversely, among the four streptococcal thioredoxins, only SmTrxA and StTrxA 1 accelerated the insulin reduction in the presence of DTT. The combined activity of the streptococcal thioredoxin components was tested through the insulin precipitation in the absence of DTT, in order to reconstitute the thioredoxin system. The assay is functioning with the combination of SmTrxB or StTrxB 1 with either SmTrxA or StTrxA 1. These results suggest that the streptococcal members of the thioredoxin system <b>dispaly</b> a direct functional interaction between them and that these protein components are interchangeable within the Streptococcus genus. In conclusion, our data prove the existence of a functioning thioredoxin system even in these microaerophiles...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change in}} polar regions will likely disrupt the {{fine-tuned}} trophic interactions among organisms in Arctic marine ecosystems. Modifications in prey phenology and composition {{as well as}} increased competition and predation from boreal species expanding their range northward are expected to affect the key Arctic fish species polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and thus have important repercussions on the Arctic marine food web. Aside from climate, the extreme seasonal light variations at high latitudes are important for phenology and foraging. Endemic Arctic organisms such as polar cod may be adapted to these drastic light variations whereas, non-endemic species may be confronted with {{a new set of}} environmental variables that could limit their northward range expansion {{in the context of a}} warming Arctic climate. In order to assess the ability of polar cod to cope with future changes in marine Arctic ecosystems, it remains important to understand their dietary plasticity. The main goal of this study was to investigate the flexibility of polar cod feeding strategies across seasons by documenting its temporal position on the generalist-specialist spectrum. Polar cod were harvested on the western and northern coast of Svalbard in September, October, January, and May in fjords influenced by Arctic water masses and fjords influenced by Atlantic water masses. The organisms’ stomach contents were extracted and analysed and prey species were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Specimens were expected to experience marked seasonal variability in their feeding success and foraging strategy. Polar cod feeding success was observed to be seasonally heterogenous, with winter specimens <b>dispalying</b> a higher probability of having empty stomachs compared to specimens from the fall or the spring. Seasonality affected polar cod diet in terms of ingested prey composition with fall specimen from Arctic domains feeding primarily on the hyperiid amphipod Themisto libellula. This suggests that larger demersal polar cod ascended in the water column in the fall to forage on this pelagic prey. The important contribution of fish prey throughout sites in the winter highlighted a flexible size-biased diet and the potential ability to switch diet to a temporarily abundant resource. Polar cod adopted a population specialist strategy in the fall and an individual specialist strategy in the winter. Therefore, the opportunistic feeding strategy adopted by polar cod is affected by seasonality insofar as diet is limited to a few preferred prey in the fall and diversified during the polar night likely as a results of visual constraints on selectivity of preferred prey...|$|R

The term fan is {{used for}} {{machines}} imparting only a small increase in pressure to a flowing gas. Fans are widely used in industrial and commercial applications. From shop ventilation to material handling to boiler and computer applications, fans are critical for process support and human health. The purpose of a fan is to raise the pressure of a gas flow and to deliver a given mass or volume flow rate. The first of the requirements thus classes fans as diffusing machines whose aim is to convert fluid kinetic energy into pressure. There are two primary types of fans: axial and centrifugal. An axial flow fan moves air or gas parallel to the axis of rotation. By comparison, a centrifugal or radial flow fan moves air perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Axial flow fans, while incapable of developing high pressures, they are well suitable for handling large volumes of air at relatively low pressures. Axial flow fans are better suited for low-resistance, high-flow applications, whereas centrifugal flow fans apply to high-pressure resistance, low-flow conditions. Axial fans can have widely varied operating characteristics depending on blade width and shape, number of blades and tip speed. Axial fans are used for creating a pressure difference. This difference creates a reduction of flow rate of fan so the similar reduction {{can be seen in}} the power of fan. This study will try to design a new axial flow fan design. Based on to the study, a new axial flow fan will be designed. What is more, there are different types of axial flow fans. These axial fans are; propeller fans, tubeaxial fans, vaneaxial fans and 2 -stage axial flow fans. However, tubeaxial fan will be discussed and designed in this study. The tubeaxial fan is a propeller fan mounted in a cylindrical tube or duct and is often called a duct fan. Since, the design will have a purpose for the wind tunnel, it will have some special requirements. Fan will have been adequate aerodynamic characteristics when the design finished. It will have enough aerodynamic blade shapes to get best efficiency and volumetric flow. It is only comprised by the rotor. Moreover, it needs a shaftpower to supply sufficient volumetric flow but the power will not exceed a certain number. Since, there is a restriction for the power and it has an upper limit, 10 kw for the power. While doing this project’s aim, some methods will be applied to the study during the analysis. Solving such a problem can be complex and too long but there is enough time to deal with it. The work packages start with researching about the subject which can be named as literature review. The literature knowledge is very important such these studies. The design parameters, dimensions, efficiencies can be defined with searching the similar articles, studies. The first step of the design is using the basic aerodynamic relationships. The requirements and the initial parameters are known. If analytical equations solved using with these parameters, it will give an initial idea about the design. This step is called meanline design. Meanline design results give the dimensions of the blades, angles of the blades and inlet and exit parameters. Therefore, the results obtained from the meanline design have to be checked for reasonable values. The design moves to the next stage so the next step comes up with two dimensional analysis. At this stage, the governing equations of fluid motion (Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations) solution that enables computational fluid dynamics method is utilized. The computational fluid dynamics investigate the flow field, volumetric flow rate and chemical reactions. The method solves the mathematical equations and gives an idea of the flow. In this study, CFD will be used to calculate the performance of an axial flow fan. A logical control volume is necessary for the solution of fluid motion. That’s why coarse and fine mesh is created. However, this section takes too much time because it is repeated several times and this is the reason why two dimensional analysis {{is used for}} this step. Quick solutions in two dimensions have been obtained and the results give an idea about the design and the impact of the profile. This step is called blade to blade computational fluid dynamic analysis. The object of a blade to blade method is to calculate the blade surface velocity distribution and the outlet angle for a given three dimensional cascade. The interaction between the airfoils and the fluid s motion can be understand using this method. The specification of the blades for an axial flow fan is at the important place of fan design. Blade to blade flow determines the airfoil shape, volumetric flow, exit static pressure etc. For the blade to blade surface at a particular spanwise position the local blade shape does not fix the outlet flow direction or pressure rise. These are determined by the whole blade and not just the spanwise section being considered. There is wide agreement on the general equations of continuity, momentum, energy, etc., governing the flow and the methods differ in the numerical techniques used for solving the equations and applying the boundary conditions. In this study, blade to blade analysis of the fan blade profiles apply three different points in the radial direction. The three airfoils are investigated for the fan performance. These two points are located in the root and tip of the blade. The third point is the mid point but not in the mid point of the radial direction. It is located in circumferentially % 50 area averaged point. This is a case formed of the turbomachinery software. When the results of the balde to blade analysis does not match with the requirements, the design has some modifications like blade inlet and exit angles or etc. These modifications are done to get the requirements of the study, such as mass flow or the efficiency. All of the modifications are called optimization of the design. This is done for the most of the designs in turbomachinery system but fans are not too complicated systems according to the compressors or turbines. That’s why it can need less modifications compare to them and this is back to the project as the gain of time. To understand the ultimate impact and results can be <b>dispalyed</b> as the final step is applied to three dimensional analysis. This application takes long time to design a new axial fan so this design step takes place in the last rank of the process. Three dimensional computational fluid dynamics analysis, applying a model closer to a real simulation. In three dimensional analysis, it has been created and provided the opportunity to review the impact more realistic. Three dimensional CFD analysis can determine the losses mostly because of the boundary layer effect, incidence losses, airfoil losses etc. All of these parameters effect the efficiency of the fan. Therefore, it can give closer efficiency to real performance of the fan. All in all, meanline design is the one dimensional analytical solution. It gives exactly the results which must have requirements at the end of the design. One dimensional analysis is just the beginning point of the design. Then, two dimensional analysis, blade to blade analysis shows the airfoil effect. When such a project is decided to design, throughflow and blade to blade CFD analysis apply to the project. Nevertheless, the throughflow analysis does not need to do for this study and this is the reason of throughflow analysis that this project does not include the throughflow. As a result, the design continues with the three dimesional CFD to be sure that it supplies the volumetric flow rate. When the design finished, the study does not encompass any test chance. Thus, the reliable results are depend on the CFD results, especially three dimensional analysis. As a consequence, this study shows a new axial flow fan design steps and the interactions of the results. The steps are done with a turbomachinery software to get quick results and there are too many softwares doing the same job. Especially, the companies which are related with turbomachinery or aircraft engine develop their own softwares. This project was done by one of them. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
