40|$|Abstract—Coverage area is an {{important}} performance metric for RFID systems, especially those used for inventory manage-ment. As such, there are a range of methods being developed to try to increase the coverage area of RFID systems without requiring additional costly and power hungry RFID readers. Most existing approaches to increase coverage employ RFID readers with multiple antennas, but this creates problems in deployment and in {{the timing of the}} RFID tag reads from the different antennas. In this paper, we propose a different approach to extend the coverage area of a single reader, using a ZigBee-based, battery-operated device we call an <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> to cooperate with the RFID reader on reading the RFID tags. The <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> is also compatible with existing RFID range extension methods for additional increase in coverage. We implement an <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> hardware platform and evaluate the performance of the system in terms of coverage extension, and we provide estimates of the lifetime achievable for different tag access scenarios. Our experiments show that each low cost, easily deployable <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> can increase the coverage area by about 70 %, and that they last for about 1. 5 months if the tags are accessed twice an hour to upwards of 4 years if they are accessed once a day, as is sufficient for many inventory management applications.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that ATM available bit rate (ABR) service can provide low-delay, fairness, and high throughput, and can handle congestion effectively inside the ATM network. However, network congestion is not really eliminated but rather it is pushed out {{to the edge of the}} ATM network, packets from TCP sources competing for the available ATM bandwidth are buffered in the routers or switches at the network edges, causing severe congestion, degraded throughput, and unfairness. This poor performance is mainly due to the uncoordinated interaction between the congestion control mechanism of TCP and ATM. It is well accepted that some form of cooperation at <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> would help to control TCP traffic flow over ATM more effectively. We have previously proposed the fair intelligent explicit window adaptation (FIEWA) scheme and fair intelligent ACK bucket control (FIABC) scheme. The key idea is to combine the feedback information from the receiver, from the underlying ATM network, and from the local information at the <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> intelligently to explicitly/implicitly control the TCP rate. We present a comparative simulation study on our schemes with other established schemes; to identify the characteristics of each different scheme; and to indicate the requirement for a fairer, simpler and more robust coherent approach at the <b>edge</b> <b>device.</b> Department of Electronic and Information EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|R

50|$|For LDP, {{a method}} of subdividing a VPLS VPN into two or three tiered {{hierarchical}} networks was developed. Called hierarchical VPLS (HVPLS), it introduces {{a new type of}} MPLS device: the multi-tenant unit (MTU) switch. This switch aggregates multiple customers into a single PE, which in turn needs only one control and data plane connection into the mesh. This can significantly reduce the number of LDP sessions and LSPs, and thus unburden the core network, by concentrating customers in <b>edge</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E
50|$|Slats, {{also known}} as leading <b>edge</b> <b>devices,</b> are {{extensions}} {{to the front of}} a wing for lift augmentation, and are intended to reduce the stalling speed by altering the airflow over the wing. Slats may be fixed or retractable - fixed slats (e.g. as on the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch) give excellent slow speed and STOL capabilities, but compromise higher speed performance. Retractable slats, as seen on most airliners, provide reduced stalling speed for take-off and landing, but are retracted for cruising.|$|E

In this paper, we investigate the issues surrounding hierarchically layered network QoS signalling configurations, as e. g. {{can be found in}} RSVP over ATM signalling. After introducing and discussing these issues we conclude that many of the decisions involved require understanding the performance characteristics of such layered signalling configurations. We therefore describe the implementation of an RSVP/ATM <b>edge</b> <b>device,</b> which we then use to conduct measurements in a configuration that involves in effect three layered signalling protocols: RSVP and ATM’s UNI and PNNI. Using these measurements we review the issues in layering signalling protocols and reinforce design decisions being taken for the <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> mediating between the different mechanisms of the two network QoS architectures...|$|R

50|$|Unlike the Series 10, the Series 30 had leading <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> {{to reduce}} the landing speeds at higher landing weights; full-span slats reduced {{approach}} speeds by 6 knots despite 5,000 lb greater weight. The slats were lighter than slotted Krueger flaps, since the structure associated with the slat is a more efficient torque box than the structure associated with the slotted Krueger. The wing had a six percent increase in chord, all ahead of the front spar, allowing the 15 percent chord slat to be incorporated.|$|E
50|$|The {{devices and}} {{facilities}} in the core / backbone networks are switches and routers. The trend is to push the intelligence and decision making into access and <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> and keep the core devices dumb and fast. As a result, switches {{are more and more}} often used in the core/backbone network facilities. Technologies used in the core and backbone facilities are data link layer and network layer technologies such as SONET, DWDM, ATM, IP, etc. For enterprise backbone network, Gigabit Ethernet or 10 Gigabit Ethernet technologies are also often used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>devices</b> may {{translate}} {{between one}} type of network protocol and another. For example, Ethernet or token ring types of local area networks (LANs) or xDSL equipment may use an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) backbone to other core networks. ATM networks send data in cells and use connection-oriented virtual circuits. An IP network is packet oriented; so if ATM {{is used as a}} core, packets must be encapsulated in cells and the destination address must be converted to a virtual circuit identifier. Some new types of optical fibre use a Passive optical network subscriber loop such as GPON, with the edge device connecting to Ethernet for backhaul (telecommunications).|$|E
