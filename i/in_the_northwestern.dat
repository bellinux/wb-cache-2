5|$|Often found {{lying on}} the bottom buried in sediment, the roughtail {{stingray}} is a generalist predator that feeds {{on a variety of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos receiving nourishment initially from yolk, and later from histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>northwestern</b> Atlantic, females bear an annual litter of 4–6 young in fall and early winter, after a gestation period of 9–11 months. By contrast, in the Mediterranean there is evidence that females bear two litters of 2–6 young per year after a gestation period of only four months. Rays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>northwestern</b> Atlantic are also larger at birth and at sexual maturity than those from the Mediterranean. The venomous tail spine of the roughtail stingray is potentially dangerous to humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern overall and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>northwestern</b> Atlantic, where it is not commercially utilized. However, in the Mediterranean and southwestern Atlantic it is subject to heavy fishing pressure and has been assessed as Near Threatened.|$|E
