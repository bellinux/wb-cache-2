5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of groups of Jews venerating Ezra to an extent greater than mainstream Judaism, which <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> the interpretation that the verse merely speaks {{of a small group of}} Jews. The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E

His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire {{emotional}} responses in the player that other games are lacking. Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does not think that it <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s, 5 H type were {{experimentally}} <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs of 5 different patterns. 376 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Simens Schukert pantograph, 377 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Fischer bow collector, 378 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an ASEA pantograph, 379 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Metropolitan Vickers pantograph and 380 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an English Electric pantograph. The pantographs on 376, 379 and 380 {{were all}} fitted {{on a small}} pantograph tower while 377 and 378 had their pantographs mounted on the roof itself. During the experiments, the pantographs were only used on the reserve track section {{which at the time}} was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a railway-like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway-style overhead used {{on the rest of the}} system. Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit pantograph operation, the pantographs fitted all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased. Ironically, all the surviving H type trams were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs 50 years later in October 1986.|$|R
5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> an emphasis on chastity {{and other forms of}} self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{the role}} of clave in salsa music, Charley Gerard states: “The clave feeling is in the music {{whether or not the}} claves are {{actually}} being played.” Every ostinato part which spans a cycle of four main beats, has a specific alignment with clave, and expresses the rhythmic qualities of clave either explicitly or implicitly. Every salsa musician must know how their particular part <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> clave, and with the other parts of the ensemble.|$|E
25|$|John P. Meier {{views the}} crucifixion of Jesus as {{historical}} fact and states that, {{based on the}} criterion of embarrassment, Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader. Meier states {{that a number of}} other criteria, e.g., the criterion of multiple attestation (i.e., confirmation by more than one source) and the criterion of coherence (i.e., that it <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> other historical elements) help establish the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical event.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the Gundestrup cauldron {{was the work of}} multiple silversmiths. Using scanning electron microscopy, Benner Larson has identified 15 different punches used on the plates, falling into three distinct tool sets. No individual plate has marks from more than one of these groups, and this <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> previous attempts at stylistic attribution, which identify at least three different silversmiths. Multiple artisans would also explain the highly variable purity and thickness of the silver.|$|E

25|$|The two fetuses found {{buried with}} Tutankhamun {{have been proven}} to be his children, and the current theory is Ankhesenamun is their mother. Not enough DNA {{was able to be}} {{retrieved}} from the mummies in KV21 to make positive identities of the queens. Enough DNA was pulled to show that the mummy known as KV21a fits as the mother of the two fetuses in Tutankhamun's tomb. The assumption that she is Ankhesenamun <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> her being the only known wife of Tutankhamun in the historical record.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, when wires {{are added}} symmetrically between the split rings, a {{passband}} occurs within the previously forbidden {{band of the}} split ring dispersion curves. That this passband occurs within a previously forbidden region indicates that the negative εeff for this region has combined with the negative μeff to allow propagation, which <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> theoretical predictions. Mathematically, the dispersion relation leads to a band with negative group velocity everywhere, and a bandwidth that is independent of the plasma frequency, within the stated conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} in the ancient sources does not make clear how {{the relation between the}} two principles should be understood. They do, however, consistently accord the One a higher status than the Indefinite Dyad and consider only the One as absolutely transcendent. This implies a monistic interpretation of the two principles and <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> assertions in the dialogues that suggest a monistic philosophy. Plato's Meno says that everything in nature is related, and the Republic states that there is an origin (archḗ) for all things, which can be grasped by reason.|$|E

25|$|Studies such as Belief in Conspiracy Theories {{state that}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{relating to the}} assassination of JFK, the moon landing and the September 11th attacks are united by a common thread: distrust of the government-endorsed story. This leads the believer to attach other conspiracies as well. Someone with a distrust of the government will likely reject any and all stories or reports directly issued by state agencies or other authorities that are {{seen as part of}} the establishment. Thus, any conspiracy will seem more plausible to the conspiracy theorist because this <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> their worldview.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} of the colony was promoting a transition from horizontal farming which largely ignored terrain to contour farming which <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> the frame and women, who {{did most of the}} agricultural work, resisted the transition. At the same time an unfounded rumor spread that the Kom traditional land would be sold to either the chairman of the KNC or to Igbo people in Nigeria (the KNC at this point had a platform of having the region join with Nigeria). The KNDP organized their efforts in the region emphasizing the women as key in the political situation.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a theory}} that the younger lady is Meritaten, {{daughter}} of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and wife of Smenkhare, based on {{a study of the}} alleles inherited by Tutankhamun. The theory goes that Meritaten married Smenkhare, believed to be her uncle. Thereby making Tutankhamun a maternal grandson of Akhenaten. The theory holds weight as inbreeding makes it harder to distinguish the generations, but there is one problem with this theory. Meritaten must be a mitochondrial descendant of Queen Tiye, or her mother Thuya, as the younger lady's mitochondrial DNA <b>fits</b> <b>with</b> her being Tiye's daughter. Nefertiti's lineage is nowhere specified, and if Meritaten is the younger lady, Nefertiti must be a mitochondrial relation of Thuya.|$|E
