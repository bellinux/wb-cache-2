The new Buzz then chooses to remain behind with Zurg, who has revealed himself as Buzz's father. Accompanied by three toy Aliens, Andy's toys steal a pizza planet delivery truck, and follow Al to the airport, where they enter the baggage <b>handling</b> <b>system.</b> Stinky Pete rips Woody's arm during a struggle, but Andy's toys overthrow Pete, where he ends up into a little girl's backpack.

5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E

25|$|The baggage <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> is {{the largest}} system and also the deepest in the world; it has a {{capacity}} to handle 8,000 bags per hour. The system includes 21 screening injection points, 49 make-up carousels, 90km of conveyor belts capable of handling 15,000 items per hour at a speed of 27km/h, and 4,500 early baggage storage positions. The entire system is located beneath the taxiway area. High-speed conveyors transport the items of baggage in individual trays, which permits better control at high speeds and leads to quicker passenger check-in and 100 percent accurate baggage tracking.|$|E

In the inventory of the marketthe internet has been used because it is there the latest information can be found.

40|$|Abstract. Case <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> offer a {{solution}} to the lack of flexibility and adaptability in workflow management systems. Because they are data driven they potentially provide good support for Product Based Workflow Design (PBWD). In this paper we investigate to which degree current case <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> (FLOWer and Activity Manager) are able to support PBWD. This is done by elaborating the design process of a case from industry in both systems. From this evaluation we concluded that current case <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> are not yet completely ready for supporting PBWD. Therefore, we recognize that better tool support is needed to make PBWD more suitable for practical use. ...|$|R

An optional main deck side cargo door (like the 747-400M (Combi)) allows loading of dimensionally taller cargo modules. A lower deck ("belly") side door allows loading of unit load devices (ULD) up to 163cm in height. Boeing delivered 126 Boeing 747-400F aircraft with no unfilled orders as of November 2009.

50|$|Though the {{original}} model {{from which the}} <b>Handle</b> <b>System</b> derives dealt with management of digital objects, the <b>Handle</b> <b>System</b> does not mandate any particular model of relationships between the identified entities, nor is it limited to identifying only digital objects: non-digital entities may be represented as a corresponding digital object {{for the purposes of}} digital object management. Some care is needed in the definition of such objects and how they relate to non-digital entities; there are established models that can aid in such definitions (e.g., Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), CIDOC CRM, and indecs content model. Some applications have found it helpful to marry such a framework to the handle application: for example, the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative brings together <b>Handle</b> <b>System</b> application with existing standards for distributed learning content, using a Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), and the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system implementation of the <b>Handle</b> <b>System</b> has adopted it together with the indecs framework to deal with semantic interoperability.|$|R
