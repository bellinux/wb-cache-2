50|$|Oberlin, {{was born}} the son of Johann Georg Oberlin (1701-1770), a teacher, and Maria Magdalena (1718-1787), {{daughter}} of lawyer Johann Heinrich Feltz, on the 31 August 1740 in the german speaking city of Strasbourg, where he studied theology. In 1766 he became Protestant pastor of Waldbach (now Waldersbach), a remote and barren region in the Steinthal (Ban de la Roche/Steintal), a valley in the Vosges on the borders of Alsace and Lorraine. Oberlin set himself to better the material equally with the spiritual condition of the inhabitants. He began by constructing roads through the valley and erecting bridges, inciting the peasantry to the enterprise by his personal example. He introduced an improved system of agriculture. Substantial cottages were erected, and various industrial arts were introduced. He founded an <b>itinerant</b> <b>library,</b> originated infant schools, and established an ordinary school {{at each of the}} five villages in the parish. In the work of education he received great assistance from his housekeeper, Louisa Scheppler (1763-1837).He practiced medicine among them, founded a loan and savings bank and introduced cotton manufacture.|$|E
5000|$|The first really {{practicable}} traveling library plan {{seems to}} have been started by Samuel Brown in East Lothian, Scotland, in 1817, though it is stated that the principle had been used with some Scottish parish libraries as early as 1810. Brown procured 200 selected volumes [...] "about two-thirds of which were of a moral and religious tendency, while the remainder comprised books of travel, agriculture, the mechanical arts and popular sciences." [...] Four libraries of 50 volumes each were stationed in Aberlady, Salton, Tyninghame and Gawald. In 20 years these libraries had increased to 3,850 volumes, distributed through 47 villages. Jean Frédéric Oberlin is said to have founded <b>itinerant</b> <b>libraries</b> in his parish of Waldersbach in the Vosges Mountains {{at about the same time}} that the East Lothian libraries were established. Both of these early plans barely survived their founders.|$|R
40|$|The {{communication}} {{is intended to}} expose and analyze the model of library used for the startup of the national network of public libraries in Portugal {{in order to identify}} their strengths and weaknesses in the optics of the political, economic and organizational framework. The first part exposes the situation of Portuguese public libraries during the 1980 ’s, {{at the beginning of the}} democratic period, which is characterized by the lack of public library services provision and the stagnation of existing libraries. The awareness of the unsustainable situation of Portuguese libraries and the change of political and economic context of the country are conjugated in order to generate a political will to develop a national policy for the public libraries and to promote a change of the librarian reality throughout the national territory. In parallel,operates the library network of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation that in collaboration with some Portuguese municipalities offers <b>itinerant</b> and fixed <b>library</b> services and whose reality is analyzed in the optical network structure and cooperation relationship with the local administration. In a second stage of analysis, we try to identify the constraints that, since an initial phase, affected the consolidation of public libraries of the national network and the capacity of organizational adaptation to the changes of the informational context...|$|R
40|$|Short {{after the}} World War II, Italy became a Republic. However, also, during the Reign of Italy (1861 - 1946), the Italian Republicans {{promoted}} {{a program for}} the secular and republican education of the people. In particular, the Italian Republican freemasons, in the first decades after the unification of Italy, promoted the popular education {{as a means for}} the construction of the "new citizen". They attempted to eliminate the hegemony of Catholic education and lead Italy towards secularization and modernization, as well as, happened in the other European states, such as France. During that process, great influence had the thought of Mazzini on the Grand Masters of Grand Orient of Italy (Frapolli, Mazzoni, Petroni, Lemmi, Nathan and Ferrari). For Mazzini, young people had to be trained in accordance with religious and a-confessional aims that made them capable of obeying without perceiving the duty as an external imposition, to improve themselves and consequently the society. The school had to be an instrument of progress and democracy, opened to all and, at least in the elementary grades, accessible to all. Equally important was to improve civic and professional training of the people and women to make them active players in history. Along this direction, the Italian Freemasonry was engaged to direct action in Parliament and in local government, through its representatives, and financed the creation of schools, "educatori", recreation centers in opposition to the Catholic schools and oratories. The Grand Orient of Italy (GOI) financed also libraries, night schools, charitable institutions, sports associations and cultural clubs; moreover, GOI supported the "League for the education of the people" (Lega per l’insegnamento popolare), founded in Belgium in 1860 and, after, widespread in France, whose main business activity was to establish <b>itinerant</b> <b>libraries</b> for the people.
