5000|$|In {{industry}} the selvage may be {{thicker than}} the rest of the fabric, and is where the main weft threads are reinforced with a tight weft back binding to prevent fraying. More simply, they [...] "finish" [...] the left and right-hand edges of fabric as it exits the loom, especially for the ubiquitous [...] "criss-cross" [...] simple or tabby weave, referred to in industry as taffeta weave. Selvages on machine-woven fabric often have little holes along their length, through the thick part, and can also have some fringe. The type or motion of selvage depends on the weaving technique or loom used. A water- or air-jet loom creates a fringed selvage that is the same weight as the rest of the cloth, as by the weft thread is drawn via a jet nozzle, which sends the weft threads through the shed with a pulse of water. The selvage is then created by a <b>heat</b> <b>cutter</b> which trims the thread at both ends close to the edge of the cloth, and then it is beaten into place. Thus it creates a firm selvage with the same thickness as the rest of the cloth.|$|E
40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>cutter</b> is a {{tool for}} {{processing}} styrene forms. Since blades of cutters are steal wires, user can freely bend them. We think this operation is intuitive for 3 D shape modeling. IGEL virtually realizes {{the operation of the}} heat cutters by a sketch input system. IGEL has two different modes, 2 D and 3 D modes, and users can switch them freely. In 2 D mode, users can draw the shapes of cutters freely. In 3 D mode, users can cut the styrene forms using their own cutters. Our implementation represents the styrene forms as triangular meshes, and cuts the meshes according to the userâ€™s operation...|$|E
50|$|Among {{the methods}} of fusing are using an {{electrically}} <b>heated</b> rope <b>cutter,</b> <b>heating</b> the blade of a knife, or melting cut ends in a flame. The cool (transparent) part of a butane lighter flame works best.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} very large objects of arbitrarily complexity from various high density polymers, a hybrid {{approach has been}} developed in which layers are individually machined and then stacked together. The layers are obtained by moving a <b>heated</b> <b>cutter</b> blade along {{the periphery of the}} layer. The adjustable tool is held by a controllable gripper and manipulated by a sculpturing robot. During motion the shape of the blade is continuously adapted to the target geometry for the layer. Thus extremely thick layers are obtained, compared to conventional techniques. The synchronous control of the shape of the cutter blade is a multilevel optimization problem, involving 1) finding the shape of the blade that suffices to the minimum energy principle, 2) minimizing the deviation between shape curves on the layer and the blades profile curve, 3) finding the best fitting region of the blades profile curve for various curvature characteristics, 4) finding the best tool positions and the optimum tool path. Based on a proper mathematical formulation, we have developed numerical methods that enable us to investigate feasibility of thicklayered fabrication of various products. Graphical simulation of the machining process demonstrates the practical applicability of the TLOM technology to automatic shape fabrication...|$|R
25|$|The company I. G. Farben began {{manufacturing}} polystyrene in Ludwigshafen, about 1931, {{hoping it}} would be a suitable replacement for die-cast zinc in many applications. Success was achieved when they developed a reactor vessel that extruded polystyrene through a <b>heated</b> tube and <b>cutter,</b> producing polystyrene in pellet form.|$|R
