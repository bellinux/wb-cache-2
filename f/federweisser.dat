5000|$|<b>Federweisser</b> (also <b>Federweißer</b> , from German Feder, [...] "feather", and weiß, [...] "white"; {{from the}} {{appearance}} of the suspended yeast), is an alcoholic beverage, typically 4 percent alcohol by volume, but it's not uncommon to see <b>Federweißer</b> in the region of 10 percent alcohol by volume. It is the product of fermented freshly pressed grape juice, known as must. The term in principle includes all stages of fermentation from must to finished wine.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the date}} of the grape harvest, it is {{available}} from early September to late October, and is generally served together with savoury food. The classic combination is <b>Federweißer</b> and Zwiebelkuchen, although <b>Federweißer</b> and chestnuts is also popular.|$|E
50|$|Due to the carbonation, <b>Federweißer</b> tastes quite refreshing, {{not unlike}} a light grape soda or a sweet {{sparkling}} wine. As fermentation progresses, however, <b>Federweißer</b> may increasingly assume a darker, often amber-like or light brown hue. In general, <b>Federweißer</b> is made from white grapes; when made from red grapes, the drink is called Federroter, Roter Sauser, or Roter Rauscher. Federroter is less common than Federweißer.Because of rapid fermentation, <b>Federweißer</b> can not be stored for long and should be consumed {{within a few days}} of purchase. As carbonic acid is constantly produced, the bottles can not be sealed airtight and have a permeable lid (they would burst otherwise). They must be stored in an upright position to allow the gas to continuously escape from the bottle and to prevent spilling.|$|E
50|$|Progressing {{fermentation}} {{was also}} a challenge in transporting bottled <b>Federweisser</b> over long distances {{before the advent of}} modern-day commercial traffic and refrigerated vehicles, the latter of which are needed to slow down the yeast's metabolism during transport. Therefore, in the old days, <b>Federweisser</b> was almost exclusively available (and, for the most part, known) in and around wine-growing regions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Federweißer</b> {{contains}} yeast, {{lactic acid}} bacteria, {{and a large}} amount of vitamin B1 and B2.|$|E
5000|$|... (Note that, in Switzerland, {{this same}} term has a {{completely}} different meaning. There, <b>Federweisser</b> refers to a white wine made from red grapes, typically pinot noir.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Culinary Wine Trail is held on {{the fourth}} weekend in September, running through the town’s vineyards. Winemakers and gastronomical {{businesses}} offer traditional Palatine cooking, Mediterranean dishes, wine and <b>Federweisser.</b>|$|E
50|$|Very famous is {{also the}} Swabian Zwiebelkuchen which {{is very similar to}} the French Quiche Lorraine. It is usually eaten in late summer and autumn {{together}} with <b>Federweisser</b> or already fermented apple juice.|$|E
50|$|Franconian <b>Federweißer,</b> is an {{alcoholic}} beverage, made of freshly pressed grape juice. Typically it has about 4 percent alcohol by volume. The term in principle includes {{all stages of}} fermentation from must to finished wine.|$|E
5000|$|During plum season {{a common}} main dish is [...] "Grumbeersupp und Quetschekuche" [...] which is potato soup and plum cake and for dessert Kerscheplotzer is served. Another {{seasonal}} dish is Zwiebelkuchen which is commonly served with <b>Federweisser</b> in autumn.|$|E
50|$|Wine {{is common}} in Lower Franconia around the River Main. Franconia {{is one of the}} German quality wine regions, and the wine of Franconia is {{typically}} bottled in bulbuous Bocksbeutel-bottles and the region is as wine-growing area especially famous for its white whine Silvaner, Bacchus and Riesling and the dry red wine Domina. During grape harvesting the <b>Federweisser</b> is very known also supra-regional.|$|E
50|$|Once yeast {{has been}} added, grapes begin to ferment rapidly. The sugar {{contained}} in the grapes is broken down into alcohol and carbon dioxide (glycolysis). As soon as an alcohol content of four percent has been reached, <b>Federweißer</b> may be sold. It continues to ferment until all the sugar has been broken down and an alcohol content of about ten percent has been reached.|$|E
50|$|Despite high must weights {{the wine}} {{tends to be}} very low in acid. The {{finished}} wine has an intense aroma reminiscent of Muscat and tends {{to be used in}} blending rather than a varietal wine, however the flavour is reminiscent of Gewürztraminer. Many Siegerrebe wines are high in extract and yellow-green to golden yellow in colour. Because Siegerebe ripens early, it is sometimes used for <b>Federweisser</b> early in the German harvest season.|$|E
50|$|Winegrowing in Neuleiningen has tradition. There {{are several}} wineries in the {{municipality}} whose existence {{goes back to}} the 18th century. They make both white wines (Riesling, Chardonnay, Pinot blanc, Müller-Thurgau) and red wines (Pinot noir, Dornfelder, Pinot Meunier, Blauer Portugieser). Some wines are aged in oaken casks. Smaller areas are also planted with new grape varieties. In autumn, <b>Federweisser</b> is on offer at the wineries, and at Christmastime, they also have mulled wine made with their own products.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is known}} as Suser, Sauser, Neuer Süßer (new sweet), or Junger Wein (young wine) in Southwest Germany, Switzerland and South Tyrol, Fiederwäissen in Luxembourg, Sturm (storm, from the cloudy appearance) in Austria, <b>Federweißer</b> in Bavaria, Neuer Wein (new wine) in the Palatinate, Bremser in Franconia, burčiak in Slovakia, burčák in Czech Republic, vin bourru or vernache in France, must in Romania, must or karcos in Hungary, [...] "მაჭარი" [...] (machari) in Georgia, [...] "մաճառ" [...] (machar) in Armenia.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979 another album, [...] "Nové mapy ticha" [...] was released, which {{introduced}} shorter {{songs and}} some more accessible lyrics (which was, however, even more apparent on several subsequent albums). The backing band was named Burčiak (<b>Federweisser)</b> {{and with this}} group Ursiny released also another album [...] "Modrý vrch", which {{is considered to be}} his best by the most of his fans and the critics. By this time he had written music to various films, including popular television musical [...] "Neberte nám princeznú" [...] (Don't take the princess away from us), with its songs performed by singers Marika Gombitová, Miroslav Žbirka and Marie Rottrová. Songs from this musical are for sure most remembered by the people from all the music ever written by Ursiny.|$|E
50|$|The Roth men’s singing club “Sangeslust”, {{founded by}} the first village schoolteacher who lived in Roth, has existed since 1895. Its tuneful and community-promoting {{activities}} continue to form {{an important element in}} the municipality’s life, whether they be for celebrations, jubilees or burials. After the bridge on the Autobahn offered its shelter from the rain, the club’s Waldfest (“forest festival”) became a much-loved Brückenfest (“bridge festival”) held on the first weekend in May. Beginning in 1983, there was a women’s club in the village that brought younger women together, and their activities became part of the kermis (church consecration festival, held in Roth on the first Sunday and Monday after 1 September, Saint Giles’s day). On the occasion of Roth’s 800th anniversary (of first documentary mention) in 1987, a cooking and baking book was published containing regional specialities. Unfortunately, the women’s club folded in 1989. In 1982, municipal council dedicated the renovated Backes (standard German: Backhaus - bakehouse) with a hearty Backesfest. Ever since, this festival has been bringing locals and fanciers from the surrounding villages together on the first weekend in October with its <b>Federweisser</b> and Pellkartoffeln (potatoes boiled in their jackets) with liverwurst. The Backes also lays on fresh bread, Quetschenkuchen (a cake made with the variety of plum known as Quetsche or Zwetschge - Prunus domestica domestica) and Backeskrumbere (“bakehouse potatoes”) made the old-fashioned way. Roth also has a local history club (Heimatverein Roth), a volunteer fire brigade, a German-French friendship club in connection with Roth’s partnership with Saint-Nicolas-lès-Cîteaux (Deutsch-Französischer-Freundeskreis Roth e.V.) and a fire brigade promotional association (Feuerwehrförderverein Roth e.V.).|$|E
