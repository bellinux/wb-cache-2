50|$|The dual {{instances}} of US 95A remained {{in place for}} several years. With Utah having discontinued its portions of Alternate US 50 in the early 1970s, Nevada officials were able to reassign the US 50A designation. Current Alternate US 50 came into existence {{around the time of}} Nevada's state highway renumbering in 1976. While the new number was posted along the road circa 1977 and first seen on Nevada's state highway map in the 1978 <b>edition,</b> the <b>designation</b> had yet to be formally approved. Interestingly, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO, which governs the assignment of U.S. Highway numbers) finally approved the routing at a highway numbering committee meeting held on April 25, 1997, nearly 20 years after US 50A was first signed.|$|R
