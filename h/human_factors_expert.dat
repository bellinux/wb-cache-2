40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{different}} levels of user performance, different types of information are processed and users will make different types of errors. Based on the error’s immediate cause and the information being processed, usability problems can be classified into three categories. They are usability problems associated with skill-based, rule-based, knowledge-based levels of performance. In this paper, a user interface for a Web-based software program was evaluated by two groups- <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> <b>experts</b> and users. The experiment discovered that <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> <b>experts</b> are more effective than users in identifying usability problems associated with skill-based and rule-based levels of performance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intraoperative {{surgical}} {{crisis management}} is learned in an unstructured manner. In aviation, simulation training allows aircrews to coordinate and standardize recovery strategies. Our {{aim was to}} develop a surgical crisis simulation and evaluate its feasibility, realism, and validity of the measures used to assess performance. METHODS: Surgical trainees were exposed to a bleeding crisis in a simulated operating theater. Assessment of performance consisted of a trainee's technical ability to control the bleeding and of their team/human factors skills. This assessment was performed in a blinded manner by 2 surgeons and one <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> <b>expert.</b> Other measures consisted of time measures such as time to diagnose the bleeding (TD), inform team members (TT), achieve control (TC), and close the laceration (TL). Blood loss was used as a surrogate outcome measures. RESULTS: There were considerable variations within both senior (n = 10) and junior (n = 10) trainees for technical and team skills. However, while the senior trainees scored higher than the juniors for technical skills (P = 0. 001), there were no differences in human factors skills. There were also significant differences between the 2 groups for TD (P = 0. 01), TC (P = 0. 001), and TL (0. 001). The blood loss was higher in the junior group. CONCLUSIONS: We have described the development of a novel simulated setting for the training of crisis management skills and the variability in performance both in between and within the 2 groups...|$|E

40|$|Conducting {{research}} within virtual environments poses unique challenges {{when trying}} to measure mental effort and visually induced motion sickness. Determining how much mental effort an individual is exerting at any given point has historically been reserved for a <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> <b>expert</b> review and self-report such as NASA-TLX. When using an objective measure of mental effort via electrodermal activity (EDA), the subjective piece of this measure no longer carries the entire burden of proof. This research explores whether electrodermal activity (EDA) {{can be used as}} a successful indicator of mental effort for a single user in a controlled environment while performing scenario-based tasks. Additionally, EDA will be explored as a potential predictive measure of visually induced motion sickness within virtual environments. Two studies were conducted to contribute to this research. The first study observed 28 participants in a combine vehicle simulator and showed there is a decrease in EDA levels over time as familiarity with the system increases. The second study included 57 participants who navigated a visually disruptive virtual maze using a 3 D head-mounted display. This study demonstrated a positive correlation between EDA and reported sickness in the first half of the study and a positive correlation between EDA and mental effort in the second half of the study.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Evidence {{from other}} professions {{suggests}} that training in teamwork and general cognitive abilities, collectively described as non-technical skills, may reduce accidents and errors. The relationship between non-technical teamwork skills and technical errors was studied using a behavioural marker system validated in aviation and adapted {{for use in}} surgery. METHOD: 26 elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies were observed. Simultaneous assessments were made of surgical technical errors, by observation clinical human reliability assessment (OCHRA) task analysis, and non-technical performance, using the surgical NOTECHS behavioural marker system. NOTECHS assesses four categories: (1) leadership and management, (2) teamwork cooperation, (3) problem-solving and decision-making, (4) situation awareness. Each subteam (nurses, surgeons and anaesthetists) was scored separately {{on each of the}} four dimensions. Two observers - one surgical trainee and one <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> <b>expert</b> - were used to assess intra-rater reliability. RESULTS: The mean NOTECHS team score was 35. 5 (95 % C. I. +/- 1. 88). The mean subteam scores for surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses were 13. 3 (95 % C. I. +/- 0. 64), 11. 4 (95 % C. I. +/- 1. 05), and 10. 8 (95 % C. I. +/- 0. 87), respectively, with a significant difference between surgeons and anaesthetists (U = 197, p = 0. 009), and surgeons and nurses (U = 0. 134, p <or= 0. 001). Inter-rater reliability was found to be strong (alpha = 0. 88). There were between zero and six technical errors per operation, with a mean of 2. 62 (95 % C. I. +/- 0. 55), which were negatively correlated with the surgeons situational awareness scores (rho = - 0. 718, p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Non-technical skills are an important component of surgical skill, particularly in relation to the development and maintenance of a surgeon's situational awareness. Experience from other industries suggests that {{it may be possible to}} improve the ability of surgeons to manage their own situation awareness, through training, intraoperative briefings and intraoperative workload management.

40|$|Many {{aircraft}} accidents/incidents investigations cite crew error as {{a causal}} factor (Boeing Commercial Airplane Group 1996). Human factors experts suggest that crew error has many underlying causes {{and should be}} the start of an accident investigation and not the end. One of those causes, the flight deck design, is correctable. If a flight deck design does not accommodate the human's unique abilities and deficits, crew error may simply be the manifestation of this mismatch. Pilots repeatedly report that they are "behind the aircraft", i. e., they do not know what the automated aircraft is doing or how the aircraft is doing it until after the fact. Billings (1991) promotes the concept of "human-centered automation"; calling on designers to allocate appropriate control and information to the human. However, there is much ambiguity regarding what it mean's to be human-centered. What often are labeled as "human-centered designs" are actually designs where a <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> <b>expert</b> has been involved in the design process or designs where tests have shown that humans can operate them. While such designs may be excellent, they do not represent designs that are systematically produced according to some set of prescribed methods and procedures. This paper describes a design concept, called Wings, that offers a clearer definition for human-centered design. This new design concept is radically different from current design processes in that the design begins with the human and uses the human body as a metaphor for designing the aircraft. This is not because the human is {{the most important part of}} the aircraft (certainly the aircraft would be useless without lift and thrust), but because he is the least understood, the least programmable, and one of the more critical elements. The Wings design concept has three properties: a reversal in the design process, from aerodynamics-, structures-, and propulsion-centered to truly human-centered; a design metaphor that guides function allocation and control and display design; and a deliberate distinction between two fundamental functions of design, to complement and to interpret human performance. The complementary function extends the human's capabilities beyond his or her current limitations - this includes sensing, computation, memory, physical force, and human decision making styles and skills. The interpretive (or hermeneutic, Hollnagel 1991) function translates information, functionality, and commands between the human and the aircraft. The Wings design concept allows the human to remain aware of the aircraft through natural interpretation. It also affords great improvements in system performance by maximizing the human's natural abilities and complementing the human's skills in a natural way. This paper will discuss the Wings design concept by describing the reversal in the traditional design process, the function allocation strategy of Wings, and the functions of complementing and interpreting the human...|$|E

We investigated the <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> focus, reasons for not considering <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> and consequences of missing <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> in safety management. The results revealed an immature focus and organization of <b>Human</b> <b>Factors.</b> Expertise on organizational ergonomics and cognitive ergonomics are missing from companies and safety authorities and are poorly prioritized during the development.
