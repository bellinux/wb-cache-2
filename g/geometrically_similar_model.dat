40|$|Storage {{capacity}} of hydropower reservoirs is lost due to sediment deposition. The problem is severe in projects located on rivers with high sediment concentration during the flood season. Removing the sediment deposition hydraulically by drawdown flushing {{is one of}} the most effective methods for restoring the storage capacity. Effectiveness of the flushing depends on various factors, as most of them are site specific. Physical/mathematical models can be effectively used to simulate the flushing operation, and based on the results of the simulation, the layout design and operation schedule of such projects can be modified for better sediment management.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the expenditure of oxygen to walk per unit distance at an intermediate speed is minimized, by definition optimal walking, was investigated to characterize optimal walking in humans with variations in individual walking speeds. Oxygen uptake and step rate（SR）were measured among 7 young male subjects walking at an increasing speed from 16. 7 to 131. 7 m min− 1 with 5 m min− 1 increments every 1 min on a level treadmill. Measurements of leg length（L）were also made and step length（SL）was calculated by dividing walking speed by SR. The hip joint angle（θ）was calculated {{as a function of}} both L and SL such that θ＝ 2 sin−［ 1 SL（／ 2 L）］ deduced from a mathematical <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> <b>model</b> of pendulum−like legs.

The stifflegged model demonstrated that the pathway of the trunk during optimal walking with a swing leg angle of 46 deg was approximately maintained at an even level by the counteracting effects of the leg decline and the heel rise. These results suggest that the minimum oxygen cost of transport during optimal walking was achieved by the mechanism underlying the maximum interchange between the gravitational−potential and kinetic energy for the body with an even level of the trunk that reduces extra muscular work needed against internal and external resistance, as well as against gravit...|$|E

Examples are elevation, stream length, basin perimeter, drainage area, and volume. The concept of geometric similarity can be applied to drainage basins just as it is to many systems. Most readers would be aware of model-prototype studies of aircraft, dams, and turbo machinery. Such studies involve considerations as well as dynamic similarity. In the same manner that inferences as to the operation of a prototype can sometimes be drawn from a <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> <b>model,</b> inferences can also be drawn about the operation of one drainage area on the basis of information obtained from a similar one.

40|$|Hydropower is a renewable, {{reliable}} and highly efficient source of energy. Hydropower {{has the ability}} to run as a base load and to adjust load rapidly. This makes hydropower suitable for coupling with other renewable energy sources to stabilize frequency fluctuations. This ability has been used increasingly over the last decade due to the deregulation of the electricity markets and the introduction of other renewable energy sources, such as wind power. These changes have involved a substantial increase in the load variations and frequent start-stops. Such operating conditions may lead to unnecessary stresses and losses in turbines. Throughout the world, hydropower is the largest renewable source of energy. Currently, {{there is a need for}} refurbishment of old hydropower plants because most of them have reached the end of their design period. Efficiency may be improved by upgrading these older turbines. During the design or refurbishment phase of turbines, model testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are the main tools available to predict, test and verify the performance as well as to investigate the flow characteristics. The use of CFD in the design and refurbishment process is becoming increasingly popular due to its flexibility, detailed flow description and cost effectiveness compared to model testing, which has been used over the last century of turbines development. However, issues still must be resolved due to the combined flow physics involved in hydropower machines, such as flow turbulence, separation, vortices, unsteadiness, swirl flow, strong adverse pressure gradients, convoluted geometry and numerical artifacts. Therefore, experimental data in such complicated systems are required to validate the numerical simulations and develop more accurate models. This thesis presents an experimental and numerical investigation performed on a reaction type axial water turbine. The investigation was performed on a model known as the Porjus U 9. It is a <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> <b>model</b> of the prototype turbine produced on a 1 : 3. 1 scale. The main objectives were to characterize the flow phenomena in this modern Kaplan turbine model, to build a data bank for the validation of the CFD tools and to study the scale-up between the model and prototype, because the corresponding prototype is available for similar experiments. The investigation was performed at three different operating points: part load, best efficiency point (BEP) and high load. The technique used to investigate the flow was laser Doppler anemometry. The investigation was performed with time- and phase-averaged velocity measurements in several sections of the turbine where different periodic and non-periodic flow phenomena were captured. Some engineering quantities were also calculated to describe the turbine characteristics, such as the pressure recovery factor and the swirl number. At off-design operations, vortex breakdown was present. The numerical analysis of the model is also presented, where several RANS turbulence models were tested. The aim was to evaluate the capability of the turbulence models to predict the flow physics in the water turbines at the BEP. Validation was made with the experimental results in order to extend the range of confidence in the CFD results.

We present an alternative representation, volume-encoded UV-maps, in which each point on the surface is mapped to a uv position which is solely a function of its 3 D position. This function is tailored for a target surface: its restriction to the surface is a parametrization exhibiting high quality, e. g. in terms of angle and area preservation; and, near the surface, it is almost constant for small orthogonal displacements. The representation is applicable {{to a wide range of}} shapes and UV-maps, and unlocks several key advantages: it removes the need to duplicate vertices in the mesh to encode cuts in the map; it makes the UVmap representation independent from the meshing of the surface; the same texture, and even the same UV-map, can be shared by multiple <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> <b>models</b> (e. g. all levels of a LoD pyramid); UV-maps can be applied to representations other than polygonal meshes, like point clouds or set of registered range-maps.

40|$|From {{a theory}} {{developed}} on a quasi-one-dimensional-flow basis, {{it is found}} that the stability of the ram jet is dependent upon the instantaneous values of mass flow and total pressure recovery of the supersonic diffuser and immediate neighboring subsonic diffuser. Conditions for stable and unstable flow are presented. The theory developed in the report is in agreement with the experimental data of NACA-TN- 3506 and NACA-RM-L 50 K 30. A simple theory for predicting the approximate amplitude of small pressure pulsation in terms of mass-flow decrement from minimum-stable mass flow is developed and found to agree with experiments. Cold-flow tests at a Mach number of 1. 94 of ram-jet models having scale factors of 3. 15 : 1 and Reynolds number ratios of 4. 75 : 1 with several supersonic diffuser configurations showed only small variations in performance between <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> <b>models.</b> The predominant variation in steady-flow performance resulted from the larger boundary layer in the combustion chamber of the low Reynolds number models. The conditions at which buzz originated were nearly the same for the same supersonic diffuser (cowling-position angle) configurations in both large and small diameter models. There was no appreciable variation in stability limits of any of the models when the combustion-chamber length was increased by a factor of three. The unsteady-flow performance and wave patterns were also similar when considered on a reduced-frequency basis determined from the relative lengths of the model. The negligible effect of Reynolds number on stability of the off-design configurations was not anticipated in view of the importance of boundary layer to stability, and this result should not be construed to be generally applicable.

The tests were carried out on two large scale 1 / 10 and 1 / 20 <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> cold <b>models</b> of the Lagisza 966 MWth supercritical CFB boiler. The proposed set of dimensionless quantities allowed the Lagisza 966 MWth CFB boiler to be closely modeled by cold models.

That suggests that the choice of the scale of a cold model is not without effect on the macroscopic movements of solids in the riser.

Using two <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> CFB <b>models,</b> pressure fluctuations were recorded while the full set of similitude parameters were matched under a broad range of operating conditions. The method of data acquisition and analysis is shown to be very important in order to observe the significant frequency phenomena. Under relatively dilute conditions similar power spectral density and Bode plot profiles are observed in the two <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> beds. The dominant frequency under these dilute conditions is inversely proportional to the characteristic CFB dimension. Under conditions of higher solids loading, an additional lower bed frequency phenomena is observed in the spectrum which may be a function of the depth of the lower dense bed in the CFB. It is evident from the results that under some operating conditions, a single dimensionless frequency is not sufficient to validate the achievement of similitude using pressure fluctuations.

40|$|Linear weirs are {{a common}} {{hydraulic}} structure {{that have been used}} for centuries with many different applications. One characteristic of weirs that is particularly useful is the head-discharge relationship where the discharge over the weir {{is directly related to the}} upstream water depth above the crest. In general, the head-discharge relationship for a weir is determined experimentally in laboratories using <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> <b>models.</b> Due to space, time, money, and discharge capacity limitations at water laboratories, creating full scale models is not always a feasible option when determining head-discharge relationships for large prototype weirs. It is typically more cost effective to create a scale model than to build a full scale model or conduct tests on the prototype. Because of this fact, physical modeling has been one the most important tools in determining head-discharge relationships for weirs. However, as the physical size of the model decreases, size scale effects associated with surface tension and viscosity forces can significantly affect the results from the physical model and cause the results to differ from what would actually occur at the prototype scale. Therefore, it is important to understand what affects surface tension and viscosity forces have on the head-discharge relationship for different size weirs and when those effects are no longer negligible. The purpose of this research was to evaluate size scale effects for linear weirs. Weirs models of three different crest shapes (flat-top, quarter-round, and half-round) were constructed and tested at four different <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar</b> sizes [weir heights (P) = 24 -, 12 -, 6 -, and 3 -in]. This was done in order to evaluate how size scale effects affect the head-discharge relationship as model size decreases for different crest shapes. Discharge coefficients were calculated for relative upstream head values ranging from 0. 01 ≤ Ht/P ≤ 2. 0 for vented and non-vented conditions. Nappe aeration behavior was documented and compared to determine where differences in the nappe trajectory occurred as a result of scale effects. Comparisons were made with data from others researchers to determine if the recommendations for minimum head limits were similar to the results from this study. This study examined the errors in the discharge coefficient associated with size scale effects and suggested limits to avoidance depending on model scale and crest shape...|$|R

Displacement profiles showed decreasing movement rates with depth in Model 1 (one-sided freezing) but plug-like displacements of the active layer over a shearing basal zone in Model 2 (two-sided active layer freezing). Volumetric transport rates were approximately 2. 8 times higher for a given rate of surface movement in the permafrost model compared with the non-permafrost model.

Thus, congruent objects are always <b>geometrically</b> <b>similar,</b> but similar objects may not be congruent, as they may have different size.|$|R
