Direct {{quenching}} (DQ) {{is one of}} {{the latest}} process routes in production of ultra-high strength, high performance steels and Ruukki one of the pioneering companies in the utilization of direct quenching. Ruukki has applied direct quenching for the production of ultra-high-strength structural steels in the form of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> <b>and</b> plate. The paper briefly summarizes the physical metallurgy fundamental of direct steels and shows some selected examples of the microstructures and properties of steels produced by direct quenching.

40|$|Abstract. The {{precipitation}} {{of copper}} in the non-oriental electrical steel was studied in this article. These precipitation particles, which influenced both the texture {{development and the}} magnetic properties of the steel sheets, appeared in the <b>hot-rolling</b> <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> {{grew up in the}} later normalization process. Their composition, morphology and crystallography had been investigated using TEM. Differed from the MnS and AlN that studied in the previous papers, these precipitate particles were found to be CuAl 2. It suggested that these particles might stimulate the recrystallization nucleation of the { 110 } oriented grains and restrain the development of { 111 } oriented grains in the sheet of non-oriented electrical steel.

40|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} {{intelligent}} parameter estimation {{algorithm is proposed}} for predicting the strip temperature during laminar cooling process. The algorithm combines a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) with grey case-based reasoning (GCBR) {{in order to improve}} the precision of the strip temperature prediction. In this context, the hybrid genetic algorithm is formed by combining the genetic algorithm with an annealing and a local multidimensional search algorithm based on deterministic inverse parabolic interpolation. Firstly, the weight vectors of retrieval features in case-based reasoning are optimised using hybrid genetic algorithm in ofï¬�ine mode, and then they are used in grey case-based reasoning to accurately estimate the model parameters online. The hybrid intelligent parameter estimation algorithm is validated using a set of operational data gathered from a <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> laminar cooling process in a steel plant. Experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the precision of the strip temperature prediction. The proposed method can be used in real-time temperature control of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> <b>and</b> has potential for parameter estimation ofdifferenttypesofcoolingprocess...|$|R

40|$|Centerline {{segregation}} {{occurs as}} a positive concentration of alloying elements in the mid-thickness region of continuously cast slab. Depending upon its severity, it may affect mechanical properties and potentially downstream processing such as weldability, particularly for high-strength line pipe. The segregation fraction in continuously cast slabs <b>and</b> corresponding <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>strips</b> was assessed on API 5 L grade X 65 line pipe steels with different levels of segregation, rated as Mannesmann 2. 0 and 1. 4. The {{results showed that the}} segregation fraction in <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> samples was in accordance with that assessed in the cast slabs, and the segregated regions in <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> samples were found to be discontinuous. Transverse and z-direction CVN impact tests were conducted on the two <b>strips</b> <b>and</b> the results showed that centerline segregation does have an influence on the Charpy impact properties of line pipe steel. Specimens located at segregated regions exhibited lower Charpy impact toughness <b>and</b> <b>strips</b> rolled from slabs with higher segregation levels are more likely to exhibit greater variability in Charpy impact toughness. The influence of centerline segregation on z-direction Charpy impact toughness is more severe than on transverse Charpy impact toughness. Lower Charpy impact toughness and brittle fracture surface with cleavage facets along with rod-shaped MnS inclusions were observed for the strip rolled from slab with 2. 0 segregation rating if the Charpy specimens were located at segregated regions. The influence on Charpy impact toughness can be associated with the pearlite structure at the centerline and level of MnS inclusions...|$|R

The {{simulation}} {{studies were}} carried out on the oriented silicon steel produced by thin slab casting and rolling (TSCR) <b>and</b> twin-roll <b>strip</b> casting in the laboratory. The precipitation of inhibiter, formation of microstructure and texture were investigated before cold rolling. The inhomogeneous microstructure and texture gradient were observed in the 7 -pass <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> (2 mm) for TSCR process, and texture gradient was not changed after normalizing, <b>and</b> the twin-roll <b>strip</b> casting directly supplied a strip with approx 2 mm of thickness being same as that of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>strip</b> by TSCR. The microstructure of twin-rolling casting strip was almost composed of all equiaxed grains which similar to the normalizing microstructure in TSCR process, but the random texture was obtained by twin-rolling strip casting.

Purpose of the work: development of an electron-optical control method and algorithms for revaling scale {{on the surface of}} a hot-rolled sheet with the use of transmitters in real-time. The results of the work include the proposal of a method permitting enhancement of the reliability and certainty in revealing scale on the surface of a hot-rolled sheet, the development of an algorithm for detecting scale which forms transmitter output signal correction coefficients, and deriving of a formula of the operators of the transmitter contrast error and prescribed-accuracy correction. The performed investigation served as a basis for determining the illuminator and transmitter angles of inclination with respect to the surface unden control. These angles provide for the maximum contrast of the scale against the background of flawless metal. A device is developed for compensating the dergee of diffusion of the object under check. The scale revealing system is put into practice. A prototype system of control of an evident strip shape has successfully passed approbation. The reliable control of scale on the hot-rolled sheet surface will make it possible to reduce metal losses, decrease the rejected metal and enhance the general efficiency of the rolling equipment.

40|$|Iron {{aluminides}} {{have been}} among the most studied intermetallics since the 1930 s, when their excellent oxidation resistance was first noticed. Their low cost of production, low density, high strength-to-weight ratios, good wear resistance, ease of fabrication and resistance to high temperature oxidation and sulfurization make them very attractive as a substitute for routine stainless steel in industrial applications. Furthermore, iron aluminides allow for the conservation of less accessible and expensive elements such as nickel and molybdenum. These advantages have led to the consideration of many applications, such as brake disks for windmills and trucks, filtration systems in refineries and fossil power plants, transfer rolls for <b>hot-rolled</b> steel <b>strips,</b> <b>and</b> ethylene crackers and air deflectors for burning high-sulfur coal. A wide application for iron aluminides in industry strictly depends on the fundamental understanding of the influence of (i) alloy composition; (ii) microstructure; and (iii) number (type) of defects on the thermo-mechanical properties. Additionally, environmental degradation of the alloys, consisting of hydrogen embrittlement, anodic or cathodic dissolution, localized corrosion and oxidation resistance, in different environments should be well known. Recently, some progress in the development of new micro- and nano-mechanical testing methods in addition to the fabrication techniques of micro- and nano-scaled samples has enabled scientists to resolve more clearly the effects of alloying elements, environmental items and crystal structure on the deformation behavior of alloys. In this paper, we will review the extensive work which has been done during the last decades to address each of the points mentioned above...|$|R

According to the results, oxide scales on the <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>strips</b> mainly comprise iron and iron oxides. The correlation between mass gain and test time follows a power exponential rule in the damp-heat test. The corrosion products are found to be mainly composed of gamma-FeOOH, Fe 3 O 4, alpha-FeOOH, and gamma-Fe 2 O 3.

40|$|This paper comprehends {{the effects}} of finish rolling {{temperature}} (FRT) and Nb-microalloying on the microstructural evolution and resultant properties of a low carbon direct quenched steel in the yield strength category of ≥ 900 MPa. Results indicate that a decrease in FRT close to Ar 3 temperature significantly influenced the microstructure following phase transformation, especially at the subsurface (~ 50 - 400 μm) of the rolled strip. On decreasing the FRT, the subsurface microstructure revealed a fine mixture of ferrite and bainite obviously {{as a result of}} strain-induced transformation, whereas the structure at the centreline remained essentially martensitic. Further, Nb-microalloying promoted the formation of ferrite and bainite even at higher FRTs, thus influencing the mechanical properties.

Hot rolling {{had little effect on}} the yield strength of Nb microalloyed UCS specimens for a given chemical composition, but resulted in a slightly finer microstructure. The effect of Nb microalloying was significant, and this is attributable to the promotion of finer, tougher austenite transformation products such as bainite and acicular ferrite at the expense of large polygonal ferrite grains. A fine dispersion of Nb solute clusters was observed in all Nb-containing steels following hot rolling, and it is suggested that this also contributes to the observed strengthening...|$|R
