When the smoke dissipates, it's revealed that the smoke is trigger scent and X-23 goes feral, attempting to kill Hazmat and Reptil. Reptil shape-shifts into a pterodactyl and evacuates Hazmat away from X-23. Reptil turns into a plesiosaur in order to hunt some sharks for him and Hazmat to dine upon.

Cullen Bloodstone confronts Reptil about their camping out on the beach while a war's going off elsewhere. Cammi interjects to agree with Cullen Bloodstone before saying she's heading out to either find Nico or avenge her. Reptil heads back to shake Hazmat out of her funk.

As Hazmat is close to exploding, Reptil swims her out to sea so that the explosion can't harm anyone. The explosion causes everyone to stop fighting each other.

Oxy-acetylene can be used as an energy resource in atomization. In this research, powders are made by oxy-acetylene atomization method. Material in wire form is melted in oxy-acetylene flame, which has operating temperature around 3480 oC, and atomized to form a fine spray. The fine molten droplets rapidly solidify forming a powders. This research investigate the variation of wire diameter and <b>flame</b> gun <b>attacking</b> angle on atomization process efficiency and production rate. Wire material which used in this research is commercial steel wire with 0. 75 mm; 1. 25 mm; 1. 50 mm in diameter. <b>Flame</b> gun <b>attacking</b> angle is varied 25 o, 30 o, 35 o, 40 o, and 45 o.

The efficiency and production rate of the atomization process are around 12. 2 % and 0. 1429 gram/minute. This efficiency and production rate are influenced by wire diameter.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} counter-cryptanalysis as a {{new paradigm}} for strengthening weak cryptographic primitives against cryptanalytic attacks. Redesigning a weak primitive to more strongly resist cryptanalytic techniques will unavoidably break backwards compatibility. Instead, countercryptanalysis exploits unavoidable anomalies introduced by cryptanalytic attacks to detect and block cryptanalytic attacks while maintaining full backwards compatibility. Counter-cryptanalysis in principle enables the continued secure use of weak cryptographic primitives. Furthermore, we present the first example of counter-cryptanalysis, namely the efficient detection whether any given single message has been constructed – together with an unknown sibling message – using a cryptanalytic collision attack on MD 5 or SHA- 1. An immediate application is in digital signature verification software to ensure that an (older) MD 5 or SHA- 1 based digital signature is not a forgery using a collision attack. This would certainly be desirable for two reasons. Firstly, it might still be possible to generate malicious forgeries using collision attacks as too many parties still sign using MD 5 (or SHA- 1) based signature schemes. Secondly, any such forgeries are currently accepted nearly everywhere due to the ubiquitous support of MD 5 and SHA- 1 based signature schemes. Despite the academic push to use more secure hash functions over the last decade, these two real-world arguments (arguably) will remain valid for many more years. Only due to counter-cryptanalysis were we able to discover that Flame, a highly advanced malware for cyberwarfare uncovered in May 2012, employed an as of yet unknown variant of our chosen-prefix collision attack on MD 5 [SLdW 07, SSA + 09]. In this paper we disect the revealed cryptanalytic details and work towards {{the reconstruction of the}} algorithms underlying <b>Flame’s</b> new variant <b>attack.</b> Finally, we make a preliminary comparision between <b>Flame’s</b> <b>attack</b> and our chosen-prefix collision attack. ...|$|R

5|$|The US forces made further {{attempts}} to secure Hill 206 on 13March, but several attacks were defeated after the American troops crested the South Knob. As casualties mounted, McCulloch resolved {{to abandon the}} direct approach, instead deciding that he would seek to wear down the defenders on the South Knob after patrols discovered that the Japanese had no reserves left to reinforce the position. From this it was assessed that their effort in the sector had been spent and {{regardless of whether they}} managed to hold the South Knob, they would be unable to exploit the position further. For their own part, the Japanese had also reached a similar conclusion and had begun transferring troops from this sector north to reinforce the Magata Unit around the northern perimeter in an effort to concentrate enough force in order to achieve a break in. Consequently, they had left only a small force on the South Knob. Over the following days this force was subjected to heavy bombardment and <b>flame</b> <b>attacks,</b> which lasted until the Japanese counterattack petered out on the northern perimeter and the Japanese withdrew from the position on 27March.
