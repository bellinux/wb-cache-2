This building was also to house the station master, the railway port superintendent, the goods supervisor, and their respective support staff. Renovation of this building for its new function was underway in September 1962, and was expected to be completed {{by the end of the}} year. Following completion of these renovations, and the relocation of the <b>goods</b> <b>office,</b> the old <b>Goods</b> <b>Office</b> building was scheduled for demolition. The demolition was delayed while the power supply for the station was re-routed, as it had been fed through the <b>Goods</b> <b>Office</b> building. The land formerly occupied by this building was reallocated for use as a car park.|$|E

40|$|In {{the pantheon}} of {{approaches}} open to participants in the pacific settlement of disputes, <b>good</b> <b>offices</b> holds a noteworthy place. The evolution of <b>good</b> <b>offices</b> {{over the past century}} is concurrent with a trend of considerable transformation within international law, including – amongst other changes – a move away from a state-led legal order, including in <b>good</b> <b>offices</b> following the emergence of the heads of international organisations as its prime users, and a process of legalisation and specialisation within the subject that has entirely altered its character. These changes have led to a redefinition of <b>good</b> <b>offices</b> that stresses the actor carrying out the role above the form that it takes. To accompany these changes in practice, {{there is a need for}} a transformation in the legal analysis and definition of <b>good</b> <b>offices.</b> One potential option in achieving this end is Bell's lex pacificatoria. If <b>good</b> <b>offices</b> is to continue to play a significant role in the settlement of violent conflicts, a fully developed legal analysis is necessary to grasp both its historical development and its potential future role...|$|R

60|$|The lost-luggage office, we may remark in passing, was a {{wonderful}} place--a place in which a moralist might find much material for mental mastication. Here, on an extensive series of shelves, were deposited in large quantities the evidences of man's defective memory; the sad proofs of human fallibility. There were caps and comforters and travelling-bags in great abundance. There were shawls and rugs, and umbrellas and parasols, and sticks and hat-boxes in such numbers as to suggest the idea that hundreds of travellers, smitten with irresistible feelings of gratitude, had left these articles as a trifling testimony of respect to the railway company. There were carpet-bags here not only in large numbers but in great variety of form and size. Smelling-bottles, pocket-handkerchiefs, flasks, pocket-books, gun-cases, portmanteaux, books, cigar cases, etcetera, enough to have stocked a gigantic curiosity shop, and there were several articles which one could not account for having been forgotten on any other supposition than that the owners were travelling maniacs. One gentleman had left behind him a pair of leathern hunting-breeches, a soldier had forgotten his knapsack, a cripple his crutches! a Scotchman his bagpipes; but the most amazing case of all was a church door! We do not jest, reader. It {{is a fact that}} such an article was forgotten, or left or lost, on a railway, and, more amazing still, it was never claimed, but after having been advertised, and having lain in the lost <b>goods</b> <b>office</b> the appointed time, it was sold by auction with other things. Many of the articles were powerfully suggestive of definite ideas. One could not look upon those delicate kid gloves without thinking of the young bride, whose agitated soul was incapable of extending a thought to such trifles. That Mrs Gamp-like umbrella raised to mental vision, as if by magic, the despair of the stout elderly female who, arriving unexpectedly and all unprepared at her journey's end, sought to collect her scattered thoughts and belongings and launch herself out on the platform, in the firm belief that a minute's delay would insure her being carried to unknown regions far beyond her destination, and it was impossible to look at that fur travelling-cap with ear-pieces cocked knowingly on a sable muff, without thinking of the bland bald-headed old gentleman who had worn it during a night journey, and had pulled it in all ways about his head and over his eyes, and had crushed it into the cushions of his carriage in a vain endeavour to sleep, and had let it fall off and temporarily lost it and trod upon it and unintentionally sat upon it, and had finally, in the great hurry of waking suddenly on arrival, and in the intense joy of meeting with his blooming girls, flung it off, seized his hat and bag and rug, left the carriage in a whirlwind of greeting, forgot it altogether, and so lost it for ever.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{commencement}} of passenger services the Forest of Dean Branch was worked by train staff in two sections - Bullo to Ruspidge and Ruspidge to Bilson.

50|$|Stretton {{provided}} the interchange with the London Midland and Scottish Railway. It had a wooden shelter, with a <b>goods</b> <b>office</b> and a telephone box.

When London Bridge Station services were extended by a viaduct to Charing Cross Station in 1868 the Hospital relocated and was partly demolished. This building remains as having been used as a <b>goods</b> <b>office</b> for the railway company.|$|E

All lines continued in use for freight traffic, however, and the passenger service from Mold to Brymbo (now operated by the LNWR's successor, the LMS) continued with five trains a day on weekdays throughout the 1930s, despite there now being no onward connection to Wrexham.|$|E

It closed completely on 3 June 1968. The wooden passenger buildings had disappeared by the late 1970s, the <b>goods</b> <b>office</b> which stood parallel to the street was demolished after 2002. In 2005 Hull College has built motor vehicle workshops for training purposes on the site. Only one set of the iron entrance gates with the original company legend has been reused as the main entrance to the new facilities.|$|E

The neighbouring goods sidings were in use for coal deliveries until the 1960s. The street level station buildings were demolished in the 1960s. The former <b>goods</b> <b>office</b> still stood in 2010, although the interior and much of the roof was destroyed in a fire in December 2009. Some platform edges remain, although most were removed when the railway embankment was pinned to stop slippage in 2001.|$|E

A station was erected {{in a shallow}} cutting spanned at its western end by a twin-arched road bridge carrying the village street (now known as Station Road) across the line. The station building and track layout was similar in style to that at neighbouring : a one-storey symmetrical red brick building and a single loop siding on the Wappenham side, 100 yd from the station, linked to the main line. Unlike Wappenham, Helmdon had a small red brick gabled goods shed which spanned the siding and contained a <b>goods</b> <b>office</b> and internal loading platform.|$|E
