However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear. [...] In the present study, the mechanisms underlying precocious collateral sprouting were studied in adult rats in vivo. Electrical stimulation was performed on the intact cutaneous nerves at 8 V, 20 HZ, 1 min. These intact nerves were isolated from the adjacent nerves by dissecting the nearby nerves. The intact dorsal cutaneous nerves were treated under three paradigms: i) electrical stimulation (S); ii) isolation of intact nerves (I); iii) <b>electrical</b> stimulation plus <b>isolation</b> (S+I). After varying periods of time (lh, 4 h, 8 h, Id, 2 d, 4 d, 8 d, and 14 d), the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) connected with these nerves were dissected and the possible factors related to precocious sprouting were investigated in the DRG neurons using in situ hybridization (ISH), immunocytochemistry (ICC) and Western blot assays. The parameters examined included immediate early genes (IEGs), such as CREB, egr- 1, c-fos, c-jun, and Oct- 2; NGF receptors (Trk A and p 75); and potential members of the NGF – Trk A signal transduction pathways inducing downstream signaling (PI 3 -kinase, SHC, PLC-y, ERK 1). [...] The results showed that, among IEGs, CREB mRNA was quickly induced after 1 h electrical stimulation, and this increase lasted to 4 d. The effects of isolation started at Id, and the combination of isolation plus stimulation resulted in this occurring sooner. At the protein level, the expression of pCREB was only significantiy increased under stimulation at 8 h (p< 0. 05). After 4 h, electrical stimulation started to induce the elevation of egr- 1 mRNA and this induction lasted until 2 d, but the protein level was significant increased only at 8 h. Isolation, which would result in increased NGF levels in the skin due to the adjacent cutaneous denervation, did not induce significant changes in Egr- 1 protein during the experimental period. Isolation plus stimulation shortened the duration of Egr- 1 increase (at 1 d) and this increase lasted to 4 d. Except for electrical stimulation alone and isolation alone, isolation and stimulation together induced significant increases of Fos in DRGs at 2 d and 4 d. Stimulation did not have significant effects on Jun protein, but after 8 h, isolation plus stimulation, respectively, resulted in significant increases in Jun protein compared with control. Oct- 2 was not affected by any of the treatments in these experiments. [...] Under the treatments of <b>electrical</b> stimulation and <b>isolation,</b> expression of Trk A receptor mRNA and protein showed different patterns in these experiments. The mRNA level of Trk A did not significantly increase after <b>electrical</b> stimulation; however, <b>isolation</b> alone resulted in a significant increase of TrkA mRNA and this increase reached a peak at 4 d.

Moreover, protection of noise-sensitive analog circuits from "noisy" digital circuits becomes increasingly difficult for highly integrated components. To meet these challenges new enabling packaging technologies may be considered. The cost of wireless communications systems is often quoted as a most important driver.
