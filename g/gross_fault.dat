60|$|The true stage-illusion in {{this and}} in all other things consists--not in the mind's judging {{it to be a}} forest, but, in its {{remission}} of the judgment {{that it is not a}} forest. And this subject of stage-illusion is so important, and so many practical errors and false criticisms may arise, and indeed have arisen, either from reasoning on it as actual delusion, (the strange notion, on which the French critics built up their theory, and on which the French poets justify the construction of their tragedies), or from denying it altogether, (which seems the end of Dr. Johnson's reasoning, and which, as extremes meet, would lead to the very same consequences, by excluding whatever would not be judged probable by us in our coolest state of feeling, with all our faculties in even balance), that these few remarks will, I hope, be pardoned, if they should serve either to explain or to illustrate the point. For not only are we never absolutely deluded--or any thing like it, but the attempt to cause the highest delusion possible to beings in their senses sitting in a theatre, is a <b>gross</b> <b>fault,</b> incident only to low minds, which, feeling that they cannot affect the heart or head permanently, endeavour to call forth the momentary affections.

60|$|Our poet, {{something}} doubtful of his fate, Made {{choice of}} me to be his advocate, Relying on my knowledge in the laws; And I as boldly undertook the cause.

A whipt fanatic, who does not recant, Is, by his brethren, called a suffering saint; And by your hands should this poor poet die, Before he does renounce his poetry, His death must needs confirm the party more, Than all his scribbling life could do before; Where so much zeal does in a sect appear, 'Tis to no purpose, 'faith, to be severe.

40|$|The dynamic {{transition}} from slow to rapid sliding along a frictional interface {{is of interest}} to geophysicists, engineers and scientists alike. In our direct shear experiment, we simulated a pre-existing frictional fault similar to those occurring naturally in the Earth. Laboratory experiments {{have been used in}} the past to successfully link the fields of rock mechanics and seismology and have been able to produce better estimates of seismic hazard. These laboratory studies found that prior to large earthquakes a nucleation region grows outwardly. Within this region shear stress is overcome through the accumulation of slip across the fault. This phenomena is referred to as slip-weakening. Once the region grows large enough an earthquake ensues. The growth phase of this nucleation zone is called the premonitory phase. Newer seismological instruments are showing that this phase actually carries seismic signatures (originally thought to be an aseismic process). This precursory seismicity is observed as foreshocks and migrating swarm-like foreshocks occur at the fringe of this expanding nucleation front. The previous laboratory studies, used to develop the major phenomenological earthquake models, did not observe this precursory seismicity, possibly {{due to the lack of}} sensors capable of measuring this high-frequency phenomenon. The laboratory study reported here has incorporated appropriate sensors that can detect foreshock events on the fringe of a nucleation zone prior to a <b>gross</b> <b>fault</b> rupture (main shock). During loading we observed foreshocks sequences as slip transitioned from slow to rapid sliding. These laboratory-induced foreshocks showed similar acoustic characteristics and spatio-temporal evolution as those detected in nature. Through direct observation (video camera), foreshocks were found to be the rapid, localized (millimeter length scale) failure of highly stresses asperities formed along the interface. The interface was created by the meshing of two rough polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bodies in a direct shear configuration. A carefully calibrated pressure sensitive film was used to map the contact junctions (asperities) throughout the interface at a range of applied normal loads F_n. Foreshocks were found to coalesce in a region of the fault that exhibited a more dense distribution of asperities (referred to as the seismogenic region). Microscopy of the interface in the seismogenic region displayed a variety of surface roughness at various length scales. This may have been introduced from the surface preparation techniques use to create a mature interface. The mature interface consisted of `flat-topped' asperity regions with separating sharp valleys. The `flat-topped' sections spanned millimetric length scales and were considerably flatter (nanometric roughness) that the roughness exhibited at longer length scales (tens of millimeters). We believe that the smoother, `flat-topped' sections were responsible for the individual asperity formation (determining their size and strength), whereas the longer length scale roughness influenced the asperity-asperity interaction during the nucleation phase. Asperities in the seismogenic region where shown to exist close enough to each other so that elastic communication (through the off-fault material) could not be neglected. Prior to <b>gross</b> <b>fault</b> rupture (i. e. mainshock), we measured the propagation of a slow nucleating rupture into the relatively `locked', seimsogenic region of the fault. Slow slip dynamics were captured using slip sensors placed along the fault that measured a non-uniform slip profile leading up to failure. We found that the propagation of the slow rupture into the locked region was dependent on the normal force F_n. Higher F_n was found to slow the propagation of shear rupture into the locked region. Within the relatively `locked' region, a noticeable increase in size and a more compact spatial-temporal distribution of foreshocks were measured when F_n was increased. In order to develop an understanding of the relationship between F_n and the resistance of the fault to slow rupture, a quasi-static finite element (FE) model was developed. The model used distributions of asperities measured directly from the pressure sensitive film in a small section of the interface where foreshocks coalesced; specifically, the region where the slowly propagating slip front encountered the more dense distribution of asperities. A single asperity was modeled and followed the Cattaneo partial slip asperity solution. As the shear force increased along the fault, the asperities in this model were able to accommodate tangential slip by entering a partial sliding regime; the central contact of the asperities remained adhered while sliding accumulated along its periphery. Partial slip on the asperity propagated inwards as the shear force was incrementally increased. A further increase in the shear force caused the asperity to enter a full sliding condition. Increasing confining loads caused increased stiffness and increased capacity to store potential shear strain energy [...] a possible measure of the `degree of coupling' between the fault surfaces. Physics from the numerical model followed the qualitative observations made using photometry of asperities along the interface, which visualized asperities in the `locked' region [...] larger asperities remained stuck throughout the loading cycle and the light transmitted through individual asperities decreased from the periphery as shear loads increased. The numerical partial slip, quantified by the potential energy stored by the asperity, increased relative to the normal pressure p. Asperity-asperity interactions were modeled along the interface using a quasi-static analysis. Progression of slip into the asperity field was increasingly inhibited as the normal confining force F_n was increased. The computational model provided an explanation as to why an increased confining force F_n could result in an increased resistance to slow rupture as well as an increased potential for larger foreshocks within the resistive, relatively `locked' section of a fault. The experiments and modeling presented in this study lay the foundation for more innovative laboratory work that could potentially improve the phenomenological models currently used to estimate earthquake hazard...|$|E

After the king had escaped from his Japanese and Korean captors to the safety of the Russian legation, he asked Greathouse to supervise the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of the Queen. Greathouse attended all sessions of the court, examined the witnesses, and had the trials conducted in a thoroughly modern manner.

At the same time, Henry had Parliament authorise Thomas Cromwell to [...] "visit" [...] all the monasteries, including those like the Cistercians previously exempted from episcopal oversight by papal dispensation, to purify them in their religious life, and to instruct them in their duty to obey the King and reject Papal authority. Cromwell delegated his visitation authority to hand-picked commissioners; chiefly Richard Layton, Thomas Legh, John ap Rice and John Tregonwell; for the purposes of ascertaining the quality of religious life being maintained in religious houses; of assessing the prevalence of 'superstitious' religious observances such as the veneration of relics; and for inquiring into evidence of moral laxity (especially sexual). The chosen commissioners were mostly secular clergy, and appear to have been Erasmian in their views, doubtful of the value of monastic life and universally dismissive of relics and miraculous tokens. An objective assessment of the quality of monastic observance in England in the 1530s would almost certainly have been largely negative, but Cromwell did not leave such matters to chance. By comparison with the valuation commissions, the timetable for these monastic visitations was very tight, with some houses missed altogether, and inquiries appear to have concentrated on <b>gross</b> <b>faults</b> and laxity; consequently where the reports of misbehaviour returned by the visitors can be checked against other sources, they commonly appear to have been both rushed and greatly exaggerated, often recalling events and scandals from years before. The visitors interviewed individually each member of the house and selected servants; prompting each one, both to make individual confessions of wrongdoing, and also to inform on one another.

Otherwise, a relay with several normally open (NO) contacts may stick when energised, with some contacts closed and others still slightly open, due to mechanical tolerances. Similarly, a relay with several normally closed (NC) contacts may stick to the unenergised position, so that when energised, the circuit through one set of contacts is broken, with a marginal gap, while the other remains closed. By introducing both NO and NC contacts, or more commonly, changeover contacts, on the same relay, it then becomes possible to guarantee that if any NC contact is closed, all NO contacts are open, and conversely, if any NO contact is closed, all NC contacts are open. It is not possible to reliably ensure that any particular contact is closed, except by potentially intrusive and safety-degrading sensing of its circuit conditions, however in safety systems it is usually the NO state that is most important, and as explained above, this is reliably verifiable by detecting the closure of a contact of opposite sense.|$|R

60|$|The whole is, {{so far as}} it goes, a {{sound and}} picturesque version of the great Shaftesbury. It would, in many ways, serve as a very sound and picturesque account of Lord Randolph Churchill. But here comes in very pointedly the {{difference}} between our modern attempts at satire and the ancient achievement of it. The opponents of Lord Randolph Churchill, both Liberal and Conservative, did not satirise him nobly and honestly, as one of those great wits to madness near allied. They represented him as a mere puppy, a silly and irreverent upstart whose impudence supplied the lack of policy and character. Churchill had grave and even <b>gross</b> <b>faults,</b> a certain coarseness, a certain hard boyish assertiveness, a certain lack of magnanimity, a certain peculiar patrician vulgarity. But he was a much larger man than satire depicted him, and therefore the satire could not and did not overwhelm him. And here we have the cause of the failure of contemporary satire, that it has no magnanimity, that is to say, no patience. It cannot endure to be told that its opponent has his strong points, just as Mr Chamberlain could not endure to be told that the Boers had a regular army. It can be content with nothing except persuading itself that its opponent is utterly bad or utterly stupid--that is, that he is what he is not and what nobody else is. If we take any prominent politician of the day--such, for example, as Sir William Harcourt--we shall find that this is the point in which all party invective fails. The Tory satire at the expense of Sir William Harcourt is always desperately endeavouring to represent that he is inept, that he makes a fool of himself, that he is disagreeable and disgraceful and untrustworthy. The defect of all this is that we all know that it is untrue. Everyone knows that Sir William Harcourt is not inept, but is almost the ablest Parliamentarian now alive. Everyone knows that he is not disagreeable or disgraceful, but a gentleman of the old school who is on excellent social terms with his antagonists. Everyone knows that he is not untrustworthy, but a man of unimpeachable honour who is much trusted. Above all, he knows it himself, and is therefore affected by the satire exactly as any one of us would be if we were accused of being black or of keeping a shop for the receiving of stolen goods. We might be angry at the libel, but not at the satire; for a man is angry at a libel because it is false, but at a satire because it is true.|$|R
