6000|$|YOUNG OFF. [Limping to the window--doubtfully] I say, {{how did you}} how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> this? Isn't it {{an awfully}} hopeless sort of life? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no offence. Let Englishmen {{speak their}} minds, {{as long as}} English land is above sea. But how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> trouble, and with whom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} stick to you," [...] Marston declared. [...] "I {{undertook}} the job; there's no more to be said." [...] He paused and resumed quietly: [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Rupert Wyndham's power?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> scrapes?" [...] {{the girl}} said. [...] "If you didn't, you wouldn't be {{suspected}} of other things. Mamma said, the other day, {{you got into}} more scrapes than any boy in the village; and you look nice, too. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Someday we're {{going to}} have a North American {{continent}} that's an economic union. That's inevitable. These economic forces are there, and government policy can't stop them. It's only a question of, How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a more secure position? They're next door and geography dictates. Like it or not, we're going up or down with the US." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{thought her}} behind my back, [...] Yea, her I long {{had learned to}} lack, And I said: [...] "I am sure you are {{standing}} behind me, [...] Though how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> this old track?" [...] And {{there was no sound}} but the fall of a leaf [...] As a sad response; and to keep down grief I would not turn my head to discover [...] That there was nothing in my belief.|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect {{they made}} sure of doing for {{us with their}} swords and knives," [...] Dick replied, [...] "and {{did not like to}} risk calling {{attention}} by the sound of pistol-shots. Now, lads, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> this row?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's nothing," [...] Mr. Blake said. [...] "Give him half an hour's rest, and he'd {{keep up with}} us back to Killicuddery. But {{where is}} your horse, and how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> this mess? The boy tells me he found you in the bog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{what you}} have done?" [...] I cried; [...] "you have done an insensate thing to come here." [...] Suddenly I remembered the sentry at the gate of Fort St. Charles. [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the city?" [...] I said; [...] "were you mad to defy the Baron and his police?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> may <b>get</b> <b>into</b> trouble,” {{called back}} Pardell. Then {{he and his}} {{companion}} disappeared {{in the direction of}} the cabin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} were English. You've got an acthent like the fellow who plays the dude in thith show. Thay, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the show business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It 's {{regularly}} splendid; but how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>get</b> <b>into</b> it?" [...] answered Polly, surveying with girlish {{interest the}} cloud of pink and white lace that lay upon the bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think ill of him. Why do you {{say that}} I think ill of him? I think better of him than of anybody else in the world;--but I know his fault, and, as it happens, it is a fault so very {{prejudicial}} to my happiness. You ask me why I got into his boat. Why does any girl get into a man's boat? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Lord Chiltern's?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he dismounted, and {{was coming}} to me, when his eye fell on El Chico. 'Sergeant,' he said to a non-commissioned officer,' take four men and march that fellow well outside the village, and then stand and watch him; and see that he goes on, and if he doesn't, shoot him.' Then {{he came over to}} me. 'It is well that I arrived in time, my lad,' he said in French.' How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> this scrape?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Banishing care, Prince Almas {{walked on}} through the garden, when {{suddenly}} a window opened and a girl, who was lovely {{enough to make the}} moon writhe with jealousy, put out her head. She lost her heart to the good looks of the prince, and sent her nurse to fetch him so that she might learn where he came from and how he had got into her private garden where even lions and wolves did not venture. The nurse went, and was struck with amazement at the sun-like radiance of his face; she salaamed and said: 'O youth! welcome! the lady of the garden calls you; come!' He went with her and into a palace which was like a house in Paradise, and saw seated on the royal carpets of the throne a girl whose brilliance shamed the shining sun. He salaamed; she rose, took him by the hand and placed him near her. 'O young man! who are you? Where do you come from? How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> this garden?' He told her his story from beginning to end, and Lady Latifa [9] replied: 'This is folly! It will make you a vagabond of the earth, and lead you to destruction. Come, cease such talk! No one can go to the Caucasus. Stay with me and be thankful, for here is a throne which you can share with me, and in my society you can enjoy my wealth. I will do whatever you wish; I will bring here King Qulmus and his daughter, and you can deal with them as you will.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madama," [...] said Teddy, wonderingly, [...] "however <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it <b>into</b> your bead to cut {{the crowd}} and come down here? Is it a fad now among the upper classes to trot off to sheep ranches instead of to Newport?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was your}} {{letter in the}} Nation the other day," [...] she said. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> drawn <b>into</b> arguments? I wanted to rush into the Nation and pick you up and wipe the anger off you, and carry you out of it all--into some quiet {{beautiful}} place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{judgment}} in your notion, old Tom, and I {{like it to}} the backbone. Deerslayer, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the canoe, lad, and paddle off into the lake with the spare one, and set it adrift, as we did with the other; after which you can float along shore, as near as <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> {{to the head of}} the bay, keeping outside the point, howsever, and outside the rushes, too. You can hear us when we want you; and if there's any delay, I'll call like a loon--yes, that'll do it--the call of a loon shall be the signal. If you hear rifles, and feel like sogering, why, you may close in, and see if you can make the same hand with the savages that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with the deer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can you?--how--can--you?"--interrupted {{the object}} of my animadversions, gasping for breath, and tearing off, with a desperate exertion, the bandage around its jaws--"how can you, Mr. Lackobreath, be so infernally cruel as to pinch me in that manner by the nose? Did you not see how they had {{fastened}} up my mouth--and you must know--if you know any thing--how vast a superfluity of breath I have to dispose of! If you do not know, however, sit down and you shall see. In my situation {{it is really a}} great relief to be able to open ones mouth--to be able to expatiate--to be able to communicate with a person like yourself, who do not think yourself called upon at every period to interrupt the thread of a gentleman's discourse. Interruptions are annoying and should undoubtedly be abolished--don't you think so?--no reply, I beg you,--one person is enough to be speaking at a time.--I shall be done by and by, and then you may begin.--How the devil sir, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> this place?--not a word I beseech you--been here some time myself--terrible accident!--heard of it, I suppose?--awful calamity!--walking under your windows--some short while ago--about the time you were stage-struck--horrible occurrence!--heard of [...] "catching one's breath," [...] eh?--hold your tongue I tell you!--I caught somebody elses!--had always too much of my own--met Blab {{at the corner of the}} street--wouldn't give me a chance for a word--couldn't get in a syllable edgeways--attacked, consequently, with epilepsis--Blab made his escape--damn all fools!--they took me up for dead, and put me in this place--pretty doings all of them!--heard all you said about me--every word a lie--horrible!--wonderful--outrageous!--hideous!--incomprehensible!--et cetera--et cetera--et cetera--et cetera-" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Someone {{said to me}} how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the House of Lords and I said by lying, {{cheating}} and stealing." ...|$|E
5000|$|References to Dougal's {{family are}} rare. In [...] "Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest", he {{mentions}} {{that his parents}} are dead, and also refers to an uncle who died after his heart stopped beating for a week. It is unclear how Dougal entered the priesthood, with Ted wondering, [...] "Dougal, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the Church? Was it, like, collect twelve crisp packets and become a priest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like fighting, Jack, {{when it can}} be avoided, and I don't {{think that}} you are quarrelsome though <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> so many fights." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Cliff sat {{for some}} minutes without answering, {{and then she}} said, [...] "Willy, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{sometimes}} <b>get</b> <b>into</b> your head an idea that absolutely sparkles!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, a chap's {{assumed to}} be {{innocent}} until he's proved guilty,' said Stalky, mounting step by step. 'How <b>did</b> they <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>into</b> the sack, Mr. Wontner?' ...|$|R
