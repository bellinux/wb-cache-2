40|$|Abstract. Erythrocytosis without {{clinical}} {{illness was}} {{noted in a}} man and his two daughters. Their blood contained approximately 62 % hemoglobin A and 38 % a new hemoglobin, designated hemoglobin Yakima. The oxygen affinity of whole blood from each subject was greatly increased and heme-heme interactions were impaired. At 370 C and a plasma pH of 7. 40, the oxygen pressure required to produce 50 % saturation of hemoglobin with oxy-gen was only 12 mm Hg as compared with a normal of 26 mm Hg. The high oxygen affinity of this blood is attributed to the presence of hemoglobin Yakima; and the increased oxygen affinity was shown to be characteristic of the isolated abnormal hemoglobin. A Bohr effect was present in hemoglobin Yakima. Arterial oxygen pressure, oxygen consumption, and cardiac output at rest were normal.

40|$|According to {{the aims}} of the labour market reforms of the 90 s {{implemented}} in many European countries, workers may stay at their first job for a shorter time, but should be able to switch jobs easily. This would generate a trade-off between job opportunities and job stability. This paper addresses this issue using administrative longitudinal data for Germany and Italy, taken as representative examples of continuous and isolated reforms, respectively. The estimated piecewise constant job and employment duration models show that changes in the durations of the first job and employment – measured as the sum of multiple consecutive jobs – are observed in periods of labour market reforms. However, the existence of a trade-off is not confirmed by the results. In Germany, men have experienced an increase in employment stability over time, mated with somewhat longer job durations, while women have not benefitted from an increase in employment durations as a <b>compensation</b> for the <b>marked</b> decrease in their first job durations. In Italy, employment stability of the new entrants of both sexes has not improved after the reforms.

Changes in the mass of the ocean were not included. In the global mean, salinity changes have a negligible effect compared with the thermal expansion of the ocean. Regionally, sea level changes are projected to deviate greatly from the global mean (standard deviation is 40 % of the mean). Changes in surface fluxes of heat, freshwater and wind stress are all found to produce significant and distinct regional sea level changes, wind stress changes being the most important and the cause of several pronounced local features, while heat and freshwater flux changes affect large parts of the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. Regional change is related mainly to density changes, with a relatively small contribution in mid and high latitudes from change in the barotropic circulation. Regional density change has an important contribution from redistribution of ocean heat content. In general, unlike in the global mean, the regional pattern of sea level change due to density change appears to be influenced almost as much by salinity changes as by temperature changes, often in opposition.

His duties also involved administrative work such as presiding over the Warden's Marcher Court, negotiating temporary truces, attending peace conferences, and travelling on embassies. He also continued to keep the peace in his home county as well, for example helping to arbitrate the dispute between the Northumberland gentry families of Heron (of Ford Castle) and Manners between 1428 and 1431, although as a feoffee to Sir William Heron- and being one of [...] "the two most powerful knights in the county"- Sir Robert took the part of Heron's wife, Isabel, after Heron was killed by Manners. This event, said James Raine, [...] "abounds with incident, characterising, at the same time, the pugnacious state of the borders, the total absence of every thing in the shape of legal redress, and the omnipotence of the church." [...] In this arbitration, Prior Wessington acted as an umpire. In Umfraville's own words, he wished to see [...] "gude rest and pece to be had in the cuntre." [...] Eventually, through Wessington's and Langley's arbitration, Umfraville informed the former on 3 April 1428 that he would request Isabel's lawsuit in London be withdrawn if Manners would pay a surety of 400 marks to Heron's widow and help Umfraville redeem the Heron estates from royal custody (for which he would attempt to get the anount of compensation demanded by the widow reduced).

40|$|Embryonic {{substantia nigra}} (SN) was transplanted to the neostriatum in adult rats {{subjected}} to a unilateral or serial bilateral destruction of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) pathway. The survival of the graft {{and the growth of}} DA-containing fibers from the graft into the host brain was studied by fluorescence histochemistry and micro-fluorometry. The motor asymmetry, and the contralateral 'sensory neglect' induced by a unilateral destruction of the nigrostriatal DA pathway, were monitored in the transplanted rats and in non-transplanted controls through repeated measurements of the amphetamine-and apomorphine-induced rotational behaviour, and through analysis of the rats performance in a number of sensorimotor tests. Finally, the development of aphagia and adipsia after a serial bilateral destruction of both nigrostriatal DA pathways were followed in rats bearing bilateral SN transplants and in lesioned non-transplanted controls. The results show that large parts of the dorsal neostriatum can be reinnervated by DA-containing axons from the intracortical transplant and that this new DA input can fully compensate for the amphetamine-induced motor assymmetry that resulted from the initial destruction of the innate nigrostriatal DA pathway. The fluorescence microscopical observations provide strong evidence that the compensation of the amphetamine-induced rotational response was specifically related to the re-establishment of a new DA input to the denervated neostriatum, and that the degree of rotational compensation was well correlated to the magnitude of ingrowth into the neostriatum. Subsequent surgical removal of the SN transplant reinstated the initial rotational behaviour. In sharp contrast to the <b>marked</b> <b>compensation</b> in motor asymmetry, the transplanted rats showed no tendency to recover in their sensorimotor performance. Thus, while the sensorimotor deficit had recovered in the control group a marked contralateral 'sensory neglect' remained in the transplanted animals. Furthermore, removal of the transplant produced a significant improvement in their sensorimotor performance within 3 days. In the bilaterally transplanted animals the presence of the transplants did not prevent the development of severe adipsia, aphagia and akinesia following the destruction of the remaining contralateral nigrostriatal pathway. In fact, the recovery from the consummatory deficits tended to be better in the lesioned control rats than in the transplanted ones. It is concluded that SN transplants reinnervation the dorsal part of the neostriatum are able to replace the innate SN in normalizing some aspects of the rats motor behaviour, while their sensorimotor deficits and deficits in consummatory behaviour were unaffected. It is suggested that this dissociation of transplant-induced recovery is due to the failure of the SN transplants to reinnervate those parts of the neostriatum which are most directly implicated in sensorimotor and consummatory behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Thermal co-processing of {{coal and}} biomass has been {{increasingly}} focused for its {{environmental and economic}} benefits. In the present work, the experimental and kinetic study on co-pyrolysis and co-gasification of Rhenish brown coal (HKN) and wheat straw (WS) was made. The pyrolysis behavior, especially for co-pyrolysis, was investigated in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a small fixed bed reactor (LPA). In TGA, the mass loss and reaction rate of single and blend samples were studied under various experimental conditions, and their effects on synergy effects. The synergy effects on products yield and properties of chars were studied in LPA. The kinetics of pyrolysis was obtained {{based on data from}} TGA by using the Coats-Redfern method. For gasification with CO 2, a small fixed bed reactor (quartz glass reactor), equipped with an online GC to monitor the gas composition, was used. The effects of processing conditions on gasification behavior and synergy effects for mixed chars and co-pyrolysis chars were investigated. The volume reaction model (VRM), shrinking core model (SCM) and random pore model (RPM), were applied to fit the experimental data. The model best fitting the experiments was used to calculate the kinetic parameters. The reaction orders of gasification reactions with single chars are also investigated. The pyrolysis study showed that a small amount of wheat straw added to the brown coal promoted the decomposition better and showed more significant synergy effects. The synergy effects varied with increasing heating rates and pressures, especially at 40 bar. The kinetic parameters were inconsistent with experimental behavior during co-pyrolysis, since the reaction was also affected by heat transfer, contact time, particles distribution and so on. The gasification study on single chars showed that Rhenish brown coal chars had higher reactivity; chars pyrolyzed at higher temperatures showed lower reactivity; and higher gasification temperatures and CO 2 partial pressures led to higher reactivity. For co-gasification process, there was no significant synergy effect for mixed chars. However, negative synergy effects (reactivity decreased compared to the calculated values based on rule of mixing) were observed for co-pyrolysis chars, caused by properties change by co-pyrolysis process. For kinetics, the reaction orders of chars ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 7. Only random pore model fitted most experiments at low and high temperatures. Synergy effects were also observed in kinetic parameters. The values of activation energy E and pre-exponential factor A for mixed chars and co-pyrolysis chars were lower than expected. The negative synergy effects showed the pre-exponential factor A had more effects. However, the higher reactivity of mixed chars than co-pyrolysis chars showed that the reaction was affected more by activation energy E. Therefore, only investigating E or A value was not enough. In addition, a <b>marked</b> <b>compensation</b> effect between activation energies and pre-exponential factors was found in the present study.
