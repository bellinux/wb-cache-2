5|$|The 104 designation, {{whether it}} be US104 or NY104, <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> surface streets to expressways and super twos, {{particularly}} from Rochester east to Oswego. The first such realignment occurred in the 1940s in Wayne County and was completed by the realignment of NY104 onto the Irondequoit–Wayne County Expressway near Webster in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Climatologically speaking, {{approximately}} 97 {{percent of}} tropical cyclones that {{form in the}} North Atlantic develop between the dates of June 1 and November 30 – dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season. Though {{the beginning of the}} annual hurricane season has historically remained the same, the official end of the hurricane season <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> its initial date of October 31. Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season; as of January2016 there have been 66tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017. The first tropical cyclone of the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on January3, became the earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on the storm in December2012.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge College {{was built}} as Scotland's first {{college in the}} late 19th century. As Coatbridge has {{moved away from the}} {{traditional}} heavy industries the teaching focus <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> traditional industry courses towards commerce, care and the arts. St Ambrose, St Andrew's and Coatbridge High are the best-known secondary schools serving Coatbridge. The first two are Roman Catholic. St Ambrose was the subject of an HMI follow-up assessment visit in January 2009. Sports journalist and broadcaster Bob Crampsey was formerly headmaster of St Ambrose. Singer and television presenter Michelle McManus is a former pupil of the school. Prominent football referee Willie Collum taught religious education at St Ambrose in the early 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{production}} of the Anahim hotspot <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> more felsic to more mafic compositions in the last 3.0million years. For instance, much of the magma created between 3.0and 0.33million years ago was igneous phonolite, trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt and basanite; the volcanoes built during this period are almost entirely made of these rock types. Other igneous rocks such as phonotephrite are present in smaller quantities; these occur in the Satah Mountain volcanic field. Volcanic eruptions in the last 0.33million years have been mainly basanitic and have occurred at the youngest eruptive centre, Nazko Cone. Basanites produced by these eruptions are significantly more undersaturated than basalts from older Anahim volcanoes {{in the west and}} may indicate an eastward shift toward a deeper or less depleted mantle source. It is also possible that as the North American Plate moves over the Anahim hotspot, it underlies thinner continental crust. The overall chemistry and mineralogy of the Anahim magmas are analogous to regions of incipient continental rifting above a mantle plume.|$|E
5|$|The right panel (220 × 97.5cm, 87 × 38.4in) {{illustrates}} Hell, {{the setting}} {{of a number of}} Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling qualityrendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterwaysand presents a tableau that <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground. The nakedness of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands.|$|E

25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{study of}} mystical experience <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> an experiential, privatized and perennialist {{approach to a}} contextual and empirical approach. The experientalist approach sees mystical experience as a private expression of perennial truths, separate from its historical and cultural context. The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, {{takes into account the}} historical and cultural context. Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile {{mainstream}} theorizing {{has taken}} different directions.

Ramsey-style dynamic-optimization models have largely displaced the fixed-saving coefficient approach. The many consumers that Stiglitz implanted into neoclassical growth modelling did not flourish there. Instead the representative agent is usually now the model's driver. Finally, the exogenous technical progress of Harrod, and most writers on growth from whatever {{school in the}} 1960s and later, has been joined by numerous models which make technical progress endogenous {{in one of the}} several possible ways...|$|E

25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{area between}} the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest. Breast and buttock cleavages, sharing a similarity between their appearances, {{are considered to be}} very sexual. British zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks. Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.|$|E

There was an effort to preserve working-class housing of African Americans on the historic peninsula, but the neighborhood has gentrified, with rising prices and rents. From 1980 to 2010, the peninsula's population <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> two-thirds black to two-thirds white; in 2010 residents numbered 20,668 whites to 10,455 blacks.

25|$|The US {{government}} in Puerto Rico enticed US companies by providing labor at costs below {{those on the}} mainland, access to contiguous US markets without import duties, and profits that could transfer to the mainland free from federal taxation. The Administration of Economic Development invited investment of external capital, importing the raw materials, and exporting the finished products to the mainland. To entice participation, tax exemptions and differential rental rates were offered for industrial facilities. As a result, Puerto Rico's economy shifted labor from agriculture to manufacturing and tourism. The manufacturing sector <b>has</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>from</b> the original labor-intensive industries, such as the manufacturing of food, tobacco, leather, and apparel products, to more capital-intensive industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and electronics. Through this project, a rural agricultural society was transformed into an industrial working class.|$|E
