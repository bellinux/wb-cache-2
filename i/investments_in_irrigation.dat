50|$|The {{conclusion}} {{made by the}} report's authors {{was that}} only by changing the way we use water within agriculture would {{we be able to}} meet the acute water, environment and poverty challenges facing us over the next 50 years. They suggested that with wise policies and <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>irrigation,</b> upgrading rainfed agriculture, and trade {{it would be possible to}} limit future growth in water withdrawals to 13% and the expansion of cultivated land to 9%. However, the effects of climate change and the increased use of biofuels would complicate matters, making actions necessary to address these. The Assessment found the greatest potential lay in rainfed areas of the world housing the highest number of poor people. Upgrading these rainfed lands through better water management held the greatest potential to increase productivity and decrease poverty. The technology would not necessarily need to be complex; simple measures such as catching water in huge tubular plastic bags and storing roof and road run-off could double or even triple food production in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia, effectively increasing productivity from each raindrop by that amount.|$|E
5000|$|The {{homestead}} acts {{were much}} abused. Although {{the intent was}} to grant land for agriculture, in the arid areas east of the Rocky Mountains, 640 acre was generally too little land for a viable farm (at least prior to major federal public <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>irrigation</b> projects). In these areas, people manipulated {{the provisions of the}} act to gain control of resources, especially water. A common scheme was for an individual, acting as a front for a large cattle operation, to file for a homestead surrounding a water source, under the pretense that the land was {{to be used as a}} farm. Once the land was granted, other cattle ranchers would be denied the use of that water source, effectively closing off the adjacent public land to competition. That method was also used by large businesses and speculators to gain ownership of timber and oil-producing land. The federal government charged royalties for extraction of these resources from public lands. On the other hand, homesteading schemes were generally pointless for land containing [...] "locatable minerals," [...] such as gold and silver, which could be controlled through mining claims under the Mining Act of 1872, for which the federal government did not charge royalties.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} many dairy famers, {{particularly}} in Northland, have {{expressed an interest}} <b>in</b> investing <b>in</b> <b>irrigation.</b> The main financial risk that dairy farmers face when considering such an investment arises from uncertainty about the stream of future returns to irrigation. This uncertainty primarily results from the variability of dryland pasture growth rates during the summer months. Obviously, the more prone an area is to drought or dry summer conditions the more profitable <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>irrigation</b> is likely to be. Uncertainty as to the future values of the costs and returns associated with dairying is a second source of risk. In this study a methodology has been developed to evaluate the economic benefits of an <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>irrigation</b> which takes into account variation in climatic conditions during the summer, and which allows the effects of changes in other key variables to be assessed. Modelling techniques are used, in conjunction with historic meteorological data, to simulate pasture growth rates and derive the resultant farm gross margins, for both a dryland and an irrigated system, {{over a number of}} seasons. A Monte Carlo style simulation is then used to obtain the probability distribution of the time to payback. The methodology was applied to a case dairy farm., based at Rukuhia in the Waikato, in order to illustrate the process. At current (1995 / 6) prices a $ 325, 000 <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>irrigation</b> at Rukuhia is estimated to take somewhere between three and ten years to repay its cost, with a 97 % probability that payback will occur in the next four to seven seasons.

40|$|<b>Irrigation</b> farmers <b>in</b> the Lower Orange River were {{surveyed}} during October 2003 {{in order to}} study whether water marketing has promoted efficiency and to identify factors that affect future <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>irrigation</b> farming. Econometric procedures (principal component and logit model) indicate that purchasers of water rights produce lucrative export grapes and horticultural crops with relatively less raisin, wine or juice grapes and less field crops; are more specialised in production; have more livestock (probably liquidity factor) and have a less negative view of the five-year review period. The water market has facilitated a transfer of water use from relatively lower value crops to relatively higher value crops, and also promoted the use of more advanced irrigation. An investment model using Ridge Regression indicates that the following variables are associated with future <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>irrigation</b> farming; expected profitability, risk perception and risk aversion (Arrow/Pratt). Results confirm that farmers who are more risk averse invest less {{in the future as}} can be expected from theory. Policies that increase risk in agriculture will have a significant negative effect on future <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>irrigation.</b> What is significant from the results is that irrigation farmers are highly risk averse (down side). Results also show that farmers who feel that water licenses are not secure expect to invest less in the future. The latter effect is thus amplified as farmers appear to be highly risk averse. This has important policy implications, and measures should be taken to improve the perceived security of water licenses. This could be achieved by keeping farmers more informed about the practical implications of the National Water Act (NWA) and specifically water licenses. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

This is done by finding the water tariff that causes the internal rate of return to fall to 12 per cent and subtracting the current water tariff per hectar (S/. 200) from the maximum tariff. The difference is rent per hectar, which is greater for small farms than larger ones.
