40|$|The SelB protein of Escherichia coli is {{a special}} {{elongation}} factor required for the cotranslational incorporation of the uncommon amino acid selenocysteine into proteins such as <b>formiate</b> dehydrogenases. To do this, SelB binds simultaneously to selenocysteyl-tRNA(Sec) and to an RNA hairpin structure in the mRNA of <b>formiate</b> dehydrogenases located directly 3 ' of the selenocysteine opal (UGA) codon. The protein is also thought to contain binding sites allowing its interaction with ribosomal proteins and/or rRNA. SelB thus includes specific binding sites {{for a variety of}} different RNA molecules. We used an in vitro selection approach with a pool completely randomized at 40 nt to isolate new high-affinity SelB-binding RNA motifs. Our main objective was to investigate which of the various RNA-binding domains in SelB {{would turn out to be}} prime targets for aptamer interaction. The resulting sequences were compared with those from a previous SELEX experiment using a degenerate pool of the wild-type <b>formiate</b> dehydrogenase H (fdhF) hairpin sequence (Klug SJ et al., 1997, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 : 6676 - 6681). In four selection cycles an enriched pool of tight SelB-binding aptamers was obtained; sequencing revealed that all aptamers were different in their primary sequence and most bore no recognizable consensus to known RNA motifs. Domain mapping for SelB-binding aptamers showed that despite the different RNA-binding sites in the protein, the vast majority of aptamers bound to the ultimate C-terminus of SelB, the domain responsible for mRNA hairpin binding...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Soybean oil and {{castor oil}} were {{modified}} {{and used to}} prepare rigid polyurethane foam with similar properties to a commercial foam used for thermal insula-tion applications. Soybean oil was firstly modified accord-ing to a peracid method, using formic acid and hydrogen peroxide to yield a <b>formiated</b> soy polyol. Furthermore, transesterification was performed with a polyfunctional alcohol to increase OH-functionality. Castor oil, which has hydroxyl groups in the molecular structure, was only trans-esterified. The vegetable polyols were characterized by OH-number, Brookfield viscosity, differential scanning calorim-etry, and size exclusion chromatography. The foams were prepared at constant NCO/OH ratio (1. 2 : 1) by the hand mix method and poured into a closed steel box. They were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, ther-mogravimetric analysis, and dynamic mechanical analysis. The apparent density and the compression strength of foams were determined, respectively, by the mass/volume relation and through the table tensile tester.

40|$|An {{existing}} {{low temperature}} diffractometer was extended with a CCD area detector. This enables electron density determinations at 20 K within one weak, if crystals with excellent quality are available. A Huber 4 -circle goniometer {{equipped with a}} closed cycle cryostat (APD) was used. The extension with a Bruker-Apex detector was possible through DFG funding. This required a new goniometer control, that is now completely included in the Bruker software. The obtainable data quality was not sufficient with former used Beryllium cylinder, because of its highly structured scattering. To obtain the required data quality for electron density determinations, a Kapton vacuum cylinder was constructed {{at the beginning of}} reconstruction. This cylinder is built by 0. 125 mm Kapton film only. This result in strongly reduced background. In addition Kapton film produces nearly unstructured scattering. Till now only Mo-K&# 945; radiation was used for electron density determinations. Ag radiation would also be possible, but is problematic because of the lower intensity. Graphite is used in the monochromator. To enhance the primary intensity a focusing collimator from XOS was installed short ago. In scope of this work the electron densities of Strychnine, a [1. 1. 1]-Propellane-derivate, Adenosinmonophosphat and a Dithiolate-Zink-complex were experimentally evaluated. The comparative study on Strychnine shows, that four different measurements with different instruments can give well reproducible electron densities. These measurements show a small deviation to theoretical calculations. The experimental electron density determination of a [1. 1. 1]-Propellane-derivate was only possible at 100 K using synchrotron. All bonds of this highly strained system could be characterised. A bond between the bridgehead atoms was located, what justifies the description as an inverted carbon atom. This bond was predicted by theoretical calculations since a while, but is characterised in detail experimentally first. The electron density determination of Adenosinmonophosphat shows problems in the multipol model for phosphorus atoms. In comparison to a 100 K measurement the lower temperature of 25 K seems to be of great advantage for changing of the model. Only the 25 K measurement together with modified models to roughly compares with theoretical calculations. The modelling of phosphorus atom remains problematic an further improvement would be helpful. Hydrogen parameters obtained by a neutron diffraction experiment from Dr. Kloosters could be used in the refinement of the Dithiolat-Zink-complex. The Zink atom shows a remarkable deformation of the 3 d and 4 s shell, that could not be deducted easily by the coordination geometry. In addition the deformation is structured in a too complicated way for the available multipolar model. Measurements of numerous substances were performed {{in the last two years}} to determine their experimental electron densities with the new developed instrument.

Anthracyclines are cytotoxic drugs widely used in clinical practice for treatment of hematological malignancies (leucaemias, lymphoms) and solid tumours (stomach, breast, ovarian cancer). Treatment by these drugs has a serious limiting factor, however. This factor is an anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity, which is caused by hydroxyl radicals and other reactive oxygen forms. The main role in their formation play the complexes with iron. Dexrazoxane is a derivate of bisdioxopiperazine, which is used to reduce the cardiotoxic effect of anthracyclines. It is supposed that it takes effect by the means of its active metabolite ADR- 925, which works as a substance chelating iron. This mechanism hinders the iron dependant formation of oxygen radicals.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. In a Fischer-Tropsch {{refinery}} environment carboxylate complexes are {{of interest}} since the carboxylic acids present in product streams lead to formation of carboxylate salts through leaching of process equipment and catalysts. It is widely accepted that decomposition of organic (carboxylic) acids catalysed by metals {{is controlled by the}} decomposition of metal salts or complexes previously formed with such an acid. The determination of physical and structural properties of caboxylate complexes could contribute to the explanation of the mechanism involved in the decarboxylation of carboxylic acids. We have successfully determined the molecular structures of copper(II) allyl acetate, zinc(II) <b>formiate,</b> zinc(II) isovaleroate, yttrium(III) acetate and lanthanum(III) propionate. It has been established that zinc has a preferred tetrahedral coordination in carboxylate complexes compared to the octahedral coordination of copper, lanthanum and yttrium complexes considered. The carboxylate O-C-O angle in these complexes range between 119 ° and 125 ° and the conformation of the carbon chains is anti in all cases except for copper(II) allyl acetate, where a gauche conformation is adopted. Using structural methods such as TGA, infrared spectroscopy and X-Ray powder diffraction and combining it with existing knowledge of yttrium carboxylates and the effective use of computational chemistry – to calculate favourable internal parameters, using DFT calculations and B-LYP level theory - a likely structure for yttrium(III) propionate is proposed. The use of infrared measurements were especially valuable towards predictions of possible structures and the postulations of Nakamoto, on the relation between carboxylate carbonyl stretching frequencies {{and the nature of the}} carboxylate bond, could be used to accurately identify – except for the <b>formiate</b> salts of zinc(II) and yttrium(III) – the bonding mode present in the relevant compounds. We systematically tuned the non-cyclic organic part of the mono carboxylate ligand by lengthening and branching of the alkyl chain and determined that thermal decomposition and heat capacity of zinc complexes are a strong function of the ligand, while the behaviour of analogous yttrium complexes is hardly affected. The thermal investigation of lanthanum(III) propionate yielded a result that is in contrast with a previous study - where only CO 2 was reported as byproduct - and we report an alternative result which indicates formation of symmetric ketones when the compound is heated to a high enough temperature. Earlier general assumptions about the layer-like crystal structure of lanthanum complexes coordinated by alkyl chain carboxylate are contradicted by the crystallographic data we collected for this compound. The crystal packing of lanthanum(III) propionate clearly shows a layered structure which is unexpected for a carboxylate with such a short alkyl...|$|E

We have measured imino proton exchange in deoxyguanosine and in the duplex d(ATATAGATC-TATAT) as a function of pH. We show that acid-induced exchange can be assigned to proton transfer from N 7 -protonated guanosine to cytidine in the open state of the pair. This is faster than transfer from neutral guanosine (the process of intrinsic catalysis previous-ly characterized at neutral pH) due to the lower imino proton pK of the protonated form, 7. 2 instead of 9. 4. Other interpretations are excluded by a study of exchange catalysis by <b>formiate</b> and cytidine as ex-change catalysts. The cross-over pH between the regimes of pH-independent and acid-induced ex-change rates is more basic in the case of base pairs than in the mononucleoside, suggestive of an increase by one to two decades in the dissociation constant of the base pair upon N 7 protonation of G.

In order to further improve the detection limits, allowing the analysis of trace levels of colchicine in biosamples and food products, an on-column preconcentration using sweeping-MEKC was investigated. Linearity of response was observed on 10 – 160 ng mL– 1 colchicine, with an estimated detection limit of around 3 ng mL– 1 colchicine. By further improving the affinity of the separation vector towards colchicine this limit could be further decreased. Preliminary application of the method for the detection of trace amounts of colchicine spiked in non-fat milk and human urine (10 ng mL– 1) shows encouraging results. (doi: 10. 5562 /cca 1765...|$|E
40|$|The {{methanation}} of CO 2 {{was performed}} on Rh/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst at temperatures between 50 and 150 °C at 2 bar of pressure in a pulse reactor. Experiments confirm the formation of methane at low temperature and pressure. The formation of <b>formiate</b> species during the adsorption of CO 2 can be excluded. After reaction with CO 2, the catalyst is oxidized. Oxidation is not observed {{in the presence of}} CO. The CO 2 is adsorbed dissociatively, forming CO (ads) and O (ads). Gem-dicarbonyl Rh(CO) 2 species are more reactive than the Rh–CO linear species. The type of adsorbed species depends on the Rh oxidation state. The formation of methane by hydrogenation of CO 2 and CO is carried out with 100 % selectivity. The activation energy for the hydrogenation of CO 2 and CO is lower than values presented in the literature which have been obtained at higher temperature. In the presence of CO 2 and CO, the reaction of methanation of CO 2 seems to be inhibited by CO. When oxygen is added in low amount in the reactant gas feed, a positive effect on methanation is observed. When the amount of oxygen is too high, oxygen has a negative effect. These results are in agreement with thermodynamics equilibrium calculations, except when O 2 is present, confirming the importance of kinetic effects in the reaction. These results open new perspectives of application of catalysis, in order to recycle CO 2 in the presence of H 2...|$|E

Pd/C, Pd(0. 9) Bi(0. 1) /C, Pt/C, Pt(0. 9) Bi(0. 1) /C and Pd(0. 45) Pt(0. 45) Bi(0. 1) /C catalysts were synthesized by a colloidal route, and physical and electrochemical methods {{were used to}} characterize the structure and {{the surface of the}} catalysts (TEM, HRTEM, EDX, XRD, ICP-OES and XPS). It was shown that only a few amount of bismuth was deposited on the Pt and/or Pd surface, and that no alloy was formed between bismuth and the other metals. The onset potential of glycerol oxidation is ca. 0. 15 V lower on Pt/C than on Pd/C. However, Pt-free Pd(0. 9) Bi(0. 1) /C catalyst presented the same catalytic activity than platinum catalyst. The Pt(0. 9) Bi(0. 1) /C led reaching a higher catalytic activity by shifting the oxidation onset potential by ca. 0. 2 V toward lower potentials compared with the Pt/C catalyst. But, the replacing of half of the platinum atoms by palladium atoms in the Pd(0. 45) Pt(0. 45) Bi(0. 1) /C material allowed achieving the same catalytic activity as with Pt(0. 9) Bi(0. 1) /C. Electrochemical experiments combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy measurements have shown that glycerol electrooxidation mechanism is independent on the catalyst, but dependent on the electrode potential. Chronoamperometry experiments combined with HPLC measurements showed that the main reaction products were glycerate, dihydroxyacetone and tartronate at low potentials, and that the increase of the electrode potential {{led to the formation of}} mesoxalate. For potential higher than 0. 8 V vs RHE, the C-C bond cleavage occurred and oxalate and <b>formiate</b> were detected...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{tetrachloroethene}} (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) also 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA) is {{an important}} contaminant. The results of the analytical monitoring of hydraulic measures at a contaminated site revealed that the concentrations of PCE and TCE are lowered by natural attenuation whereas TCA was recalcitrant. In the R and D-project a technology for the microbial in-situ dagradation of VCH was developed with emphasis {{on the degradation of}} TCA. Under anaerobic conditions a complete comatabolic degradation of TCA could be achieved. 1, 1 -Dichloroethane (DCA) was the only observed metabolite. Chloroethane did not accumulate. The used auxiliar substrat was a mixtur of acetate and <b>formiate</b> or molasses. The transitions of the single environmental phases, 'anaerobaerob' may principally enhance the degradation of the VCH. However, the investigations showed no significant aerobic transformation of TCA or DCA. Methane which may serve as inductor for the aerobic degradation of the VCH is produced under anaerobic conditions. However, the concentrations were not high enough, so that after transition to aerobic conditions the aerobic degradation could not be induced. Although these anaerobic/aerobic transitions are easily to realize for biochemical reasons, they require high amounts of supplements. Because the degradation in in-situ-technologies is limited by mass transfer, no degradation kinetics compared to bioreactors are required. The mineralization of VCH under anerobic conditions is therefore preferable. An extensive monitoring may help to prevent process specific problems (CH_ 4 -gas bubbles, clogging by biomass). An aerobic post-treatment may further improve the quality of the groundwater. (orig.)

40|$|In nylon {{finishing}} a final step is a thermal treatment to fix auxiliary chemicals to fibers, to remove volatile compounds and monomers and to relax the textile structure. For this purpose stenters with natural gas burners are applied. The hot exhaust air contains monomers, solvents, lubricants and specific textile auxiliary chemicals {{that have to}} be removed with large amounts of fresh or process water by exhaust air washers. To reduce water costs, process-integrated water treatment and recycling processes are demanded. Annular photoreactors with low and middle-pressure mercury arc lamps and a solar non concentrating tubular receiver reactor have been applied to examine the treatment of exhaust air washer liquor and its components in the laboratory and up to semi-technical scale. The application of sole UV radiation, the combination of UV radiation with oxidants, semiconductor photocatalysts and the light enhanced Fenton reaction were compared. The photo Fenton conditions were optimized in respect of throughput and hydrogen peroxide consumption. The degradation pathway of epsilon-caprolactam (the main constituent of the air washer liquor) was analyzed by ion chromatography and HPLC-MS. The overall degradation was controlled by total organic carbon analysis. Intermediates like epsilon-amino capronic acid, N-hydroxy-epsilon-caprolactam, epsilon-nitroso capronic acid have been confirmed as initial intermediates also like acetate, oxalate and <b>formiate</b> as intermediates before complete mineralization. In comparison to photolytic hydrogen peroxide oxidation, light enhanced Fenton turned out to be much faster and to consume lower amounts of hydrogen peroxide. It could be demonstrated that the iron catalyst can be recycled with minor activity losses with middle-pressure mercury arc lamps. Photochemically enhanced Fenton reaction has proved to be most effective with respect to the consumption of time, energy and chemicals for the application in exhaust air treatment of nylon finishing. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{pharmacokinetics}} and the efficacy of a shorter than usual 5 -day quinine treatment given orally to children in Cameroon with malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Quinine (8. 3 mg of base per kg of body weight every 8 h) was administered as a 2 % <b>formiate</b> salt syrup for 5 days to 30 children (age range, 0. 55 to 6. 7 years) with uncomplicated falciparum malaria (initial parasitemia, 1. 4 × 103 to 1. 8 × 105 /μl). Quinine concentrations in plasma samples (five to nine per patient) were measured by liquid chromatography on days 1 to 3. Parasitemia was counted on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 14. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were analyzed by population approaches by using NONMEM and WinBugs, respectively. The kinetics of quinine were best described by a one-compartment model with time-varying protein binding. Clearance and the volume of distribution were positively correlated with body weight and increased over time. Parasitemia was undetectable from day 3 to 14 in all children. The time to a 4 -log reduction of the initial level of parasitemia (Ter) was related to the average quinine concentration from 0 to 72 h (Cav) as Ter = Tmin [1 + (C 50 /Cav) s], where sigmoidicity (s) is equal to 2, Tmin is the time to eradication at infinite Cav, and C 50 is the value of Cav for which Ter is twice Tmin. The C 50 distribution was unimodal, and all C 50 values were less than 8 mg/liter, while Cav ranged from 5. 9 to 18. 3 mg/liter. The median (10 th to 90 th percentile) Ter was 47 h (range, 39 to 76 h). The efficacy of a 5 -day treatment course should be evaluated in a larger clinical trial...|$|E

First, the radical telomerization of VDF with CnF 2 n+ 1 -I to direct low molecular weight-telomers {{was investigated in}} various experimental conditions: initiators, temperatures and solvents to favour the formation of CnF 2 n+ 1 (VDF) xI. Whatever the experimental conditions, it was observed the regioselective radical addition of CnF 2 n+ 1 radical onto the methylene site of VDF. Then, ethylenation of these VDF telomers was achieved {{in the presence of}} peroxy initiator with a quantitative conversion of the VDF-containing iodide reactants. Chemical change of RF(VDF) xC 2 H 4 I into RF(VDF) C 2 H 4 OH occurred in two steps: (i) from a mixture of DMF/water (for which a 6 / 1 content led to the best conditions); (ii) followed by a basic medium to saponify RF(VDF) xCH 2 CH 2 OCOH <b>formiate</b> into the corresponding VDF-containing alcohols. Suitable conditions were found to avoid any dehydrofluorination of the VDF telomeric chain. Oxidation of these fluorinated alcohols in the presence of H 2 SO 4 /CrO 3 mixture led to the corresponding CnF 2 n+ 1 (VDF) xCH 2 CO 2 H carboxylic acids. Surface tensions of these VDF-containing carboxylic acids were achieved reaching a value of 19. 8 mN m- 1 for a surfactant concentration of 5 g L- 1, showing similar values as that of commercially available perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) while critical micellar concentration value of C 2 F 5 CH 2 CF 2 CH 2 CF 2 CH 2 CO 2 H was 1. 4 g L- 1 at room temperature...|$|E

The strains SMA 21 and SMA 17 were irregular cocci whereas strain MC 15 formed sarcinalike cocci in aggregates. The strains MC 20 and MC 21 were rodshaped. All strains grew within a temperature range from 0 up to 44 °C, a pH value of 6. 2 to 9. 9 and salt concentrations from 0. 02 to 0. 6 M NaCl. Some were also able to grow at lower pH values down to pH 4. 8 for SMA 21, SMA 17 and MC 21 and even down to pH 4. 1 for MC 15. The most of the strains grew also at higher temperatures up to 54 °C except MC 20. The substrates used for methane formation were H 2 /CO 2, methanol and acetate for the coccishaped and H 2 /CO 2 and <b>formiate</b> for the rodshaped strains. MC 20 could also use 2 -propanol. Trypicase peptone and yeast extract were not needed for growth by any strain. The 16 S-rRNA fragment sequences of the strains MC 20 and MC 21 could be allocated to the genus of Methanobacteria and the sequences of the strains MC 15, SMA 17 and SMA 21 to Methanosarcina. The sequence of MC 20 showed only 96. 7 % similarity to the sequence of the nearest cultivated relative Methanobacterium oryzae, which indicates for a discrete species. MC 15 and MC 21 showed a slightly higher similarity difference of 98. 5 % to Methanosarcina barkeri and 99. 4 % to Methanobacterium subterraneum, respectively. The strains SMA 17 and SMA 21 showed a high similarity {{to each other and}} to their nearest cultivated relative Methanosarcina mazei (99. 8 and 99. 9 %), but with significant differences in their physiological properties...|$|E
40|$|The extraradical {{mycelium}} (ERM) of mycorrhizal fungi {{constitutes an}} important pathway for the translocation of energy-rich photoassimilates from plant to soil. Because {{of the large}} surface of the mycelium, and its provision of carbon, the ERM potentially constitutes an important site for interactions with other microorganisms in soils. The focus of this thesis is on the ERM of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and its interactions with soil bacteria, and the possible ecological significance of these interactions. In an in vitro study, soil bacteria differed {{in their ability to}} attach to AM fungal hyphae. These physical associations between bacteria and fungi were influenced by hyphal vitality and fungal strain. The degree of attachment of bacteria to living or dead hyphae may reflect the ecological niche differentiation of these bacteria, and consequently their trophic relationship (e. g. mutualistic or saprotrophic) to the mycorrhizal fungi. Carbohydrates of mycelial origin, mainly in the form of glucose, acetate and <b>formiate,</b> were identified in exudates from an AM fungus. Mycelial exudates promoted the occurrence of certain bacterial taxa in vitro, further supporting the view that specific interactions may occur between some bacteria and AM fungi. In a field study with long-term applications of different organic and inorganic fertilisers, amendments with sewage sludge or ammonium sulphate changed the bacterial community composition in root-associated soil aggregates. In addition, ammonium sulphate reduced the taxon richness and the occurrence of specific taxa of both AM fungi and bacteria in the mycorrhizosphere. These changes were primarily explained by the low pH of soils amended with sewage sludge or ammonium sulphate. However, taxon richness of both AM fungi and bacteria also appeared to be promoted by high soil organic content. In summary, interactions between bacteria and the ERM of AM fungi may be specific and physical associations and mycelial exudates may influence these interactions. Microbial interactions are important in determining soil fertility and plant health. In agricultural systems some microorganisms may be either positively or negatively affected by different types of fertilisation, therefore it is possible soil management practices could be customised to promote microorganisms that are beneficial to farming systems...|$|E

To identify what groups may be involved in the inhibition, the consortium was simplified by successively omitting one group at a time. Pasteurized milk was inoculated with these more or less complex consortia and their effects on L. monocytogenes count, pH, acids and volatile compounds in the core of uncooked pressed cheese were evaluated. The growth of L. monocytogenes was the highest in cheeses prepared with pasteurized milk and only St. thermophilus. Inhibition in other cheeses was expressed by comparison with growth in these ones. All the consortia containing both lactic acid bacteria (group A) and Gram positive catalase positive bacteria (group B) - ABCD, ABD, ABC, AB - were more inhibitory than those containing lactic acid bacteria on its own (A) or associated only with yeasts (AD) or/and Gram negative (ADC). Consortia without lactic acid bacteria were weakly inhibitory or had no effect. Gram positive catalase positive bacteria alone were not inhibitory although most of the species became established in the cheeses. The Lactobacillus population (Lb. casei, Lb. plantarum, Lb. curvatus and Lb. farciminis) was predominant in cheeses (9 log CFU/g) with a higher count than Leuconostoc (7 log CFU/g) and Enterococcus (7 log CFU/g). Lactobacillus counts were negatively correlated with those of L. monocytogenes (r = - 0. 84 at 18 days) and with the level of D-lactic acid. There was no correlation between L. monocytogenes and Leuconostoc or Enterococcus counts. Complex consortium ABCD and AB not only had a stronger inhibitory power in cheeses than consortium AD, they were also associated with the highest levels of L-lactic and acetic acids. All cheeses inoculated with lactic acid bacteria differed from those without by higher levels of ethyl <b>formiate,</b> pentane and alcohols (2 -butanol, 2 -pentanol), and lower levels of ketones (2 -hexanone, 2, 3 -butanedione) and aldehydes (2 -methyl-butanal). Levels of 2 -methyl-butanal, 2 -butanol and 2 -pentanol were higher in ABCD and AB cheeses than in AD cheeses.
