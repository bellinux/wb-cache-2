50|$|The first Boeing YC-14 (serial number 72-1873) flew on 9 August 1976. Two {{aircraft}} were built, {{the second}} being s/n 72-1874. The competing YC-15 had started flights {{almost a year}} earlier. Head-to-head flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base started in early November 1976. During flight testing, the YC-14 was flown at speeds as low as 59 kn and as high as M=.78 at 38000 ft. However, {{it was found that}} the YC-14's drag was 11% higher than originally predicted. Modifications developed in wind tunnel testing, comprising the addition of vortex generators to the upper aft portion of the nacelles, deletion of the nozzle <b>door</b> <b>actuator</b> fairing, alterations to the aft end of the landing gear pods and the addition of aft fuselage strakes, reduced this drag decrement to 7%. The YC-14 also demonstrated the capability to carry the 109,200 lb M60 Patton main battle tank, something that was not demonstrated with the YC-15.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} is a <b>door</b> <b>actuator</b> and alignment apparatus {{for opening}} and closing the 15, 000 -pound horizontally sliding door of a storage overpack. The <b>door</b> <b>actuator</b> includes a ball screw mounted horizontally on a rigid frame including a pair of door panel support rails. An electrically powered ball nut moves along the ball screw. The ball nut rotating device {{is attached to a}} carriage. The carriage attachment to the sliding door is horizontally pivoting. Additional alignment features include precision cam followers attached to the rails and rail guides attached to the carriage...|$|E
40|$|Flight {{tests of}} the {{propulsion}} system of a YF- 12 airplane were made which included off-schedule inlet operation and deliberately induced unstarts and compressor stalls. The tests showed inlet/engine compatibility to be good {{through most of the}} flight envelope. The position of the terminal shock wave could be determined from throat static pressure profiles or from root-mean-square levels of throat static pressure fluctuations. A digital simulation of the control system showed an oscillation of the forward bypass doors to be caused by hysteresis in the bypass <b>door</b> <b>actuator</b> linkages...|$|E
5000|$|Domain {{models of}} <b>door</b> <b>actuators,</b> motor controls, and braking systems would {{typically}} {{be considered as}} generic re-usable service domains whereas the passenger train controller domain {{is likely to be}} a very product-specific application domain.|$|R
5000|$|These trains has {{a similar}} IGBT-VVVF {{traction}} system to the existing C751B and C151A {{and it is the}} first train to have a white front with a smaller logo. These trains are the first to be fitted with STARiS 2.0, which is embedded in the door's overhead panels, as factory stock and also the first amongst the rolling stock used on the North South Line and East West Line to have electric <b>door</b> <b>actuators</b> rather than the traditional pneumatic <b>door</b> <b>actuators</b> on previous generations of rolling stock, allowing smoother and more reliable door operations, reducing delays. The first C151B train 601/602 made its debut on the North South Line on 16 April 2017.|$|R

5000|$|Decomposition {{within the}} {{analysis}} domain where system requirements are modelled, and grouped, around specific, disjoint, subject matters. To {{return to the}} earlier passenger train example, individual semantic models may be created based on <b>door</b> <b>actuators,</b> motor controls, and braking systems. Each grouping is considered, and modelled, independently. The only defined relationship between the groupings are dependencies e.g. a passenger train application may depend on both door actuation and motor control. Braking systems may depend upon motor control.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{complications}} encountered {{when attempting to}} create a secure pervasive computing environment. The model introduced in this paper is primarily conceptual. The chosen environment is built around a shared space containing a classified network. Since access to the classified network is only available to people once they are in this space, we investigate what is required to ensure only authorised people can enter, which highlights problems inherent {{in any kind of}} physical access control, and then how to carry this through to manage their access to information once inside the space. A layered agent architecture is considered, using real time devices such as biometric mechanisms, <b>door</b> <b>actuators</b> and a smart card reader acting as the lower level agents. These agents are then wrapped in software allowing them to communicate with higher level agents that through the coordination of these low level agents control the security of the pervasive environment. Security is further enhanced, by preventing the classified network from communicating with the network containing the biometric devices and databases. We also consider the security implications of using paper documents within the shared space, as well as the possibility of any other devices that could potentially be used for smuggling information out of the environment. ...|$|R
50|$|Many roboticists {{construct}} AUVs as a hobby. Several competitions exist {{which allow}} these homemade AUVs {{to compete against}} each other while accomplishing objectives. Like their commercial brethren, these AUVs can be fitted with cameras, lights, or sonar. As a consequence of limited resources and inexperience, hobbyist AUVs can rarely compete with commercial models on operational depth, durability, or sophistication. Finally, these hobby AUVs are usually not oceangoing, being operated {{most of the time}} in pools or lake beds. A simple AUV can be constructed from a microcontroller, PVC pressure housing, automatic <b>door</b> lock <b>actuator,</b> syringes, and a DPDT relay. Some participants in competitions create open-source designs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{problem that}} caused the {{accident}} was immediately obvious, as the rear cargo door was missing and had caused severe damage to the left horizontal stabilizer as it blew off. Investigators immediately studied the maintenance history and found that on March 3, 1972, {{three months before the}} accident, the handlers reported that the door had not latched electrically and had to be closed manually. On May 30, McDonnell Douglas issued Service Bulletin 52-27, DC-10 SC 612, which called for the upgrading of the electrical wiring that drove the latches because [...] "Three operators have reported failure of the electrical latch actuators to latch/unlatch the cargo <b>doors.</b> Latch <b>actuator</b> failure is attributed to an excessive voltage drop reducing the output torque to the actuator. This condition may prevent electrical latching/unlatching of the hooks." [...] The modification was not compulsory, however, and had not been carried out on N103AA, the plane involved in the incident.|$|R
2500|$|There {{were two}} serious {{injuries}} on board: a fracture and laceration of a foot, and an acute back strain requiring {{two days of}} hospitalization. [...] The aircraft was significantly damaged by the excessive G-forces. [...] The wings were permanently bent upwards by , the inboard main landing gear lost two <b>actuator</b> <b>doors,</b> and the two inboard main gear struts were left dangling. Most affected was the tail, where large outer parts of the horizontal stabilizer had been ripped off. [...] The entire left outboard elevator had been lost along with its actuator, which had been powered by the hydraulic system that ruptured and drained.|$|R
5000|$|The captain Vadim Demchenkov reminisced: [...] "Watch {{of three}} men {{ran from the}} engine room up the ladders due to they were already knee-deep or waist-deep into the water. Due to alarm the second {{engineer}} arrived at own place in the engine room and immediately he blocked clinkety <b>door</b> by the <b>actuator</b> from the main deck. The capacity of the tunnel of the ship was not less than 1500 tons. If {{it was filled with}} sea water, the loss of the vessel would have been inevitable. This ship had single-compartment unsinkability, but she was still afloat! Apparently, the grain coefficient of permeability was very small actually and the grain was not so actively washed away at sea due to was not big waves and the ship was not heavily pitching and rolling".|$|R
40|$|Doors {{that allow}} {{scientific}} instruments to record and retrieve the observed data are often {{required to be}} designed and installed {{as a part of}} sounding rocket hardware. The motor-actuated vacuum door was designed to maintain a medium vacuum of the order of 0. 0001 torr or better while closed, and to provide an opening 15 inches long x 8. 5 inches wide while open for cameras to image Halley's comet. When the electric motor receives the instruction to open the door through the payload battery, timer, and relay circuit, the first operation is to unlock the door. After unlatching, the torque transmitted by the motor to the main shaft through the links opens the <b>door.</b> A microswitch <b>actuator,</b> which rides on the linear motion conversion mechanism, is adjusted to trip the limit switch {{at the end of the}} travel. The process is repeated in the reverse order to close the door. 'O' rings are designed to maintain the seal. Door mechanisms similar to the one described have flown on Aerobee 17. 018 and Black Brant 27. 047 payloads...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} number of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems that are time-sensitive and resource-aware. From healthcare to building and even home/office automation, it is now common to find systems combining interactive and sensing multimedia traffic with relatively simple sensors and <b>actuators</b> (<b>door</b> locks, presence detectors, RFIDs, HVAC, information panels, etc.). Many of these are today known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Quite frequently, these systems must be capable of (1) prioritizing different traffic flows (process data, alarms, non-critical data, etc.), (2) synchronizing actions in several distributed devices and, to certain degree, (3) easing resource management (e. g., detecting faulty nodes, managing battery levels, handling overloads, etc.). This work presents FTT-MA, a high-level middleware architecture aimed at easing the design, deployment and operation of such AmI systems. FTT-MA ensures that both functional and non-functional aspects of the applications are met even during reconfiguration stages. The paper also proposes a methodology, together with a design tool, to create this kind of systems. Finally, a sample case study is presented that illustrates the use of the middleware and the methodology proposed in the paper...|$|R
