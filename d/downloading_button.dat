40|$|My art evolves out of deep attentiveness to {{idiosyncratic}} {{aspects of}} mundane experience. These aspects of experience are manifested through body language, gestures, facial expressions, and the peripheral hunch.

5000|$|In Specht v. Netscape, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{looked at}} the {{enforceability}} of a browse-wrap contract entered into on the Netscape website. Users of the site were urged to download free software available on the site by clicking on a tinted button labeled [...] "download". Only if a user scrolled down the page to the next screen did he come upon an invitation to review the full terms of the program's license agreement, available by hyperlink. The plaintiffs, who {{had not seen the}} agreement, downloaded the software and then were later sued for violations of federal privacy and computer fraud statutes arising from the use of the software. The Second Circuit then noted that an essential ingredient to contract formation is the mutual manifestation of assent. The court found that [...] "a consumer's clicking on a <b>download</b> <b>button</b> does not communicate assent to contractual terms if the offer did not make clear to the consumer that clicking on the <b>download</b> <b>button</b> would signify assent to those terms." [...] Because the plaintiffs were not put on notice of these terms they were not bound by them.|$|R

Accepting drawing as operating in conceptual space, I explore experimental loops within the visual logic of that territory.

Like painting and sculpting, the drawings occupy an intangible state between objects and ideas. I embrace this irresolution.
