50|$|Bangladesh is one {{of seven}} {{countries}} of the world where the number of men exceeds the number of women. Eighty-eight percent of the population adheres to Islam. Veiling and adherence to purdah remain domains of contestation in regards to whether they serve as vehicles of empowerment or discrimination. While seen in Western discourse as restrictive of women's rights, some claim that burkas allow for better freedom of movement in Bangladesh. Despite the changes that have come with the demand for women in the export industry, women are generally unseen outside the domestic sphere. This is especially true in rural Bangladesh. While labour <b>force</b> <b>increase</b> has accounted for higher percentages for females than males, terms of equality are measured in various areas beyond employment. Their status and position is also measured in terms of education, income, assets, health, and the role they play in the family and in society. These characteristics are representative of the amount of political power and social prestige a woman is accorded and thus the extent to which she can influence decision-making within the home and in the community.|$|E
50|$|A catch bond {{is a type}} of noncovalent bond whose {{dissociation}} lifetime {{increases with}} tensile force applied to the bond. Normally, bond lifetimes are expected to diminish with force. In the case of catch bonds, the lifetime of the bond actually increases up to a maximum before it decreases like in a normal bond. Catch bonds work {{in a way that is}} conceptually similar to that of a Chinese finger trap. While catch bonds are strengthened by an increase in force, the <b>force</b> <b>increase</b> is not necessary for the bond to work. Catch bonds were suspected for many years to play a role in the rolling of leukocytes, being strong enough to roll in presence of high forces caused by high shear stresses, while avoiding getting stuck in capillaries where the fluid flow, and therefore shear stress, is low. The existence of catch bonds was debated for many years until strong evidence of their existence was found in bacteria. Definite proof of their existence came shortly thereafter in leukocytes.|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{proposals}} to compensate CO 2 -induced warming with {{a decrease in}} solar radiation, this study investigates how single-forcing simulations should be combined to best represent the spatial patterns of surface temperature and precipitation of idealized geoengineering scenarios. Using instantaneous and transient simulations with changing CO 2 and solar forcings, we show that a geoengineering scenario, i. e., a scenario where the solar constant is reduced as CO 2 concentrations are increased, is better represented by subtracting the response pattern of a solar <b>forcing</b> <b>increase</b> simulation from the response pattern of a CO 2 <b>forcing</b> <b>increase</b> simulation, than by adding the response pattern of a solar forcing decrease simulation to a CO 2 <b>forcing</b> <b>increase</b> simulation. The reason is a asymmetric response of the climate system to a <b>forcing</b> <b>increase</b> or decrease between both hemispheres. In particular, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation responds faster to a solar forcing decrease compared to a solar <b>forcing</b> <b>increase.</b> Further, the climate feedbacks are state and region dependent, which is particularly apparent in the polar regions due to the sea ice-albedo feedback. The importance of understanding the local response of the climate system to geoengineering and single-forcing scenarios is highlighted, since these aspects are hardly discernible when only global mean values are considered. © 2014.

5000|$|Adjusting {{from war}} time to peace time was an {{enormous}} shock for the U.S. economy. Factories focused on war time production had to shut down or retool their production. A short recession occurred in the United States following Armistice Day, but {{this was followed by}} a growth spurt. The recession that occurred in 1920, however, was also affected by the adjustments following the end of the war, particularly the demobilization of soldiers. One of the biggest adjustments was the re-entry of soldiers into the civilian labor force. In 1918, the Armed Forces employed 2.9 million people. This fell to 1.5 million in 1919 and 380,000 by 1920. The effects on the labor market was most striking in 1920, when the civilian labor force increased by 1.6 million people, or 4.1%, in a single year. (Though smaller than the numbers in post-World War II demobilization in 1946 and 1947, this is otherwise the largest documented one-year labor <b>force</b> <b>increase).</b> [...] In the early 1920s, both prices and wages changed more quickly than today. Employers may have been quicker to offer reduced wages to returning troops, hence lowering their production costs, and lowering their prices.|$|E
5000|$|The R520 {{architecture}} {{is referred to}} by ATI as an [...] "Ultra Threaded Dispatch Processor". This refers to ATI's plan to boost the efficiency of their GPU, instead of going with a brute <b>force</b> <b>increase</b> {{in the number of}} processing units. A central pixel shader [...] "dispatch unit" [...] breaks shaders down into threads (batches) of 16 pixels (4×4) and can track and distribute up to 128 threads per pixel [...] "quad" [...] (4 pipelines each). When one of the shader quads becomes idle, due to a completion of a task or waiting for other data, the dispatch engine will assign the quad with another task to do in the meantime, with the overall result being a greater utilization of the shader units, theoretically. With such a large number of threads per [...] "quad", ATI created a very large general purpose register array that is capable of multiple concurrent reads and writes and has a high-bandwidth connection to each shader array. This provides temporary storage necessary to keep the pipelines fed by having work available as much as possible. With chips such as RV530 and R580, where the number of shader units per pipeline triples, the efficiency of pixel shading drops off slightly because these shaders still have the same level of threading resources as the less endowed RV515 and R520.|$|E

40|$|Abstract When {{an object}} {{held by a}} {{precision}} grip is subjected to an abrupt vertical load perturbation, somato-sensory input from the digits triggers an increase in grip force to restore an adequate safety margin, preventing frictional slips. In adults the response occurs after a la-tency of 60 - 80 ms. In the present study, children from 2 years old upward-and adults grasped and lifted an object using a precision grip. Sudden, unpredicted increases in load force (tangential to the grip surfaces) were induced by the experimenter by dropping a small disc on to a re-ceptacle attached to the object. The impact elicited a grip force response which in young children had a longer la-tency and a smaller amplitude than was seen in adults. The grip response latency gradually become shorter and its amplitude increased with increasing age, reaching adult values at 6 -lO years. The muscle activity underly-ing the response could have several bursts. The adults showed one brisk response, appearing 40 - 50 ms after impact, in extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscles, while younger children also exhibited a short-latency burst, ap-pearing about 20 ms after impact. It is suggested that the short-latency response was mediated via spinal path-ways, and that these pathways are disengaged by supra-spinal centers during development. In a predictable load-ing situation, when subjects dropped the disc themselves into the receptacle using the contralateral hand, they changed strategy. Adults induced a well-timed anticipa-tory grip <b>force</b> <b>increase</b> prior to the impact that was scaled to {{the weight of the}} object. The youngest children did not time the <b>force</b> <b>increase</b> properly in relation to the impact.
