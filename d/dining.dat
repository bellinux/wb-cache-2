5|$|A {{portrait}} of Marie closely resembling a photograph by Krøyer {{was completed in}} 1891. The following year, it {{was added to the}} frieze in the <b>dining</b> room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel which had become the artists' favourite meeting place. Placed next to Krøyer's own portrait, it confirmed Marie's position as an accepted member of the Skagen Painters. The <b>dining</b> room was designed by the architects Ulrik Plesner and Thorvald Bindesbøll in connection with the first major expansion of the hotel in 1892. At Krøyer's suggestion, it was decided to incorporate Degn Brøndum's art collection into its decoration. Over the years it became a custom that visiting artists donated portraits of each other to the hotel owner and these were placed in a frieze just under the ceiling. Today the <b>dining</b> room together with its frieze forms part of Skagens Museum.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes a}} contextual analysis of two female <b>Diné</b> poets who use storytelling and writing {{and includes a}} chapter on the pedagogical implications of Native American student storytelling and writing. I first examine poetry written by two <b>Diné</b> women, Luci Tapahonso and Laura Tohe to understand the ways these poets, particularly the poetry, reclaim and revive <b>Diné</b> literacies and rhetorics. My analyses are informed by the historical and cultural contexts that shaped <b>Diné</b> philosophy, particularly, the philosophy that informs and is shaped by the practice of <b>Diné</b> literacies and rhetorics. I draw from mythical, historical, and contemporary <b>Diné,</b> Native American, and other minoritized scholars for lenses of analysis to show how these poets define and reclaim the female <b>Diné</b> voice and identity. Colonial and neocolonial changes in <b>Diné</b> lifeways and traditions and the encounters between <b>Diné</b> and other groups and the imposition of the English language (written literacy) are pertinent to these contextual analyses and pedagogical implications...|$|R

5|$|From the 1854 {{establishment}} of railways in Norway to 1909, no <b>dining</b> service was offered aboard trains; passengers {{were allowed to}} bring food with them. Train stations also lacked <b>dining</b> facilities. The first <b>dining</b> service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen. He established the restaurant at Drammen Station, and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a <b>dining</b> service aboard the express trains on the Bergen Line, which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two carriages from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. These were {{to be paid for}} by the state, but the Parliament of Norway delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability of restaurant carriages on trains. The plans were opposed by the teetotaler faction of Parliament, but there was a majority in favor of <b>dining</b> service. To get the carriages in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated. After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the carriages was refunded by NSB. In 1910, when President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt visited Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, several restaurant carriages were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant carriages were put in regular service on the Østfold Line.|$|E

Building on cross-cultural interviewing techniques that originally used photographs, this study uses a selection of museum textiles to explore <b>Dine</b> aesthetics. The results address <b>Dine</b> weavers' views of the meanings and changes in <b>Dine</b> textile designs, the significance of the process of weaving, and the motivational forces that fuel this tradition...|$|R

40|$|We {{isolated}} a membrane-bound metallopeptidase, <b>DINE</b> (damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase), by {{differential display}} PCR using rat normal and axotomized hypoglossal nuclei.

For instance, cranial and spinal nerve transection, ischemia, corpus callosum transection, and colchicine treatment increased <b>DINE</b> mRNA expression in the injured neurons, whereas kainate-induced hyperexcitation, immobilization, and osmotic stress failed to up-regulate <b>DINE</b> mRNA. Expression of <b>DINE</b> in COS cells partially inhibited C 2 -ceramide-induced apoptosis, probably because of the activation of antioxidant enzymes such as Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, Mn-superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase through the proteolytic activity of <b>DINE.</b> These data provide insight into the mechanism of how injured neurons protect themselves against neuronal death...|$|R
