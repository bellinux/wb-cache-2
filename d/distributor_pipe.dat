40|$|Abstract. Distributor plays a {{major role}} on uniformly of the fluid flow {{distribution}} through multiple channels, particularly in two phase flow. Uniformity and low pressure drop are the major issue which shall be solved. This study emphasized on the shape of branching points for two phase flow distributor to minimize mal-uniformity and pressure drop. The present <b>distributor,</b> the merge <b>pipe</b> <b>distributor</b> was developed to curved round distributor models with three types of reducer namely; curve reducer, T-reducer and straight reducer. The work was done thru investigating the performance of merge <b>pipe</b> <b>distributor</b> and comparing it to the performance of developed distributors. The analyses were performed through CFD modeling by using Fluent @ software, the two dimensional approach and high superficial velocity. It was founded that, the merged <b>pipe</b> <b>distributor</b> has tended to lack uniformity of phase distribution and slightly lower pressure drop than curved reducer distributor. While the curve round distributor models with T-reducer has exhibited better performance due to smaller pressure drop and optimum phase uniformity...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{efficiency}} of a Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plant {{depends on the}} effectiveness of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system. A Single tank TES system has potential to provide effective solution. In a single tank TES system, a thermocline region, which produces the temperature gradient between hot and cold storage fluid by density difference, is used. Preservation of this thermocline region in the tank during charging and discharging cycles depends on the uniformity of the velocity profile at any horizontal plane. One of the major challenges for the single tank thermocline is actually maintaining the thermocline region in the tank, so that it does not spread out to occupy the entire tank. Since the thermocline is a horizontal surface, the hot and cold fluid must be introduce {{in such a way that}} it does not disturb the thermocline. If the fluid is introduced in a jet stream, it will disturb the thermocline and mix the hot and cold fluids into a homogeneous medium. So the objective of this thesis is to preserve the thermocline region by maximizing the uniformity of the velocity distribution. An ideal distributor will minimize the thermocline spreading and hence maximize the useable form of thermal energy storage in a single tank system. The performance of two different types of distributors: <b>pipe</b> flow <b>distributor</b> and honeycomb distributor, were checked. The effectiveness of the <b>pipe</b> flow <b>distributor</b> was checked by varying the dimension of the geometry i. e. number of holes, distance between the holes, position of the holes and number of <b>distributor</b> <b>pipes.</b> ^ Thermal energy storage system from solar power relies on high temperature thermal storage units for continuous operation. The storage units should have facilitated with high thermal conductivity and heat capacity storage fluid. Hence it is necessary to find a better performing heat transfer fluid at higher operating temperature. Novel materials such as nanomaterial additives can become cost effective and can increase the operating range of the storage facilities to higher range of temperatures. In this work Hitec® molten salt is considered as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). The operating temperature of this HTF is 300 - 500 °C. So to increase the thermal properties of this HTF nanomaterial has been added. The effective thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of the nanofluid were calculated and the thermal effect of this nanofluid was observed from the simulation result. ...|$|R

The flow of brine water was regulated by a calibrated valve placed between the water tank and the water <b>pipe</b> <b>distributor</b> in the absorber.

To investigate solid concentration in gas-solid fluidized bed for methanol-to-olefins process catalyzed by SAPO- 34, a cold model experiment system is established in this paper. The system comprises a gas distributor in a 300 mm internal diameter and 5000 mm height acrylic column, the fiber optic probe system and series of cyclones. The experiments are carried out at ambient conditions and under different superficial gas velocity ranging from 0. 3930 m/s to 0. 7860 m/s and different initial bed height ranging from 600 mm to 1200 mm. The effects of radial distance, axial distance, superficial gas velocity, initial bed height on solid concentration in the bed are discussed. The effects of distributor shape and porosity on solid concentration are also discussed. The time-averaged solid concentration profiles under different conditions are obtained.

The technique consists basically of analyzing {{the mass of the}} liquid collected in 21 vertical pipes measuring 52 mm in internal diameter and 800 mm in length placed in a quadratic arrangement and positioned below the distributor A 50 mm thick acrylic blanket that does not disperse liquids was placed between the <b>distributor</b> and the <b>pipe</b> bank to avoid splashes. Assays were carried out with ladder-type distributors equipped with 4 parallel pipes each for a column measuring 400 nun in diameter {{as an example of the}} application. The number (n) of orifices (95, 127, and 159 orifices/m(2)), orifice diameter (d) (2, 3, and 4 mm) and the flowrate (q) (1. 2; 1. 4; and 1. 6 m(3) /h) were varied. The best spread efficiency, which presented the lowest standard deviation, was achieved with 159 orifices, 2 mm and 1. 4 m(3) /h. The pressure (p) at the distributor inlet for this condition was only 51000 Pa (0. 51 kgf/cm(2)), while the average velocity (v) was 6. 3 m/s in each orifice.

40|$|What is a {{trickling}} filter? A {{trickling filter}} (TF) is a {{wastewater treatment system}} that biodegrades organic matter and {{can also be used}} to achieve nitrification. The wastewater trickles through a circular bed of coarse stones or plastic material. A rotating <b>distributor</b> (a rotating <b>pipe</b> with several holes across it) evenly distributes the wastewater from above the bed. The microorganisms in the wastewater attach themselves to the bed (also known as the filter media), which is covered with bacteria. The bacteria break down the organic waste and remove pollutants from the wastewater. When excess nutrients became a concern, it became necessary to adapt “conventional ” sewage treatment systems to meet the increased oxygen demand placed on receiving waters by high ammonia nitrogen concentrations in wastewater effluents. TFs and other attached-growth processes proved to be well-suited for the removal of ammonia nitrogen by oxidizing it to nitrate nitrogen (nitrification). What is nitrification? Nitrogen exists in many forms in the environment and can enter aquatic systems from either natural or human-generated sources. Some of the primary direct sources or transport mechanisms of nitrogen from sewage are listed below: • Untreated sewage—direct discharge • Publically owned treatment works (POTW) effluent—direct discharge, land application • POTW waste solids—direct discharge, land application • Septic tanks and leach fields—groundwater movement Nitrification/denitrification is the process of converting nitrogen into a form in which it can ultimately be removed. In the first step of this process, influent ammonia nitrogen is oxidized to nitrate nitrogen. At this point, the nitrogen has merely changed forms and has not yet been removed from the wastewater. In the second step, denitrification, nitrate nitrogen is A General Overview converted into nitrogen gas that vents to the atmosphere naturally. The two general types of TF nitrification configurations are single-stage and two-(or separate-) stage. • Single-stage: Carbon oxidation and nitrification take place in a single TF unit...|$|R
