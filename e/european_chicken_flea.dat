A new C. felis felis clade from both the Czech Republic and Romania is also reported. A high proportion of C. canis was observed from dogs and cats in the current study and phylogeny revealed that C. canis forms a sister clade to the oriental cat flea Ctenocephalides orientis (syn.

Out of 33 fleas tested, representing C. felis felis, C. canis and Ce. gallinae, 7 (21. 2 %) were positive for R. felis using diagnostic real-time PCR targeting the gltA gene and a conventional PCR targeting the ompB gene. No samples tested positive for Bartonella spp. using a diagnostic real-time PCR assay targeting ssrA gene. This study confirms high genetic diversity of C. felis felis globally and serves as a foundation to understand the implication for zoonotic disease carriage and transmission by the flea genus Ctenocephalides...|$|R

40|$|Summary This study {{sought to}} assess {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) diversity and phylogeographic structure of chickens from five agro-ecological zones of Zimbabwe. Furthermore, chickens from Zimbabwe were compared with populations from other geographical regions (Malawi, Sudan and Germany) and other management systems (broiler and layer purebred lines). Finally, haplotypes of these animals were aligned to chicken sequences, taken from Gen-Bank, that reflected populations of presumed centres of domestication. A 455 -bp fragment of the mtDNA D-loop region was sequenced in 283 chickens of 14 populations. Thirty-two variable sites that defined 34 haplotypes were observed. In Zimbabwean chickens, diversity within ecotypes accounted for 96. 8 % of the variation, indicating little differentiation between ecotypes. The 34 haplotypes clustered into three clades that corresponded to (i) Zimbabwean and Malawian chickens, (ii) broiler and layer purebred lines and Northwest <b>European</b> <b>chickens,</b> and (iii) a mixture of chickens from Zimbabwe, Sudan, Northwest Europe and the purebred lines. Diversity among clades explained more than 80 % of the total variation. Results indicated the existence of two distinct maternal lineages evenly distrib-uted among the five Zimbabwean chicken ecotypes. For one of these lineages, chickens from Zimbabwe and Malawi shared major haplotypes with chicken populations that have a Southeast Asian background. The second maternal lineage, probably from the Indian subcontinent, was common to the five Zimbabwean chicken ecotypes, Sudanese and Northwest <b>European</b> <b>chickens</b> as well as purebred broiler and layer chicken lines. A third maternal lineage excluded Zimbabwean and other African chickens and clustered with haplotypes presumably originating from South China...|$|R

In both plants and animals, genes that underlie traits that are ubiquitous in modern breeds (referred to as domestication genes) are often presumed to have been selected early during the domestication process. Here, by typing genetic variability in ancient <b>European</b> <b>chickens</b> over the past 2, 000 years, we show that a mutation though to be crucial during chicken domestication {{had not yet been}} subjected to strong human-mediated selection.

In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia. These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus's arrival in the Americas.|$|R

40|$|Some African {{countries}} have forbidden {{the import of}} frozen <b>European</b> <b>chickens,</b> and this could trigger the revival of a modernized local poultry industry. But the poultry fanners who wish {{to take advantage of}} this will have to become more familiar with the technologies involved. When deep-frozen <b>European</b> <b>chickens</b> first arrived in some African towns about ten years ago, the public grew accustomed to a plentiful supply of cheap meat. These birds were much cheaper than local ones because they and their offal benefited, directly or indirectly, from export subsidies. They created a large market among those who could not afford the traditionally-reared chickens. However, times have changed for some countries such as Cameroon, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire, which have decided to put a stop to these imports which, although low-cost, were proving too expensive in foreign exchange and at the same time preventing any intensive development of poultry-keeping locally. At that time there were many business failures because of the stiff competition from imports. Poultry houses erected near urban centres in Niger, Cote d'Ivoire and the Congo had to close down or be converted for other use. A new era Now the future looks more promising for local intensive poultry enterprises, protected as they are from competition. In general, poultry-rearing in Africa has recently risen dramatically; between 1980 and 1988 production of all categories has increased by more than two-thirds and by 1988 stood at more than two million tonnes per year. This has been due to progressive urbanization and the resulting change in dietary habits, a phenomenon unparalleled except in Asia. Eighty per cent of the demand from the cities is met now by small-scale poultry keepers with free-range birds. Birds produced on an industrial scale account for the rest. Overcoming the difficulties Logically the consumers of frozen chic kens, known ironically as 'mortuary chic kens', should go back to locally-produced birds, but this will happen only if they can be sold at competitive prices. This presents the local industry with a difficult challenge given the constraints on tropical aviculture. Poultry-rearing today is extremely technical. Birds live in intensive conditions; they are from selected, high-performance stock; and are nourished on industrially-produced complete feed. However, intensive methods used in temperate countries are not appropriate here, as the combination of heat and humidity create the right environment for fungi and bacteria which cause disease and lead to high mortality. Cool, ventilated buildings must be designed and built, and the density of birds per square metre must be reduced. Poultry sheds must have drinking water available and a regular electricity supply for forced ventilation: power cuts are fatal for chicks brought in from Europe by air. Heat can also depress the birds' appetites and their feed must be highly concentrated but small in volume to promote rapid growth. Prophylactic vaccines and medicines against tropical and imported diseases are expensive and often have to be imported. Village poultry-keeping needs encouragement Modern poultry-farming in Africa is still heavily dependent on imported products: medicine, day-old chicks and complete food. But there is no necessity for this state of affairs. New hatcheries mean chicks can be hatched out locally much more cheaply. In Niger the Goudel poultry centre will soon be able to supply the whole country. Nutritional supplements to enrich locally-produced feed may soon be the sole import. Therefore, the future of village poultry looks promising, despite some difficulties that remain to be overcome. Villages already produce more than three-quarters of the poultry meat consumed and have the technical and economic potential to achieve fuller development. Some African {{countries have}} forbidden the import of frozen <b>European</b> <b>chickens,</b> and this could trigger the revival of a modernized local poultry industry.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>chickens</b> were {{introduced}} into the American continents by the Spanish after their arrival in the 15 th century. However, there is ongoing debate as {{to the presence of}} pre-Columbian chickens among Amerindians in South America, particularly in relation to Chilean breeds such as the Araucana and Passion Fowl. To understand the origin of these populations, we have generated partial mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from 41 native Chilean specimens and compared them with a previously generated database of ≈ 1, 000 domestic chicken sequences from across the world as well as published Chilean and Polynesian ancient DNA sequences. The modern Chilean sequences cluster closely with haplotypes predominantly distributed among European, Indian subcontinental, and Southeast Asian chickens, consistent with a European genetic origin. A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate change}} is {{increasing}} the magnitude of environmental stressors, such as temperature, pathogens, and drought, that limit the survivability and sustainability of livestock production. Poultry production and its expansion is dependent upon robust animals {{that are able to}} cope with stressors in multiple environments. Understanding the genetic strategies that indigenous, noncommercial breeds have evolved to survive in their environment could help to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying biological traits of environmental adaptation. We examined poultry from diverse breeds and climates of Africa and Northern Europe for selection signatures that have allowed them to adapt to their indigenous environments. Selection signatures were studied using a combination of population genomic methods that employed FST, integrated haplotype score (iHS), and runs of homozygosity (ROH) procedures. All the analyses indicated differences in environment as a driver of selective pressure in both groups of populations. The analyses revealed unique differences in the genomic regions under selection pressure from the environment for each population. The African chickens showed stronger selection toward stress signaling and angiogenesis, while the Northern <b>European</b> <b>chickens</b> showed more selection pressure toward processes related to energy homeostasis. The results suggest that chromosomes 2 and 27 are the most diverged between populations and the most selected upon within the African (chromosome 27) and Northern European (chromosome 2) birds.

40|$|In {{a global}} economy food origin is gaining {{increasing}} attention as determining purchase criterion in food consumption. Consequently, for many consumers a product’s country-of-origin (COO) is an important cue in evaluating both domestic and foreign products. A double-bounded dichotomous choice approach in an in-store setting {{was used to assess}} consumers’ preference and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the product attribute “Swiss origin” relative to “European origin” for chicken meat. Data collection took place in the poultry section of six grocery stores in Francophone Switzerland. Sample selection was based on the consumer’s purchase decision, that is only actual chicken buyers were questioned. During the survey product data of participants’ actual purchase were recorded. Thus, both hypothetical stated and revealed consumer behaviour data were collected. Based on 450 records we highlight four different consumer segments, notably “Loyal Swiss”, “Low Price Swiss Zappers”, “Price Orientated”, and „The Gourmets”. At an equal price, 90 % of the entire sample prefers Swiss chicken meat. To elicit mean WTP for “Swiss origin” we used logit analysis. The results indicate that mean WTP differs significantly between the highlighted consumer segments. “Loyal Swiss” – medium to high priced Swiss chicken meat consumers – are willing to pay a premium of about 7. 40 Euros per kilo chicken breast of Swiss origin. This premium corresponds with actual price differences of at most 7. 50 €/kg for Swiss chicken breast relative to European found in the researched grocery stores. “Low Price Swiss Zappers” are willing to pay a premium of 2. 10 €/kg chicken breast of Swiss origin. In contrast, the “Price Orientated” and „The Gourmets” are not willing to pay any premium for Swiss origin. This corresponds with their revealed purchase behaviour as they bought imported <b>European</b> <b>chicken.</b> Considering mean WTP for the entire sample of 3. 00 €/kg for Swiss origin, we conclude {{that this is not a}} good predictor for specific consumer segments.

40|$|The {{domestic}} fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, or chicken, {{features as}} {{an important part of}} human society, culture and subsistence, both now and in the past. Despite studies into the origins and spread of many of the other domestic animals, the origins and nature of spread of the chicken west and into Europe has been largely neglected {{due to a lack of}} sufficient compiled evidence. It is widely accepted that chickens are descended from junglefowl in Asia and South East Asia, but more precise origins of the chicken are debated. As a bird with limited flight capability, the chicken has been transported worldwide by humans. Once the chicken arrived in Europe, very little attention has been given to the human-chicken interactions which governed its success, and enabled it to become permanently established in a region very different to where its ancestor originates- geographically, environmentally and culturally. This study compiles zooarchaeological evidence for the chicken across Europe, combines it with evidence from archaeology and anthropology, and takes the novel approach of applying ecological and biogeographical techniques. Such techniques complement traditional methods of archaeological assessment, and provide new and unique insights into the origins, spread and impact of this significant species. I establish the regions which are most suitable for initial domestication, and demonstrate that Europe would not be suitable for indigenous populations of the ancestor bird. This informs us about the human investment required to m aintain early populations of chicken. I identify India as the most likely origin of early <b>European</b> <b>chickens,</b> based on environmental suitability, presence of the ancestor species, and practical routes from Asia to Europe; but propose multiple centres of domestication in Asia. Once the chicken reaches Europe, multiple diffusion events associated with specific cultures are identified, primarily via trade routes. The niche of the ancestor is compared to the niche of the early domestic chicken and found to have shifted, indicating adaptation under domestication. The introduction of the chicken into Europe as a non-native species is shown to have directly and indirectly affected certain species, but the chicken itself is most affected by human agency. The date, location and context for the faunal remains, combined with literary evidence and material culture, establishes change and continuity in both use and perception of chickens by human societies. The conclusions and methods presented in this thesis are relevant to several subjects, including archaeology, zooarchaeology, ecology and conservation, and demonstrate the benefits of a multi- disciplinary approach...|$|R

About 7. 5 % of the respondents used neither of the remedies. To confirm the farmers’ perception on problematic external parasites of free-range chickens a diagnostic survey was conducted. Fifty free-range chickens were randomly selected and examined for external parasites. About 96 % of the free-range chickens examined harboured at least one species of external parasites. Fleas (Echidnophaga gallinacea) (50. 7 %) were the most prevalent followed by lice, Menopon gallinae (12. 4 %); Menacanthus stramineus (5. 3 %) and Knemidocoptes mutans (0. 57 %). Given that Jeyes fluid, used engine oil, paraffin, C. aurea, C. pulchella and T. minuta were mainly used in controlling these parasites, it was important to determine the potential dermal irritant effects of these plants. A dermal irritant effect test was, therefore, conducted using a rat model. Forty eight rats, with parts of the backs shaven, were used to screen the materials for irritation. All the materials tested did not cause any visible skin irritation on rats (p> 0. 05). Regarding that ethnoveterinary materials were non irritant on rat skin in vitro repellency and contact bio-assay models were used to assess the insecticidal properties of Tagetes minuta, Calpurnia aurea, Clutia pulchella, used engine oil, paraffin and Jeyes fluid on fleas. For the in vitro bioassay T. minuta and Jeyes fluid at 100 % concentration demonstrated a repellency level of 76 and 83 %, respectively. Tagetes minuta was the most effective among plant materials (p 0. 05). For the contact bio-assay, C. pulchella, C. aurea and T. minuta at a concentration of 100 % resulted in flea mortality of 83. 5, 73. 3 and 42. 5 %, respectively. The efficacy of Clutia pulchella compared well with that of Karbadust which had a mean mortality of 97. 5 %. Paraffin, used engine oil, and Jeyes fluid (19. 2 %) caused higher flea mortality of more than 82 %. In the in vivo study 60 free-range chickens were artificially infested with fleas and test materials were topically applied on infested sites. Test materials exhibited varying flea load reduction efficacy. Used engine oil and Jeyes fluid at 76. 8 % concentration had a reduction efficacy of 100 and 96 % after 3 days post application of test materials. These were not significantly different to that of the positive control Kabadust (carbaryl 5 %). The plants C. pulchella and C aurea at 100 % concentration had an efficacy of 92 and 77 %, respectively. The commonly used remedies by resource-limited farmers to control fleas vary in efficacy. Some of the materials are as effective as the commercial insecticides hence they have a potential to be exploited as insecticides. Further investigations on plant compounds with insecticidal properties and their toxicity, need to be conducted before the plants are recommended for use...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{complete}} {{linkage disequilibrium}} between the SNP (SNP B) in BCDO 2 gene {{and the yellow}} skin phenotype in <b>European</b> domestic <b>chicken</b> has been reported. Here, we genotyped the reported SNPs (SNP A, SNP B, and SNP C) of the BCDO 2 gene in 183 Chinese Indigenous chickens from 11 breeds/populations, including 57 yellow, 17 white, and 109 black skin chickens. The frequency of all three SNPs were significantly different between yellow and white skin chickens (p< 0. 01). In black skin chickens, a high frequency of the heterozygous genotype (AG) in SNP A (0. 51) and SNP B (0. 48) was observed. A total of three haplotypes (AAA, AGA, and GAA) from these three SNPs were obtained. Frequencies of the proposed yellow skin-associated haplotype AGA in yellow skin, white skin, and black skin chickens were 0. 81, 0. 35, and 0. 56, respectively. The {{results showed that the}} yellow skin phenotype of the evaluated birds has not been under selection, and that the BCDO 2 gene in black skin chickens, evolutionally may undergo a transition phase from yellow to white skin chicken. We concluded that, the SNPs of BCDO 2 gene not only can be used to determine whether the chicken was subjected to selection, but may also be used as a marker when selecting for the preferred skin color in chicken breeding programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of indigenous {{animal genetic resources}} is a requisite step in providing needed information {{for the conservation of}} useful genotypes against future needs. Thus, in this study, 22 microsatellite markers were used to genotype 114 local chickens from the Forest (n = 59) and Savannah (n = 55) eco-zones of Ghana and the results compared to those of the ancestral red junglefowl (n = 15) and two <b>European</b> commercial <b>chicken</b> populations – a broiler (n = 25) and white leghorn (n = 25). A total of 171 alleles were observed, with an average of 7. 8 alleles per locus. The local Ghanaian chickens showed higher diversity in terms of the observed number of alleles per locus (6. 6) and observed heterozygosity (0. 568) compared with the combined control populations (6. 0 and 0. 458, respectively). However, Wright's F-statistics revealed negligible genetic differentiation (FST) in local Ghanaian chicken populations. In addition, 65 % of the Savannah chickens were inferred to be more likely from the Forest, suggesting a south-north dispersal of chickens from their probable original location in the Forest zone to the Savannah areas. It is concluded that the Forest and Savannah chickens of Ghana are a single, randomly mating unselected population, characterized by high genetic diversity and constitute a valuable resource for conservation and improvement...|$|R
