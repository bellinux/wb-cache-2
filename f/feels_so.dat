25|$|In Chapter 100, Sima Yi warns Cao Zhen that Shu forces will, {{within the}} next ten days, launch an attack on Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu), a {{strategic}} location which would allow further incursions into the Wei heartland. After Cao Zhen refuses to believe Sima Yi, the two make a bet {{and each of them}} leads half of the Wei army to guard the valleys to the east and west of Mount Qi. Cao Zhen prepares for battle halfheartedly as he thinks that he is right. Seven days later, when his scouts report that a small number of Shu soldiers are approaching the valley, Cao Zhen sends his subordinate Qin Liang (秦良) to lead 5,000 men to survey the terrain. As Qin Liang and his men travel deeper into the valley, they fall into an ambush by Shu forces led by Liao Hua and Guan Xing and are completely destroyed. The Shu forces then disguise themselves by wearing the Wei soldiers' armour and uniform and infiltrate Cao Zhen's camp. In the meantime, Sima Yi encounters and defeats Shu forces led by Wei Yan. When he learns that no enemy forces have been spotted at Cao Zhen's side, he immediately leads his troops to Cao Zhen's camp. By then, the Shu infiltrators have launched a surprise attack within Cao Zhen's camp. Sima Yi shows up in time, drives back the Shu forces, and saves Cao Zhen. Cao Zhen <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> ashamed of himself that he falls sick. Zhuge Liang writes a letter to Cao Zhen to taunt and insult him. Cao Zhen becomes so angry after reading the letter that he coughs blood and dies that night in his camp. Sima Yi sends his dead body back to Luoyang, where he receives a proper burial.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] is a {{complimentary}} love song that contains [...] "curse" [...] words and a repetitive chorus. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{wrote that the}} song has a simple message evident in the lyrics, [...] "At {{the end of the}} day you are who you are and I love you that way." [...] Maz Halima of Flavour Magazine described the track as a [...] "serene song". [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] contains the line [...] "And you my lover / But I love you like a brother" [...] which, according to Popdust's Exton, is reminiscent of actress Angelina Jolie and her brother James Haven at the Oscars. Exton further explained that the song is full with vague descriptions of Rihanna's feelings, which result as [...] "hollow" [...] declaration that she is never going away. While singing the lines [...] "Middle of the Day / Give Me What I want / It <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> special / It <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> good" [...] she admits [...] "liking afternoon delights".|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger, said the meetings themselves were very entertaining and allowed for good character development between April and Andy, and Ron and April. However, {{he said the}} main plot with Leslie and the historic mansion was not tied strongly enough to Leslie's fear that Mark and Ann would get married. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the episode, especially the callbacks to previous episodes and {{the interaction of the}} characters during the meetings. Although the show was only on hiatus for about a month, he said, [...] "Man, it <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> good to have Parks and Recreation back.

500|$|Mountain Music, {{released}} in February 1982, is considered their final release before a significant upgrade in production and sound. All {{three of the}} album's singles reached number one: [...] "Mountain Music" [...] in May 1982, followed two months later by [...] "Take Me Down" [...] that July, and [...] "Close Enough to Perfect" [...] in October. That year, both Mountain Music and <b>Feels</b> <b>So</b> Right would go quadruple platinum; by late 1982, the band had sold over six million albums, despite just two years on the national circuit. [...] "Christmas in Dixie", a seasonal song {{released in}} 1982, charted on two of Billboard magazine's music popularity charts in six different calendar years.

500|$|... "Kiss & Cry" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} [...] music critics. A reviewer from Selective Hearing was positive in their review, labeling it a [...] "very catchy track".

[...] Tomoyuki Mori from Amazon was positive in his review, complimenting Utada's songwriting and production. He also praised the [...] "gorgeous atmospheric" [...] composition, and labelled it [...] "charming". Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express described the song as [...] "fun", and highlighted its composition as a strong factor to its overall delivery. However, Daniel Robson, who wrote for The Japan Times, felt its inclusion into Heart Station was disappointing as he quoted, [...] " [...] it’s followed by a run of five previous singles and a short, dull interlude track, which just <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> lazy." [...] He felt the inclusion, alongside other singles, made him question the value of the overall album.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] is a pop song lasting {{three minutes}} and twenty-six seconds. Written {{in the key}} of E major, it follows the chord {{progression}} G5—Dsus—Csus2—Dsus, beginning with a fast beat, composed of chiming electric guitar and drums and later progressing to [...] "the snares skip and the keyboards shimmer". In the view of Chris William of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Breakout"'s lyrics are [...] "a harangue against life's cruelest inequities", drawing attention to the opening verse, [...] "Every week's the same/Stuck in school's so lame/My parents say that I'm lazy/Getting up at 8 a.m.'s crazy/Tired of bein' told what to do/So unfair, so uncool," [...] though adding that the song {{was a sign that}} the [...] "little girl isn't growing up". However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times said the song was indeed about growing up fast, referencing the lines [...] "It <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> good to let go" [...] and [...] "Wish it would never end" [...] and Jodi Rosen of Rolling Stone also believed [...] "she's venting the frustrations of a teen who's too grown-up to submit to her parents, teachers or anyone else" [...] with the lines [...] "tired of bein' told what to do".|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|Agent Broyles {{discovers that}} the army did {{classified}} experiments in Edina called [...] "Project Elephant", {{but most of the}} records are gone. The team brings the body, along with a butterfly Walter found in the town and thought Astrid would like, back to the lab in Boston. They discover that both have transformed into deformed versions of themselves. Peter and Olivia go back to Edina to talk with the sheriff and try to locate the owner of the truck. Meanwhile, back in the lab, Walter tries to remember why the case <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> familiar. Throughout the episode Walter had been humming some strange melody, and he and Astrid realize he might previously have worked on the project with the army. The melody was a memory trick Walter used to remind himself where he stored the experiment files so many years ago. The experiment was done by the army in the late 1970s to test how electromagnetic pulses can camouflage soldiers and was conducted on the townspeople; the army was unaware of the long-term effects of the study until it was too late, and the people were stuck in a deformed state. The [...] "hum" [...] hides their deformities from the human eye through a massive electromagnetic pulse that runs through the town, and once they leave and are out of the pulse's reach, their true deformities show.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting. Hannah Lawrence from Hollywood was happy with romance of the episode, writing [...] "It seems clear that the writers are spending more time on characters finding love, and I actually enjoy it very much ... I suspect the writers are aware that ultimately what all of us want for the Dunder-Mifflin employees is love." [...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – and it <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going {{to be some kind of}} subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ... I feel 'Doomsday' was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity the show's been lacking severely since Michael's departure." ...|$|E

500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in which Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Michael Emerson comments Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him {{is a sort of}} scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science. He also described the events as a demonstration that [...] "Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a step or two ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game". The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E
500|$|According to {{sheet music}} {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] {{is written in}} common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Set in the key of A major, it follows the basic chord progression of A–E–D for the verse and A–E–Fm–D progression for the chorus, while Gaga's voice spans from A3 to D5 Gaga's references for the saxophone solo was E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen hence she ultimately asked Clarence Clemons from E Street Band to play the instrument. Clemons told Rolling Stone that in January 2011, he was contacted by Gaga's management and {{they wanted him to}} play on Born This Way. Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that he could record it on the coming Monday or Tuesday, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. Clemons flew from Florida to New York, and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "The Edge of Glory". She simply told Clemons, [...] "We'll put the tape on and you just play". The recording concluded by 3 a.m. after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised to get paid, since he [...] "would have done it for free. I can never believe something that <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> good earns me money." ...|$|E

They toured extensively, headlining small clubs and opening for bigger acts in major venues.

In February 1981, Alabama released its second major label album, <b>Feels</b> <b>So</b> Right; it peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and stayed for more than three years, longer than any other Alabama album. [...] "Old Flame" [...] was their next number one in February 1981, followed by [...] "Feels So Right" [...] in May, and [...] "Love in the First Degree" [...] that October. That year, Alabama received {{a great deal}} of industry attention: Billboard named them New Group for the Year, Radio & Records called them Group of the Year, and the Academy of Country Music (ACM) deemed the band the Vocal Group of the Year. The quintet performed on the 1981 Country Music Association Awards, where it received both Instrumental Group of the Year and Vocal Group of the Year. Although the band received unprecedented success, Owen's personal life was falling apart: his father died while he was on the road, affecting him greatly.|$|E
