5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Sir Mike Jackson, Dannatt was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of the British Army—on 29 August 2006. Concerned that {{the formation of the}} British Armed Forces Federation meant that soldiers were losing confidence in generals to lobby on their behalf, his first act as CGS was to write a long letter to the Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne, which he copied to the MoD's senior civil servant, Bill Jeffrey; Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS); and to the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Air Staff—his opposite numbers in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force respectively. In the letter, he asserted his view that the Army was over-stretched by operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and that essential equipment, such as helicopters, was unavailable or ineffective and outdated, like the Snatch Land Rover. He also raised concerns with the standard of accommodation provided for soldiers at home and with soldiers' wages. The following weekend, he travelled to Afghanistan on his first official visit as CGS. He met Des Browne in person for the first time two days after becoming CGS and later acknowledged the difficulties faced by defence secretaries in the little time they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for the role.|$|E

Milbury told the media, [...] "You can't {{do that in the}} NHL. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> yourself." [...] Luongo defended himself by saying he did not divert from his usual game day routine by looking at just one apartment. Luongo finished the season with the Islanders, posting a 3.25 GAA and [...]904 save percentage in 24 games.|$|E

500|$|Dein {{described}} Wenger as {{the most}} important manager in the club's history: [...] "Arsène's a miracle worker. He's revolutionised the club. He's turned players into world-class players. Since he has been here, we have seen football from another planet". Former Watford manager Graham Taylor said of Wenger in 2002: [...] "I believe his biggest contribution to football is getting across the idea that players <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> right and look after themselves". Wenger's loyalty towards financial fair play and handling of Arsenal's debt since their stadium move has earnt him praise, not least from American baseball general manager Billy Beane, who in particular lauded his transfer strategy. A survey in 2007 found Wenger was the only Premier League manager to have made a profit on transfers, and between 2004 and 2009, he made an average profit of £4.4million per season on transfers, far more than any other club.|$|E
500|$|In March 1930, Garrett {{was posted}} as adjutant/quartermaster to the 3rd Light Horse Regiment at Mount Gambier, South Australia. As a speaker at Mount Gambier's Anzac Day commemorations on 25 April 1934, he was {{reported}} as {{warning of the}} poor state of Australia's preparedness for war, admonishing: [...] "We shall {{not have the time}} that we had before the last war, and we shall not be fighting for our homes thousands of miles away. We shall be fighting at our own back door. That is what we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for." [...] In August that year he was transferred to the 4th Light Horse Regiment at Warrnambool, Victoria, as adjutant/quartermaster. Garrett was posted to the staff of Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1936, and departed for England in November the following year to attend the Staff College, Camberley. He was promoted to major in July 1938, and returned to Australia upon the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
500|$|Thomas was a {{teenager}} when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: [...] "And death shall have no dominion", [...] "Before I Knocked" [...] and [...] "The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower". [...] "And death shall have no dominion" [...] appeared in the New English Weekly in May 1933. When [...] "Light breaks where no sun shines" [...] appeared in The Listener in 1934, it {{caught the attention of}} three senior figures in literary London, T. S. Eliot, Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender. They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, 18 Poems, was published in December 1934. 18 Poems was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was [...] "the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years". The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the Sunday Referee, netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir. The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves. [...] A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin. In September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas {{did not know how to}} do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him. Years later, his wife Caitlin would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> his eggs for him. In December 1935 Thomas contributed the poem [...] "The Hand That Signed the Paper" [...] to Issue 18 of the bi-monthly New Verse. In 1936, his next collection Twenty-five Poems, published by J. M. Dent, also received much critical praise. In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London. It was the time that Thomas's reputation for heavy drinking developed.|$|E

2500|$|Overy {{wrote that}} blitzkrieg as a [...] "coherent {{military}} and economic concept has proven a difficult strategy to defend {{in light of the}} evidence". Milward's theory was contrary to Hitler's and German planners' intentions. The Germans, aware of the errors of the First World War, rejected the concept of organising its economy to fight only a short war. Therefore, focus was given to the development of armament in depth for a long war, instead of armament in breadth for a short war. Hitler claimed that relying on surprise alone was [...] "criminal" [...] and that [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for a long war along with surprise attack". During the winter of 1939–40, Hitler demobilised many troops from the army to return as skilled workers to factories because the war would be decided by production, not a quick [...] "Panzer operation".|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, in an {{interview}} with Geoff Keighley, when a fan asked [...] "which game do you want to direct or reboot?" [...] Kojima stated without hesitation, [...] "Silent Hill". Keighley jumped in and asked [...] "What {{do you want to do}} with Silent Hill?" [...] Kojima responded: [...] "A guy [...] that is such a chicken and is so easily scared – making a scary game – I'm very confident that something horrifying would come out from that. But on the other hand I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> myself to have nightmares every single day. Hopefully sometime in the future I'm able to work on this, but I would really need to prepare to have daily nightmares." [...] In August 2014, P.T. was released on the PlayStation Store revealed that a new game in the Silent Hill franchise titled Silent Hills was being directed by Kojima for the PlayStation 4, alongside Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro. In April 2015, the playable trailer was removed and the game was officially cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} during {{the days of the}} Temple, seven days before Yom Kippur, they would move the High Priest from his house to the cell of the counselors and prepare another priest to take his place in case {{anything}} impure happened to him to make him unfit to perform the service. Rabbi Judah said that they prepared another wife for him, in case his wife should die, as [...] says that [...] "he shall make atonement for himself and for his house" [...] and [...] "his house" [...] means [...] "his wife." [...] But they told Rabbi Judah that if they would do so, then there would be no end to the matter, as they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> a third wife in case the second died, and so on. The rest of the year, the High Priest would offer sacrifices only if he wanted to, but during the seven days before Yom Kippur, he would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifices, burn the incense, trim the lamps, and offer the head and the hind leg of the sacrifices. They brought sages from the court to the High Priest, and throughout the seven days they read to him about the order of the service. They asked the High Priest to read it aloud, in case he had forgotten or never learned.|$|E
