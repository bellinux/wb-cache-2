40|$|The {{uncontrolled}} {{release of}} radioactive fission {{products from the}} primary circuit of a nuclear power reactor, described as “release source term”, {{is one of the}} major criteria for assessing a severe nuclear accident. A large number of tests were carried out under the European Commission (EC) Framework Programmes to improve our understanding of the fission product behaviour. Especially the five integral pile tests that were carried out in the Phébus FP programme lead to an increased understanding of the mechanisms of severe accidents, but also emphasized the need of further separate effect tests to study some individual phenomena in more detail. One of these was the possibility of chemical revaporisation of fission products (especially 137 Cs) after their initial deposition inside the primary circuit or containment. This revaporisation can lead to a significant release in the late phase of a severe accident which was previously not taken into account when calculating the release source term. To study this behaviour using realistic samples of fission product deposits, which were obtained from the Phébus test circuit, a lead shielded revaporisation device was designed and set-up inside a glove box. In the device, a compact high temperature furnace is used to heat the samples under a controlled gas flow up to 1273 K with nearly ambient pressure. The gas flow is slow enough to prevent physical resuspension. <b>It</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> steam, air or argon. An on-line gamma spectroscopy system is used to scrutinize the revaporisation behaviour by monitoring the loss of activity for the 137 Cs in the sample. In the most recent test sequence, consisting of 3 experiments, samples from the Phébus FPT 3 upper vertical line were heated with 2 K/min up to 1273 K under steam, hydrogen or air. The tests showed similar results for the two experiments under oxidising conditions (steam or air) were used as process gas. Revaporisation started for steam at ~ 810 K respectively for air at ~ 860 K and progressed for some time with a loss of activity equal to ~ 1 %/min. More than ~ 90 % of the 137 Cs had revaporised at the end of the experiment. The experiment using reducing conditions (pure hydrogen) showed diverse results. The revaporisation did not start before ~ 955 K and progressed with a slower loss of activity (~ 0. 7 %/min). The total amount of revaporisation was only 79 %, which was caused by a power outage which the system experienced before the planned heating sequence had finished. Nevertheless, the results show that revaporisation is possible and that a switch in the atmospheric conditions (reducing to oxidising) lowers the threshold temperature which is necessary to trigger revaporisation. For the last experiment a sampling method was introduced to determine the size and chemical composition of the aerosols that form after the process gas is cooled down. Analysis showed a large number of particles in the diameter range 8 - 20 nm and EDX revealed Cs, Re and Si to be their main components. JRC. E. 2 -Safety of Irradiated Nuclear Material...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{radiolysis}} {{of water}} confined in montmorillonites is studied {{as a function of}} the composition of the montmorillonite, the nature of the exchangeable cation, and the relative humidity by following the H 2 production under electron irradiation. It is shown that the main factor influencing this H 2 production is the water amount in the interlayer space. The effect of the exchangeable cation is linked to its hydration enthalpy. When the water amount is high enough to get a basal distance higher than 1. 3 nm, then a total energy transfer from the montmorillonite sheets to the interlayer space occurs, and the H 2 production measured is very similar to the one obtained in bulk water. For a basal distance smaller than 1. 3 nm, the H 2 production increases with the relative humidity and thus with the water amount.

Thin layers of PrF 3 NPs suspensions in water were prepared and dried on 1 -mm-thick VUV-grade CaF 2 substrates by applying the “drop-casting method”. Then, the CaF 2 substrates were placed in the optical path between the hydrogen lamp and the VUV monochromator in a vacuum. The stainless steel 316 vacuum chamber was evacuated initially to 10 −[*] 7  mbar using two turbomolecular pumps at a differential pumping configuration (Edwards EXT 100 / 200, pumping speed 150 ls− 1).

The relatively low background pressure of both compounds irreversibly damages the VUV optics and the turbomolecular pump after few hours of operation and therefore it sets certain experimental constraints, preventing an equivalent registration of LaF 3 spectrum because of high outgassing rates and a low background operating pressure (<[*] 10 − 4  mbar).

40|$|The {{world is}} facing a severe threat in terms of climate change, {{and the use of}} fossil fuels for {{transport}} and electricity production is a major contributor. The use <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> is foreseen to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport by means <b>of</b> using <b>hydrogen</b> in fuel cell vehicles as well as increase energy security in electricity production by means <b>of</b> using <b>hydrogen</b> as temporary storage of energy. In this thesis I have calculated the GHG emissions for several promising hydrogen production methods for today and the potential reduction towards 2050 through life cycle assessment. Then, I have estimated a technical potential for hydrogen production in 2050, based on available biomass in form of waste, short rotational crops and residues from agriculture, forestry and farming. Last, I put together a life cycle assessment <b>of</b> the <b>hydrogen</b> semi-truck Nikola One, to found the basis of a scenario assessment <b>of</b> using <b>hydrogen</b> as fuel for road freight transport in Europe towards 2050. The initial life cycle assessment, calculated per kg hydrogen, showed a large variation for the following hydrogen production methods: biogas steam reforming (3. 9 kg CO 2 -eq), gasification (10. 8 kg CO 2 -eq), dark fermentation together with photo fermentation (8 kg CO 2 -eq), dark fermentation together with microbial electrolysis cell (13. 2 kg CO 2 -eq) and a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (40 kg CO 2 -eq). For the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE), 85 % of the emissions was due to the use of electricity, assumed to be from the European electricity mix. For the rest, that are based on biomass, their emissions originates on average 25 % from the use of short rotational woody crops, and forestry residues as biomass feedstock, 29 % from the use of fossil gas as energy source for heat and steam, and 38 % from the use of electricity. To assess the potential emission reduction towards 2050 I assumed that the production methods that uses fossil gas for heating will convert to using biomass instead. I also assume, based on EUs Reference Scenario for 2050, that the emission per kWh for the European energy mix reduces with 37 %. Per kg hydrogen produced the results are: biogas steam reforming (2. 8 kg CO 2 -eq), gasification (3. 7 kg CO 2 -eq), dark fermentation together with photo fermentation (5. 5 kg CO 2 -eq), dark fermentation together with microbial electrolysis cell (8. 9 kg CO 2 -eq) and a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (27 kg CO 2 -eq). To calculate the total hydrogen production capacity for Europe in 2050 I assume that <b>it</b> mainly will <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> from biomass due to the low GHG emissions. In addition, I assume that water electrolysis uses 1 % of available electricity from solar, wind, and hydropower to produce hydrogen to secure the system, so {{that it is possible to}} have a complete hydrogen fueling system for transport. Calculations shown that by using all the technical biomass capacity in form of waste, short rotational crops and residues from agriculture, forestry and farming a total of 92. 9 megatons <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> can be produced per year, given the use of biogas steam reforming, gasification and dark fermentation together with photo fermentation. The total yearly hydrogen production from water electrolysis is estimated to be 0. 3 megatons. The resulting European average GHG emission per kg hydrogen is 4 kg CO 2 -eq. An estimate of the total fuel consumption for road freight transport in 2050, given a full transition over to hydrogen, show that it is needed 21 megatons <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> which is 23 % of the estimated potential yearly production of 2050. To assess the potential GHG mitigation potential for a freight transport fleet fueled on hydrogen I have conducted a life cycle assessment <b>of</b> the <b>hydrogen</b> truck Nikola One. The results, given an emission of 4 kg CO 2 -eq per kg H 2, show that there is a emission reduction potential of 45 %, compared to today, and a emission reduction potential of 54 %, compared to a scenario for 2050 with only use of fossil fuels. My results show that here is a potential for large-scale hydrogen production from biomass in Europe towards 2050, and that it can supply fuel for the entire road freight transport fleet. The GHG emissions are nevertheless dependent both on the different production methods, the use of fossil gas and the electricity mix. Hydrogen from water electrolysis is especially sensitive to emissions from the energy mix, and should only be used directly together with renewable energy...|$|R
