40|$|Abstract: Frozen-thawed {{fish and}} fillets are being marketed as <b>fresh</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillets.</b> One {{of the methods}} which helps us to {{differentiate}} unfrozen from frozen-thawed fish fillet is the enzymatic method. By means of the freezing and thawing process lysosomal enzymes are released. Lysosomal enzyme activities have the enzymes which decompose protein, carbohydrate, fat and nucleic acids. In this research, fresh, stored in ice, frozen and smoked salmon fish (Onchorhyncus keta and Salmo salar) have been used. In press juice and in extracts of these fish a muscle lysosomal enzyme a-Glucosidase (E. C. 3. 2. 1. 20) in activitation quantities was detected. The lysosomal enzyme activities of the press juice of frozen-thawed salmon fish fillets were observed to be higher thanthose of fresh salmon fish fillets. The a-Glucosidase activity (D E 405 x 10 - 2 h- 1 x mg protein) was detected as 0. 151 (at the beginning) in fresh fillets of salmon fish and that value of the salmon fish which are stored in ice was observed to have increased to 0. 309 by the 9 th day. The activity in frozen-thawed fillets was detected as 1. 185 to 1. 503. The a-Glucosidase activity of smoked salmon with different storage expiry periods was observed to be 0. 969 - 4. 51. At {{the end of the}} research {{it can be said that}} the lisosomal enzyme a-Glucosidase (E. C. 3. 2. 1. 20) can be used to differentiate between processed, nonprocessed, fresh and frozen-thawed fish and fillets...|$|E

The isolates were screened {{for their ability to}} influence the growth of Staphylococcus aureus strain 196 E by means of spot-plate tests on APT and nutrient agars at 25 C. The 438 cultures that influenced the growth of S. aureus were retested on spot plates at 15, 30, and 42 C. After elimination of replicates, the 143 remaining cultures were classified into species, genera, or groups, and 14 different cultures were tested for their influence on the growth of S. aureus in APT broth at 25 C. Over half of the effective cultures inhibited S. aureus and less than half were stimulatory. Pork sausage had the highest proportion of inhibitory cultures, and stewing beef had the lowest. APT agar was better than nutrient agar for screening, and incubation at 15 C gave more effector organisms than at 30 and 42 C. Most of the lactic acid bacteria were inhibitory, but other groups of bacteria contained more stimulatory cultures than inhibitory ones. The three Escherichia coli cultures were stimulatory, but most other Escherichia cultures were inhibitory. Aerobacter and Paracolobactrum isolates were mostly stimulatory. Cultures of other kinds of bacteria were more or less evenly distributed between inhibitory ones and stimulatory ones. Genera containing mostly inhibitory bacteria were Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, and Lactobacillus. Inhibitory species were E. freundii and E. intermedia. Tests with S. aureus in broth indicated that all cultures inhibitory according to spot plates were inhibitory in broth, but stimulation on spot plates did not always indicate the same phenomenon in broth...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} raw-appearing restructured models made from hake (Merluccius capensis) muscle, using cold gelation technology by addition of sodium alginate and microbial transglutaminase (MTGase), were studied during frozen storage at - 15 °C. Among {{the more interesting}} results, addition of MTGase produced more protein aggregation in models processed by muscle homogenization and thus the protein network that formed in the gel was better than in samples with added sodium alginate. All samples presented enhanced changes in mechanical properties such as gel strength {{in the course of}} frozen storage. The protein network that formed was better organized as shown by the ultrastructure analysis and by protein aggregation data from the beginning of storage, and as a result Water Binding Capacity was greater in restructured models processed by muscle homogenization. Some of the models studied presented lipid oxidation during frozen storage, slightly more in the ones with MTGase added. Industrial Relevance: The industrial relevance of the present work is to establish bases for using <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> trimmings and minced muscle to prepare restructured products that can be commercialized in a raw state and that could also support frozen storage in order to prolong the self-life in the market. The models studied here are not final products but the base with which to prepare them. One possibility of them is to process this kind of products with technologies normally used in whole fish muscle such as smoked <b>fish</b> <b>fillets,</b> carpaccios or marinated products. In addition, these raw restructured products can be commercialized to be cooked as a normal <b>fresh</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> or pieces of fillet in a variety of preparations, and also products that contain a high amount of salt. Samples elaborated by binding larger muscle fragments imitate well the original fibrousness of the muscle so that it could be used to elaborate products similar to hamburgers or others that will be fried in batter. © 2009.

40|$|Since {{the early}} twentieth century and {{particularly}} during World War II and in the post Confederation era Newfoundland has experienced the impact of the modernization process. Increased urbanization, a more diversified economy, and a vast improvement in transportation and communication are among some of the major developments arising out of this process.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and test a food grade nanoemulsion as an improved delivery medium for applying phytochemicals to extend the shelf life of fresh foods. The hypothesis was that phenolics, which have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic structures, can bind at the interface of an oil-water solution. Nanoemulsions, with high surface areas, should therefore have a high interfacial absorption capacity for otherwise less soluble phytochemicals and act as a universal solvent to deliver the antimicrobial and antioxidant effects into fresh foods. The food grade nanoemulsion was developed from 10 % (v/v) vegetable oil and 5 % (w/v) modified starch HI-CAP 100 using a microfluidizer at 95 MPa pressure for more than two processing cycles. These nanoemulsion ranged in particle size from 180 to 220 nm. The developed nanoemulsion was stable for more than a year at - 80 °C and 8 weeks at room temperature. The solubility enhancement of phenolics using nanoemulsion was determined with respect to their solubilities in oil and water. The nanoemulsion acted as a universal solvent for phenolics with a wide range of log P phase partitioning values. The solubility enhancement of phenolic compounds in nanoemulsion, compared to their solubility in water was ascorbyl palmitate > quercetin > rutin > vanillic acid > vanillin > caffeic acid > gallic acid with a solubility enhancement factor of 40, 27, 15, 4, 3. 2, 2. 3 and 0. 63 times increased solubility respectively. The solubility enhancement of the emulsion compared to oil was in the order ascorbyl palmitate > rutin > quercetin > vanillic acid > caffeic acid > curcumin > vanillin with an increase of 19. 5, 15, 10, 7, 3. 6, 3. 5 and 2. 3 fold respectively. The nanoemulsion was also able to dissolve 6477 ± 276, 3533 ± 314 and 519 ± 4 µg/mL of tea, apple and grape seed extracts. However, these solubilities were lower than the aqueous solubilities of these extracts. The ability of nanoemulsions to deliver various phenolic compounds to fish fillets dipped in nanoemulsions diluted into aqueous solutions was measured. Gallic acid was tested as a model for delivery onto <b>fresh</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillets</b> at various concentrations ranging from 200 - 1200 µg/mL. A fourfold increase in the binding of gallic acid by fish muscle was observed after a 30 minute dip in the nanoemulsion compared to uptake from a water control at the same concentration. Similarly all other tested compounds showed absorption to fish muscle when delivered as a nanoemulsion. The extent of absorption was time and concentration dependent, though most of the absorption occurred in the first 10 minutes. (+) -Catechin was the only exception where the aqueous delivery of catechin to fish fillet was superior compared to nanoemulsion delivery. The ability of the nanoemulsion to suppress fish off flavours, particularly trimethylamine (TMA), was tested as a criterion for the effectiveness of the nanoemulsion as a preservative delivery medium. A screening trial with phytochemicals showed variable suppression effects of TMA production. Selected phytochemicals and their combinations were then tested in quadruplicate for their ability to suppress TMA levels in treated fish. All the phytochemicals added to nanoemulsions showed significant (p < 0. 05) effects on production of TMA when compared with their aqueous solutions. TMA levels in the control fish rose from 4 mg/ 100 g fish on day 0 to 12 mg/ 100 g fish on day 10 of storage at 8 °C. The most effective results were achieved by synergies of two compounds such as vanillin/β-carotene and β-carotene/curcumin where final TMA values 1. 5 mg/ 100 g and 3. 4 mg/ 100 g fish on day 10 of storage were achieved respectively. The nanoemulsion without phytochemicals was also partially effective in reducing the TMA level. These suppression effects of diluted blank nanoemulsion were related to the level of water added to blank nanoemulsions when used as dip mediums. The present findings present new information on the development of water dilutable, stable food grade nanoemulsions with the ability to dissolve and deliver a variety of phytochemicals. The use of hydrophobic phenolics as a dip medium was made possible by solubilization of phytochemicals into nanoemulsion. Similarly combinations of hydrophobic/hydrophilic and hydrophobic/hydrophobic phenolics as preservatives have been made possible extending the shelf life of fish beyond that achievable by water soluble combinations...|$|E
