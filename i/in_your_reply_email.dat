6000|$|The {{dinner is}} to {{comprise}} the new feature of ladies dining {{at the tables}} with the gentlemen--not looking down upon them from the gallery.

6000|$|I presume {{you will}} answer Bismarck’s kind telegram. Please to [...] mention me <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>reply</b> or not {{as you think}} proper. As to the [...] {{impending}} crisis of our fate, one important element, I admit, will [...] be {{the feeling of the}} party. I have asked Peel (whose first [...] feeling seems rather to be with you) to learn what he can. I tend [...] to harden in my own view, principle and precedent seeming to me [...] alike clear. There are four precedents of our own time—1835, 1841, [...] 1852, 1859, under three ministers. The only case the other way is [...] that of 1868 of which the circumstances were altogether peculiar. [...] But I admit it to be very doubtful whether we should get beyond [...] the address. On the other hand I admit freely that I have no title [...] to press my view beyond a certain point.|$|R

[...] "You {{might have}} {{overlooked}} some trifling thing that won't be of no use {{to you in the}} jungle, but that'll come in mighty handy to a poor sailorman in London. Ah! just as I feared," [...] he ejaculated an instant later as he withdrew a roll of bank-notes from Paulvitch's inside coat pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! Your manner, so {{different}} from the interest and sympathy which endear you to so many hearts, your altered voice, the constraint there is in everything you say, and <b>in</b> <b>your</b> looks," [...] <b>replied</b> the student, [...] "warn me that you know me.

6000|$|... "Greatly as {{time and}} {{suffering}} have altered him in many respects, {{there is no}} change, Valeria, in the aversion--the horror I may even say--with which he views your idea of inquiring anew into the circumstances which attended the lamentable death of his first wife. It makes no difference to him that you are only animated {{by a desire to}} serve his interests. 'Has she given up that idea? Are you positively sure she has given up that idea?' Over and over again he has put these questions to me. I have answered--what else could I do in the miserably feeble state in which he still lies?--I have answered in such a manner as to soothe and satisfy him. I have said, 'Relieve your mind of all anxiety on that subject: Valeria {{has no choice but to}} give up the idea; the obstacles in her way have proved to be insurmountable--the obstacles have conquered her.' This, if you remember, was what I really believed would happen when you and I spoke of that painful topic; and I have heard nothing from you since which has tended to shake my opinion in the smallest degree. If I am right (as I pray God I may be) in the view that I take, you h ave only to confirm me <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>reply,</b> and all will be well. In the other event--that is to say, if you are still determined to persevere <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hopeless project--then make up your mind to face the result. Set Eustace's prejudices at defiance in this particular, and you lose your hold on his gratitude, his penitence, and his love--you will, in my belief, never see him again.|$|R
60|$|<b>Yours,</b> <b>in</b> <b>reply</b> to mine about horses, received. Of {{course you}} know the facts better than I; still two {{considerations}} remain: Stuart's cavalry outmarched ours, having certainly done more marked service on the Peninsula and everywhere since. Secondly, will not a movement of our army be a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate instead of foraging in squads everywhere? But I am so rejoiced to learn from your despatch to General Halleck that you begin crossing the river this morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Happy <b>in</b> <b>your</b> ignorance!" [...] <b>replied</b> the poet, {{with an air}} of sublime superiority. [...] "To your coarser mind, perhaps, I {{may seem}} to speak of more {{important}} griefs when I add, what I had well-nigh forgotten, that I am out at elbows, and almost starved to death. At any rate, you have the advice and example of one individual to warn you back; for I am come hither, a disappointed man, flinging aside the fragments of my hopes, and seeking shelter in the calm retreat which you are so anxious to leave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{me wrong}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> thoughts," [...] <b>replied</b> the student, flushing. [...] "One of the Queen's {{secretaries}} is {{even at this}} moment coming along this track in company with Hockins and Ebony. While seated at breakfast I saw Rafaravavy walk in this direction, and somehow I took it into my head that you would surely meet her here--I know not why I thought so, unless it be that in like circumstances I myself would have acted the same part--so I hastened on in advance to warn you. Hush! do you not hear their steps?" ...|$|R
30|$|For the {{question}} “Are {{you satisfied with}} the current implementation of patient-specific dosimetry <b>in</b> <b>your</b> centre?”, 45 % of the responders answered Yes and 55 % answered No. For {{the question}} “Which factors limit the implementation of patient-specific dosimetry <b>in</b> <b>your</b> centre?”, the <b>reply</b> alternatives were non-exclusive.

[...] Those lines, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> last kind <b>reply</b> to me, rouse my courage, dear Mr. Governor, and sharpen the vigilance which has always been one of the strong points in my character. Every suspicious circumstance which occurs in this house will be (so to speak) seized on by my pen, and will find itself (so to speak again) placed on its trial, before your unerring judgment! Let the wicked tremble! I mention no names.|$|R

60|$|It has {{not been}} {{customary}} heretofore, nor will it be hereafter, {{for me to say}} something to every regiment passing in review. It occurs too frequently for me to have speeches ready on all occasions. As you have paid such a mark of respect to the chief magistrate, it appears that I should say a word or two <b>in</b> <b>reply.</b> <b>Your</b> colonel has thought fit, on his own account and <b>in</b> <b>your</b> name, to say that you are satisfied with the manner in which I have performed my part in the difficulties which have surrounded the nation. For your kind expressions I am extremely grateful, {{but on the other hand}} I assure you that the nation is more indebted to you, and such as you, than to me.
