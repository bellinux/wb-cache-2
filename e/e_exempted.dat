40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that past performance is a good predictor of future performance. The exact strength of that relationship, however, has been unclear. Knowing the predictive power of past performance on future performance is particularly important for employers who make hiring decisions {{based in part on}} internal candidates’ performance record. Generally, some of the internal candidates’ performance would be measured at different points of time (e. g., 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months ago). Others under consideration will be external candidates, whose employment information is derived from selection devices such as structured interviews and intelligence tests. This paper uses a meta-analysis to examine 20 previously published studies on the stability of job performance over time. It provides an estimate of the relationship between existing performance measures and future performance, and models the nature of this relationship {{as a function of the}} elapsed time between measures. The findings show conclusively that, in general, past performance is, indeed, a good predictor of future performance for a variety of job types (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>exempt,</b> nonexempt, and those that are evaluated subjectively). Using a hypothetical selection scenario, this report also demonstrates how that information can be used to compare multiple internal and external candidates...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} (1) compare outcome {{assessments}} in normal and osteoarthritic cats and (2) evaluate the analgesic efficacy of tramadol in feline osteoarthritis (OA), in a prospective, randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Twenty cats were included after clinical examination, blood work and full body radiographs were performed. In Phase 1, outcome assessments aimed to differentiate normal (n = 5; i. <b>e.</b> <b>exempt</b> of any radiographic and clinical sign of OA) from OA (n = 15) cats. In Phase 2, OA cats were treated twice daily with a placebo (PG: cornstarch 15 mg) or tramadol (TG: 3 mg/kg) orally for 19 days, with a 3 -month washout period between treatments. Evaluations were performed in normal and OA cats at baseline and consisted of: 1) peak vertical force (PVF) after staircase exercise; 2) telemetered night-time motor activity (NMA); and 3) response to mechanical temporal summation (RMTS). After treatment, PVF, NMA and RMTS evaluations were repeated in OA cats. Data were analysed with mixed model methods with an alpha-threshold of 5 %. Phase 1 : 1) PVF (% of body weight; mean ± SD) was higher in normal (59 ± 10. 5) than in OA cats (50. 6 ± 5. 7) (p = 0. 005); 2) NMA (no unit) was not different between groups; 3) RMTS (number of stimuli; median (range)) was higher in normal [29. 5 (23. 5 - 30) ] than in OA cats [14 (8. 5 - 28) ] (p < 0. 0001). Phase 2 : PVF, NMA and RMTS presented a treatment effect (p = 0. 024, p = 0. 008 and p = 0. 018, respectively). No clinically important adverse-effects were observed. Outcome assessments such as kinetics (PVF) {{and evaluation of}} central sensitisation (RMTS) are discriminant of OA status. Mobility measured by NMA was not discriminant of OA status, however it increased in OA cats with tramadol treatment. Nociceptive hypersensitivity quantified by RMTS was evident in OA cats and was responsive to tramadol treatment...|$|R

50|$|The EB-29 (<b>E</b> {{stands for}} <b>exempt),</b> {{was used as}} a carrier {{aircraft}} in which the bomb bay was modified to accept and launch experimental aircraft. They were converted in the years following World War II. One EB-29 was converted to carry the famous Bell X-1 until it was replaced by a B-50. Another was used to carry and test the XF-85 'parasite fighter'. This fighter was intended to be carried by the Convair B-36 on long-range missions to protect it from Soviet fighters. Another EB-29 was used to carry two EF-84B Thunderjet fighters as part of Project Tom-Tom. All three Tom-Tom aircraft (the B-29 and the two jet fighters) and their crews were lost in a crash on April 24, 1953.|$|R
40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007, New York City began using student tests and other {{measures}} to assign each school a grade (A to F), and linked grades to rewards and consequences, including possible school closure. These grades were released in late September, arguably too late for schools to make major changes in programs or personnel, and students were tested again in January (English) and March (math). Despite this time frame, regression discontinuity estimates indicate that receipt of a low grade significantly increased student achievement, more so in math than English, and improved parental evaluations of school quality. School accountability systems link rewards and consequences {{to a set of}} measurable outcomes, typically student scores on standardized tests. While these systems aim to improve school quality and academic achievement, a substantial literature on accountability has focused on how schools may act in ways that improve accountability measures but do not actually raise achievement (<b>e.</b> g., <b>exempting</b> low performing students from testing) or raise achievement for a subset of students (i. e., those given more weight in the accountability system) at their classmates’ expense. 1 In short, {{there is a great deal}} of evidence on the pitfalls of school accountability, but far less evidence that these systems can lead to increases in student achievement...|$|R
50|$|Series E U.S. Savings Bonds were marketed by the United States {{government}} as war bonds from 1941 to 1980. Those issued from 1941 to November 1965 accrued interest for 40 years; those issued from December 1965 to June 1980, for 30 years.

40|$|Legitimacy of {{public-private}} partnerships for combatting cybercrime partially {{depends on whether}} or not law enforcement data processing activities are subject to the same data protection-related restrictions, whether they involve cooperation of private parties or not. - Information sharing within PPPs is a complex phenomenon with various configurations and power structures. This complexity needs to be accounted for in the analysis of the applicability of the two data protection regimes. - GDPR as a general data protection instrument and the Police Directive as a lex specialis are meant to leave no space for the private-public data transfers to fall through the cracks. However, which legal regime applies when private entities and law enforcement act as joint controllers is a grey area of the dual EU data protection regime and may seriously undermine legitimacy of PPPs, unless private parties are given status of competent authorities or controllership within PPPs is assigned in a special legal act. - Private parties may be subject to less data protection restrictions, <b>e.</b> g. <b>exempted</b> from the purpose limitation principle, when collaborating with the law enforcement. This may create motivation for the public law enforcement to actively seek such collaboration to avoid constraints imposed on them by law. - It is recommended that the legislative measures creating such exemptions subject private-public data transfers to the same conditions of legality of processing as the processing by competent authorities...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophySelf {{assessment}} for individual taxpayers {{was first introduced}} in Malaysia for the 2004 year of assessment. This change from the previous official assessment system to self assessment has redefined the roles and responsibilities of both taxpayers and tax administrators in Malaysia. In particular, self assessment has placed the onus on individual taxpayers, both salary and wage earners and the self-employed, to voluntarily and correctly determine their own tax liabilities. The level of voluntary compliance achieved under self assessment {{was expected to be}} influenced not only by taxpayers’ ability to understand the compliance requirements of the income tax law, but also by their behaviour in relation to a range of economic, fiscal, psychological and sociological factors. In this context, the main objective of this research was to investigate the influence of the introduction of self assessment on the compliance behaviour of individual taxpayers in Malaysia. In addition, the research sought to identify the causes (such as ‘tax knowledge’, ‘tax structure features’, ‘financial constraints’ and ‘attitudes towards tax’) that may influence taxpayers’ compliance behaviour; and the nature of their influence, in relation to the introduction of self assessment in Malaysia. Demographic variables (such as age, gender, level of education and ethnic background) were also investigated to provide another dimension (as moderating variables) to the analysis of compliance behaviour. Six research questions were developed to address the objectives of the research. A mixed method design comprising two quantitative research methods (survey and experiment) and one qualitative research method (case study) was conducted concurrently in three phases. The findings derived were triangulated via a cross-method analysis to address the six research questions. The findings revealed that the introduction of self assessment had had a positive influence on individual taxpayers’ compliance behaviour. This was attributed to individual taxpayers having a greater awareness of the change in their responsibilities as a result of self assessment, and that this in turn led to an improvement in their tax knowledge. As there was no prior comparable empirical evidence available in relation to the impact of the introduction of self assessment on tax compliance behaviour, this research finding is an important contribution to existing knowledge on the compliance behaviour of individual taxpayers. Based on the findings of the research, it was found that tax knowledge had significant effects on the compliance behaviour of individual taxpayers. The lack of tax knowledge did cause numerous errors in tax returns prepared and furnished by individual taxpayers, resulting in unintentional non-compliance by some and over compliance by others. Tax structure features showed reasonably strong effects on taxpayers’ compliance behaviour. Empirical evidence revealed that fear of being tax audited and penalised had also indirectly influenced individual taxpayers’ compliance decisions. Thus it is concluded that individual taxpayers were sensitive to the two tax structure features, namely tax audit and penalty, while the effect of the tax rates on their compliance behaviour was marginally less significant. Financial constraints were found to have more direct and strong influence on the compliance behaviour of self-employed taxpayers. The issue of financial constraints was not of major concern among the salary and wage earners under the self assessment regime. However, as the tax rates imposed on individual taxpayers in Malaysia are relatively low as compared to some other countries (such as those in Australia and New Zealand), and coupled with relief and rebates available, individual taxpayers could be paying very minimal taxes. In terms of attitudes towards tax, two prominent findings emerged from the survey and the case study. Firstly, taxpayers’ attitudes, in terms of confidence in handling their tax affairs, did {{have a positive impact on}} their compliance behaviour. Secondly, taxpayers’ attitudes towards the tax system, the tax administration and tax officers had negative effects on their compliance decisions. In contrast to the effects of financial constraints, these findings on attitudes towards tax appeared to be only affecting the compliance behaviour of individuals who were salary and wage earners. Finally, in the multi-ethnic society of Malaysia, this research revealed evidence of the different needs of ethnic groups in relation to tax education, how they manage their tax affairs, how the tax structure features as well as how their attitudes towards tax had affected their decision to comply. This research also revealed evidence of the different compliance behaviour of the two categories of taxpayers (i. e. the salary and wage earners and the self-employed) in respect of the reporting compliance pertaining to three different types of income (i. <b>e.</b> taxable income, <b>exempted</b> income and casual income). Arising from the findings of this research, several policy implications were identified. The findings demonstrated that in formulating strategies to enhance voluntary compliance, it is important for the relevant authorities to be aware of, understand and appreciate individual taxpayers’ compliance behaviour and the need to render tax education services...|$|R
