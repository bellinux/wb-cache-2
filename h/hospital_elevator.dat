[...] While the US government has begun the process of prosecuting contractors that stole American tax dollars, the Iraqi government currently has no means of reacquiring Iraqi assets that were stolen by US contractors. This is partially due to a decree passed by the CPA that gives civilian contractors in Iraq immunity from all Iraqi jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|Once the {{elevator}} {{arrives at the}} floor, it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of {{the elevator}}. Medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car, select their floor and close the doors with the door close button. The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor, and will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car. Some <b>hospital</b> <b>elevators</b> will feature a 'hold' position on the code-blue key switch (similar to fire service) which allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated.|$|R

5000|$|It {{has been}} alleged that {{large amounts of}} American tax dollars and seized Iraqi {{revenues}} were lost by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). One audit put the total number as high as $8.8 billion. Fraudulent contractors such as Philip Bloom often bribed CPA officials in exchange for contracts that were never performed.An article in the New York Times describes [...] "irregularities including millions of reconstruction dollars stuffed casually into footlockers and filing cabinets, an American soldier in the Philippines who gambled away cash belonging to Iraq, and three Iraqis who plunged to their deaths in a rebuilt <b>hospital</b> <b>elevator</b> that had been improperly certified as safe."

50|$|In 2008, Tracy filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit for}} her out-of-town again husband, Luke. The lawsuit was filed against her sister-in-law Monica, {{which resulted in}} a hospital brawl in the General <b>Hospital</b> <b>elevator.</b> Tracy told Monica not to operate on Luke because of her emotional strain against the deaths of Alan and Emily; however, she did anyway, and froze on the operating table. Since Tracy filed the medical malpractice suit, she has been kicked out of the family's mansion with frozen access to the family money. When Luke did return, she explained to him that she still loved him, but was not {{going to continue to be}} married to him. Luke told her that he was not going to give up on their marriage so easily. Later on, she and Luke left town because Luke was being investigated by his connections with the Zacchara family, which invested in his Haunted Star Casino. The mob family left him to take the fall with the I.R.S. because he stole money from them. Afraid of what he would be up to, she agreed to leave with him. Tracy returned without Luke because he was not spending the money and enjoying their time the way that she wanted him to. At this time, Monica was in rehab after being indicted in court for hit and run. Tracy visited Monica and learned that she was doing fine and was ready to return to work in a few weeks, which pleased Tracy. Tracy visited Monica in rehab and asked for advice about how to save Lulu's life. Monica told Tracy that if she could turn back the clock, she would do everything to save all of her children, especially Jason. With that, she told Tracy that if she wanted to save Lulu's life, then she had to do everything in her power to drive a wedge between Lulu and Johnny. After that, she visited Johnny in his holding cell where she told him about her brush with the mafia. She explained to him that she was once a mob boss and she heard about how his father Anthony Zacchara murdered his wife: Johnny's mother. She told him that if he really cared about Lulu, he would let her go. In October 2008, when Lulu was in her darkest hour, Tracy had one of her 'men' track down Luke. He turned up in Mexico, so Tracy headed there, but not before blackmailing Edward into getting the money laundering charges dropped. Once she was satisfied, she flew to Mexico and found Luke in a bar. They were both briefly put in jail, after a run-in with the local cops. n November, it was announced that Laura had awoken from her coma. There was a question of whether or not Luke would stay married to Tracy or go back to Laura, the love of his life. On November 20, Tracy filed for a divorce, but Luke tried to tell her he loved only her. With a new dawning beginning as Luke proclaimed his love for Tracy, being unconvinced and stubborn, Tracy shut Luke out lying to him and making him believed they were already divorced. However, the obvious love between the two lead to many ploys by Luke to win the new love of his life back. This happened on New Year's Eve when Luke planned a surprise party for Tracy. Tracy thought that it was a stupid gesture and a waste of her time and money. They played roulette, Tracy asked Luke what Laura's Birthday was. He replied December 21. Tracy then said that if the ball landed on 21 Luke will leave the country and give her a divorce but if it landed on 6 (Tracy's Birthday) she had to take him back. The ball landed on 6 and they bring in the new year with a passionate kiss.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the virtues}} of {{advertising}} can be debated, ad-creep often especially refers to advertising which is invasive and coercive, such as ads in schools, doctor's offices and <b>hospitals,</b> restrooms, <b>elevators,</b> on ATMs, on garbage cans, on vehicles, on restaurant menus, and countless other items. In Steve Johnson's piece referenced above, he criticizes product placement and [...] "creative advertising enhancements" [...] as [...] "one more manifestation of {{an environment in which}} the commercial assault is almost nonstop". Commercial Alert, a nonprofit organization founded by Public Citizen [...] "to keep the commercial culture within its proper sphere, and to prevent it from exploiting children and subverting the higher values of family, community, environmental integrity and democracy" [...] also characterizes [...] "ad creep" [...] as an assault, with ad companies fighting a [...] "relentless battle to claim every waking moment, and what one executive called, with chilling candor, mind share". A 2017 Daily Express story in the UK suggests [...] "the creeping incursion of adverts in Windows 10" [...] has been an issue.|$|R

5000|$|Ad creep says, [...] "There are ads in schools, airport lounges, doctors offices, movie theaters, <b>hospitals,</b> gas stations, <b>elevators,</b> {{convenience}} stores, on the Internet, on fruit, on ATMs, on {{garbage cans}} {{and countless other}} places. There are ads on beach sand and restroom walls." [...] "One of the ironies of advertising in our times is that as commercialism increases, it makes it that {{much more difficult for}} any particular advertiser to succeed, hence pushing the advertiser to even greater efforts." [...] Within a decade advertising in radios climbed to nearly 18 or 19 minutes per hour, on prime-time television the standard until 1982 was no more than 9.5 minutes of advertising per hour, today it is between 14 and 17 minutes. With the introduction of the shorter 15-second-spot the total amount of ads increased even more. Ads are not only placed in breaks but also into sports telecasts during the game itself. They flood the Internet, a growing market.|$|R
2500|$|Male and gay {{prostitution}} {{is increasing}} in Pakistan, though gay prostitution {{is not a}} recent phenomenon in the country. British explorer Richard Francis Burton, who visited the Sindh region long before the British conquest, documented a brothel of boy prostitutes in Karachi. Today many areas of large cities in the country have become virtual red-light districts for gay sex. Male prostitutes operate their business in every city and major town in Pakistan. Clients of male prostitutes come from every class, age group and profession. Homosexual men belonging to the upper and middle classes frequently pick up male prostitutes from video game shops, restaurants and cold-drinks spots. Young male prostitutes generally find customers in places like dark alleys, crowded bus stops, shopping centres, cinemas, hotel lobbies, parks, railway stations, <b>hospitals,</b> school compounds, <b>elevators</b> of public buildings etc. Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Sabzi Mandi, Lea Market, Landhi, Malir, and Lyari in Karachi are places visited by homosexuals from lower income groups. Clients in these areas primarily consist of bus drivers and conductors, night watchmen, labourers from upcountry, policemen, low-income government officials, small-time [...] businesspersons etc.|$|R
40|$|Although patient {{confidentiality}} {{has been}} a fundamental ethical principle since the Hippocratic Oath, it is under increasing threat. The main area of confidentiality is patient records. Physicians {{must be able to}} store and dispose of medical records securely. Patients should be asked whether some information should be kept out of the record or withheld if information is released. Patient identity should be kept secret during peer review of medical records. Provincial legislation outlines circumstances in which confidential information must be divulged. Because of the "team approach" to care, hospital records may be seen by many health care and administrative personnel. All hospital workers must respect confidentiality, especially when giving out information about patients by telephone or to the media. Research based on medical-record review also creates challenges for confidentiality. Electronic technology and communications are potential major sources of breaches of confidentiality. Computer records must be carefully protected from casual browsing or from unauthorized access. Fax machines and cordless and cellular telephones can allow unauthorized people to see or overhear confidential information. Confidentiality is also a concern in clinical settings, including physicians' offices and hospitals. Conversations among <b>hospital</b> personnel in <b>elevators</b> or public cafeterias can result in breaches of confidentiality. Patient confidentiality is a right that must be safeguarded by all health care personnel...|$|R
