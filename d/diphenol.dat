40|$|Catalytic {{etherification}} of phenolic {{oil with}} methanol was investigated {{to decrease the}} polarity and acidity of the product oil. The catalyst KH 2 PO 4 /activated alumina (AA) provided the best performance due to its excellent dehydration and anti-coking property. When catalyzed by KH 2 PO 4 -AA, the content of aryl ethers increased with rising temperature during the early stage but decreased at 500 degrees C. Alkoxy phenols had an inhibiting effect on etherification of alkyl phenols due to adsorption competition. Aryl ethers were mostly generated from alkyl phenols, while alkoxy phenols also contributed by simultaneous conversion to dialkoxybenzenes and <b>diphenols,</b> with a higher selectivity to <b>diphenols.</b> This explained the reduced alkoxy phenols and more generated alkyl phenols and aryl ethers at 350 degrees C. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cyclofenil <b>diphenol,</b> a weak non-steroidal oestrogen, binds to albumin. In the {{presence}} of concentrations of albumin just sufficient to keep cyclofenil <b>diphenol</b> in solution, the compound inhibited the synthesis of [35 S]proteoglycans, [3 H]glycoproteins, [3 H]hyaluronate and [3 H]proteins in primary cultures of chondrocytes from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma in a dose-dependent manner. When excess albumin was present, conditions were found (90 micrograms of cyclofenil <b>diphenol</b> and 4 mg of albumin per ml of culture medium) which completely inhibited [35 S]proteoglycan and [3 H]hyaluronate synthesis but {{had little effect on}} [3 H]protein or [3 H]glycoprotein synthesis. The time of onset of inhibition of [35 S]proteoglycan synthesis by cyclofenil <b>diphenol</b> was very rapid (t 1 / 2 less than 25 min) and incompatible with an action mediated through suppression of proteoglycan core protein synthesis. Cyclofenil <b>diphenol</b> inhibited the synthesis of [35 S]chondroitin sulphate chains onto p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xyloside in the cultures. Cyclofenil <b>diphenol</b> had little effect on the secretion from chondrocytes of [35 S]proteoglycans synthesized immediately prior to treatment. Chondrocyte cultures treated with cyclofenil <b>diphenol</b> recovered their biosynthetic activities almost completely within 3 h of removing the compound from the culture medium. Cyclofenil <b>diphenol</b> had a similar inhibitory action on the synthesis of [35 S]proteoglycans in secondary cultures of human dermal fibroblasts from both normal subjects and patients with systemic sclerosis. It is proposed that cyclofenil <b>diphenol</b> inhibits the synthesis of [35 S]proteoglycans by interfering with the formation of the glycosaminoglycan side chains of these molecules in the Golgi apparatus of cells.

The biocatalysis of the PPE {{with a wide range}} of mono- and <b>diphenols,</b> as substrates, was shown to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase (PPO) activity. Fraction FIIIa exhibited an inhibitory effect, measured spectrophotometrically, on PPO activity with the monophenols, including 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and m- and p-cresols and the <b>diphenols,</b> including chlorogenic acid, catechin, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DHPAA), L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), 4 -methylcatechol, catechol and caffeic acid; however, using the polarographic method, the inhibition of PPO activity by PPE biocatalysis occurred with the <b>diphenols</b> but not with the monophenols. The selected enzymatic fraction FIIIa was further purified, using size-exclusion chromatography, which resulted in three fractions FIVa, FIVb and FIVc. Although fraction FIVc contained the highest PPE activity, it showed a lack of enzyme stability. Fraction FIIIa was therefore, subjected to further purification by hydrophobic interaction chromatography thereby yielding fractions FVa, FVb, FVc, FVd, FVe, FVf and FVg, where fraction FVc showed the highest PPE activity. The denatured electrophoretic analysis of fraction FVc showed the presence of one major band, with a molecular weight of 60 kDa.

Schistosome egg {{production}} {{is dependent upon}} the activities of two developmentally regulated tyrosinases. The FASEB Journal, 21 (7), 823 - 835. Egg production is responsible for life cycle progression and host immunopathology during schistosomiasis, with the associated parasite molecules being investigated as potential novel chemotherapeutic targets. Here, we characterize two Schistosoma mansoni products, tyrosinase 1 and tyrosinase 2 (SmTYR 1 /SmTYR 2) and show that their <b>diphenol</b> oxidase enzyme activities are critical for eggshell formation and production. The genes encoding these bifunctional enzymes (monophenol and <b>diphenol</b> oxidases) result from a duplication event that likely occurred before speciation and exist in the parasite?s genome as multiple copies, which are linked and localized to chromosomes 4 and W. SmTYR 1 /SmTYR 2 transcription and <b>diphenol</b> oxidase action are developmentally regulated with most enzyme activity localized to the eggshell?producing cells contained within the vitellaria of adult female worms. Importantly, kojic-acid mediated inhibition (IC 50 = 0. 5 ?M) of SmTYR 1 /SmTYR 2 ?s <b>diphenol</b> oxidase activity during in vitro culture of sexually mature adult worms resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} the production of phenotypically normal eggs.
