5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>noise.</b> If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E
25|$|The A-weighting curve {{has been}} widely adopted for <b>environmental</b> <b>noise</b> measurement, and is {{standard}} in many sound level meters. The A-weighting system is used in any measurement of <b>environmental</b> <b>noise</b> (examples of which include roadway noise, rail noise, aircraft noise). A-weighting is also in common use for assessing potential hearing damage caused by loud noise.|$|E

30|$|However, {{chemical}} pesticides {{may have}} long-term residual effects which reduce {{the populations of}} pest for several weeks, months or years. On the other hand, population dynamics {{in the real world}} is inevitably affected by <b>environmental</b> <b>noises.</b> So {{it is very important to}} study stochastic population systems to analyze the effect of <b>environmental</b> <b>noises</b> on population systems [21 – 27].|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} {{numerical}} simulations and discussions, we {{can conclude that}} both heavy intensity of <b>environmental</b> <b>noises</b> and large impulsive perturbations to the ecological system {{will lead to the}} extinction of the species. And this shows that the departments of environment protection should control the <b>environmental</b> <b>noises</b> and impulsive disturbance reasonably to protect the ecological balance.|$|R
25|$|Roads are a chief {{source of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>noise</b> generation. In the early 1970s it was {{recognized}} that design of roads can {{be conducted to}} influence and minimize noise generation. Noise barriers are used to reduce noise pollution, in particular where roads are located close to built-up areas. Regulations can restrict the use of engine braking.|$|E
25|$|The {{accepted}} {{definition of}} chronic tinnitus, {{as compared to}} normal ear noise experience, is five minutes of ear noise occurring {{at least twice a}} week. However, people with chronic tinnitus often experience the noise more frequently than this and can experience it continuously or regularly, such as during the night when there is less <b>environmental</b> <b>noise</b> to mask the sound.|$|E

3000|$|Because of the {{existence}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>noises,</b> the parameters appearing in model (1.1) are emphatically not constants. In a simple case, <b>environmental</b> <b>noises</b> manifest themselves as white and color noises. We assume that white noise mainly affects the natural death rates, that is, μ→μ+σḂ(t), where σ represents the intensity of white noise, B(t) is a standard Brownian motion defined on a complete probability space (Ω, F, {F(t)}_t≥ 0, [...] P) with filtration {F(t)}_t≥ 0 satisfying the usual conditions (see [1]).|$|R

25|$|Synchronized {{neuronal}} currents induce weak magnetic fields. The brain's magnetic field, measuring at 10 femtotesla (fT) for cortical {{activity and}} 103 fT {{for the human}} alpha rhythm, is considerably smaller than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment, {{which is on the}} order of 108 fT or 0.1 µT. The essential problem of biomagnetism is, thus, the weakness of the signal relative to the sensitivity of the detectors, and to the competing <b>environmental</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E
25|$|The outer {{shells of}} in-ear {{headphones}} {{are made up}} of a variety of materials, such as plastic, aluminum, ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much <b>environmental</b> <b>noise.</b> Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} indicates belugas are highly {{sensitive to the}} noise pollution produced by humans. In one study, the maximum frequencies produced by an individual located in San Diego Bay, California, were between 40 and 60kHz. The same individual produced sounds with a maximum frequency of 100 to 120kHz on being transferred to Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii. The difference in frequencies {{is thought to be}} a response to the difference in <b>environmental</b> <b>noise</b> in the two areas.|$|E

25|$|The curves were {{originally}} defined for use at different average sound levels, but A-weighting, though originally intended {{only for the}} measurement of low-level sounds (around 40 phon), is now commonly used for the measurement of <b>environmental</b> <b>noise</b> and industrial noise, as well as when assessing potential hearing damage and other noise health effects at all sound levels; indeed, the use of A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for all these measurements, although it is badly suited for these purposes, being only applicable to low levels so that it tends to devalue the effects of low frequency noise in particular.|$|E
25|$|For short-distance applications, such as {{a network}} in an office {{building}} (see FTTO), fiber-optic cabling can save space in cable ducts. This is because a single fiber can carry much more data than electrical cables such as standard category 5 Ethernet cabling, which typically runs at 100 Mbit/s or 1 Gbit/s speeds. Fiber is also immune to electrical interference; there is no cross-talk between signals in different cables, and no pickup of <b>environmental</b> <b>noise.</b> Non-armored fiber cables do not conduct electricity, which makes fiber a good solution for protecting communications equipment in high voltage environments, such as power generation facilities, or metal communication structures prone to lightning strikes. They {{can also be used}} in environments where explosive fumes are present, without danger of ignition. Wiretapping (in this case, fiber tapping) is more difficult compared to electrical connections, and there are concentric dual-core fibers that are said to be tap-proof.|$|E
500|$|The {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} making audio recordings of a Toyota Prius and combustion engine Honda Accord approaching from two directions at [...] {{to assure that}} the hybrid car operated only with its electric motor. Then test subjects in a laboratory listened to the recordings and indicated when they could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could locate the hum of the internal combustion engine car at [...] away, but could not identify the hybrid running in electric mode until it came within , leaving just less than two seconds to react before the vehicle reached their position. In a second trial, the background sounds of two quietly idling combustion engine cars were added to the recordings to simulate the noise of a parking lot. Under this condition, the hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than the conventional car before the subjects could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about [...] feet away. This result means that under closer to normal <b>environmental</b> <b>noise,</b> a pedestrian {{would not be able to}} correctly determine the hybrid's approach until it was one second away.|$|E

40|$|Dynamical {{decoupling}} as {{a quantum}} control strategy aims at suppressing quantum decoherence adopting the popular philosophy that the disorder in the unitary {{evolution of the}} open quantum system caused by <b>environmental</b> <b>noises</b> should be neutralized by a sequence of ordered or well-designed external operations acting on the system. This work studies the solution of quantum-state-diffusion equations by mixing two channels of <b>environmental</b> <b>noises,</b> i. e., relaxation (dissipation) and dephasing. It is interesting to find in two-level and three-level atomic systems that a non-Markovian relaxation or dissipation process can be suppressed by a Markovian dephasing noise. The discovery results in an anomalous control strategy by coordinating relaxation and dephasing processes. Our approach opens an avenue of noise control strategy with no artificial manipulation over the open quantum systems. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

2500|$|A child's {{ability to}} learn to read, known as reading readiness, begins in infancy, as the child begins {{attending}} to the speech signals in their environment and begins producing spoken language. Children make some use of all the material that they are presented with, including every perception, concept and word that they come in contact with; thus {{the environment in which}} a child develops affects the child's {{ability to learn}} to read. The amount of time that a child spends together with parents or other important caregivers while listening to them read is a good predictor of the level of reading that the child will attain later in life. [...] As a child sits with a caregiver, looking at pictures and listening to stories, he or she will slowly learn that all the different lines on each page make different symbols and then that together these symbols refer to words. [...] Taking time to read to children is the most important precursor to a child's development of reading. Preschool-aged children with limited exposure to books and reading in their home, including limited experience of being read to, are at risk of reading difficulties. For example, these children tend to have less exposure to literary phrases, such as [...] "Once upon a time", and have smaller vocabularies, both factors that affect the ability to read by limiting comprehension of text. The environment in which a child lives may also impact their ability to acquire reading skills. Children who are regularly exposed to chronic <b>environmental</b> <b>noise</b> pollution, such as highway traffic noise, have been known to show decreased ability to discriminate between phonemes as well as lower reading scores on standardized tests.|$|E
