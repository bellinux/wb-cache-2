In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
5|$|Although Hitler had {{terminated}} his Austrian {{citizenship in}} 1925, {{he did not}} acquire German citizenship for almost seven years. This meant that he was stateless, legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation. On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, {{who was a member}} of the NSDAP, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state's <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick, and thus of Germany.|$|E

Madison defeated Monroe after offering a campaign pledge that he would introduce constitutional amendments comprising a Bill of Rights at the First Congress.|$|E
5|$|Bruce led the Australian <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa.

The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements would set the pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the European Common Market in 1973.|$|E

Oliphant agreed, and joined the Minister for External Affairs, H. V. Evatt and the Australian Representative at the United Nations, Paul Hasluck, to hear the Baruch Plan.

5|$|Long was {{promoted}} {{as a potential}} vice presidential candidate by the Massachusetts <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1900 Republican National Convention, and was a personal favorite of McKinley's for the position. However, party leaders objected to him on geographic grounds, and Lodge (with whom Long continued to feud) disingenuously wore a Long banner, even though he supported Roosevelt, who easily won the nomination. The McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won the election, and Long decided to stay on for McKinley's second term.|$|E
