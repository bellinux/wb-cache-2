5|$|Always a loner, {{he spent}} hours playing with toy trains, preferring {{to cross the}} street rather than speak to anyone. He {{attended}} Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous and shy to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before he passed out. The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> none of it.|$|E
5|$|Boggs is {{led to his}} {{execution}} and sees that Scully has not attended. Scully visits Mulder in hospital, where he is recovering from his gunshot wound. She has come to believe Mulder's assertion that Boggs arranged everything. Mulder asks her why she refused the chance to hear from her father again through Boggs. She tells him {{that she did not}} need to hear anything, because she already knew what her <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said.|$|E
5|$|Mark's father {{remarried}} {{and raised}} them strictly, seeking to influence {{them to become}} leaders. Throughout his childhood and teenage years, Mark's <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> him combine athletic and mental training. Mark would have to dribble a basketball without looking at it while reciting multiplication tables; practice baseball swings in a batting cage while answering questions about the periodic table and similar combined drills that his father hoped would develop quick thinking and self-confidence that would guide Mark {{in all areas of}} life and not simply sports.|$|E

Few <b>fathers</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> let me have my own way half so much. You must not {{prejudice}} Fanny against him. I must have them love one another." ...|$|R

5|$|During the {{pre-production}} {{stages of}} Entre a Mi Mundo, Selena and Pérez {{had fallen in}} love—despite their fellow band members warning them about Abraham. Selena and Pérez decided to date discretely to avoid a negative reaction from Abraham. After finding out about their relationship, Abraham fired Pérez from the group just weeks before the album was due to be released, and threatened to disband the group if Selena went after Pérez. Selena and Pérez decided to elope in Corpus Christi, Texas on April 2, 1992; a move that Selena chose believing that her <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> never approved of them. In the days following their marriage, Abraham approached Pérez after news of their elopement spread on local news and radio stations, apologized, accepted their relationship, and accepted Pérez back into the band as its guitarist.|$|E

25|$|In her {{contributions}} to Ken Burns's award-winning documentary television series Baseball (1994), Goodwin related stories {{about growing up}} as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. She noted that her <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> her document the baseball game from the radio and replay {{the events of the}} game once he returned home. She cited this as her first experience as a historian. She chronicles her family's love for the Dodgers until the team's move to Los Angeles in 1957. When she met her husband in the late 1960s, she became a Boston Red Sox fan, even though her father became a New York Mets fan; one of her sisters later became a Colorado Rockies fan, and her other sister stayed a Dodgers fan.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{would be}} a great relief to his mind. Few <b>fathers</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left you such {{complete}} liberty of action, consented to your engagement, and then acted so kindly and cautiously in not forcing on you this, for which he had begun to wish ardently. You have grieved him extremely, and you owe it to him to show that this has not all been caprice.' ...|$|R

25|$|In Christian art, {{the hand}} of God has {{traditionally}} been understood as an artistic metaphor that {{is not intended to}} indicate that the deity was physically present or seen in any subject depicted. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the representation of the full-bodied figure of God the <b>Father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been considered a grave violation of the Second Commandment. According to conventional art historical interpretation, the representation of {{the hand of}} God in early Christian art thus developed as a necessary and symbolic compromise to the highly anti-anthropomorphic tenor of the Second Commandment, though anthropomorphic interpretations are certainly plausible. In early Christian and Byzantine art, the hand of God is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a blessing gesture, but sometimes performing an action. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice. In later Christian works it tends {{to be replaced by a}} fully realized figure of God the Father, whose depiction had become acceptable in Western Christianity, although not in Eastern Orthodox or Jewish art.|$|E
500|$|Likewise, medical {{historian}} W. T. W. Potts {{considers it}} {{a possibility that}} the Duchess took a lover under pressure from her brother Leopold. He cites the rarity of genetic mutations as evidence, {{as well as the}} [...] "remarkable" [...] circumstances surrounding Victoria's conception. Potts makes no mention of Conroy specifically, only that the <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a haemophiliac himself or would have had a mutated gene.|$|E
500|$|In 2010 {{the memoir}} was {{published}} in book form by Macmillan, as , edited by Duncan Barrett. [...] Barrett wrote in an introduction that he felt that Skirth's story [...] "deserved as wide an audience as possible—and to be read in its protagonist's own words". [...] Skirth's daughter Jean, who had given permission for the memoir to be published remained uncertain whether publishing the memoir was what her <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted, but {{believed that it was}} important that his story should be widely known.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not. Only the Duke {{happens to be}} Prime Minister, and his house is {{considered}} to have the very best society that England, or indeed Europe, can give. And I think it is something in a young man's favour when {{it is known that}} he associates with such persons as the Duke of Omnium. I believe that most <b>fathers</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a regard to the company which a man keeps when they think of their daughter's marrying." ...|$|R
500|$|Franklin Peale was one {{of sixteen}} {{children}} his <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> by his three wives. Elizabeth Peale died when Franklin was eight years old, but his father soon remarried, and the child was thereafter cared for by his stepmother. [...] He was given little classroom education, though he did spend some time at a local school in nearby Bucks County, {{as well as at}} Germantown Academy and the University of Pennsylvania. [...] For the most part, his education was informal, as was usual in the Peale family, with the student given the means to study what interested him, or what he appeared to be good at. [...] In Franklin Peale's case, he made toys as a boy, and surveyed his father's farm near Germantown. Although he lacked the artistic talent of some of his brothers, such as Titian Peale, he proved mechanically inclined.|$|E
500|$|Into Temptation {{marks the}} second film by {{independent}} filmmaker Patrick Coyle, who {{wrote and directed}} the 2003 drama film Detective Fiction. Coyle said Into Temptation was partially inspired by his father, James Patrick Coyle, a kind but belligerent {{man who had been}} encouraged by his mother to become a priest. James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in World War II and met Margaret Mary Quinlan, who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle's mother. Coyle conceived of the script for Into Temptation while imagining what kind of priest his <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been. His father strongly approved of the project, and told Coyle, [...] "Go make that movie. And tell the truth." [...] Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend, the Reverend Damian Zuerlein, who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children. Coyle said of him, [...] "He's just a young, energetic, competent, committed, devoted man working with a poor parish. And he loves his work. I was inspired by that." [...] Coyle said when writing Into Temptation, he did not intend to make a religious film, and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein, [...] "The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender. He's a good man trying to do a job the best he can." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the show}} {{is based on the}} uncensored novel {{released}} in 2011, rather than the 1953 film adaptation, it contains references to prostitution and gay sex, as well as the Army's investigation into them, that the film did not feature. The right to create the musical adaptation came with the condition {{that it had to be}} based on the original book. James Jones's daughter Kaylie and son Jamie were in the audience for the show's opening night in London. During its preview period some people walked out of the performance, having been unprepared for the nudity and swearing in the production. Darius Campbell who played First Sergeant Milt Warden, said that the [...] "James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film – and wanted to see more – have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." [...] Kaylie admitted they had doubts about the idea of the show when it first came up, but added that [...] "I'm thrilled—it's so sophisticated and moving." [...] She also noted that she [...] "was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes, because my dad said this is just the way it was back then" [...] and that [...] "my <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been amazed".|$|E

50|$|A More Perfect Constitution {{is a book}} {{published}} by American {{political scientist at the}} University of Virginia, Larry J. Sabato, in which he proposes a constitutional convention to substantially overhaul the United States Constitution. He points out that after the Bill of Rights, there have only been seventeen constitutional amendments over the past 220 years. He argues that a constitutional convention is overdue and is something that the Founding <b>Fathers</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted. He offers 23 proposals for revising the Constitution.|$|R
2500|$|Stephen Peck, son of actor Gregory Peck, also {{expressed}} concern. Responding {{to the question}} of how he thought his <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> reacted to the book, he said that he [...] "would have appreciated the discussion the book has prompted, but would have been troubled by the decision to publish it." [...] Peck noted that his father considered Lee a dear friend. She gave him the pocket watch that had belonged to her father, on whom she modeled Atticus and that Gregory wore it the night he won an Oscar for the role. Stephen, who is president and chief executive of the United States Veterans Initiative, went on to say [...] "I think he would have felt very protective of her," [...] and that his <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> counseled Lee not to publish Watchman because it could taint Mockingbird, one of the most beloved novels (in) American history.|$|E
2500|$|Believing {{the faint}} voice {{to be that}} of her father, Bell's {{daughter}} Mrs. Gilbert Grosvenor remarked: [...] "That is just the sort of thing <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said. He was always quoting from the classics." [...] The voice was later identified by Tainter as in fact that of her paternal grandfather, Alexander Melville Bell. The historic recording, not heard since 1937, was played again in 2013 and made available online.|$|E
2500|$|Lugosi {{was buried}} {{wearing one of}} the [...] "Dracula" [...] cape costumes, per the request of his son and fifth wife, in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never {{requested}} {{to be buried in}} his cloak; Bela G. Lugosi confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, actually made the decision but believed that it is what his <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the more}} publicized cases of this type was the 1994 Chester and Patti Szuber transplant. [...] This {{was the first time}} that a parent had {{received}} a heart donated by one of their own children. [...] Although the decision to accept the heart from his recently killed child was not an easy decision, the Szuber family agreed that giving Patti's heart to her <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been something that she would have wanted.|$|E
2500|$|... “He {{believed}} in taking chances and seeking new opportunities. In 1971, {{he was offered}} and accepted a position as Assistant Dean and Associate Professor of Surgery in the College of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina. He was quoted as saying: ‘My <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been extremely pleased to know that his son {{had been invited to}} join the staff and faculty of an institution he could not have hoped to enter in any capacity.’ He was speaking to the racial segregation in the State of South Carolina.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Bartle idolized his clergyman {{father and}} {{displayed}} some guilt {{for not having}} followed in his profession. [...] Bartle continued to make major decisions only after deciding what his <b>father</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done in a similar circumstance. [...] But Roe Bartle hated the penury of the clergyman's life. [...] The first time he asked a girl for a date, she rejected {{him because he was}} dressed in ill-fitting, second-hand clothes. [...] Crushed, he swore before a mirror, [...] "hand upraised", that no child of his would ever know poverty. But once he had the money, he also acquired expensive hand-tailored suits.|$|E
