50|$|The helix in {{the antenna}} can twist in two {{possible}} directions: right-handed or left-handed, {{as defined by}} the right-hand rule. In an axial-mode <b>helical</b> <b>antenna</b> the direction of twist of the helix determines the polarisation of the radio waves. Two mutually incompatible conventions are in use for describing waves with circular polarisation, so the relationship between the handedness (left or right) of a <b>helical</b> <b>antenna,</b> and the type of circularly-polarised radiation it emits cannot be stated without ambiguity. Helical antennas can receive signals with any type of linear polarisation, such as horizontal or vertical polarisation, but when receiving circularly polarised signals the handedness of the receiving antenna must be the same as the transmitting antenna; left-hand polarised antennas suffer a severe loss of gain when receiving right-circularly-polarised signals, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|In the axial mode or end-fire <b>helical</b> <b>antenna,</b> the {{diameter}} and {{pitch of the}} helix are comparable to a wavelength. The antenna functions as a directional antenna radiating a beam off {{the ends of the}} helix, along the antenna's axis. It radiates circularly polarised radio waves. These are used for satellite communication.|$|E

50|$|A <b>helical</b> <b>antenna</b> is {{an antenna}} {{consisting}} of a conducting wire wound {{in the form of}} a helix. In most cases, helical antennas are mounted over a ground plane. The feed line is connected between the bottom of the helix and the ground plane. Helical antennas can operate in one of two principal modes — normal mode or axial mode.|$|E
5000|$|The {{low cost}} of CubeSats has enabled {{unprecedented}} access to space for smaller institutions and organizations but, for most CubeSat forms, {{the range and}} available power is limited to about 2W for its communications antennae. [...] They can use radio-communication systems in the VHF, UHF, L-, S-, C- and X-band. For UHF/VHF transmissions, a single <b>helical</b> <b>antenna</b> or four monopole antennae are deployed by a spring-loaded mechanism.|$|E
50|$|One {{application}} that has used heatshrink {{in large quantities}} since the early 1970s is the covering of fibreglass <b>helical</b> <b>antennas,</b> used extensively for 27 MHz CB Radio. Many millions of these antennas have been coated this way.|$|R

50|$|John Daniel Kraus (June 28, 1910 - July 18, 2004) was an American {{physicist}} {{known for}} his contributions to electromagnetics, radio astronomy, and antenna theory. His inventions included the <b>helical</b> <b>antenna,</b> the corner reflector, and several other types of antennas. He designed the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University, which was constructed mostly {{by a team of}} OSU students and was used to carry out the Ohio Sky Survey. Kraus held a number of patents and published widely.|$|E
50|$|In {{the normal}} mode or {{broadside}} <b>helical</b> <b>antenna,</b> the diameter and {{the pitch of}} the aerial are small compared with the wavelength. The antenna acts similarly to an electrically short dipole or monopole, and the radiation pattern, similar to these antennas is omnidirectional, with maximum radiation {{at right angles to}} the helix axis. The radiation is linearly polarised parallel to the helix axis. These are used for compact antennas for portable and mobile two-way radios, and for UHF television broadcasting antennas.|$|E
50|$|The gain of the <b>helical</b> <b>antenna</b> {{strongly}} {{depends on}} the reflector. The above classical formulas assume that the reflector has {{the form of a}} circular resonator (a circular plate with a rim) and the pitch angle is optimal for this type of reflector. Nevertheless, these formulas overestimate the gain for several dB. The optimal pitch that maximizes the gain for a flat ground plane is in the range from 3° to 10° and it {{depends on the}} wire radius and antenna length.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} ways to make a high-gain antenna; the most common are {{parabolic}} <b>antennas,</b> <b>helical</b> <b>antennas,</b> yagi antennas, and phased arrays of smaller antennas of any kind. Horn antennas can also be constructed with high gain, but are less commonly seen. Still other configurations are possible - the Arecibo Observatory uses a combination of a line feed with an enormous spherical reflector (as opposed to a more usual parabolic reflector), to achieve extremely high gains at specific frequencies.|$|R

50|$|Planar array - a flat {{two-dimensional}} array of antennas. Since {{an array of}} omnidirectional antennas radiates two beams 180° apart broadside {{from both sides of}} the antenna, it often is either mounted in front of a reflector, or is composed of directive antennas such as Yagi or <b>helical</b> <b>antennas,</b> to give a unidirectional beam.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the above}} antennas, {{traveling}} wave antennas are nonresonant {{so they have}} inherently broad bandwidth. [...] They are typically wire antennas multiple wavelengths long, through which the voltage and current waves travel in one direction, instead of bouncing {{back and forth to}} form standing waves as in resonant antennas. They have linear polarization (except for the <b>helical</b> <b>antenna).</b> Unidirectional traveling wave antennas are terminated by a resistor at one end equal to the antenna's characteristic resistance, to absorb the waves from one direction. This makes them inefficient as transmitting antennas.|$|E
50|$|The short {{wavelengths}} also allow high gain antennas to be conveniently small. High gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and UHF television reception are usually Yagi, log periodic, corner reflectors, or reflective array antennas. At {{the top end}} of the band slot antennas and parabolic dishes become practical. For satellite communication, helical, and turnstile antennas are used since satellites typically employ circular polarization which is not sensitive to the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas. For television broadcasting specialized vertical radiators that are mostly modifications of the slot antenna or <b>helical</b> <b>antenna</b> are used: the slotted cylinder, zig-zag, and panel antennas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Telstar had {{a single}} innovative transponder that could relay data, a single television channel, or multiplexed telephone circuits. Since the spacecraft spun, it required an array of antennas around its [...] "equator" [...] for uninterrupted microwave communication with Earth. An omnidirectional array of small cavity antenna elements around the satellite's [...] "equator" [...] received 6 GHz microwave signals to relay back to ground stations. The transponder converted the frequency to 4 GHz, amplified the signals in a traveling-wave tube, and retransmitted them omnidirectionally via the adjacent array of larger box-shaped cavities.
