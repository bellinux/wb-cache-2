40|$|Traditional {{locomotion}} studies emphasize an optimization of {{the desired}} movement trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. We propose an information based theory that locomotion is neither triggered nor commanded but controlled. The basis for this control is the information derived from perceiving oneself in the world. Control therefore lies in the human-environment system. In order to test this hypothesis, we derived a mathematical foundation characterizing the energy that is required to perform a rotational twist, with small amplitude, of the instantaneous axes of the knee (IAK). We {{have found that the}} joint’s perception of the ground reaction force may be replaced by the co-perception of muscle activation with appropriate intensities. This approach generated an accurate comparison with known joint forces and appears appropriate in so far as predicting the effect on the knee when it is free to twist about the IAK. <b>Keywords</b> Bellman’s <b>principle</b> of optimality; Ball-Disteli diagram; Perception-action coupling manifold; Gibson’s theory of affordance; Ball’s screw theory; minimum information principle; Muscle synergie...|$|R

Maximum rate of time evolution. Schrodinger equation. Quantum mechanics. 1 Introduction and motivation My motivation to write this paper came from reading [20]. In this and other papers, Landauer argues that the energy time uncertainty principle does not force energy dissipation to occur during communication. Although Landauer's papers are interesting and important, and may be correct, they suffer from the major problem that Landauer nowhere defines exactly what he thinks the energy-time uncertainty principle is, nor does he provide a simple precise mathematical definition of "communication. " It seems quite plausible to me that with varying, but still reasonable, definitions of these notions, one could reach varying conclusions on this fundamental question.

40|$|In [12], new local minimax theorems which {{characterize}} {{a saddle}} point {{as a solution}} toatwo-levellocal minimax problem are established. Based on the local characterization, a numerical minimax method is designed for finding multiple saddle points. Many numerical examples in semilinear elliptic PDE have been successfully carried out to solve for multiple solutions. One of the important issues remains unsolved, i. e., the convergence of the numerical minimax method. In this paper, we first modify Step 5 in the algorithm such that it becomes practically easier to implement. Then we establish some convergence results for the numerical minimax method for isolated or non-isolated critical points.

This paper {{is about an}} analysis of implied meaning or hidden meaning in conversation, specifically in the novel. The main focus of the analysis is the utterance of the main character of the novel. In conducting this study, the theory of co-operative principles and maxims proposed by Paul Grice (1975) was {{used to analyze the}} conversations. The writer used qualitative method to analyze the co-operative principles and implicature within the novel by conducting several procedures of data collection. First, the writer read the novel as the research text; the goal of this step is to understand the context and to collect data needed for this study. Second step is to analyze the data using the proposed theory and describe the implicature within the data.

Since I had finally completed (almost) all of my courses after seven and a half years of hard labor, I could start the search for an interesting topic. For me the search started with external IT companies offering spots in the direction of my master specialization, Information System Engineering. The DB group of the university had a database which was holding several assignments, amongst which Gladior had entered an open invitation to discuss a number of topics. Once I contacted them it appeared that Indenty, a sister company of Gladior was actually running the R&D department that had very interesting topics, amongst which keyword suggestion. After two meetings with Tom Visser and Daniël Bos, the choice was made and I started working at their office the very next week. After working for about six months at the office I started writing the thesis at home (just after finishing my final course) and eight weeks later it was done as it is lying in front of the reader, enjoy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{theoretical}} framework, based on contemporary philosophical aesthetics, from which principled assessments of the aesthetic value of information organization frameworks may be conducted. Design/methodology/approach – This paper identifies appropriate discourses within the field of philosophical aesthetics, constructs from them a framework for assessing aesthetic properties of information organization frameworks. This framework is then applied in two case studies examining the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), and Sexual Nomenclature: A Thesaurus. Findings – In both information organization frameworks studied, the aesthetic analysis was useful in identifying judgments of the frameworks as aesthetic judgments, in promoting discovery of further areas of aesthetic judgments, and in prompting reflection on the nature of these aesthetic judgments. Research limitations/implications – This study provides proof-of-concept for the aesthetic evaluation of information organization frameworks. Areas of future research are identified as the role of cultural relativism in such aesthetic evaluation and identification of appropriate aesthetic properties of information organization frameworks. Practical implications – By identifying a subset of judgments of information organization frameworks as aesthetic judgments, aesthetic evaluation of such frameworks can be made explicit and principled. Aesthetic judgments can be separated from questions of economic feasibility, functional requirements, and user-orientation. Design and maintenance of information organization frameworks can be based on these principles. Originality/value – This study introduces a new evaluative axis for information organization frameworks based on philosophical aesthetics. By improving the evaluation of such novel frameworks, design and maintenance can be guided by these <b>principles.</b> <b>Keywords</b> Evaluation, Analysis, Bibliographic systems, Indexes, Retrieval languages, Philosoph...|$|R

This {{research}} was conducted because humor can be analyzed in terms of language. Humor appear at sudden time because spontaneous communication even less accordance with purpose to entertain. This communication affected the shape of violation or compliance at cooperation principle. Issues that want to answered in this thesis are, (1) How are the technique used by the character to bring humor? (2) How are the forms of violations and compliance to the maxim of cooperation principle? (3) How are the response from hearer when humor appeared?The goal of this {{research was}} to determine the techniques of humor and violation or compliance of cooperation principle that contained then describe the response. The research data obtained from comic Kureyon Shinchan Volume 3. The analyzed data was 20 Japanese conversational that contains elements of humor that can entertain.

Web 2. 0 is defined as the innovative use of the World Wide Web to expand social and business growth and to explore collective intelligence from the community. The features of Web 2. 0 include user behavior and software design perspectives. A high level technical architecture is included in Web 2. 0 features. Google Web Search is a web search engine owned by Google Inc. and is the most-used search engine on the Web. Google receives several hundred million queries each day through its various services. The main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in WebPages. Also the functionality of Google search engine in retrieving the information is based on the 3 <b>principles.</b> <b>Keyword</b> Search, where the search engine examines its index and provides a listing of best-matching web pages according to its criteria, usually with a short summary containing the document's title and sometimes parts of the text. The index is built from the information stored with the data and the method by which the information is indexed. Page Rank is a link analysis algorithm, used by the Google Internet search engine that assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents. In simple words this means that your results will be ordered by the relative importance of your search terms in the document. Google also uses Indexing. It has an index of all pages it's crawled based on the terms in each page. Inverted index technique is now replaced and stores the information as stems. Another principle is finally, we point out the limitations of the current technologies in order to analyze the new technology development in the Web 3. 0 model.
