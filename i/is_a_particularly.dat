5|$|Efforts {{to control}} the spread of malaria {{suffered}} a major setback in 1930: entomologist Raymond Corbett Shannon discovered imported disease-bearing Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes living in Brazil (DNA analysis later revealed the actual species to be A. arabiensis). This species of mosquito <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> efficient vector for malaria and is native to Africa. In 1938, the introduction of this vector caused the greatest epidemic of malaria ever seen in the New World. However, complete eradication of A. gambiae from northeast Brazil and thus from the New World was achieved in 1940 by the systematic application of the arsenic-containing compound Paris green to breeding places, and of pyrethrum spray-killing to adult resting places.|$|E
5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability induced by {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the key}} methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum field theory called a conformal field theory. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E

Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} is {{a general}} process involving the motion of adatoms, molecules, and atomic clusters (adparticles) at solid material surfaces. The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface, as in figure 1. Just as in bulk diffusion, this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature. Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the conventional model of nearest-neighbor jumps. Tunneling diffusion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen {{has been shown to}} diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect.|$|E

The final patina <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering. It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished' to embark a particular look, feel, and/or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters {{consume a}} wide range of insects; beyond a few distasteful {{butterflies}} they consume almost any insect from tiny Drosophila flies to large beetles and dragonflies. At some point bee-eaters have been recorded eating beetles, mayflies, stoneflies, cicadas, termites, crickets and grasshoppers, mantises, true flies and moths. For many species the dominant prey item are stinging members of the order Hymenoptera, namely wasps and bees. In a survey of 20 studies the proportion of the diet made up by bees and wasps varied from 20% to 96%, with the average being 70%. Of these honeybees can comprise {{a large part of the}} diet, as much as 89% of the overall intake. The preference for bees and wasps may have arisen because of the numerical abundance of these suitably sized insects. The giant honeybee <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> commonly eaten species. These bees attempt to congregate in a mass defence against the bee-eaters. In Israel, a European bee-eater was documented attempting to eat a small bat that it had caught, which probably couldn't fit down its throat.|$|E

The brick drugstore annex at 155-157 River Street <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> representative commercial example of the style. In 1893 the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago popularized the Classical and Renaissance revivals and Beaux-Arts style. They came to Troy very quickly when Marcus Cummings and his son Frederick designed the Classical Revival county courthouse at 80 Second Street, the third to occupy the site, the following year. A short distance away three years later, the Renaissance Revival Hart Memorial Library was built of Vermont marble, joining the similarly styled 1895 Frear Mansion, also on Second Street.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus {{is fairly}} common, {{and can be}} found growing in moist areas under trees in autumn, often among Sphagnum moss. Though it {{strongly}} favours beech, it has also been found under oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship with the trees under which it grows. It can also be found growing on rotting wood or other hard surfaces; specimens have been observed on both conifer and hardwood logs. These are typically smaller specimens, and it is possible that they represent a dwarf variety. Despite growing on rotting wood, the species is not saprotrophic; instead, the mycelia of the species are linking with tree roots growing through or near the wood. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> useful adaptation when the soil is either wet or nutrient-poor. Mushrooms can sometimes grow in large numbers, but they can also be found growing in tight clumps, or solitarily when growing out of season. The species can be found in Europe, with collections in Scandinavia, the British Isles Bulgaria, Germany, and northern Turkey; in North America, it has been recorded as common in Canada and both the northern and southern United States; in northern Asia, it was found in regions near both the Oka River and the central Angara River in Siberia; and in eastern Asia, it has been collected in China.|$|E
5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E

5|$|The motte-and-bailey castle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> {{northern}} European phenomenon, most numerous in Normandy and Britain, {{but also}} seen in Denmark, Germany, Southern Italy and occasionally beyond. European castles first {{emerged in the}} 9th and 10th centuries, {{after the fall of}} the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes and local territories became threatened by the Magyars and the Norse. Against this background, various explanations have been put forward to explain the origins and spread of the motte-and-bailey design across northern Europe; there is often a tension among the academic community between explanations that stress military and social reasons for the rise of this design. One suggestion is that these castles were built particularly in order to protect against external attack‚Äì the Angevins, it is argued, began to build them to protect against the Viking raids, and the design spread to deal with the attacks along the Slav and Hungarian frontiers. Another argument is that, given the links between this style of castle and the Normans, who were of Viking descent, it was in fact originally a Viking design, transported to Normandy and Angers. The motte-and-bailey castle was certainly effective against assault, although as historian Andr√© Debord suggests, the historical and archaeological record of the military operation of motte-and-bailey castles remains relatively limited.|$|E
5|$|Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations {{occurred}} due {{to contact}} with golden eagles, lead poisoning, {{and other factors}} such as power line collisions. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors {{have been trained to}} avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased. Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices; lead waste is not as much of a problem for other avian scavengers such as the turkey vulture and common raven. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use non-lead bullets when hunting in the condor's range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California condor. There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the other states in which the condor currently resides.|$|E
5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and {{hold on to the}} weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E
