The technological changes, associated with the evolutions of use, lead the companies indeed to renew their ranges more and more early.

However, the remanufacturing can be economically and environmentally beneficial only if the product and its life cycle are designed by taking account of the value, the nature and lifespan of the modules to be re-used, and the lifespan of the product.

Ten subjects propelled two different wheelchairs (adjustable and conventional chairs) while the motions of the left arm and trunk were measured using a video tracking system. Eulerian angles described the sequence-dependent rotations of the humerus relative to the trunk. Wheel angular velocity and acceleration, hand position on the handrim, and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>cycle</b> subphases were also measured. Selected temporal and kinematic parameters were derived from the time-normalized average cycle of each subject on each wheelchair. Within-subject variation of these parameters according to wheelchair type were compared using a two-tailed t-test for paired observations. The adjustable chair made available a larger propulsion arc compared with the conventional chair. Only the minimum amount of elevation demonstrated {{a significant difference between}} chairs (the conventional chair had a smaller mini-mum than the adjustable chair) at the corrected significance level of p< 0. 001. Other differences, though not statistically significant, were still informative. Less shoulder internal rotation but more overall shoulder motion was observed during recovery phase in the adjustable chair as compared with the conventional chair. The methods presented for measuring the 3 -D kinematics of the shoulder complex during wheelchair propulsion proved feasible for future use in studies that will address shoulder kinetics, energy require-ments, wheelchair design, and chronic use disorders.

Such THCs {{as a rule}} include unloading facilities and freight railway station. The {{central part of the}} THC is a technological line that carries out operations of reception and unloading of unit trains with raw materials. The technological line consists of transport and freight modules. The latter plays a leading role and, in its turn, consists of rotary car dumpers and conveyor belts. This module represents a determinate system that carries out preparation and unloading operations. Its processing capacity is set in accordance with manufacturing capacity of the sinter plant. The research has shown that in existing operating conditions, which is characterized by “arrhythmia” of interaction between external transport operation and production, technological line of THC functions inefficiently. Thus, it secures just 18 - 20 % of instances of processing of inbound unit trains within set standard time. It was determined that duration of the cycle of processing of inbound unit train can play a role of regulator, under stochastic characteristics of intervals between inbound unit trains with raw materials on the one hand, and determined unloading system on the other hand. That is why evaluation of interdependence between these factors allows determination of <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>cycle</b> of processing of inbound unit trains.

Quatro densidades (1333; 1666; 2222 e 3333 plantas/ha) e dois sistemas de espaçamento (retângulo e losango) foram avaliados durante as quatro primeiras produções. O sistema de espaçamento teve pouco efeito sobre a duração do ciclo e do período de colheita, enquanto que, a partir da segunda safra, estes períodos foram maiores à medida que a densidade aumentou. Na densidade 3333 plantas/ha, a soma dos quatro ciclos atingiu 55, 1 meses, enquanto que nas demais densidades este período foi reduzido para 50, 1 meses (2222 plantas/ha), 47, 7 meses (1666 plantas/ha) e 45, 9 meses (1333 plantas/ha). A colheita do primeiro ciclo foi realizada em quatro meses para todas as densidades.
