40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the efficiency of <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps</b> in the tertiary treatment of sewage to control pathogens. The performance of the photochemical reactor used in the tests was monitored by microbiological analyses to quantify E. coli (bacteria indicator), C. perfringens (protozoa indicator), coliphages (virus indicator). The experiments were performed with effluent from an UASB reactor installed at the WTP- USP São Carlos campus subjected to an aerated submerged biological filter and a photochemical reactor with radiation UV at 254 nm. The results showed that the indicators coliphages and E. coli showed the least resistance to UV radiation reaching removal from 1. 70 to 3. 90 log and 1. 60 to 5. 20 log, respectively. On the other hand, the indicator C. perfringens was more resistant to the effect of <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps</b> reaching values between 0. 0 (no inactivation) and 1. 30 log. For SST concentrations greater than 100. 0 mg. L- 1, the effect of the <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps</b> became less pronounced. However, in practice it was possible to notice significant results in tests with TSS concentrations of 135. 0 mg. L- 1. The experimental approach proved the usefulness of the combined method for inactivating pathogens commonly found in domestic sewage. Besides meeting the standards established by the Brazilian regulation, the final effluent is in agreement with the guidelines defined by WHO. This allows the reuse of the final effluent for unrestricted irrigation, although complementary examination must be performed...|$|R

50|$|High-pressure bulbs are 3 to 5 {{inches long}} and {{typically}} powered by a ballast with 250 to 2,000 watts. The most common is the 400 watt variety that is used as an added face tanner in the traditional tanning bed. High-pressure lamps use quartz glass, and as such do not filter UVC. Because UVC can be deadly, a special dichroic filter glass (usually purple) is required that will filter out the UVC and UVB. The goal with high-pressure tanning bulbs is to produce a high amount of UVA only. Unfiltered light from a high-pressure lamp is rich in UVC used in <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps,</b> for water purification, but it damages human skin.|$|R

30|$|A simple glass UV {{irradiation}} chamber was designed with four UV-C, 15 -W <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps</b> (Philips, Amsterdam, Holland). Two lamps on the dorsal side and {{two on the}} ventral side were fixed {{at a distance of}} 27 [*]cm from the center, fine threads passed across the center where the egg trays were placed for irradiation. The threads were connected to a vortex mixture in order to create vibration for the egg rotation. The lamps were switched on for half an hour before the experiment to stabilize the energy of the UV rays (Onozato and Yamaha [1983]). Egg tray surface was measured with a UV meter (Ultra-Violet Products, Inc., San Gabriel, CA, USA) for dosage calculations.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} form of <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamp</b> looks similar to an {{ordinary}} fluorescent lamp but the tube contains no fluorescent phosphor. In addition, rather than being made of ordinary borosilicate glass, the tube is made of fused quartz. These two changes combine to allow the 253.7 nm ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc to pass out of the lamp unmodified (whereas, in common fluorescent lamps, it causes the phosphor to fluoresce, producing visible light). Germicidal lamps still produce a small amount of visible light due to other mercury radiation bands.|$|E
5000|$|Laminar flow {{cabinets}} {{may have}} a UV-C <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamp</b> to sterilize the interior and contents before usage to prevent contamination of experiment. Germicidal lamps are usually kept on for 15 minutes to sterilize the interior and no contact is to be made with a laminar flow hood during this time. During this time, scientists normally prepare other materials to maximize efficiency. (It is important to switch this light off during use, to limit exposure to skin and eyes as stray ultraviolet light emissions can cause cancer and cataracts.) ...|$|E
50|$|Short-wave UV {{light is}} harmful to humans.

For this reason, the light produced by a <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamp</b> must be carefully shielded against both direct viewing and reflections and dispersed light that might be viewed.

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the effectiveness {{and limitations of}} ultraviolet (UV) <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps</b> in biosafety cabinets and pass-boxes, with particular reference to anthrax spores. Methods and Results: An estimated 50 colony forming units (CFUs) of spores of the Sterne strain of Bacillus anthracis were distributed on blood agar plates and on smooth and rough plastic surfaces, glass slides, galvanized metal strips, squares of writing paper, nitrocellulose/cellulose acetate strips, and membrane filters. After drying these were exposed in triplicate to the UV sources of a Class 2 biosafety cabinet and a biosafety level (BSL) 3 pass-box for various time periods. Viable B. anthracis could not be recovered from hard surfaces at 15 minutes (the shortest time period tested) when fully exposed to UV at intensities of � 3. 8 W/m 2 (the lowest intensity tested) in a Class 2 biosafety cabinet and a BSL 3 pass-box. However, the penetrating ability of the UV {{was found to be}} extremely limited with even the microstructural elements of nitrocellulose or similar membranes able to substantially shield the spores. The UV failed totally to penetrate thin (66 µm) paper or Petri dish plastic, although it did penetrate plastic sandwich wrap. Conclusions: The UV from <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps</b> in biosafety cabinets and pass-boxes is rapidly sporicidal for fully exposed anthrax spores on hard surfaces but is readily nullified by the slightest obstacle to direct exposure. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results fill a major information gap for those devising or following protocols for decontamination of items and materials in biosafety cabinets and pass-boxes. Such protocols need to be written around a full comprehension of the data presented here. Keywords UV; sterilization; anthrax spore; biosafety cabinet; pass-bo...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{ultraviolet}} radiation emitted, rather than the thermal/pressure shocks or the chemical species that are generated in these events, is the lethal agent that inactivates Escherichia coli colonies exposed to electrohydraulic discharges, EHD. Disinfection is completely suppressed {{in the presence of}} < 100 mg L^(- 1) of 2, 2 ‘-dihydroxy- 4, 4 ‘-dimethoxybenzophenone- 5, 5 ‘-disulfonic acid, BP 9, a commercial water-soluble sunscreen. Viable bacteria decay by logit kinetics with the number of EHD. The fact that the slopes of the logit plots depend inversely on BP 9 concentration, and vanish above ∼ 30 mg BP 9 L^(- 1), is direct evidence that E. coli is exclusively sterilized by UV radiation in these experiments. Present LD_(50) photon doses are about 10 ^ 3 times larger than those required from low-power <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps,</b> indicating that high-intensity radiation is able to further promote into inactive channels the lower excited state(s) of nucleic acids responsible for DNA damage.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} and compare the antimicrobial activity of UV radiation of wavelength 253. 7 nm (used in typical <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps)</b> against Staphylococcus aureus on the surfaces of conventionally produced white ceramic wall tiles (matt and shiny) and the same tiles coated with TiO 2 using three different methods: RF diode sputtering, atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD) and spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD). Results clearly indicate that the bac-tericidal action of UV radiation is much stronger on the surfaces of tiles coated with TiO 2 than on the tiles uncovered. The strongest bactericidal effect of UV radiation was found for film prepared by APCVD. Results of experiments for shiny and matt tiles did not differ statistically. The use of ceramic wall tiles coated with TiO 2 films in hospitals, veterinary clinics, laboratories, food processing plants and other places where UV radiation is applied for disinfection should greatly improve the efficiency of this treatment.

40|$|Some foundamental researchs upon {{bacterial}} {{contamination of}} wooden fishing boats (less than 100 tons) {{were carried out}} {{and the effect of}} a <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamp</b> upon the sterilization of bacteria was studied. 1) The bacterial densities were examined in several parts of the fishing boats, which had been thoroughly washed after unloading of the catch. And, in the fish hold, which has been most frequently in contact with the catch, the density was counted more than 10 ^ 6 per cm^ 2. 2) The bacterial density calculation shows the existence of a close relationship between the efficiency of washing and the wall materials or wall paints of the fish hold. The material which shows the best effect is a galvanized iron, the second best is the one coated with vinyl chloride paint or coal tar, while, in case of plain wooden wall, the effect could be barely observed. 3) The installation of a <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamp</b> in the fish hold was proved to be very effective in sterilizing the bacteria on the wall.

Isolation cultures were used to grow the rotifers individually in separate U-plate depressions. The source of ultraviolet radiation consisted of four mercury <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps</b> used in combination to deliver a uniform flux of 315 uW/cm 2 over the sample. Five groups of rotifers, one control and four experimental groups of 96 each, were used. The rotifers used were 2 - 10 hours of age {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. The experimental groups were exposed to uv radiation for 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 7 minutes, 9 minutes. The mean lifetime of each of the control, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 7 minutes, and 9 minutes irradiated groups was 20. 4 days, 19. 1 days, 17. 1 days, 11. 5 days, and 6. 3 days respectively. No specific theory, nor the mechanism involved is given to explain these uv radiation effects on rotifers.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} issues for today's HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) engineer is Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). Many building owners, operators, and occupants complain of foul odors emanating from HVAC systems. The objectionable odor is the byproduct of the microbial growth (mold and fungus) that accumulates and develops on wet surfaces of HVAC units, causing foul odors to emanate from affected systems and degrading the IAQ and unit performance. This objectionable odor has been appropriately named the "Dirty Sock" syndrome. Less obvious to the building occupants, but of equal importance, are the physical effects the microbial organisms have on HVAC equipment. They restrict the airflow and limit the heat transfer capability, which increases the operating costs of the equipment. Fortunately, IAQ degradation, foul odor, and increased expenses can be eliminated with the installation of the ultraviolet 'C' band (W-C) <b>lamps.</b> The ultraviolet <b>germicidal</b> <b>lamps</b> are designed to kill odor causing mold and fungus that grow in wet evaporator sections of HVAC units. These lamps are installed inside HVAC systems and irradiate areas inhabited by the offending organisms, making it impossible for them to survive.
