5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent <b>higher</b> <b>prices.</b> This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E
5|$|Beef steak is graded for quality, with <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> {{for higher}} quality. Generally, {{the higher the}} quality, the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{between the}} French and the Portuguese {{began to show}} itself in the region during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading posts in Cacheu and Farim asked for <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and Sédhiou, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French. This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was {{negotiated}} in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Kenneth Lay merged {{the natural}} gas {{pipeline}} companies of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth to form Enron. In the early 1990s, he helped to initiate the selling of electricity at market prices, and soon after, the United States Congress approved legislation deregulating the sale of natural gas. The resulting markets {{made it possible for}} traders such as Enron to sell energy at <b>higher</b> <b>prices,</b> thereby significantly increasing its revenue. After producers and local governments decried the resultant price volatility and asked for increased regulation, strong lobbying on the part of Enron and others prevented such regulation.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E

Farmers received <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> for their agricultural products, railroads and commercial businesses thrived in the state's cities and towns, and manpower shortages gave laborers more bargaining power. The war also helped establish a national banking system to replace state-chartered banking institutions; by 1862 there were thirty-one national {{banks in the}} state.

The Commission began an antitrust investigation in 2007 of Apple's business practices after the complaint was made, but ultimately the Commission probe found no agreements between Apple and major record labels on how iTunes is run in Europe, only that Apple had been paying higher wholesale prices to UK music labels and was passing the cost along to UK customers.|$|E
5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and <b>higher</b> <b>prices,</b> intending to re-sell {{them for a}} profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E

No suitable agent could be found to oversee {{the sale of the}} third portion of LNC land, Hook Heath, and as a consequence Tubbs kept it under LNC control and oversaw its development himself. Over the 1890s the site was subdivided into plots for large detached houses, and a golf course was built to attract residents and visitors.|$|E
5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E
5|$|Although men {{and money}} had been secured, the markets {{component}} of the Bruce plan was never fully realised. At the 1923 Imperial Economic Conference, Bruce lobbied consistently for the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin to make changes to Great Britain's trading arrangements to give preference to dominion products over imports from other nations. He argued for Empire-wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental imports from other countries and empires. Baldwin and the Conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in Britain; however, the British public feared <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> for basic products (particularly food), and this fear {{was a factor in}} the Conservative government's defeat in the election of December 1923. Baldwin's successor Ramsay MacDonald repudiated the plan, much to Bruce's chagrin, and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout the decade. World agricultural prices stalled in the mid-1920s as European and American agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels, and Australian exports were crowded out of markets as the decade progressed.|$|E

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>prices</b> {{are often}} {{reported}} {{as an obstacle}} that inhibits the purchase of organic food products. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate how organic food products perform at different price levels and whether <b>high</b> <b>prices</b> are an advantage or a disadvantage for consumers’ repeat purchase of organic food. Based on analyses of actual purchase data, this study explores the effect of two product attributes (production method and price) on repeat purchase. The analysis is based on purchase data for four product categories (red meat, chicken, milk and hard cheese) registered by the GfK panel in 2011 in Denmark. The results show that within product categories, repeat purchase is linked more to production method than to price, and it is more prevalent for organic compared to conventional food, and for <b>high</b> <b>price</b> compared to low and medium price. Cross-purchasing of both organic and <b>high</b> <b>price</b> products is <b>high.</b> Low <b>price</b> leads to <b>highest</b> repeat purchase within individual organic product categories. <b>High</b> <b>price</b> is linked to the highest levels of cross-purchase across organic products. However, other market performance criteria are better for the organic medium price tier. These findings have several practical implications. For producers, it is important to know that low price actually stimulates repeat purchase. For retailers, <b>high</b> <b>price</b> levels might stimulate cross-purchases in a wider organic assortment...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|E
5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E
