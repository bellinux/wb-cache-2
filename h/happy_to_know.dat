500|$|A {{scene in}} which Ivan and Paul shared a kiss on a sofa sparked some {{controversy}} with viewers. 126 people complained to media watch dog Ofcom deeming the scenes to be explicit. The company later cleared Emmerdale of any wrongdoing, and a spokesperson said that [...] "Ivan and Paul's behaviour was no more explicit than that previously exhibited by other characters in the soap. Given the inexplicit portrayal of this relationship, we consider that these scenes were acceptable." [...] While Andy Green of the Liverpool Echo said [...] "Paul and Ivan's fumble on the sofa was probably the steamiest pre-watershed gay scene ever shown on mainstream TV." [...] Brocklebank told So So Gay's reporter that Ivan's bisexuality storyline had a [...] "huge effect" [...] on the viewers. He revealed that he had received [...] "a lot" [...] of letters from Christian groups telling {{him that he would}} go to hell for kissing another male on pre-watershed television. However, he also received many from young gay and lesbian teenagers who had thanked him for [...] "making it easier to come out" [...] because they had someone to relate to. He added that [...] "the majority was very positive" [...] feedback and felt <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that his portrayal had helped people face their sexuality.|$|E
500|$|The team {{breaks into}} TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, {{planning}} {{to replace the}} new novel with their old version before the mass printing begins. However, when they reach the printing room, the book publishing executive shows up {{with a group of}} armed men. He reveals that someone tipped him off about their plan, just as Lisa appears letting them know it was her because she wants her name on a book that will actually be popular. The executive types in the password in the printing machine and gives Lisa the honor of inserting the USB flash drive with the novel on it. Later, when the saddened members of the group-writing team are walking away from the headquarters, they pass a book store and discover that The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy is being put on the stands. Lisa shows up again, letting them know that she only pretended to betray them so that the publisher would type in the password. When Lisa gave Bart a hug, she replaced the executive's flash drive with Bart's flash drive that contained the troll novel. As a result, she was able to put the original version into print. Lisa is <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that her name is finally on a book; however, when she opens a copy, she discovers that Gaiman is listed as the author, not her. It turns out that there were three flash drives and that Gaiman heisted his way to the best-seller list [...] "once again" [...] despite being illiterate. During the credits, it is revealed that Moe was aware of Gaiman's scheme, and was in fact allied with him from the start. The two celebrate with a toast at Shelbyville Beach, but Gaiman double-crosses Moe and poisons his drink.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Derrick Smith of Game-insider.com wrote: [...] "Taki, my personal all-time favorite doesn’t make the Soul Calibur V trip. Yet she is nicely replaced with Natsu, her apprentice who brings with her the complete Taki package with some added youth to spice things up."

2500|$|Charles Oliver {{writes the}} novel shows a central Hemingway theme of [...] "maintaining control over one's life, {{even in the}} face of terrible odds." [...] Cantwell knows he is dying and faces death [...] "with the dignity which he {{believes}} he has maintained throughout his military service." [...] Oliver thinks the two male characters, Cantwell and Alvarito, have an unstated understanding – both men love Renata, but Cantwell accepts and is <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Renata will almost certainly marry Alvarito. Within hours of dying he says to himself: [...] "You have said goodbye to your girl and she has said goodbye to you. That is certainly simple". The theme of death is central in Hemingway's writings and his characters routinely achieve redemption at the moment of death, which can be seen as a form of existentialism. Jean-Paul Sartre believed to face death well is to live a heightened existence.|$|E

60|$|I am {{anxious and}} {{glad to have}} an {{opportunity}} of saying a word in reference to one incident in which I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you were interested, and still more <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> though it may sound paradoxical, that you were disappointed--I mean the death of the little heroine. When I first conceived the idea of conducting that simple story to its termination, I determined rigidly to adhere to it, and never to forsake the end I had in view. Not untried in the school of affliction, in the death of those we love, I thought what a good thing it would be if in my little work of pleasant amusement I could substitute a garland of fresh flowers for the sculptured horrors which disgrace the tomb. If I have put into my book anything which can fill the young mind with better thoughts of death, or soften the grief of older hearts; if I have written one word which can afford pleasure or consolation to old or young in time of trial, I shall consider it as something achieved--something which I shall be glad to look back upon in after life. Therefore I kept to my purpose, notwithstanding that towards the conclusion of the story, I daily received letters of remonstrance, especially from the ladies. God bless them for their tender mercies! The Professor was quite right when he said that I had not reached to an adequate delineation of their virtues; and I fear that I must go on blotting their characters in endeavouring to reach the ideal in my mind. These letters were, however, combined with others from the sterner sex, and some of them were not altogether free from personal invective. But, notwithstanding, I kept to my purpose, and I am <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that many of those who at first condemned me are now foremost in their approbation.|$|E
