Hydrogen ion and sodium ion activities have been stuccessfully determined by means of glass-membrane electrodes(l- 5). However, {{in the presence of}} sodium, glass electrodes are usually inadequate for measuring potassium, divalent cation or anion activities(4). The adaptation of the liquid <b>ion-exchanger</b> principle for use with microelectrodes, permits measurement of K+ and Cl- activities on botlh sides of the cell mem-brane(6 - 8). We hlave constructed potassium-selective liquid <b>ion-exchanger</b> microelectrodes to measure K+ activity in rat distal tubules.

Due to recent concerns over potential radiological and chemical degradation of SuperLig(R) 644 resin and increased pressure drops observed during pilot-scale column studies, an increased interest in developing a potential backup <b>ion-exchanger</b> material has resulted. Ideally, a backup <b>ion-exchanger</b> material would replace the SuperLig(R) 644 resin and have no other major impacts on the pretreatment facility flowsheet. Such an ideal exchanger has not been identified to date. However, Crystalline Silicotitanate (CST) <b>ion-exchanger</b> materials have been studied {{for the removal of}} cesium from a variety of DOE wastes over the last decade. CST <b>ion-exchanger</b> materials demonstrate a high affinity for cesium under high alkalinity conditions and have been under investigation for cesium removal specifically at Hanford and SRS during the last six years. Since CST is an inorganic based material (with excellent properties in regard to chemical, radiological, and thermal stability) that is considered to be practically non-elutable (while SuperLig(R) 644 is an organic based elutable resin), the overall pretreatment facility flowsheet would be impacted in various ways.

Many studies on inorganic <b>ion-exchangers</b> {{have been carried out}} due to the scientific interest towards their high mechanical and thermal stabilities, high resistance to oxidation and high sorption capacity regarding transition and radioactive metal ions. Titanium phosphates (TiP) in particular, have revealed very good cation-exchange properties in relation to different transition metal ions in aqueous solutions. It has been demonstrated that their physicochemical properties as well as their structural characteristics can be altered by carefully choosing the conditions of synthesis: the temperature, acidity, Ti(IV) speciation in solution and reaction time. Since the ‘classical’ crystalline TiP ionites have been divided into two main groups: alfa type; α-TiP [α-Ti(HPO 4) 2 •H 2 O] and gamma type; γ-TiP [Ti(H 2 PO 4) (PO 4) •H 2 O] with different functional groups (–H 2 PO 4, –HPO 4 and –PO 4) present, the researchers have focused on synthesis of various metastable TiP with different functional properties. In this work, three different synthetic routes for TiP <b>ion-exchangers</b> were explored in order to obtain a sorbent composed solely of –H 2 PO 4 exchange units. The ─H 2 PO 4 groups were expected to considerably increase the pH working range of the sorbents and to nearly double the theoretical exchange capacity of TiP <b>ion-exchangers</b> containing mostly –HPO 4 functional groups. Among the synthesized <b>ion-exchangers</b> (TiP 1, TiP 2 and TiP 3), TiP 1 has shown very good sorption characteristics and therefore, most of the studies were performed on it. TiP 1 was synthesized at mild thermal conditions using cobalt(II) ions as a modifying agent and HCl-washes as post-synthetic treatments. This sorbent was characterized by different spectroscopic techniques and its chemical formula was established to be: TiO(OH) (H 2 PO 4) •H 2 O. The sorption capacity of TiP 1, estimated about 4. 8 meq. g- 1, is higher than the reported exchange capacity for various amorphous TiP. The sorption characteristics of TiP 1 towards divalent ions such as Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Ni 2 +, Mn 2 + and Co 2 +, were investigated in this work. The results of the sorption experiments (in the 1 - 20 mmol. L- 1 range) were fitted to the Langmuir and Temkin models with the latter one being somewhat preferred for most of the metal ions studied. This indicates that interactions between adsorbed molecules cannot be neglected. It was also found that the kinetics of the ion-exchange process was very fast and the equilibrium was reached within 10 minutes. The kinetic data were modeled using the pseudo-second order reaction rate and the obtained curves were consistent with chemisorption being the rate limiting step of the reactions. The selectivity order of the metal ions studied towards TiP 1 here was found to be: Cu 2 + > Zn 2 + > Mn 2 + > Co 2 + > Ni 2 +. The TiP 1 sorbent has also shown {{to be a very good}} cation-exchanger when batch experiments were performed using heavy metals polluted waters from closed mines, supplied by Boliden AB. These studies delineated that TiP 1 has displayed exclusive sorption capacities and imminent ion-exchange kinetics. It has been distinctly shown that a modest change in the synthesis could facilitate the fabrication of titanium phosphate <b>ion-exchangers</b> with improved and versatile sorption properties.

40|$|Plasticized {{polymeric}} membrane electrodes containing selective chemical receptors (ionophores) {{that are used}} in potentiometric and optical sensors have recently been shown to be attractive in controlled current coulometry for calibration free reagent delivery. For this purpose, a galvanostatic pulse of fixed duration is applied across an ion-selective membrane containing added <b>ion-exchanger</b> sites, resulting in the release of a calculated amount of ions from the membrane into the sample phase. This paper evaluates the operational limits of such coulometric actuators with chronopotentiometry, using silver-selective membranes as model systems. Diffusion theory predicts the depletion of ionophore and <b>ion-exchanger</b> at one of the two interfaces in a matter of minutes, owing to the relatively small diffusion coefficients in such membranes. Chronopotentiometry on membranes containing lipophilic cations at either side of the membrane, rather than silver ions, confirms that the ionophore depletes at the inner side of the membrane. At the sample side, ionophore is expected to increase in concentration and does not result in a loss of selectivity. Chronopotentiometric responses show a drastic transition at long times, typically 30 min, which cannot plausibly be explained by the depletion of added lipophilic <b>ion-exchanger</b> at the sample side since the diffusion coefficients are similar to that of ionophore. It is postulated that the intrinsic anion-exchanger sites of the PVC matrix are relatively immobile and do not easily concentration polarize upon application of a transmembrane current pulse, in agreement with Buck's earlier work on fixed site membranes. Indeed, silver and calcium-selective membranes fabricated with increased concentrations of such fixed sites, by using carboxylated PVC, exhibited chronopotentiometric breakdown times larger than 60 min and no loss in coulometric efficiency. The results obtained here will help in designing coulometric actuators with improved characteristics on the basis of hydrophobic polymeric ion-selective membranes...|$|R
