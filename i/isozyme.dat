5|$|Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a {{class of}} closely related enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the breakdown of the}} superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. Superoxide dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the <b>isozyme,</b> can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc SOD is present in the cytosol, while manganese SOD is present in the mitochondrion. There also exists a third form of SOD in extracellular fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial <b>isozyme</b> seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc SOD (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on superoxide), while mice without the extracellular SOD have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). In plants, SOD isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron SOD found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.|$|E

In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} {{individual}} lipoxygenase <b>isozymes</b> in soybean [Glycine max (L.)

Native isoelectric focusing followed by immunoblotting was employed to examine individual lipoxygenase <b>isozymes.</b> In leaves of all ages, two distinct classes of lipoxygenase <b>isozymes</b> were detected. One class of lipoxygenase <b>isozymes</b> had nearly neutral isoelectric points (pls) ranging from pH 6. 8 to 7. 2. The other class of lipoxygenase <b>isozymes</b> had acidic pls ranging from pH 4. 7 to 5. 6.

However, four acidic lipoxygenase <b>isozymes</b> (pl = 4. 70, 4. 80, 4. 90, 4. 95) were more abundant in intermediateage leaves than in either the youngest or oldest leaves examined. Following mechanical wounding of leaves, these same four acidic <b>isozymes</b> also increased in abundance both locally and systemically in leaves from wounded plants.

5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. <b>Isozyme</b> banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E

CaMKII expression was evaluated {{in a variety of}} human tumor cell lines using RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase coupled polymerase chain reaction). PCR primers which flanked the CaMK-II variable domain were used so that all possible variants of the four mammalian CaMK-II genes (α, β, γ and δ) could be identified. 8 distinct CaMK-II <b>isozymes</b> were identified from human mammary tumor and neuroblastoma cell cDNA, each of which represented a variant of β, γ or δ CaMK-II.

A panel of human cell types was then screened for these CaMK-II <b>isozymes.</b> As expected, cerebral cortex predominately expressed α, β and δA CaMK-II. In contrast, tumor cells, including those of neuronal origin, expressed an entirely different spectrum of CaMK-II <b>isozymes</b> than adult neuronal tissue.

Glucokinase has a lower affinity for glucose than the other hexokinases do, and its activity is localized to a few cell types, leaving the other three hexokinases as more important preparers of glucose for glycolysis and glycogen synthesis for most tissues and organs. Because of this reduced affinity, the activity of glucokinase, under usual physiological conditions, varies substantially according to the concentration of glucose.|$|E

The mechanisms underlying these two processes, however, are largely unknown. Protein kinase C <b>isozymes,</b> which are activated by phorbol esters, are important mediators in the angiogenic process. In the current work, we identified the protein kinase C <b>isozymes</b> present in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and determined which of the <b>isozymes</b> are activated in response to phorbol ester or to collagen treatments. Using western blot analysis, we found that microvascular endothelial cells contain at least six protein kinase C <b>isozymes</b> (α, β, δ, ϵ, ζ, η).

(Furthermore, much later molecular phylogenetics has shown that vertebrates are {{more closely related to}} tunicates than to amphioxus, thus negating the logic of this analysis.) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons. First, gene mapping data in humans and mice revealed extensive paralogy regions - sets of genes on one chromosome related to sets of genes on another chromosome in the same species, indicative of duplication events in evolution. Paralogy regions were generally in sets of four. Second, cloning of Hox genes in amphioxus revealed presence of a single Hox gene cluster, in contrast to the four clusters in humans and mice. Data from additional gene families revealed a common one-to-many rule when amphioxus and vertebrate genes were compared. Taken together, these two lines of evidence suggest that two genome duplications occurred in the ancestry of vertebrates, after it had diverged from the cephalochordate evolutionary lineage.|$|E

The resulting GST-PLIs showed ability to bind to three Tf venom PLA 2 <b>isozymes.</b> The binding study with the truncated forms indicated that one of two three-finger motifs of PLI-I was able to bind to PLA 2 <b>isozymes.</b> The N-terminal 37 -amino acid fragment and the CRD-like domain of PLI-IV and PLI-V were bound to PLA 2 <b>isozymes.</b> On the other hand, their C-terminal 12 -amino acid segment also associated with PLA 2 <b>isozymes.</b> When either of two units of a hydrophobic tripeptide in this sequence was replaced by trialanine, the binding was completely abolished, indicating that the C-terminal hydrophobic cores of PLI-IV and PLI-V were critically responsible for the binding to venom PLA 2 <b>isozymes...</b>|$|R
