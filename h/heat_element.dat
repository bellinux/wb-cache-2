Natural convective heat transfer from a square horizontal flat isothermal <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> imbedded in a larger flat square adiabatic surface with a square flat horizontal adiabatic surface mounted parallel to the heated surface at a relatively short distance from it has been numerically studied. The surface of the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> {{is in the same}} plane as the surface of the surrounding adiabatic material. The square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> considered in this study is at a higher temperature than that of the surrounding fluid. Both the case where the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> is facing upwards and the surrounding adiabatic covering surface is above the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> (upward facing case) and the case where the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> is facing downwards and the surrounding adiabatic covering surface is below the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> (downward facing case) have been considered. The situation considered is a simplified model of some situations that arise in engineering practice examples occurring in some electrical and electronic component cooling problems. In this study, the range of conditions considered is such that laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows occur. The {{purpose of this study was}} to numerically determine how the heat transfer rate from the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> varies with the distance of the adiabatic covering surface from the <b>heated</b> <b>element.</b> The solution was obtained by numerically solving the governing equations subject to the boundary conditions using the commercial CFD solver ANSYS FLUENT© using the kepsilon turbulence model with full account being taken of buoyancy force effects.
