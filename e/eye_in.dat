40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the degree of}} reunion <b>in</b> rabbit <b>eyes</b> of the superior oblique tendon after several surgical weakening procedures. Methods: A total of 32 rabbits (64 <b>eyes)</b> were used <b>in</b> this study. The rabbits {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups, eight rabbits (16 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> the tenotomy group, eight rabbits (16 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> the tenectomy group, eight rabbits (16 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> the disinsertion group and eight rabbits (16 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> the recession group. The degree of reunion or reattachment of the superior oblique tendon on the globe were examined on four <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> each group at postoperative weeks two, four, six and eight. Results: At eight weeks, the newly created insertion site remained at the same site <b>in</b> all <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the recession group, and the distal end of the superior oblique tendon was reattached at the medial border of the superior rectus muscle <b>in</b> all four <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the tenotomy and disinsertion groups, and in three of four <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the tenectomy group. Conclusions: From this experimental study, it was speculated that superior oblique recession is more effective than other superior oblique weakening procedures. This result could be helpful in the prediction of time of recurrence for superior oblique overaction after superior oblique weakening procedures...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} three photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) procedures {{in the treatment of}} astigmatism. METHODS: In this retrospective comparative case series, 89 eyes of 50 patients who underwent PRK treatment for astigmatism were enrolled. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on the PRK procedure: Group 1 : PRK without mitomycin-C (MMC) application, Group 2 : PRK with MMC application, and Group 3 : Trans-Photorefractive Keratectomy (T-PRK). The efficacy, safety, predictability, and complications of treatment were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months after the treatment. RESULTS: At postoperative 6 months, the percentage of postoperative uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20 / 20 or better was 55. 6 % (20 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> group 1, 75 % (15 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> group 2, and 75. 8 % (25 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> group 3 (P= 0. 144). The percentage of postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of unchanged or gained ≥ 1 lines was 80. 6 % (29 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> group 1, 70 % (14 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> group 2, and 90. 9 % (30 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> group 3 (P= 0. 151). The percentage of postoperative BCVA of lost ≥ 2 lines was 11. 1 % (4 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> group 1, 20 % (4 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> group 2, and 6. 1 % (2 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> group 3. The mean manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE) and mean cylindrical refraction were not significantly different among the each groups (P> 0. 05). At postoperative 6 months, the percentage of MRSE of within ± 0. 50 D was 100 % (36 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> Group 1, 100 % (20 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> Group 2, and 93. 9 % (31 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> Group 3. At the each follow-up period, {{there was no significant difference}} <b>in</b> number of <b>eyes</b> with haze and mean haze score(P> 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The study showed that PRK without MMC, PRK with MMC and T-PRK appears to have similar effectiveness, safety and predictability in the treatment of astigmatism.

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the therapeutic outcomes of idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurisms and neuroretinitis(IRVAN) syndrome by different treatments. METHODS:Seven patients(14 eyes) with IRVAN {{were enrolled in}} this study and divided into different stages. There were 4 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> stage Ⅱ and 10 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> stage Ⅲ. The visual acuity(VA) was ≥ 0. 6 <b>in</b> 6 <b>eyes,</b> 0. 3 <b>in</b> 4 <b>eyes,</b> and ≤ 0. 1 <b>in</b> 4 <b>eyes.</b> Treatment involved retinal laser photocoagulation for peripheral retinal ischemia area <b>in</b> the 4 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> stage Ⅱ and panretinal laser photocoagulation(PRP) for the 10 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> stage Ⅲ. Two <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> stage Ⅲ were also treated with intravitreal injection of ranibizumab and 4 eyes with vitrectomy before PRP. Visual acuity and fundus situations were measured after the treatments. The follow-up time was 6 mo ～ 10 a. RESULTS:After treatments, the final VA was improved <b>in</b> 6 <b>eyes,</b> remaining unchanged <b>in</b> 6 <b>eyes,</b> and decreased after improved <b>in</b> 2 <b>eyes.</b> It was as following:≥ 0. 6 <b>in</b> 9 <b>eyes,</b> 0. 3 ～ 0. 6 <b>in</b> 4 <b>eyes,</b> and ≤ 0. 1 <b>in</b> 1 <b>eyes.</b> Four <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> stage Ⅱ maintained a good vision, but one of them had a new ischemia area. We treated it with PRP and there was no progression now. In stage Ⅲ, there were 2 eyes with unchanged VA, 2 eyes with improved VA, 2 eyes with improved VA after giving ranibizumab, 4 eyes with vitreous hemorrhage and with better VA after treatments, and <b>in</b> the 4 <b>eyes,</b> 2 eyes kept stable and another two had recurrent vitreous hemorrhage for several times and ended with poor vision. Fundus examination showed the closure of hemorrhage area and optic disc or retinal neovascularization shrinked. CONCLUSION:PRP is effective for <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> stage Ⅱ. <b>Eyes</b> <b>in</b> stage Ⅲ could be treated with intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or vitrectomy in addition to PRP.

40|$|Tessellated fundus {{is found}} as common and early-phase {{characteristic}} of myopic eyes and their locations are varied among patients. However, {{the relationship between}} their locations and morphological parameters of the eyes is still unknown. The purpose is {{this study is to}} determine the locations of the tessellations in the ocular fundus of young healthy eyes, and to determine relationships between their locations and morphological parameters of the eyes. This is a prospective observational cross sectional study of 126 eyes of 126 healthy volunteers (mean age 26. 0 ± 4. 1 years). The eyes were classified into eight groups based on the location of the tessellations; no tessellation, temporal, infra-temporal, inferior, nasal, peripapillary, whole retina, and unclassified tessellations. The degree of optic disc tilt was quantified using a sine curve fitting program on the optical coherence tomographic circle scan images. The correlations between each tessellation location and the axial length, area of the optic disc plus conus (AOC), and optic disc tilt were determined. Forty-four <b>eyes</b> were place <b>in</b> the no tessellation group, 12 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the temporal, 21 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the infra-temporal, 9 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the inferior, 8 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the nasal, 15 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the peripapillary, 11 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the whole, and 6 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the unclassified groups. The differences in the axial lengths between the no tessellation group and the infra-temporal groups were significant. A significant difference was found in the AOC between the no tessellation and the inferior, infra-temporal, and peripapilalry groups. A significant difference was found in the optic disc tilt between the no tessellation and infra-temporal groups (P< 0. 05). The tessellations are located at specific sites in the fundus of young healthy eyes with the infra-temporal location most frequent.
