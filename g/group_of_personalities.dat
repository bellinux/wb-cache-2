50|$|It {{has been}} noted that even though early lexical studies in the English {{language}} indicated five large <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> traits, more recent, and more comprehensive, cross-language studies have provided evidence for six large groups rather than five.

Based on these findings {{it has been suggested that}} the Big Five system should be replaced by HEXACO, or revised to better align with lexical evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Organic {{personality}} disorder (OPD) {{is not included}} in the wide variety <b>of</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> disorders. For this reason, the symptoms and diagnostic criteria <b>of</b> the organic <b>personality</b> disorder are {{different from those of the}} mental health disorders, which are included in this various <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> disorders. According to the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10, this disorder is a type of mental health behavioural disorder. The Fourth Revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV defines the organic {{personality disorder}} as the personality change, which is caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) that means there are specific brain areas of patients, which have been injured after a very strong accident. Moreover, according to the ICD-10, the organic personality disorder is associated with a [...] "significant alteration of the habitual patterns of premorbid behaviour". Furthermore, organic personality disorder is associated with [...] "personality change due to general medical condition". There are crucial influences on emotions, impulses and personal needs because of this disorder. Thus, all these definitions about the organic personality disorder support that this type of disorder is associated with changes in personality and behaviour.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we empirically {{investigate}} the contribution <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> traits to the gender gap in entrepreneurship. Our empirical analyses, {{which are based on}} data obtained from a large scale survey of individuals in 36 countries, suggest that a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> traits which we call Individual Entrepreneurial Aptitude (IEA) has a positive effect on latent and nascent entrepreneurship among women and men. Moreover, women’s considerably lower level of IEA contributes significantly to the gender gap in entrepreneurship. The lower level of IEA is mainly due to women’s lower levels of competitiveness and risk tolerance. Furthermore, these results are confirmed by the results of a country-level analysis which show that the within-country variation of entrepreneurial activities of women and men is significantly related to within-country variation of IEA. entrepreneurship, gender gap, personality traits, competitiveness...|$|R

5000|$|As it {{has already}} been mentioned, the organic {{personality}} disorder is included in a wide <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> and behavioural disorders. This mental health disorder can be caused by disease, brain damages or dysfunctions in specific brain areas in frontal lobe. The most common reason for this profound change in personality is the traumatic brain injury (TBI). Children, whose brain areas have injured or damaged, may present Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and organic personality disorder. Moreover, this disorder is characterised as [...] "frontal lobe syndrome". This characteristic name shows that the organic personality disorder can usually be caused by lesions in three brain areas of frontal lobe. Specifically, the symptoms <b>of</b> organic <b>personality</b> disorder can also be caused by traumatic brain injuries in orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It is worth to be mentioned that organic personality disorder may also be caused by lesions in other circumscribed brain areas.|$|R

50|$|Despite its late origins, the {{exterior}} of the church is very much associated with the baroque style. Due to the surrounding property with the convent and seminar buildings and other houses, it is only possible to see the church with its mighty towerless façade that overlooks the other buildings of the old town. Above the portal rises a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>personalities</b> created for the church by Nikolaus Binterim. It is essentially the coronation of Mary, Queen of Heaven, flanked by Augustine of Hippo, patron saint and ruler of the Augustinian order, and his mother Monica of Hippo. In the south and east of the church are the former convent buildings and rooms of the seminar, which were built between 1737 and 1753. The wing of the monastery complex has a beautiful portal with figures, which also come from Nikolas Binterim, after the façade of the church itself. The interior of the church tends to rococo, which is expressed by a fusion of nave and choir a concept that is increasingly found in the Rococo stylistic.|$|E

A period of instability due to a deleterious political intervention (from 1947 to the present day) responsible for the destruction of the structure and concept of a new teaching hospital (Hospital de Santa Maria). As a result of the socio-political situation conflicting laws and vicious rules lead to an excess of non-selected teachers and an alarming increase of students, patients and medical doctors A change from the present situation and a new concept of clinical teaching must be imagined.

40|$|This {{extended}} abstract briefly introduces Hofstede’s three leveled {{model of}} hu- man mental programming which captures the unique mental constitution of a person. These levels devide the vague “human factor” in more approachable categories. In {{the following sections}} each category is addressed and presented seperately according to research found and regarding security-aware behaviour. By including universal human behaviour, characteristics of organisational and na- tional cultures as well as (occupational) <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> traits <b>of</b> employees, {{we might be able}} to identify emerging social threats. Furthermore, assessing social risks could help to develop guidelines for cultural change towards a more security- aware organisational culture. As the influence of an organisation on external factors (other than their own or- ganisational culture) tends to be minimal, developing, allowing, and applying cultural changes can be a promising approach in mitigating socio-technical risks...|$|R
40|$|Schizotypy is a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> traits, {{associated}} with Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SPD), that {{are thought to}} be a pre-condition of Schizophrenia. It is however widely accepted that schizotypal traits exist on a continuum throughout the general population.

Previous research has identified associations between adult attachment and schizotypy and more recently research is beginning to address the associations between emotion regulation and schizotypy. This present study examined the relationship between attachment, emotion regulation and schizotypy in a non-clinical sample. This relationship was investigated using a cross-sectional design. Standard multiple regression found that anxious attachment and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were both predictive of schizotypy. The significance of these findings and future implications are discussed...|$|R
