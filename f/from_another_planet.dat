5|$|The inner Solar System {{has been}} made the goal of at least four {{unmanned}} programs. The first was Mariner in the 1960s and '70s, which made multiple visits to Venus and Mars and one to Mercury. Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (Mariner 2), {{to take the first}} pictures <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> (Mariner 4), the first planetary orbiter (Mariner 9), and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver (Mariner 10). This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Clark and Michael Jon Carter (Booster Gold) {{inadvertently}} {{traveled to}} the 31st century, where they found themselves caught in a war between New Krypton, led by Kara, and an army of xenophobes, during which Doomsday is reawakened, then defeated when all the belligerents form an alliance. While in the future, Clark met a child named Bartholomew Allen, causing Clark to suspect he was a descendant of Bart and giving him hope {{that he was still}} alive. After meeting Diana Prince, with whom he teamed to defeat Hades and Felix Faust, Clark, as Superman, chose to reveal to the President that he was not a meteor-infected individual as the public believed but was <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet.</b> Later, Clark attempted to rally the heroes and the world to make a stand against the Monitors.|$|E

5000|$|The descent capsule of Venera 4 {{entered the}} {{atmosphere}} of Venus on October 18, 1967, making it the first probe to return direct measurements <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planets</b> atmosphere. The capsule measured temperature, pressure, density and performed 11 automatic chemical experiments to analyze the atmosphere. It discovered that {{the atmosphere of}} Venus was 95% carbon dioxide (...) , and in combination with radio occultation data from the Mariner 5 probe, showed that surface pressures were far greater than expected (75 to 100 atmospheres).|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} set {{about two years}} after the {{collapse}} of civilization due to a mysterious disease called neuroderm. The [...] "disease" [...] is actually caused by a symbiotic micro-organism sent to Earth <b>from</b> <b>another</b> inhabited <b>planet,</b> and is actually beneficial, though seen as disfiguring because of the graying of skin which eventually spreads over the entire body.|$|R
25|$|Through flashbacks, {{imaginary}} {{stories and}} time travel, Superman comics in the Silver Age examined the implicit themes of Superman's origin as an orphan <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet,</b> while also providing explanations for many key story elements. In 1961, Superman #146 told {{the most complete}} version of the origin story to date, this time inserting references to {{other elements of the}} expanding Superman mythos, including Jor-El's warning to his brother Zor-El, father of Supergirl, about Krypton's fate and Krypto's launch into space.|$|E

As David Frankel noted in Artforum, ”she seems both a familiar presence {{and at the same}} time unknowable, one multifaceted figure- she is all of them-but at the same time non-of them at all… Starr proposes a model of art-making and combines the baroque with the spontaneous….the frame is fiction".|$|E
25|$|The Antarctic {{gate was}} later {{revealed}} to have originally {{been the primary}} Stargate on Earth, built by the Ancients. The Stargate originally used in the SGC, found in Giza, was brought to Earth by Ra <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet.</b> Since Stargate addresses correspond to planetary locations and not individual gates, the new gate inherited the same address {{as the one in}} Antarctica. Because the Antarctic gate had been abandoned millennia earlier by the Ancients and no longer had a connected DHD, Ra's gate became the primary (but Earth doesn't use a DHD).|$|E
60|$|Thus {{from his}} {{original}} bulk—or, to speak more accurately, from the {{condition in which}} we first considered him—from a partially spherified nebular mass, certainly much more than 5,600 millions of miles in diameter—the great central orb and origin of our solar-planetary-lunar system, has gradually descended, by condensation, in obedience {{to the law of}} Gravity, to a globe only 882,000 miles in diameter; but it by no means follows, either that its condensation is yet complete, or that it may not still possess the capacity of whirling <b>from</b> itself <b>another</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In Sherlock Holmes' War of the Worlds, Professor Challenger theorizes to Sherlock Holmes {{that the}} Martians came <b>from</b> <b>another,</b> wetter <b>planet</b> {{due to their}} seeming {{familiarity}} with the ocean while battling the Thunder Child; their small lungs (which would have been inadequate in Mars' atmosphere); {{and the fact that}} no construction was evident on Mars before the 1894 opposition. Their apparent struggle to move in Earth's gravity is given as a mixture of caution and embellishment in the accounts of Wells, [...] "the known atheist and radical". Challenger further speculates that they came <b>from</b> <b>another</b> solar system in the galaxy.|$|R
25|$|Later {{stories in}} the Dalek comic tell of the {{expansion}} of the Daleks' empire, including a lengthy war against the Mechanoids which is averted by a robot sent <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet.</b> In the last published comic in this series, the Daleks learn the location of Earth, which they propose to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television later, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the Dalek Emperor did show up later on in the programme.|$|E
25|$|According to the doctrine, Adam {{was once}} a mortal man who became resurrected and exalted. <b>From</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet,</b> he then came as Michael to form Earth. Adam brought Eve, one of his wives, with him to Earth, where they became mortal by eating the {{forbidden}} fruit in the Garden of Eden. After bearing mortal children and establishing the human race, Adam and Eve returned to their heavenly thrones where Adam serves as God and is the Heavenly Father of humankind. Later, Adam returned to the Earth to the ancient prophets, and to become the literal father of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Toulouse-Lautrec {{would have}} seized at once {{on all that}} was {{significant}} of the moral atmosphere, would have seized most of all on what satisfied his slightly morbid relish of depravity... But Seurat, one feels, saw it almost as one might suppose some visitant <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> would have done. He saw it with this penetrating exactness of a gaze vacant of all direct understanding... Each figure seems to be so perfectly enclosed within its simplified contour, for, however precise and detailed Seurat is, his passion for geometricizing never deserts him—enclosed so completely, so shut off in its partition, that no other relation than a spatial and geometrical one is any longer possible. The syntax of actual life has been broken up and replaced by Seurat's own peculiar syntax with all its strange, remote and unforeseen implications.|$|E
25|$|Jaye Davidson as Ra, a {{powerful}} alien in human form. After voyaging across the universe, {{searching for a}} new host that could sustain his dying body, Ra {{took the form of}} a curious adolescent boy and enslaved the people of his planet (Earth). Using a Stargate, he transported people <b>from</b> Earth to <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> (where much of the film is set) until the humans on Earth rebelled and buried their Stargate.|$|R
50|$|Bell's {{love for}} big cats is also {{expressed}} in Tomorrow's Sphinx (about cheetahs in {{past and future}} Egypt) and The Jaguar Princess (a werecat (jaguar) woman in Aztec Mexico). Bell is also fascinated with flight, writing People of the Sky about Pueblo Indians who migrate <b>from</b> Earth to <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> and learn to ride winged aliens. Bell's short stories {{have appeared in the}} Witch World and CatFantastic (cats and magic) anthologies, both edited by science fiction and fantasy writer, Andre Norton.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} Last Hope, {{the evil}} empire was {{destroyed}} by pilot Vanessa Gaiden. Although she escaped, her victory was short-lived as she never made it home and was declared missing in action. Meanwhile, a new evil appears and begins to terrorize the galaxy, a planet lord called [...] "The Master" [...] that can create beings of steel and enslave humans by absorbing their souls. Gordian Gaiden, Vanessa's newlywed husband, is out to search for her when he feels the presence of evil and dons his Gunlord suit. After destroying the Master, Gordian receives a distress signal <b>from</b> Vanessa on <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> and rescues her, allowing the couple to enjoy the victory of their adventures.|$|R
500|$|Many other {{observations}} and proclamations by notable personalities added {{to what has}} been termed [...] "Mars Fever". In 1899, while investigating atmospheric radio noise using his receivers in his Colorado Springs lab, inventor Nikola Tesla observed repetitive signals that he later surmised might have been radio communications coming <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet,</b> possibly Mars. In a 1901 interview Tesla said: ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's final {{large-scale}} orchestral {{works were}} his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: [...] "If {{ever there was}} music <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet,</b> this is surely it. Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air rarefied and bracing." [...] Nielsen's last musical composition, the organ work Commotio, was premiered posthumously in 1931.|$|E
500|$|The book {{states that}} {{advanced}} human scientists <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> with 25,000 years of scientific advances created all life on Earth through DNA manipulation. These scientists, Raël said, were originally called Elohim or [...] "those {{who came from}} the sky". He wrote that some forty prophets in Earth's history were sent by Elohim, but their messages were distorted by humans, {{largely because of the}} difference in the level of civilization between the advanced race and Earth's primitive one.|$|E
6000|$|... "The new Feudalism will be but {{an orderly}} {{outgrowth}} of present [...] tendencies and conditions. All societies evolve naturally out of [...] their predecessors. In sociology, as in biology, {{there is no}} cell [...] without a parent cell. The society of each generation develops a [...] multitude of spontaneous and acquired variations, and out of these, [...] by a blending process of natural and conscious selection, the [...] succeeding society is evolved. The new order will differ in no [...] important respects from the present, except in the completer [...] development of its more salient features. The visitor <b>from</b> <b>another</b> [...] <b>planet</b> who had known the old and should see the new would note but [...] few changes. Alter et Idem--another yet the same--he would say. [...] From magnate to baron, from workman to villein, from publicist to [...] court agent and retainer, will be changes of state and function so [...] slight as to elude all but the keenest eyes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{activities}} {{around a}} far-flung human colony {{on the planet}} Resurgam, orbiting the star Delta Pavonis, inadvertently {{attracted the attention of}} the Inhibitors. The Conjoiners, also made aware of this event, sent Clavain to recover the exceedingly powerful [...] "Cache Weapons" [...] from this system (said weapons having been stolen from the Conjoiners centuries before) {{that could be used to}} fend off the Inhibitors while the Conjoiners escaped. Clavain instead defected from the Conjoiners, intending to use the weapons to protect all of humanity. Skade, another Conjoiner, was sent to stop him and recover the weapons. They fought around the Resurgam system, with Clavain and his allies eventually obtaining the weapons. Clavain's ally Remontoire agreed to seek out alien assistance from the Hades Matrix, a nearby alien computer disguised as a neutron star, whilst Clavain sheltered refugees <b>from</b> Resurgam on <b>another</b> <b>planet,</b> later termed Ararat.|$|R
5000|$|Being a {{powerful}} witch, Rita possessed many magical abilities. By {{far the most}} common demonstration of her power was her use of her [...] "wand" [...] (actually an ornate staff) to make her monsters and minions grow to enormous sizes. Rita has also used magical rituals to control humans to do her bidding and even turn them evil, at least temporarily (Tommy Oliver and Katherine Hillard being the most prominent examples). She can also trap people in other dimensions and, like most villains from the [...] "Zordon era", can teleport at will, though only at relatively short range (i.e., from the moon to Earth and back, but not <b>from</b> Earth to <b>another</b> <b>planet).</b> Rita was also able to create her own Power Ranger, but she accomplished this by simply giving a Power Coin to an individual she had brainwashed to be evil, rather than facilitate {{a connection to the}} Morphing Grid herself.|$|R
500|$|Several episodes hint at Mitchell's love life. The early {{episodes of}} season 9 suggest a {{relationship}} between Mitchell and Landry's daughter, Dr. Carolyn Lam (Lexa Doig); a scripted romantic subplot in [...] "Avalon" [...] was filmed but was cut for time when the two-parter ran long for over twenty minutes. In season 9's [...] "Collateral Damage", Mitchell has a romantic encounter with a female human researcher <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet,</b> named Reya Varrick but she is killed. At his 20-year high school reunion in [...] "Bounty", Mitchell lays {{the foundation for a}} relationship with his high school crush, Amy Vanderburg.|$|E
500|$|It {{is alleged}} that the reptilians not only come <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet,</b> but are also from another {{dimension}}, the lower level of the fourth dimension (the [...] "lower astral dimension"), the one nearest the physical world. Barkun argues that the introduction of different dimensions allows Icke to skip awkward questions about how the reptilians got here. Icke writes that the universe consists of {{an infinite number of}} dimensions that share the same space, just like television and radio frequencies. Some people can tune their consciousness to other wavelengths, and it is from one of these other dimensions that the Anunnaki control the planet, although just as fourth-dimensional reptilians control us, they in turn are controlled by a fifth dimension.|$|E
500|$|Hamm's script had an ape {{astronaut}} <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> crash-landing in New York Harbor, {{launching a}} virus that will make human beings extinct. Dr. Susan Landis, {{who works for the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Alexander Troy, an Area 51 scientist, use the ape's spacecraft to return to the virus' planet of origin, hoping to find an antidote. They find an urban environment where apes armed with heavy weapons hunt humans. The main villain was Lord Zaius; in contrast to Dr. Zaius, Lord Zaius was very cruel to the humans. Landis and Troy discover the antidote and return to Earth, only to find in their 74-year absence that apes have taken over the planet. [...] "The Statue of Liberty's once proud porcelain features have been crudely chiseled into the grotesque likeness of a great grinning ape".|$|E
50|$|First {{successful}} in-place {{analysis of}} <b>another</b> <b>planet.</b> It {{may have also}} been the first space probe to impact the surface of <b>another</b> <b>planet,</b> although {{it is unclear whether}} it reached Venus' surface.|$|R
5000|$|Oakland-based artist Skinner, who characterizes {{his work}} as [...] "psychedelic {{nightmare}} paintings," [...] created the album's artwork. Prior to its release, bassist and vocalist Troy Sanders stated: [...] "It's {{going to be a}} work of art for sure. It's going to be very eye-opening. Very striking. It's <b>from</b> <b>another</b> dimension, and a lot of our music is geared toward that idea—taking you to <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> on songs. It's out there, and I think it's incredible." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{name change}} from Planet One to Planet 51 {{was a result}} of the demands made <b>from</b> <b>another</b> entity branded <b>Planet</b> One, which {{produces}} children and teen TV programmes. They made contact with the film's producers early on to resolve the trademark and brand confusion issues. The Spanish film company made an offer to Planet One for all ownership rights to their [...] "Planet One" [...] trademarks and related website URLs. Planet One chose not to take that offer and to protect their brand and trademarks that have been active for many years. As a result, the film's producers chose to rename the film Planet 51. This is a reference to the high top secret military base Area 51 where conspiracy theorists claim that data and specimens from a space alien landed on Earth in 1947 are stored.|$|R
500|$|After Applewhite's release, he and Nettles {{resolved}} to contact extraterrestrials and they sought like-minded followers. They published advertisements for meetings, where they recruited disciples, whom they called [...] "crew". At the events, they purported to represent beings <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet,</b> the Next Level, who sought participants for an experiment. They claimed {{that those who}} agreed {{to take part in}} the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level. He and Nettles referred to themselves as [...] "Guinea" [...] and [...] "Pig". Applewhite described his role as a [...] "lab instructor" [...] and served as the primary speaker, while Nettles occasionally interjected clarifying remarks or corrections. The two seldom personally spoke with attendees, only taking phone numbers with which they could contact them. They initially named their organization the Anonymous Sexaholics Celibate Church, but it soon became known as the Human Individual Metamorphosis.|$|E
500|$|... "Brother from Another Series" [...] is {{the sixteenth}} episode of The Simpsons eighth season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on February 23, 1997. Sideshow Bob is released from prison into the care of his brother Cecil and {{claims to be a}} changed man. However, Bart does not believe him and tries to find out what Bob is up to. It was the first episode directed by Pete Michels and was written by Ken Keeler. The episode guest stars Kelsey Grammer in his sixth appearance as Sideshow Bob and David Hyde Pierce as Cecil. The title is not only a pun on the movie The Brother <b>from</b> <b>Another</b> <b>Planet</b> (used for a previous episode as well), but also a reference to the fact that guest stars Kelsey Grammer (Frasier Crane) and David Hyde Pierce (Niles Crane) also played bickering brothers on the NBC sitcom Frasier.|$|E
500|$|Grant began {{restructuring}} {{the system of}} the O.T.O. by augmenting its grading structure with that of Crowley's other occult order, the A∴A∴. This attempt failed, as Grant's attentions were increasingly drawn into his founding and running of the New Isis Lodge. The lodge became operational in April 1955 when Grant issued a manifesto announcing his discovery of an extraterrestrial [...] "Sirius/Set current" [...] upon which the lodge was to be based. In this manifesto, Grant claimed that a new energy was emanating down from Earth <b>from</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> which he identified with Nuit, a goddess who appears in the first chapter of Crowley's Thelemic holy text, The Book of the Law. Germer however deemed it [...] "blasphemy" [...] that Grant had identified a single planet with Nuit; on 20 July 1955, Germer issued a [...] "Note of Expulsion" [...] expelling Grant from the O.T.O.|$|E
