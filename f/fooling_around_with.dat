25|$|Regarding human interaction, evil {{of oppression}} and abuse is {{a theme that}} is {{illustrated}} through Curley and Curley's wife. Curley uses his aggressive nature and superior position {{in an attempt to}} take control of his father's farm. He constantly reprimands the farm hands and accuses some of <b>fooling</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> his wife. Curley's Napoleon complex is evidenced by his threatening of the farm hands for minuscule incidents. Curley's wife, on the other hand, is not physically but verbally manipulative. She uses her sex appeal to gain some attention, flirting with the farm hands. According to the Penguin Teacher's Guide for Of Mice and Men, Curley and Curley's wife represent evil in that both oppress and abuse the migrants in different ways.|$|E

His family are struggling financially and resort to siphoning petrol from their car to run their back-up generator when the power grid fails. When the generator breaks down one night, Ali begins to wonder why he is fixing it against a backdrop of gunfire, instead of studying in peace.
