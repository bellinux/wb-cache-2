25|$|Self-forgiveness {{happens in}} {{situations}} where an individual <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> that they perceive to be morally wrong and they consider themselves {{to be responsible for}} the wrongdoing. Self-forgiveness is the overcoming of negative emotions that the wrongdoer associates with the wrongful action. Negative emotions associated with wrongful action can include guilt, regret, remorse, blame, shame, self-hatred and/or self-contempt.|$|E
25|$|The {{plots and}} subplots of the episodes are {{established}} in an outline written by David, and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors (a technique known as retroscripting). As with Seinfeld, which David co-created, {{the subject matter}} in Curb Your Enthusiasm often involves the minutiae of American daily social life, and plots often revolve around Larry David's many faux pas and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, {{as well as his}} annoyance with other people's behavior. The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which often leads him into awkward situations. He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe that he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> morally terrible or disgusting.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} novels, the only crime {{which he can}} be seen to commit might be illegal entry, when he and Paul Drake are searching for evidence. And even then, he would expect to put up a strong and {{effective}} defense leading to an acquittal. Hamilton Burger is constantly under the impression that Mason <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> illegal, but is never able to prove it. Gardner prefaced many of his later novels with tributes to coroners and forensic pathologists whose work was instrumental to solving cases. Gardner inserts his ideas about the importance of proper autopsies into many of his Mason novels. In The Case of the Fugitive Nurse, for instance, close scrutiny of dental records in the identification of burned bodies is a key point. In that same story, the possible use of additives to track illegal resale of medical narcotics is examined.|$|E
25|$|The Binou sect uses totems: common {{ones for}} the entire village and {{individual}} ones for totem priests. A totem animal is worshiped on a Binou altar. Totems are, for example, the buffalo for Ogol-du-Haut and the panther for Ogol-du-Bas. Normally, no one is harmed by their totem animal, even {{if this is a}} crocodile, as it is for the village of Amani (where there is a large pool of crocodiles that do not harm villagers). However, a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> wrong. A worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem. For example, an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat buffalo meat, allowed to use leather from its skin, nor even to see a buffalo die. If this happens by accident, he has to organise a purification sacrifice at the Binou altar. Boiled millet is offered, and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a Binou altar. This colours the altar white and red. Binou altars look like little houses with a door. They are bigger when the altar is for an entire village. A village altar has also the 'cloud hook', that will catch clouds and make it rain.|$|E

500|$|Goff's {{judgment}} {{made several}} significant and immediate {{changes to the}} law. First, {{it was the first}} decision which imposed a requirement of foreseeability of harm to cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher; [...] "it must be shown that the defendant <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> which he recognised, or judged by the standards appropriate at the relevant place or time, or ought reasonably to have recognised, as giving rise to an exceptionally high risk of danger or mischief if there should be an escape, however unlikely an escape may have been thought to be". Secondly, it was the first decision to state that Rylands may be a sub-set of nuisance, and as such applied the same requirement of foreseeability of harm to nuisance, where previously such a requirement had not existed.|$|E
500|$|According to Lopez, {{the song}} is about missing someone terribly; [...] "someone who is missing someone so much and <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> so wrong to the person that they know they can't fix it. So they just hate {{themselves}} right in that moment, they can't stand , they regret everything that they did and they wish they could change things." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted the chorus of [...] "Me Haces Falta" [...] to be self-loathing, with the lines: [...] "Tú me haces falta/Sí, me arrepiento/Me odio/Estoy desesperada" [...] (English: [...] "I miss you/Yes, I repent/I hate myself/I'm desperate"). Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly praised the song's lyrics, but dismissed the song's production, stating {{that it does not}} live up the song's [...] "florid, romance-novel lyrics".|$|E
500|$|This {{approach}} was also adopted in Comptroller of Income Tax v. ACC (2010). The Court of Appeal held it is trite law that a quashing order will not lie unless a public authority <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> that a court can quash or, in other words, deprive of legal effect. It observed that [...] "a decision need {{not in itself}} have a direct legal effect or consequence {{before it can be}} quashed. A decision which operates as a prerequisite to or a step in a process capable of altering rights, interests or liabilities may also be the subject of a quashing order." [...] The Court eventually concluded that, [...] "a quashing order will only lie against decisions which have some form of actual or ostensible legal effect, whether direct or indirect. A mere opinion clearly does not fall within this category." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Barting Over", which aired February 16, was {{promoted}} as the show's milestone 300th episode. However, [...] "The Strong Arms of the Ma" [...] was the 300th episode to be broadcast. According to Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star, [...] "It's {{very difficult to}} find a straight answer why milestone status has been bestowed on [...] Some rationalize that the 300 figure doesn't account for two early holiday specials, Fox maintains that there was some discrepancy between the original, scheduled broadcast date- {{deep in the heart of}} the ratings-mad February sweeps- and the number of episodes that were eventually aired leading up to it." [...] "Barting Over" [...] refers to the error when Marge tells Lisa [...] "I can't count the number of times (Homer) <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> crazy like this." [...] Lisa responds that it is 300, to which Marge replies that she [...] "could have sworn it's been 302".|$|E
500|$|Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", is {{typically}} uttered when he injures himself, {{realizes that he}} <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> stupid, or when something bad has happened or {{is about to happen}} to him. During the voice recording session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an [...] "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out [...] "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word [...] "Damn!" [...] Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered [...] "D'oh!" [...] The first intentional use of D'oh! occurred in the Ullman short [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (1989), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire".|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Stripped Intro", {{describes}} her musical changes as she sings, [...] "Sorry that I speak my mind/ Sorry don't do what I'm told". The follow-up [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] featuring Lil' Kim is an R and hip hop song which incorporates elements from dancehall toward its end. Lyrically, {{it talks about}} the theme of feminism, and was suggested that it is toward rapper Eminem and Fred Durst. The third track [...] "Walk Away" [...] is a piano ballad where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor to talk about an abusive relationship. It {{is followed by the}} fourth track and third single from Stripped, [...] "Fighter", which incorporates strong elements from rock and arena rock. It talks about a woman wants to thank a man who <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> wrong to her, and was inspired by Aguilera's unhappy childhood. It is followed-up by the interlude [...] "Primer Amor Interlude", the flamenco-inspired latin pop track [...] "Infatuation", and the interlude [...] "Loves Embrace Interlude", respectively.|$|E
