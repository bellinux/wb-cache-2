The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists working in the fields of plant systematics, taxonomy, and nomenclature. This is accomplished in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources, such as reference publications and journals.|$|E

5|$|The {{friendship}} between Byron and Giraud {{has become a}} topic of interest among scholars and biographers of Byron. Many believe that the pair's relationship was platonic, but correspondence between Byron and his friends has been used since the late 20th century {{to argue that the}} two were engaged in a love affair. The earliest claim of a sexual relationship between them comes from George Colman's poem Don Leon, in which Byron is the principal character and Giraud is portrayed as his liberator from the sexual prejudices in Britain. The poem is not biographical; <b>it</b> <b>promotes</b> Colman's own social and political views.|$|E
5|$|The poly(A) tail is {{important}} for the nuclear export, translation, and stability of mRNA. The tail is shortened over time, and, when it is short enough, the mRNA is enzymatically degraded. However, in a few cell types, mRNAs with short poly(A) tails are stored for later activation by re-polyadenylation in the cytosol. In contrast, when polyadenylation occurs in bacteria, <b>it</b> <b>promotes</b> RNA degradation. This is also sometimes the case for eukaryotic non-coding RNAs.|$|E
5|$|Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a {{relatively}} high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is paramagnetic at ambient conditions, it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly fluorescent complexes with various organic compounds, {{but there is no}} evidence of its incorporation into bacteria and archaea. When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where <b>it</b> <b>promotes</b> cancer.|$|E

5|$|To obtain enough protein, aphids need to suck {{large volumes}} of sap. The excess sugary fluid, honeydew, is {{secreted}} by the aphids. It adheres to plants where <b>it</b> <b>promotes</b> growth of sooty molds. These are unsightly, reduce the surface area of the plant available for photosynthesis and may reduce {{the value of the}} crop. These aphids are also the vectors of about thirty plant viruses, mostly of the nonpersistent variety. The aphids may not be the original source of infection but are instrumental in spreading the virus through the crop. Various chemical treatments are available to kill the aphids and organic growers can use a solution of soft soap.|$|E
5|$|While the {{mutagenic}} and genotoxic {{effects of}} TCDD are sometimes disputed and sometimes confirmed it does foster {{the development of}} cancer. Its main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion; <b>it</b> <b>promotes</b> the carcinogenicity initiated by other compounds. Very high doses may, in addition, cause cancer indirectly; one of the proposed mechanisms is oxidative stress and the subsequent oxygen damage to DNA. There are other explanations such as endocrine disruption or altered signal transduction. The endocrine disrupting activities seem {{to be dependent on}} life stage, being anti-estrogenic when estrogen is present (or in high concentration) in the body, and estrogenic in the absence of estrogen.|$|E
