5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania also share food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat {{even though they}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating {{with a man who}} possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may also benefit from her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E

25|$|The Green Sun Princes' {{disadvantage}} is {{that they}} are few in number; only 50 infernal essences are controlled by the Yozis, and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> the ability to corrupt further Solar Essences as the Deathlords can. On the other hand, the Infernals have the full resources of the demon realm at their disposal, along with numerous Yozi cults which already exist in creation. The Infernals are closely tied to their Yozi masters, and experience Urge, psychological motivations towards missions set by their patrons. Unlike Abyssals, Infernals rarely regret their state, and instead revel in their mission to overthrow the upstart gods and return creation to its original rulers. It is implied, however, that due to the inherently poor treatment by the Yozis (being unable to fully comprehend things outside of their domain and thus with little respect for anything else) and obvious insanity, the vast majority will grow dissatisfied and go rogue, using their link to Primordial power to mutate into new Titans themselves, not bound by the same shortness of vision they possess.|$|E

2500|$|Gaze following: Social animals {{coordinate}} their communication by monitoring of each other's head and eye orientation. Such behaviour {{has long been}} recognized as {{an important component of}} communication during human development, and gaze-following has recently received much attention in animals. Studies have been conducted on apes, monkeys, dogs, birds, and tortoises, and have focused on two different tasks: [...] "follow another’s gaze into distant space" [...] and [...] "follow another’s gaze geometrically around a visual barrier e.g. by repositioning themselves to follow a gaze cue when faced with a barrier blocking their view". The first ability has been found among a broad range of animals, while the second has been demonstrated only for apes, dogs, wolves, and corvids (ravens); attempts to demonstrate this [...] "geometric gaze following" [...] in marmoset and ibis gave negative results. [...] Researchers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> a clear picture of the cognitive basis of gaze following, but developmental evidence indicates that [...] "simple" [...] gaze following and [...] "geometric" [...] gaze following probably rely on different cognitive mechanisms.|$|E

[...] The competitor is judged on his or her ability to fit and present the halter horse to its best advantage. [...] The horse is taken through a short pattern where the horse and handler must set up the horse correctly at a standstill and exhibit full control while at a walk, jog, turning and in more advanced classes, pivoting and backing up. [...] Clothing of the handlers tend to parallel that of western pleasure competition. [...] Halters are leather ornamented with silver.
