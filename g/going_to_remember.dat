500|$|Andre Ethier, Russell Martin and Wilson Valdez {{managed to}} each earn three hits each during the Dodgers game. Ethier {{hit a home}} run which drove in the first four runs of the season for the Dodgers, who stole five bases — their most since August 23, 1999 when they stole seven in a game at Milwaukee. [...] "It's kind of cool to have a decent game on Jackie Robinson Day," [...] Martin said. [...] "I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> this {{probably}} {{for the rest of my}} life." [...] Randy Wolf, who was playing for the Dodgers at the time (currently a free agent) allowed six hits and three runs in six innings and struck out seven. [...] "The whole team wearing No. 42, it kind of goes sour if we don’t win," [...] Wolf said. [...] "It was great. There were a lot of special people here.

It's just more solid, more clear." [...] Q gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "Grunge may have died, but Pearl Jam it seems will never be slayed." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer Jon Pareles gave the album three out of five stars, feeling that the album [...] "comes across {{as part of an}} {{extended}} conversation among the five band members...and fans loyal enough to check in for Pearl Jam's latest musings on love, death and social responsibility." [...] The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars, stating that Pearl Jam [...] "are dignified, musicianly, sincere... and a teensy bit dull" [...] and observing that [...] "Vedder's affecting vocal angst drowns in a sea of pessimistic riffola." [...] The review called Binaural [...] "a warts-and-all album; it has grabbers, songs that sink in slowly and a few absolute duds." [...] At the 2001 Grammy Awards, [...] "Grievance" [...] received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. Regarding Binaural, Ament stated that [...] "we look back and think we didn't put some of the best songs on it", adding that [...] "I think there are some beautiful things that came out of it, but we're never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that record as one of the greats." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to authorizing torture, Stalin also signed 357 lists in 1937 and 1938 authorizing executions of some 40,000 people, and about 90% {{of these are}} confirmed to have been shot. While reviewing one such list, Stalin reportedly muttered {{to no one in}} particular: [...] "Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years time? No one. Who remembers the names now of the boyars Ivan the Terrible got rid of? No one." [...] Stalin's alleged remark may be compared with Hitler's famous admonition to his generals in 1939: [...] "Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave him}} her hand. [...] "I'll forgive you, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the harangue. I--rather liked it. It made me think. Strange to say, I {{like people who}} make me think." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment. [...] "First of all, I {{want to say}} I'm sorry I went by that day without {{answering}} your whistle. Merril had worked me up against you, and since I get a bonus on results, every dollar's worth of freight you picked up was so much out of my pocket. Still, you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that against me now. We both earn our bread at sea, {{and you have to}} stand by me." ...|$|E

Now you and I will drink our little toast." ...|$|E

60|$|EILEEN (assertively). Well, I know! You needn't waste pity on him. He'll be {{only too}} {{glad to get}} my letter. He's been anxious {{to be free of}} me ever since I was sent here, only he thought it wouldn't be decent to break it off himself while I was sick. He was afraid of what people would say about him when they found it out. So he's just {{gradually}} stopped writing and coming for visits, and waited for me to realise. And if I didn't, I know he'd have broken it off himself the first day I got home. I've kept persuading myself that, in spite of the way he's acted, he did love me {{as much as he could}} love anyone, and that it would hurt him if I---- But now I know that he never loved me, that he couldn't love anyone but himself. Oh, I don't hate him for it. He can't help being what he is. And all people seem to be--like that, mostly. I'm only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that he and I grew up together, and that he was kind to me then when he thought he liked me--and forget all the rest. (With agitated impatience.) Oh, Stephen, you know all this I've said about him. Why don't you admit it? You've read his letters.|$|E

5000|$|Dragan Antulov of rec.arts.movies.reviews gave {{two out of}} ten, stating [...] "Italian {{visual effects}} expert Carlo Rambaldi is always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>remembered</b> for various {{impressive}} bad guys he had helped create for films like King Kong or Alien. When he was executive producer for Decoy, Canadian 1995 action thriller, the result was something which was only bad and hardly the stuff he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>remembered</b> for. Cynics would say that Peter Weller and Robert Patrick seem like an excellent choice for the roles of mercenaries because they played killing machines in their best known films. Author of this review tends to agree with that, but their presence alone {{is not enough to}} save Decoy from well-deserved road to [...] "straight-to- video" [...] oblivion. Everything else is a complete mess - the plot is incoherent, the action scenes look terrible, so in the end Decoy sinks below the standards, which are lowest, even for B movies. The only thing that is relatively pleasing to the eye is the use of Saskatchewan locations but the viewers might do themselves a great service if they watch some documentary instead of this." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{we shall}} do awfully badly in Syracuse {{the last half}} of this week. And why? For one thing, because the show isn't a show at all at present. Why should people flock to pay for seats for what are {{practically}} dress-rehearsals of an unknown play? Half the principals have had to get up in their parts in two weeks, and they haven't had time to get anything out of them. They are groping for their lines all the time. The girls can't let themselves go in the numbers, because they are wondering if they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the steps. The show hasn't had time to click together yet. It's just ragged. Take a look at it in another two weeks! I know! I don't say musical comedy is a very lofty form of art, but still there's a certain amount of science about it. If you go in for it long enough, you learn the tricks, and take it from me that, if you have a good cast and some catchy numbers it's almost impossible not to have a success. We've got an excellent cast now, and the numbers are fine. I tell you--as I tried to tell Pilkington, only he wouldn't listen--that this show is all right. There's a fortune in it for somebody. But I suppose Pilkington is now sitting in the smoking-car of an east-bound train, trying to get the porter to accept his share in the piece instead of a tip!" ...|$|E

"In one way, it's not a {{very big}} thing we have done, boys," [...] he said; and Laura was quick to notice the {{significance}} of the fact, which was also characteristic of the country, that he counted himself as one of them. [...] "We've chopped a hole in the primeval forest, held back the river, and set up our mill. That's about all on the face of it, but there's rather more behind. It's another round with Nature, and we've got her down again. It's a thing you have to do west of the Rockies, or she'll crush the life out of you. There are folks in the Eastern cities who call her beneficent; but they don't quite understand what was laid on man in Eden long ago. Here he's up against flood and frost and snow. Well, I guess we've done about all we can, and now that I've paid my respects to the chopper and carpenter-gang, there's another man I want to mention. He took hold of the contract to put us up our dam, and kept hold through the blamedest kind of luck. There's hard grit in him and the boys he led, and the river couldn't wash it out of them. Well, when the big turbines are humming and the mill's grinding out money for all of you, I guess you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the boys who built the dam." ...|$|E

In mid-winter, Jean, {{once more in}} the family way, was turned out of doors by her family; and Burns had her received and cared for {{in the house of}} a friend. For he remained to the last imperfect in his character of Don Juan, and lacked the sinister courage to desert his victim. About the middle of February (1788), he had to tear himself from his Clarinda and make a journey into the south-west on business. Clarinda gave him two shirts for his little son. They were daily to meet in prayer at an appointed hour. Burns, too late for the post at Glasgow, sent her a letter by parcel that she might not have to wait. Clarinda on her part writes, this time with a beautiful simplicity: [...] "I think the streets look deserted-like since Monday; and there's a certain insipidity in good kind folks I once enjoyed not a little. Miss Wardrobe supped here on Monday. She once named you, which kept me from falling asleep. I drank your health in a glass of ale--as the lasses do at Hallowe'en--'in to mysel'.'"

This was kind at least; but hear his expressions: [...] "I have taken her a room; I have taken her to my arms; I have given her a mahogany bed; I have given her a guinea.... I swore her privately and solemnly never to attempt any claim on me as a husband, even though anybody should persuade her she had such a claim--which she has not, neither during my life nor after my death. She did all this like a good girl." [...] And then he took advantage of the situation. To Clarinda he wrote: [...] "I this morning called for a certain woman. I am disgusted with her; I cannot endure her"; and he accused her of [...] "tasteless insipidity, vulgarity of soul, and mercenary fawning." [...] This was already in March; by the thirteenth of that month he was back in Edinburgh. On the 17th, he wrote to Clarinda: [...] "Your hopes, your fears, your cares, my love, are mine; so don't mind them. I will take you in my hand through the dreary wilds of this world, and scare away the ravening bird or beast that would annoy you." [...] Again, on the 21st: [...] "Will you open, with satisfaction and delight, a letter from a man who loves you, who has loved you, and who will love you, to death, through death, and for ever?... How rich am I to have such a treasure as you!... 'The Lord God knoweth,' and, perhaps, 'Israel he shall know,' my love and your merit. Adieu, Clarinda!
