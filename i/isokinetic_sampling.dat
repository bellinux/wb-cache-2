40|$|Particulate matter (PM) {{concentrations}} in ambient air can be monitored by gravimetric sampling near a source using Federal Reference Method (FRM) samplers. PM is regulated by size, with PM 10, which {{is comprised of}} particles with aerodynamic equivalent diameters {{less than or equal}} to 10 ?m, being the main focus of this research. FRM PM 10 samplers exhibit sampling errors when sampling dusts with mass median diameters (MMDs) that are larger than the 10 ?m sampler cutpoint. For industries to be regulated equitably, these sampler errors must be quantified and understood. This research evaluates the performance of FRM PM 10 and low volume total suspended particulate (TSP) samplers under the controlled conditions of a wind tunnel. The performance evaluation was conducted by observing the sampler cutpoints, slopes, and measured concentrations. These measured values were compared to values obtained using a collocated <b>isokinetic</b> reference <b>sampler.</b> The results of this research indicate that PM 10 samplers do not operate as intended under all conditions. The cutpoint of the PM 10 inlets was significantly higher than the maximum FRM limit of 10. 5 ?m when sampling dust with MMDs larger than the cutpoint of the sampler. The slope values for the PM 10 inlets were significantly higher than the maximum FRM limit of 1. 6. MMDs and geometric standard deviations of PM collected by TSP samplers were significantly different than those of PM collected using the collocated <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler.</b> The concentrations measured by the TSP samplers were significantly higher than the collocated <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler.</b> The results of this research provide a better understanding of the performance of TSP and PM 10 samplers operating under different conditions and shows that these samplers are not operating as intended.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that EPA approved federal reference method (FRM) samplers can substantially misrepresent the fractions of particles being emitted from agricultural operations due to the relationship between the performance characteristics of these samplers and existing ambient conditions. Controlled testing in a wind tunnel is needed to obtain a clearer understanding and quantification of the performance shifts of these samplers under varying aerosol concentrations, wind speeds and dust types. In this study, sampler performance was tested in a controlled environment wind tunnel meeting EPA requirements for particulate matter (PM) sampler evaluation. The samplers evaluated included two low-volume PM 10 and Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) pre-separators. The masses and particle size distributions (PSDs) obtained from the filters of tested samplers were compared to those of a collocated <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler.</b> Sampler performance was documented using two parameters: cut-point (d_ 50) and slope. The cut-point is the particle diameter corresponding to 50 % collection efficiency of the pre-separator while the slope is the ratio of particle sizes corresponding to cumulative collection efficiencies of 84. 1 % and 50 % (d_ 84. 1 /d_ 50) or 50 % and 15. 9 % (d_ 50 /d_ 15. 9) or the square root of 84. 1 % and 15. 9 % (d_ 84. 1 /d_ 15. 9). The test variables included three levels of wind speeds (2 -, 8 -, and 24 -km/h), five aerosol concentrations varying from 150 to 1, 500 mu g/m 3 and three aerosols with different PSDs (ultrafine Arizona Road Dust (ARD), fine ARD and cornstarch). No differences were detected between the performance of the flat and louvered FRM PM 10 samplers (a = 0. 05). The mean cut-point of both the PM 10 samplers was 12. 23 mu m while the mean slope was 2. 46. The mean cut-point and slope values were statistically different from the upper limit of EPA-specified performance criteria of 10. 5 mu m for the cut-point and 1. 6 for the slope. The PM 10 samplers over-sampled cornstarch but under-sampled ultrafine and fine ARD. The performance of the dome-top TSP sampler was close to the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler,</b> and thus it {{can be used as a}} reference sampler in field sampling campaigns to determine true PM concentrations. There were large variations in the performance of the cone-top TSP samplers as compared to the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler.</b> Dust type and wind speed along with their interaction had an impact on sampler performance. Cut-points of PM 10 samplers were found to increase with increasing wind speeds.

We present a design for a stacked vertical trap that has been modelled (computational fluid dynamics, CFD) and evaluated {{in the field and}} in the wind tunnel. The ‘swinging’ trap orients to within 10 ° of the flow in the wind tunnel at 8  m s− 1, and more rapidly in the field, where natural variability in wind direction accelerates orientation. The CFD analysis indicates flow is steered into the trap during incident wind flow. The trap has a low profile and there is only a small decrease in mass flow rate for multiple traps, poles and rows of poles. The efficiency of the trap was evaluated against an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler</b> and found to be greater than 95 %. The centre pole is a key element of the design, minimally decreasing trap efficiency. Finally, field comparisons with the trap of Sherman et al.

The samplers were: the Big Spring Number Eight (BSNE) sampler, the Modified Wilson and Cooke (MWAC) sampler, the Suspended Sediment Trap (SUSTRA), the Pellet catcher (POLCA), and the saltiphone. In the wind tunnel, the samplers were calibrated against an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler</b> (a modified Sartorius SM 16711 sampler with adjustable flow rate), and this for three sand types (median diameter: 132, 194 and 287 mum) and live wind speeds (ranging from 6. 6 to 14. 4 m s(- 1)). In the field, seven calibration tests {{of two weeks}} each were conducted. The absolute efficiencies of the BSNE, MWAC and POLCA {{are more or less}} comparable and vary between 70 % and 120 %, depending on sediment size and wind speed. For the SUSTRA, the efficiency is somewhat lower for fine sands and for wind speeds above 11 m s(- 1). Finally, the saltiphone can accurately detect the periods of saltation transport, but in its current version, the instrument is not accurate when measuring the absolute saltation flux. The most recommendable sampler in the test is the MWAC, not only because of its high efficiency, but also because its efficiency is independent of wind speed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Airborne {{coal dust}} {{generated}} during mining can deposit and accumulate on mine surfaces, presenting a dust explosion hazard. When assessing dust hazard mitigation strategies for airborne dust reduction, sampling {{is done in}} high-velocity ventilation air, {{which is used to}} purge the mining face and gallery tunnel. In this environment, the sampler inlet velocity should be matched to the air stream velocity (<b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling)</b> to prevent oversampling of coarse dust at low sampler-to-air velocity ratios. Low velocity ratios are often encountered when using low flow rate, personal sampling pumps commonly used in underground mines. In this study, with a goal of employing mine-ready equipment, a personal sampler was adapted for area sampling of coarse coal dust in high-velocity ventilation air. This was done by adapting an isokinetic nozzle to the inlet of an Institute of Occupational Medicine (Edinburgh, Scotland) sampling cassette (IOM). Collected dust masses were compared for the modified IOM isokinetic sampler (IOM-MOD), the IOM without the isokinetic nozzle, and a conventional dust sampling cassette without the cyclone on the inlet. All samplers were operated at a flow rate typical of personal sampling pumps: 2 L/min. To ensure differences between collected masses that could be attributed to sampler design and were not influenced by artifacts from dust concentration gradients, relatively uniform and repeatable dust concentrations were demonstrated in the sampling zone of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health experimental mine gallery. Consistent with isokinetic theory, greater differences between isokinetic and non-isokinetic sampled masses were found for larger dust volume-size distributions and higher ventilation air velocities. Since <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> is conventionally used to determine total dust concentration, and <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> made a difference in collected masses, the results suggest when sampling for coarse coal dust the IOM-MOD may improve airborne coarse dust assessments over "off-the-shelf" sampling cassettes.

40|$|This project {{provides}} a first exploration {{into the relationship}} between suspended sediment concentrations and water discharge within Big Creek as its tributaries. The results from our research provide insight into two fundamental questions: (1) Are the concentrations of sediment observed in tributaries and mainstem streams proportional {{to the size of}} their drainage basin? (2) Do sediment concentrations increase systematically with discharge do concentrations fall off earlier than flood flows? During the summer of 2008, water samples were collected from Big Creek at the Taylor Ranch Bridge as well as from 11 tributaries to Big Creek (Cliff Creek, Dunce Creek, Goat Creek, Pioneer Creek, Cave Creek, Cabin Creek, Cow Creek, Canyon Creek, Monumental Creek, Cougar Creek, and Rush Creek). Water samples were collected using three different techniques: (1) an automated pump sampler that made frequent collections from Big Creek, (2) a tethered, hand-held <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler</b> that collected depth and width integrated samples off the Taylor Ranch bridge, and (3) a rod-mounted <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler</b> that was used in tributaries where the streams could be safely waded across. Our results suggest that larger streams carry disproportionately higher sediment loads than the smaller streams. A suitable explanation for this observation is that as drainage basins increase in size, the probability of a high sediment supply point source (such as a landslide or weak lithologic unit) increases. For example, Big Creek carries more sediment than other channels because it includes tributaries such as Monumental or Crooked Creeks that have characteristically higher sediment loads. Over a three month sampling period the average sediment concentration for Big Creek was. 916 mg/L, as compared to a smaller tributary, such as Cliff Creek that has a sediment concentration value of. 445 mg/L (difference in drainage area between the two stated streams is 1425. 34 km 2). Our results also suggest that sediment fluxes remain high during flood events such as spring runoff or summer thunderstorms. In most landscapes, the sediment concentration increases during the rising limb of the flood, but all readily available material is typically exhausted before the high flows decrease. In Big Creek and many of the tributaries, the sediment supply appears inexhaustible. This could be due to high sediment yields from the extensively burned landscape, or from the mining of sediment from abundant floodplain cut banks. Further work can strengthen these findings by concentrating on a smaller number of tributary streams so that a higher temporal frequency of data can be collected. This will be useful in measuring stream health, water quality, and the effect on riparian and aquatic ecosystems. Also, future work should examine the how the proportion of organic sediment to inorganic sediment varies both in time and from one tributary to the next. Though our study aimed to explore how fire influences sediment production, there too many uncertainties in these mechanisms to confidently attribute differences flux to fire history...|$|R
40|$|The National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) was {{established}} and revised to regulate PM 10 (particles {{less than or}} equal to 10 ?m in aerodynamic diameter), as these small particles were found to penetrate and deposit in human respiratory tract, causing adverse health effects. The FRM and FEM sampler designated by the USEPA to monitor PM 10 and Total Suspended Particles (TSP) mass concentration require either expensive equipment or tedious tests. In many cases, a faster and easier measurement is desired. The goal of this study was to test the applicability of a handheld particle monitor (Aerocet 831, Met One Instruments, Grants Pass, OR) for monitoring PM 10 and TSP in the ambient air. This monitor is capable of measuring PM 10 and TSP mass concentration in just one minute. To achieve this goal, monodisperse solid ammonium fluorescein aerosols of aerodynamic diameter 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, and 17 ?m were generated and introduced into wind tunnel at speed of 2, 8 and 24 km/h. The Aerocet 831 and an <b>isokinetic</b> (reference) air <b>sampler</b> were co-located in the wind tunnel to monitor and collect aerosols simultaneously. Separate tests were performed to find out a mathematical correlation equation between fluorescence intensity unit (FIU) and a wide range of fluorescein particle mass (0 - 240 ?g).

The Aerocet 831 is suggested having good performance for monitoring PM 10 at wind speed of 2 km/h, however its applicability for measuring PM 10 at 8 and 24 km/h is limited due to the oversampling at small particle sizes.

40|$|The HALO Submicrometer Aerosol Inlet (HASI) was {{specifically}} designed for HALO with the aim to provide up to 30 l/min sample air flow (divided over four forward facing sample lines) to aerosol instruments mounted inside the aircraft cabin. HASI samples the air {{on the top of}} the fuselage outside of the aircraft boundary layer. The air stream is aligned in the inlet and deaccelerated in three stages by roughly a factor of 40 using a front shroud, a main diffusor and smaller diffusers at the tips of four sample tubes which protrude into the deaccelerated air stream. In addition, there is a backward-facing sample tube installed for optional use. The design concept is to allow regulating the sample air flow in each of the four forward-facing sample lines to achieve <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> conditions according to the actual speed of the aircraft. Pumps and bypass lines for regulation of the air flow are part of the Aerosol Measurement System (AMETYST) cabin rack on HALO operated by DLR. The geometric design of the inlet should prevent large cloud droplets and ice crystals from entering the sample lines directly. Judging from the first measurements of different instruments using HASI during the ML-CIRRUS and ACRIDICON-CHUVA missions with HALO, it appears that condensation particle counter (CPC) measurements of interstitial aerosol in liquid clouds are affected by artefacts while in ice clouds there is no indication of any measurement problem.

The most efficient samplers are the MWAC and the SIERRA, followed by the BSNE and the SUSTRA. The WDFG is more effective than the BSNE at velocities below 3 m s(- 1), but its efficiency drops quickly at higher wind speeds. The most recommendable sampler for field measurements is the BSNE, because its efficiency varies only very slightly with wind speed. In the absence of horizontal flux samplers, the MDCO collector can be used as an alternative to assess horizontal dust flux and airborne dust concentration provided the appropriate calibrations are made.

40|$|This method {{describes}} {{the collection of}} hydrogen chloride (HCl, CAS Registry Number 7647 - 01 - 0) and chlorine (Cl 2, CAS Registry Number 7782 - 50 - 5) in stack gas emission samples from hazardous waste incinerators and municipal waste combustors. The collected samples are analyzed using Method 9057. This method is designed to collect HCl/Cl in their gaseous forms. Use of this method 2 {{is limited to the}} sampling of relatively dry, particulate-free gas streams. Sources, such as those controlled by wet scrubbers, that emit acid particulate matter (e. g., HCl dissolved in water droplets) must be <b>sampled</b> using an <b>isokinetic</b> HCl/Cl <b>sampling</b> train (see Method 0050). This method has 2 potential for collection of all halogens and halogen acids, but has not been fully evaluated for that use. For analytical determination of additional halides, Method 9056 is used rather than Metho...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Fine-grained {{sediment}} is {{an important}} pollutant in streams and estuaries, including the Chesapeake Bay in the USA. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the sources of fine-grained sediment using the sediment fingerprinting approach in the Linganore Creek watershed, a tributary to the Chesapeake Bay. Materials and methods The sediment fingerprinting approach was used in the agricultural and forested, 147 -km 2 Linganore Creekwatershed,Maryland from 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2010 to determine the relative percentage contribution from different potential sources of fine-grained sediment. Fine-grained suspended sediment samples (< 63 μm) were collected during storm events in Linganore Creek using an automatic <b>sampler</b> and manual <b>isokinetic</b> samplers.

40|$|Particulate {{emission}} sampling in stacks or ducts with cyclonic {{flow patterns}} presents significant problems in obtaining representative measurements of concentrations and flow rates. Difficulties also arise {{in establishing the}} correct velocity for determining the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> rate. Sections 2. 4 and 2. 5 of Method 1 describe procedures for verifying the absence of cyclonic or other flow patterns not parallel to the stack or duct axis. These sections also specify limits of acceptability for the angles of flow using the described procedures. The purpose of this guideline is to determine options for consider when the acceptable limits of angular or cyclonic flow are exceeded. Following are three options and recommendations for each for addressing the measurement of particulate emissions when cyclonic or nonparallel flow patterns exist. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Find another location. In many situations, sampling can be conducted downstream of the origina...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{diffraction}} {{offers a}} fundamentally superior basis for measuring suspended particles as it, unlike older and simpler optical or acoustic methods, does not suffer {{a change in}} calibration with changing sediment color, composition, or size. The diffraction based LISST series instruments have, in this manner, opened new scientific vistas into particle dynamics, their settling velocities measured in-situ, {{and to a lesser}} extent, floc dynamics. The first new system, the LISST-SL, employing <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> is now in development for the needs of the USGS. Current frontiers in research deal with particle shape effects. New data firmly point to the need for distinguishing spheres from natural, random shapes. The second new system delivers suspended sediment concentration and a true mean size (vs. Sauter Mean Diameter provided by LISST- 25 ’s). This results from newly invented shapes of comet detectors...|$|E
40|$|The IAPWS Working Group Power Cycle Chemistry has {{examined}} the published work {{in the area of}} sampling insoluble impurities in water and steam, especially of metals and their oxides. Representative samples of such species are essential for the control of corrosion product transport in nuclear and fossil-fired power plants. IAPWS recognizes that there is a requirement for work to be pursued in this field and has prepared this document to assist potential investigators in obtaining sponsorship. Specifically, requirements for <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling,</b> conditions governing the deposition of particles in sample lines, the influence of the corrosion film on the sample line surfaces, and precipitation of soluble corrosion products should be researched. Although encouraging this work, IAPWS is not able under its statutes to provide financial support. The IAPWS contact can provide any further development information and will act as a liaison between research groups...|$|E
40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} concentrations and emission rates of particulate matter (PM) from mechanically ventilated livestock buildings were evaluated {{in a laboratory}} facility and in a swine-finishing barn. Concentrations of PM were measured inside the room (room sam-pling) and at the exhaust duct (exhaust sam-pling). Concentrations at the exhaust duct were determined using high-volume traverse downstream of the exhaust fan, low-volume traverse downstream of the fan, and fixed sampling upstream and downstream of the fan. The traverse methods, which served as the reference, were conducted under <b>isokinetic</b> conditions; fixed <b>sampling</b> was done under both isokinetic and sub-isokinetic conditions. Compared to the traverse method, both room sampling and exhaust sampling under sub-isokinetic conditions overestimated PM con-centrations. Fixed <b>sampling</b> under <b>isokinetic</b> conditions, on the other hand, {{did not differ significantly}} (P> 0. 05) from the high-volume traverse method. Thus, isokinetic fixed sam-pling can be an alternative to the more expen-sive and time-consuming high-volume PM traverse method to measure PM concentra-tions and emission rates at the exhaust...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{relating to}} the reflood phase of a Large Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LB-LOCA) in Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR). Three related types of experiment have been carried in this context, namely studies of particle motion in an annulus geometry simulating drop motion in a ballooned fuel element, studies of single phase flow in a 3 × 3 tube bundle simulating a ballooned fuel element and studies of reflooding of a hot tube {{in which it was}} possible to photograph the region above the rewetting front using axial view photography. In the particle tracking studies, Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) was used to determine typical particle tracks in an annulus test section in which the inner surface was ballooned to simulate the clad ballooning likely to occur during the reflood phase of an LB-LOCA. Excellent agreement was obtained between the measured particle tracks and ones calculated using the STAR-CD CFD code. The second set of experiments focussed on investigating the effect of pin ballooning on the vapour flow. An idealised, simulated PWR bundle containing a 3 × 3 rod arrangement with a central ballooned pin was designed and constructed and, using a novel <b>isokinetic</b> probe <b>sampling</b> technique, the axial deviation in mass flow of an outer sub-channel was measured. Again, good agreement was obtained between the flows measured and those calculated from the STAR-CD code. To further elucidate the rewetting process itself and the behaviour of the associated two-phase flow, an axial-viewing reflood (AVR) rig has been designed and constructed. Within this facility, experiments have been carried out to examine the thermal-hydraulic effects occurring during bottom-up reflooding of a single hot tube. A high-speed high-temperature axial viewing technique has been developed and applied to observe the quench front, and any precursory droplet production, deposition and entrainment ahead of the propagating quench front.

40|$|The {{problem of}} an {{adequate}} sampling from slurry handling equipment {{is present in}} many branches of the chemical and related industries. It is often very important to know the solid concentration and the particle size distribution in the apparatus of this kind, {{in order to control}} and operate them. For this purpose, wall sampling is widely adopted in industrial practice for its simplicity and versatility. Serious errors in measuring solids concentration can arise from unsuitable sampling. This work reports the main factors that may cause these deviations from ideal wall sampling during work with slurry handling equipment. Up to now, some authors have thoroughly studied the problem of <b>isokinetic</b> and anisokinetic <b>sampling</b> from slurry pipelines, both theoretically and experimentally. However, little work was dedicated to the withdrawal of solid suspensions from stirred vessels. The main sources of sampling errors occur because of particle inertia, particle bouncing effects and flow structure ahead of the sampling device. The results of experimental work of different authors indicate that the solid concentration in the sample, i. e. sampling efficiency, depends strongly on the sample tube design, withdrawal velocity and sampling device location as well...|$|R
