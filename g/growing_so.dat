5|$|The boys take Marvin to an all-you-can-eat buffet, {{where he}} is shocked by how much food the townsfolk consume {{compared}} to his home country, and by how wasteful Cartman is with his food. Back at school, Mr. Garrison announces the food drive is a failure because students have brought {{in only a few}} cans of creamed corn. The boys present Marvin to the class during show and tell, after which Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria tell the boys they will have to call Red Cross and send Marvin home. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephisto shows Chef that the turkey DNA is <b>growing</b> <b>so</b> rapidly that the turkeys might take over the world if they are not stopped.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that the}} findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were <b>growing</b> <b>so</b> fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E

25|$|By this time, {{gossip about}} Caroline was everywhere. Lord Byron {{wrote to his}} {{publisher}} that Caroline and Pergami were lovers, and Baron Friedrich Ompteda, a Hanoverian spy, bribed one of Caroline's servants {{so that he could}} search her bedroom for proof of adultery. He found none. By August 1817, Caroline's debts were <b>growing,</b> <b>so</b> she sold Villa d'Este and moved to the smaller Villa Caprile near Pesaro. Pergami's mother, brother and daughter, but not his wife, joined Caroline's household.|$|E
25|$|During {{his second}} term {{as head of the}} {{government}} he courted the left and labour unions with social legislation, including subsidies for low-income housing, preferential government contracts for worker cooperatives, and old age and disability pensions. Giolitti tried to sign an alliance with the Italian Socialist Party, which was <b>growing</b> <b>so</b> fast in the popular vote, and became a friend of the Socialist leader Filippo Turati. Giolitti would have likes to have Turati as minister in his cabinets, but the Socialist leader always refused, due to the opposition of the left-wing of his party.|$|E
25|$|A {{parasitoid}} {{sooner or}} later kills its prey, so this form of parasitism is close to predation. Idiobiont parasitoid wasps sting their prey on capture, either killing them outright or paralyzing them immediately. The prey is then carried to a nest, an egg is laid on or in it, and the parasitoid develops rapidly. Koinobiont parasitoid wasps lay their eggs in young hosts, usually larvae, which are allowed to go on <b>growing,</b> <b>so</b> the host and parasitoid develop together for an extended period. Some koinobionts regulate their host's development hormonally, for example preventing it from pupating or making it moult whenever the parasitoid is ready to moult.|$|E

Edward Failing, who in 1857 when he was sixteen had first started to work at H.W. Corbett and Co {{when he had finished}} school, and M.B. Millard. Each became a sixth interest partner in H.W. Corbett and Co. Edward had been only ten when he first came out to Portland with his father Josiah Failing and older brother Henry Failing, who was then seventeen and later became Corbett’s brother-in-law. By September 1867 H.W. Corbett & Co. had its own office in New York City and was no longer employing an agent.|$|E
25|$|The Redwood and Potter Valleys {{face each}} other on the west and east, respectively, just north of Lake Mendocino in the far {{northern}} reaches of Mendocino County. The areas include heavily wooden terrain with the name Redwood Valley coming from the legends of redwood trees <b>growing</b> <b>so</b> densely packed that they blotted out the sky. In the southern reaches of Redwood Valley is the Ricetti bench, a fluvial terrace the features crimson red soil, where Mendocino County's first vineyards were planted in the 1850s. Today the Redwood Valley is known for its peppery, spicy Zinfandels. The Redwood Valley is slightly cooler than the vineyard plantings to the south towards Ukiah, allowing the area to produce wines with more acidity and deeper color. Many of the grapes grown in the Potter Valley AVA are blended and sold under the more widely recognizable Mendocino AVA. In the 21st century, Potter Valley has developed a reputation for white grape varieties such as Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc as well as Pinot noir from its pockets of cooler microclimates.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{wind tunnel}} testing by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics {{revealed}} longitudinal instability and stabilizer skin buckling at high speeds. The {{weight of the}} aircraft, a great concern given the low thrust of early turbojets, was <b>growing</b> <b>so</b> quickly that the USAAF had to set a gross weight limit of 13,400lb (6,080kg).

[...] This government executed a number of citizens and deprived all but a few of their rights, eventually <b>growing</b> <b>so</b> extreme that even the moderate oligarch Theramenes fell afoul of the government and was executed. [...] Fearing for their lives, numerous Athenians fled to Thebes.|$|E
500|$|The drug {{addiction}} of Towelie, {{a living and}} talking towel, is <b>growing</b> <b>so</b> overwhelming that the South Park boys make attempts to help him. Towelie's history is shown, using head interviews and on-screen captions (in a parody of Intervention), starting with years of {{drug addiction}} to cannabis, crystal meth, heroin and crack. He previously had a girlfriend named Rebecca and conceived a child with her (a washcloth), but he {{was kicked out of}} their home due to his persistently getting high. Having run out of money for hard drugs, Towelie starts getting high off of cans of computer duster. His life continued in a downward spiral, leaving him in heavy debt and offering oral sex to strangers for money in the alleys. The boys help him get a job at Lake Tardicaca, a summer camp for kids with physical and mental disabilities, as a towel to dry off the campers. However, Towelie persists in drug use and fellating strangers in the supply closet, and is fired by the camp. The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself (except for Cartman, who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of thousands of pages of anti-Semitic remarks on television, which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the [...] "no interruptions" [...] rule). Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie's child, [...] "Washcloth", which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California. Later, Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son.|$|E

2500|$|In 1835, {{to keep up}} with demand, a {{steam engine}} was placed in the lower floors to keep up {{production}} when the wind wasn't blowing. However, this only partly rectified the situation, as when the mainline railway arrived in 1837, flour production could not keep up with local demand - Stafford was <b>growing</b> <b>so</b> quickly, and with new rail links, it was possible to bring in cheap flour, which meant the mill could not compete. Furthermore, due to the demand for finer, white flour which could not be produced at the Broad Eye Windmill, by 1896, the mill reached the end of its life in its intended form, and in the following year, in 1897, the sails and winding gear were removed.|$|E
2500|$|On Monday 8 January, Pye Records {{issued a}} 45 rpm single {{of the song}} [...] "I'm Backing Britain" [...] {{supporting}} the campaign. Written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, and sung by Bruce Forsyth, the chorus included [...] "The feeling is <b>growing,</b> <b>so</b> let's keep it going, the good times are blowing our way". All involved in making the single took cuts in their fees or royalties so that the single sold for 5 shillings instead of the going rate of 7s d. Forsyth happily endorsed the campaign: [...] "The country has always done its best when it is up against the wall. If everyone realises what we are up against {{we can get out}} of trouble easily." [...] However, the song did not make the charts; it sold only 7319 copies.|$|E
2500|$|In French sources, such {{as those}} {{carefully}} picked over and then given in English by the well-sourced and best-selling Belloc translation of 1903, it is stated that a thick bramble briar grows out of Tristan's grave, <b>growing</b> <b>so</b> much that it forms a bower and roots itself into Iseult's grave. It goes on that King Mark tries to have the branches cut three separate times, and each time the branches grow back and intertwine. [...] This behaviour of briars {{would have been very}} familiar to medieval people who worked on the land. Later tellings sweeten this aspect of the story, by having Tristan's grave grow a briar, but Iseult's grave grow a rose tree, which then intertwine with each other. Further tellings refine this aspect even more, with the two plants being said to have been hazel and honeysuckle.|$|E
