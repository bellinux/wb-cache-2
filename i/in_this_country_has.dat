25|$|In {{a fitting}} {{tribute to the}} legacy of Clerk, other West Indian missionaries and the Basel Mission, the British Governor of the Gold Coast during World War I, Frederick Gordon Guggisberg, reacted to the {{expulsion}} of Basel Mission as alien security risk from the Gold Coast by lamenting that, the forced departure was “the greatest blow which education <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> ever suffered;” describing their work as the “first and foremost as regards quality of education and character training” – {{a testament to the}} mission’s approach of combining academic study with practical training for life. While propagation of the Gospel was the main objective of the West Indians and the Basel Mission, the domestic socioeconomic and dire educational environment motivated them to establish the first formal schools and colleges in the country, open to pupils from all walks of life. Moreover, the missionaries provided alternative sources of employment to rural inhabitants through the establishment of mechanized agriculture and commerce-driven small-scale industries such as construction and craftsmanship including printing, tile manufacturing and weaving in order to create self-sufficiency among the natives.|$|E

The composer's more avowedly serious music was less widely esteemed by his compatriots. In a 1928 profile the magazine The British Musician commented, [...] "There {{is no need to}} explain here why his serious music, whether written thirty years ago or as recently as 1927... has not won the popularity of, say, Edward German's dances: it is pleasant music, delightfully scored; but it is not so fascinating as that from which it derives—the music of the Viennese writers of dance music, of Délibes and Gounod and the like."

500|$|The news of Ferrier's death {{came as a}} {{considerable}} shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary. The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death approached, maintained that [...] "no singer <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> ever been more deeply loved, {{as much for the}} person she was as for the voice she uttered". Her death, he continued, [...] "quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation" [...] (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of Granta, believed that she [...] "may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen." [...] Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: [...] "The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler—in that order." [...] Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, [...] "have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague." [...] At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier's voice: [...] "She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world." ...|$|E

Since student protests began on Feb. 4, more than 1,500 protesters have been detained, more than 30 have been killed, and more than 50 people have reported that they were tortured while in police custody,” thus exposing “the depth of this government's criminalization of dissent.” ...|$|E

This trip, described in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (and later in Kesey's unproduced screenplay, The Further Inquiry) was the group's attempt to create art out of everyday life, and to experience roadway America while high on LSD. In an interview after arriving in New York, Kesey is quoted as saying, [...] "The sense of communication <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> damn near atrophied. But we found as we went along it got easier to make contact with people. If people could just understand it is possible to be different without being a threat."

[...] After returning from a tour of overseas bases, the Regimental Hostess at one camp wrote to Jolson, [...] "Allow me to say {{on behalf of all}} the soldiers of the 33rd Infantry that you coming here is quite the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to us, and we think you're tops, not only as a performer, but as a person.

6000|$|... 4. I {{have very}} {{little doubt that the}} value of paper <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> already risen, norwithstanding the {{increased}} issues of the Bank. These increased issues I attribute chiefly to the great failures which have taken place among country banks, and the very great purchases which have been made for the continental markets, and, under these circumstances, increased issues might take place, accompanied even by a rise of value. But the currency has not yet recovered itself. The real exchange, during the last year, must have been greatly in our favour, although the nominal exchange is considerably against us. This shews, incontrovertibly, that our currency is still depreciated, in reference to the bullion currencies of the continent. A part, however, of this depreciation may still be owing to the value of bullion in Europe not having yet fallen to its former level.|$|E
60|$|But I go farther. The Old-Age Pensions Act, so {{far from}} being in {{conflict}} with a scheme of contributory insurance, is really its most helpful and potent ally. The fact that at seventy the State pension is assured {{to all those who}} need it, makes a tremendous difference to every form of insurance confined to the years before seventy, whether for old age or for invalidity. I asked an eminent actuary the other day to make me some calculations. They are rough, general calculations, and no doubt they might be more exact. But roughly, I believe it to be no exaggeration to say that the rates to cover a man till seventy are in many cases scarcely half what they would be, if they had to cover him till death. Do you see what that means? It is a prodigious fact. It is the sort of fact by the discovery of which people make gigantic fortunes; and I suggest to you that we should make this gigantic fortune for John Bull. It means that the whole field of insurance has become much more fruitful than it ever was before, that there is a new class of insurance business possible which never was possible before. It means that the whole field of insurance is far more open to the poorest class of people than it was before, and that with a proper system the benefits of the Old-Age Pensions Act would not be confined to the actual pensioners who are drawing their money, but would extend forwards in anticipation to all other classes and to all other people, and that so far as five shillings a week is concerned--that is not much unless you have not got it--the actuarial position of every man and woman <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> been enormously improved by the Old-Age Pensions Act.|$|E

And such were the hopes of those who had intentions against the estates of others. Gunga Govind Sing, therefore, being pressed to the wall by this declaration of the Rajah's relation, when he could say nothing against it, when it was clear and manifest, and there were only impudent barefaced denials, and asseverations against facts which carried truth with themselves, did not in his answer pretend to say that a zemindary might be parted without the consent of the government, that a minor might be deprived of it, that the next relation had a power of disposing of it. He did indeed say, but nobody believed him, that he had used no force upon this relation; but as every one knew the act would be void, he was driven to Mr. Hastings's great refuge,--he was driven to say, [...] "The government <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> arbitrary power; the power of government is everything, the right of the subject nothing; they have at all times separated zemindaries from their lawful proprietors.
