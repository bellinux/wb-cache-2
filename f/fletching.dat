5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} uses, birds have been hunted for food since Palaeolithic times. They have been captured and bred as poultry to provide meat and eggs {{since at least the}} time of Ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with cormorant fishing and the use of honeyguides. Feathers have long been used for bedding, as well as for quill pens and for <b>fletching</b> arrows.|$|E
5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the <b>fletching</b> of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E

25|$|Bird {{feathers}} {{have long}} been used for <b>fletching</b> arrows. Colorful feathers such as those belonging to pheasants {{have been used to}} decorate fishing lures.|$|E
25|$|Fletchings {{are found}} {{at the back of}} the arrow and act as {{airfoils}} to provide a small amount of force used to stabilize the flight of the arrow. They are designed to keep the arrow pointed in the direction of travel by strongly damping down any tendency to pitch or yaw. Some cultures, for example most in New Guinea, did not use <b>fletching</b> on their arrows. Also, arrows without <b>fletching</b> (called bare shaft) are used for training purposes, because they make certain errors by the archer more visible.|$|E
25|$|The ghost floats, footless {{and with}} arms bent {{up at the}} elbows as is {{customary}} for ghost images of the period, in flames above a grassy field. Her head is framed by pine boughs. She stares off to the right, her gaze following her outstretched right arm. Covering {{the palm of her}} right hand is a blue cloth on top of which rests a rolled up kakemono or makimono scroll. In her left hand she grasps a red cloth—possibly a furoshiki—which is tied up as a round, flat parcel.

25|$|Some skills, such as woodcutting and fishing, {{enable the}} player to collect raw {{materials}} {{that can be}} processed into usable items for other skills, such as <b>fletching</b> and cooking respectively.

Other skills allow players to kill certain NPCs, build their own houses, move around the map with greater ease, steal from various NPCs, market stalls and chests located in-game, light fires, cook their own food, create their own potions, craft runestones and weapons, plant their own plants, hunt NPC animals, raid dungeons, and summon familiars to assist in combat and training skills.|$|E
2500|$|Fletchings are {{traditionally}} made from feathers (often from a goose or turkey) {{bound to the}} arrow's shaft, but are now often made of plastic (known as [...] "vanes"). Historically, some arrows used for the proofing of armour used copper vanes. Flight archers may use razor blades for <b>fletching,</b> {{in order to reduce}} air resistance. With conventional three-feather <b>fletching,</b> one feather, called the [...] "cock" [...] feather, is at a right angle to the nock, and is normally nocked so that it will not contact the bow when the arrow is shot. Four-feather <b>fletching</b> is usually symmetrical and there is no preferred orientation for the nock; this makes nocking the arrow slightly easier.|$|E
2500|$|A flu-flu {{is a form}} of <b>fletching,</b> {{normally}} made {{by using}} long sections of full length feathers taken from a turkey, in most cases six or more sections are used rather than the traditional three. Alternatively two long feathers can be spiraled around the end of the arrow shaft. The extra <b>fletching</b> generates more drag and slows the arrow down rapidly after a short distance, about 30 m or so [...]|$|E
5000|$|CEO Guy Self (John Michie) gave <b>Fletch</b> {{a job as}} {{the ward}} manager of the AAU ward. Director of nursing Colette Sheward (Louise Delamere) was shocked to find <b>Fletch</b> as he is her ex-fiance. <b>Fletch</b> is keen to impress Colette and {{introduces}} {{a new way of}} management, however Colette is less than impressed by an agency nurse (Helen Flanagan) that <b>Fletch</b> has hired, believing he has done so based on her looks rather than her qualifications. <b>Fletch</b> begins a friendship with registrar Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden) and helps him move on from his wife's affair. Following a disastrous day, Colette decides to leave Holby and shares an emotional goodbye with <b>Fletch.</b> <b>Fletch's</b> divorce was finalized and Natalie arrives on AAU with her friend Bex during a night of drinking. Tensions arise between the pair when Natalie begins revealing <b>Fletch's</b> past to staff and patients, but he is immediately on hand to help when she collapses. <b>Fletch</b> supports Natalie through tests, but when she goes for surgery, she eventually dies, devastating <b>Fletch</b> and their children. <b>Fletch</b> struggles in the aftermath of Natalie's death and begins taking his upset out on patients. His eldest daughter Evie (Macey Chipping) supports him and helps him overcome his issues. <b>Fletch</b> is optimistic when Evie begins a new school, but is devastated when she is admitted following a crash. Scared that Evie will have an injury similar to her mother's, <b>Fletch</b> orders an MRI scan for her and is relieved when Evie reveals she didn't get on the bus because she was being bullied. Another patient from the bus crash helps <b>Fletch</b> overcome his personal issues and he continues to suffer from financial strain.|$|R

When Clifford suggests stealing pharmaceutical drugs, <b>Fletch</b> rejects the idea causing Clifford to become nasty with him. <b>Fletch</b> and his children are evicted from their home and stay overnight in the hospital basement before staying in a grotty B&B. <b>Fletch</b> agrees to help Clifford until he discovers that the drugs are going to dealers and the van driver is a friend (Ray MacAllan) who had offered him money. Clifford confessed he was in debt to drug dealers and that they knew about <b>Fletch</b> and his children, but <b>Fletch</b> still refused to cooperate. The drug dealers then attacked Adele Effanga (Petra Letang), believing her to be Clifford's daughter Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu). <b>Fletch</b> urges Clifford to tell the police, but instead he leaves Holby. <b>Fletch</b> confesses the truth surrounding Clifford and Adele's attack to Mo who tells <b>Fletch</b> that she won't call the police unless he leaves Holby in a month.|$|R

2500|$|Whenever natural <b>fletching</b> is used, the {{feathers}} {{on any one}} arrow must {{come from the same}} wing of the bird. The most common being the right-wing flight feathers of turkeys. [...] The slight cupping of natural feathers requires them to be fletched with a right-twist for right wing, a left-twist for left wing. This rotation, through a combination of gyroscopic stabilization and increased drag on the rear of the arrow, helps the arrow to fly straight away. [...] Artificial helical fletchings have the same effect. Most arrows will have three fletches, but some have four or even more. Fletchings generally range from two to six inches (152mm) in length; flight arrows intended to travel the maximum possible distance typically have very low <b>fletching,</b> while hunting arrows with broadheads require long and high <b>fletching</b> to stabilize them against the aerodynamic effect of the head. [...] Fletchings may also be cut in different ways, the two most common being parabolic (i.e. a smooth curved shape) and shield (i.e. shaped as one-half of a very narrow shield) cut.|$|E
2500|$|Singijeon-class {{projectiles}} {{were small}} arrows designed by Korean siege engineers specifically {{to be used}} in hwachas.

50|$|After Sasha {{recovered}} from her hangover, she {{met up with}} <b>Fletch</b> {{and asked him if}} he had got anymore drugs, but he didn't and said it would be best if they both laid off the drugs for a while. Danny Valentine (David Judge) found <b>Fletch</b> with Sasha and told him it would be best if he and Sasha wouldn't see each other any more, which <b>Fletch</b> agreed to but Sasha still wanted to be with him. <b>Fletch</b> spotted Sasha and Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) kissing together in the village, so <b>Fletch</b> confronted her and told her he saw them both kissing. Sasha reminded <b>Fletch</b> that he dumped her, telling him he had no right to be jealous, but then <b>Fletch</b> admitted he wanted her back with him and with little hesitation, they return to form and score some drugs. Sasha and <b>Fletch</b> bought more heroin by stealing Nancy Dean's (Jessica Fox) purse in Il Gnosh and stole the money she had in it. Later, Michaela saw a wasted Sasha and <b>Fletch</b> at the park and pitied them. On <b>Fletch's</b> 17th birthday, Hannah bumped into him in the village and invited him round for a birthday lunch. <b>Fletch</b> agreed but Josh was adamant that he wouldn't show up as usual. When <b>Fletch</b> finally showed up at the Ashworths, his party was overshadowed by the return of Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) and he sneaked out, feeling ignored. <b>Fletch</b> was desperate for another fix and told Sasha this, so she decided to steal her dad's keys to the boiler room and sent a text message to <b>Fletch</b> telling him to meet her there so they could take the drugs there to avoid the risk of getting caught in the village. Sasha and <b>Fletch</b> were again desperate for another fix but neither had any money, so Sasha decided to con money out of her dad who was blinded by her desperation to score and returned to her hideout with <b>Fletch</b> to take more heroin.|$|R
50|$|With {{nowhere else}} to go, <b>Fletch</b> was using school as his only refuge. <b>Fletch</b> decided to leave school. <b>Fletch</b> forgave Sasha for having sex with Nige, and begged her to leave Hollyoaks to come to London with him, but Sasha, however, couldn't decide. Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) pushed then-pregnant Tina Reilly (Leah Hackett) down the city stairs, <b>Fletch</b> {{was the only one}} to witness this action, however Niall blamed him for the attack. No one {{believed}} <b>Fletch's</b> claims that he was innocent, and he escaped Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna) who was trying to arrest him. <b>Fletch</b> went to the hospital to try and explain what had happened, but Niall made things clear that no one would believe him, so he left. A month or two later, <b>Fletch</b> showed up for results day at Sixth Form where he convinced a now clean Sasha that he was also clean. He asked Sasha to move away with him, however, Sasha spotted marks on <b>Fletch's</b> arm from a recent heroin injection.

2500|$|The {{most famous}} weapon of the Huns, of course, is the Qum Darya-type {{composite}} recurve bow, {{often called the}} [...] "Hunnish Bow." [...] This bow was invented {{some time in the}} 3rd or 2nd centuries BC with the earliest finds near Lake Baikal, but spread across Eurasia long before the Hunnic migration. These bows were typified by being asymmetric in cross-section between 145-155cm in length, having between 4–9 lathes on the grip and in the siyahs. Although whole bows rarely survive in European climatic conditions, finds of bone Siyahs are quite common and characteristic of steppe burials. Complete specimens have been found at sites in the Tarim Basin and Gobi Desert such as Niya, Qum Darya, and Shombuuziin-Belchir. Eurasian nomads such as the Huns typically used trilobate diamond shaped iron arrowheads, attached using birch tar and a tang, with typically 75cm shafts and <b>fletching</b> attached with tar and sinew whipping. Such trilobate arrowheads are believed to be more accurate and have better penetrating power or capacity to injure than flat arrowheads.|$|E
