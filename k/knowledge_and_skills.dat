5|$|Klein ISD offers {{four main}} foreign {{language}} courses: French, Spanish, German, and Latin. All {{four of these}} language courses are taught with curriculum approved by the Texas Essential <b>Knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>Skills</b> (TEKS) and supplemented with textbooks for each course. German and Latin have four years of instruction total - starting in German/Latin 1-3 and ending with AP French/Latin Language. French, however, has five years of instruction total, French 1-4 and ending with AP French Language. Spanish, like French, has five years of instruction, but offers Spanish 1-3 and then offers AP Spanish Language and AP Spanish Culture. In the 2017-2018 school year, Klein ISD will be adding Chinese and American Sign Language to its course selection, but no classes have been held yet for these two courses.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of learning models on the <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect viewed from adversity quotient (AQ). The learning models compared were learning model of the Numbered Heads Together (NHT) with scientific approach, Pairs Check (PC) with scientific approach, and classical with scientific approach. This research was a quasi-experimental research. The population of the research was all of the eighth grade students of the State Junior High School in Sukoharjo. The instruments used to collect data were mathematics knowledge aspect test, mathematics <b>skill</b> aspect test <b>and</b> adversity quotient questionnaire. Technique of analyzing data that used was unbalanced two ways multivariat analysis of variance. From the research, it can be concluded that: (1) learning by using cooperative learning model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with learning by using cooperative learning model of PC with scientific approach, learning by using cooperative learning model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with learning by using classical learning with scientific approach, learning by using cooperative learning model of PC with scientific approach gave better <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect than learning by using classical learning with scientific approach, (2) students who have adversity quotient of Climber gave better <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect than students who have adversity quotient of Camper and Quitter, students who have adversity quotient of Camper gave the same <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with the students who have adversity quotient of Quitter, (3) on each learning model, students who have adversity quotient of Climber gave better <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect than students who have adversity quotient of Camper and Quitter, students who have adversity quotient of Camper gave the same <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with the students who have adversity quotient of Quitter, (4) on each adversity quotient, learning by using cooperative learning model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with learning by using cooperative learning model of PC with scientific approach, learning by using cooperative learning model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect with learning by using classical learning with scientific approach, learning by using cooperative learning model of PC with scientific approach gave better <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> aspect than learning by using classical learning with scientific approach...|$|R

However, success in an industrialized society demands certain <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill.</b> To satisfy these demands, age-grading ensures that the young possess {{sufficient}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> to assume authority and the old retire before they lose their skills. This kind of disengagement is effected by the individual, prompted by either ego changes or the organisation—which is bound to organisational imperatives—or both.|$|R

5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E

40|$|The {{life style}} is formed and {{stabilized}} in adolescence. Since consumption {{of fruits and}} vegetables may affect the risk of chronic diseases, their low consumption during adolescence is very important. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> is considered as one of the main determinants of this behavior. This study aimed to investigate the <b>Knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> of proper consumption of fruit and vegetables among adolescent girls in Shahrekord, Iran. Materials and Methods: This study was a descriptive-analytic investigation conducted on high school girls in Shahrekord city during 2013 to 2014. 308 female students were selected randomly from 8 high schools and a researcher made questionnaire was used to collect the demographic, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> related data. Validity and reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated by internal consistency method (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 70, Cronbach's alpha= 0. 76), respectively. The collected data was analyzed by SPSS- 21 software. Results: The mean age of students was 13. 86 ± 1. 3 years. There was no statistically significant association between consumption of fruit and vegetables and fathers' education level, mothers' job and parents' age. However, there was a significant association between fathers' job <b>and</b> adolescents' <b>skill</b> of fruit <b>and</b> vegetables consumption (P < 0. 05). In addition, a significant association between mothers' education level <b>and</b> adolescents' <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> of fruit <b>and</b> vegetables consumption was observed (P < 0. 05). There was a significant direct association between <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> (P= 0. 01 and r= 082), so that adolescents with more knowledge, had a better skill as well. Conclusion: Considering the adolescents' low <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> in proper consumption of fruit and vegetables and also the direct association between <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill,</b> it seems necessary to implement educational programs according to the health education and promotion theories and models, with contribution of parents and school personnel, to improve the <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> empower adolescent girls in consumption of fruit and vegetables...|$|R
