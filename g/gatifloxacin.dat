The increases in the MICs of <b>gatifloxacin</b> accompanying those mutational steps suggest that primary targets of <b>gatifloxacin</b> in the wild type and the first-, second-, and third-step mutants are wild-type topoisomerase IV (topo IV), wild-type DNA gyrase, singly mutated topo IV, and singly mutated DNA gyrase, respectively. <b>Gatifloxacin</b> had activity {{equal to that of}} tosufloxacin and activity more potent than those of norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin against the second-step mutants (grlA gyrA; <b>gatifloxacin</b> MIC range, 1. 56 to 3. 13 μg/ml) and had the most potent activity against the third-step mutants (grlA gyrA grlA; <b>gatifloxacin</b> MIC range, 1. 56 to 6. 25 μg/ml), suggesting that <b>gatifloxacin</b> possesses the most potent inhibitory activity against singly mutated topo IV and singly mutated DNA gyrase among the quinolones tested. Moreover, <b>gatifloxacin</b> selected resistant mutants from wild-type and the second-step mutants at a low frequency. <b>Gatifloxacin</b> possessed potent activity (MIC, 0. 39 μg/ml) against the NorA-overproducing strain S. aureus NY 12, the norA transformant, which was slightly lower than that against the parent strain SA 113. The increases in the MICs of the quinolones tested against NY 12 were negatively correlated with the hydrophobicity of the quinolones (correlation coefficient, − 0. 93; P < 0. 01). Therefore, this slight decrease in the activity of <b>gatifloxacin</b> is attributable to its high hydrophobicity.

40|$|<b>Gatifloxacin,</b> an 8 -methoxyfluoroquinolone, {{was found}} to be two- to {{fourfold}} more active against wild-type Staphylococcus aureus ISP 794 than its desmethoxy derivative, AM- 1121, and ciprofloxacin, another desmethoxy fluoroquinolone. Single grlBA mutations caused two- to fourfold increases in the MIC of <b>gatifloxacin,</b> and a single gyrase mutation was silent. Double mutations in gyrA and grlA or grlB caused a 32 -fold increase in the MIC of <b>gatifloxacin,</b> in contrast to a 128 -fold increase for ciprofloxacin and AM- 1121. Overexpression of the NorA efflux pump had minimal effect on the MIC of <b>gatifloxacin.</b> The bactericidal activity of the three quinolones at four times the MIC differed only for a double mutant, with <b>gatifloxacin</b> exhibiting a killing pattern similar to that for ISP 794, whereas ciprofloxacin and AM- 1121 failed to show any killing. With <b>gatifloxacin,</b> selection of resistant mutants at twice the MIC was 100 - to 1, 000 -fold less frequent than with the comparison quinolones, and mutants could rarely be selected at four times the MIC. The limit resistance in ISP 74 was 512 times the MIC of <b>gatifloxacin</b> and 1, 024 times the MICs of ciprofloxacin and AM- 1121. Novel mutations in topoisomerase IV were selected in five of the six single-step mutants, three of which were shown to cause quinolone resistance by genetic studies. In conclusion, topoisomerase IV is the primary target of <b>gatifloxacin.</b> In contrast to comparison quinolones, mutations in both topoisomerase IV and gyrase are required for resistance to <b>gatifloxacin</b> by clinical breakpoints and do not abolish bactericidal effect, further supporting the benefit of the 8 -methoxy substituent in <b>gatifloxacin...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to screen the {{interactions}} of fourth generation fluoroquinolone-gatifloxacin with efflux pumps i. e. P-gp, MRP 2 and BCRP.

Such clarification may lead to the development of strategies to overcome efflux and enhance its bioavailability at target site. This process will aid in the reduction of dose volume, further eliminating the chances of systemic toxicity from topical <b>gatifloxacin</b> eye drops. MDCK cell lines transfected with the targeted efflux transporters were used for this study. [14 C] Erythromycin was selected as a model substrate for P-gp and MRP 2 whereas Hoechst 33342 was employed as a substrate for BCRP. Uptake and transport studies of these substrates were performed in the presence of <b>gatifloxacin</b> to delineate its interaction with efflux transporters. Further the efflux ratio in the presence of <b>gatifloxacin</b> was calculated from bidirectional transport studies. The concentration of [14 C] erythromycin and Hoechst 33342 were measured using scintillation counter and fluorescence plate reader respectively. A concentration dependent inhibition effect in the presence of <b>gatifloxacin</b> was revealed on [14 C] erythromycin uptake.

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} the antibacterial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and compare their activity between ciprofloxacin-susceptible and resistant bacterial isolates from patients with keratitis and endophthalmitis. Materials and Methods: The {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, <b>gatifloxacin</b> and moxifloxacin was determined for 123 bacterial isolates, using E test. Among the 123 isolates, 68 were gram-positive (Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp.) and 55 were gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The bacterial isolates were divided into three groups: susceptible / intermediate/ resistant to ciprofloxacin. The MIC values for various fluoroquinolones were compared between the three groups and between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Results: For gram-positive isolates, median MICs of fourth generation fluoroquinolones were lower than second generation. The median MIC was lowest for <b>gatifloxacin</b> and moxifloxacin (0. 094 mg/ml) in ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolates of gram-positive bacteria. For ciprofloxacin-susceptible gram-negative bacteria, the median MIC of ciprofloxacin (0. 19 mg/ml) was significantly lower than ofloxacin, levofloxacin, <b>gatifloxacin</b> and moxifloxacin (1. 5, 0. 5, 0. 5 and 2 mg/ml respectively).

Seventy-six pediatric patients (average age, 6. 7 ± 5. 0 years) were administered a single oral dose of <b>gatifloxacin</b> suspension (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg of body weight; 600 -mg maximum) in a dose-escalating manner. Subjects were stratified by age into 4 groups. An additional 12 children, greater than 6 years of age, received <b>gatifloxacin</b> as the tablet formulation at a dose of approximately 10 mg/kg. Gatifloxacin's apparent clearance and half-life were 5. 5 ± 2. 1 ml/min/kg and 5. 1 ± 1. 4 h. The maximum concentration of drug in plasma and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased in a manner approximately proportional to the dose. At the 10 -mg/kg dose, the bioavailability was similar between the suspension and tablet formulation. The apparent oral clearance of <b>gatifloxacin,</b> normalized for body weight, exhibited a small but statistically significant decrease with increasing age. In all subjects receiving <b>gatifloxacin</b> at 10 mg/kg, the AUC exceeded 20 μg[*]·[*]h/ml (estimated free AUC/MIC ratio of ≥ 34 for MIC of ≤ 0. 5 μg/ml). These data suggest that <b>gatifloxacin</b> at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 24 h will achieve therapeutic concentrations in plasma in infants and children...|$|E
40|$|The {{bactericidal}} {{activity of}} <b>gatifloxacin,</b> alone and {{in combination with}} isoniazid and rifampin, was studied on both exponential- and stationary-phase cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H 37 Rv. On log-phase cultures, the bactericidal activity of <b>gatifloxacin</b> at 4 �g/ml was rapid and was {{very similar to that}} of isoniazid. At concentrations of 0. 25 and 4 �g/ml, <b>gatifloxacin</b> enhanced the activity of isoniazid. Killing of the stationaryphase culture was biphasic. During the first 2 days, <b>gatifloxacin</b> at 4 �g/ml slightly increased the limited bactericidal activities of isoniazid and rifampin. However, no further additional bactericidal activity was found during further incubation with isoniazid alone or when <b>gatifloxacin</b> was added to either isoniazid or rifampin. This suggested that the stationary-phase culture contained a mixture of occasionally dividing bacilli that were killed during the first 2 days and true static persisters in the residual population that mimicked those in human lesions. In view of the failure of <b>gatifloxacin</b> to add to the sterilizing activity of isoniazid or rifampin during days 2 to 6 of exposure in the stationary-phase culture, it is unlikely to be a sterilizing drug {{that can be used to}} shorten the duration of treatment appreciably when it is added to present treatment regimens...|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} in vitro activities of <b>gatifloxacin</b> and seven other drugs against 100 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia using the agar gradient diffusion (Etest) method. Percentages of susceptible isolates were as follows: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 90 %; <b>gatifloxacin,</b> 71 %; levofloxacin, 57 %; ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, 54 %; ceftazidime, 49 %; ciprofloxacin, 29 %; cefepime, 21 %; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 20 %. Time-kill studies of three isolates indicated that <b>gatifloxacin</b> was bactericidal at times {{as early as}} 3 h of incubation when tested at concentrations equivalent to twice the MIC (two isolates) and 4 times the MIC (one isolate) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>gatifloxacin</b> against 308 aerobes and 112 anaerobes isolated from bite wound infections was studied. <b>Gatifloxacin</b> was active at ≤ 0. 016 μg/ml against all 148 Pasteurella isolates (eight species and three subspecies) tested {{and all other}} aerobes tested, including Actinobacillus-Haemophilus spp., Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria weaveri, Weeksella zoohelcum, staphylococci, and streptococci. Fusobacteria were sometimes resistant. <b>Gatifloxacin</b> MICs at which 90 % of the isolates were inhibited were 0. 125 μg/ml against Bacteroides tectum and Prevotella spp., 0. 25 μg/ml against Porphyromonas spp., and 0. 5 μg/ml against peptostreptococci...|$|E
40|$|A stability-indicating RP-HPLC {{method is}} {{presented}} for determination of <b>gatifloxacin</b> and flurbiprofen in binary combination. <b>Gatifloxacin,</b> flurbiprofen and their degradation products were detected at 254 nm using a BDS Hypersil C 8 (250 X 4. 6 mm, 5 µm) column and mixture of 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3. 0) and methanol 30 : 70 v/v as mobile phase. Response was linear {{over the range}} of 15 - 105 mg mL- 1 for <b>gatifloxacin</b> (r² > 0. 998) and of 1. 5 - 10. 5 mg mL- 1 for flurbiprofen (r² > 0. 999). The developed method efficiently separated the analytical peaks from degradation products (peak purity index > 0. 9999). The method developed can be applied successfully for determination of <b>gatifloxacin</b> and flurbiprofen in human serum, urine, pharmaceutical formulations, and their stability studies...|$|E
