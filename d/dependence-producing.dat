40|$|Nicotine is {{considered}} the main <b>dependence-producing</b> constituent in tobacco products. In analogy with other drugs of abuse, nicotine enhances dopamine (DA) neurotransmission within the mesocorticolimbic DA system. This increase in DA release {{is thought to be}} at least partially responsible for the reinforcing and <b>dependence-producing</b> effects of nicotine. However, accumulating evidence suggests that also glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in the <b>dependence-producing</b> effects of nicotine since nicotine also enhances the release of glutamate release in the mesocorticolimbic DA system, and glutamate receptor antagonists inhibit the nicotine-induced release of DA in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists modulate the acute and chronic effects of nicotine on locomotor activity (LMA) and mesocorticolimbic DA release. In particular, we wanted to examine the possible role of NMDA receptor subunits in the stimulatory actions of nicotine following acute and chronic administration of the drug. Acute administration of nicotine produced a dose-dependent increase in LMA and DA release in the NAcc. Administration of the novel AMPA receptor antagonist ZK 200775 and the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CGP 39551 attenuated the effects of nicotine. In contrast and unexpectedly, the NR 2 B subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonist, Ro 25 - 6981 potentiated the acute effects of nicotine on LMA (without producing stereotypies) as well as on DA release in the NAcc. Chronic administration of nicotine resulted in the development of behavioral sensitization and nicotine-conditioned locomotor stimulation. Behavioral sensitization developed two days prior to the onset of the conditioned response. When Ro 25 - 6981 was given to na√Øve rats at a dose, which by itself had no effect on LMA, in rats chronically treated with nicotine, it significantly increased LMA without inducing stereotypies. Moreover, the same dose of Ro 25 - 6981 had no effect on DA release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) whereas a trend toward increased DA release was noted in the NAcc. In addition, Ro 25 - 6981 potentiated nicotine-induced DA release in the mPFC but not in the NAcc. Chronic administration of nicotine exposure caused no changes in the expression levels of NR 2 A or NR 2 B mRNA in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or ventral striatum (VStr) but Western blot revealed that there was an upregulation of the NR 2 B subunit protein but not NR 2 A subunit protein in the PFC with no corresponding changes in the VStr. Taken together, our data suggest that both AMPA and NMDA receptors are involved in the acute effects of nicotine on LMA and NAcc DA release. However, whereas a non-selective blockade of NMDA receptors inhibits the acute effects of nicotine on LMA and NAcc DA release, a selective blockade of the NR 2 B subunit enhances nicotine's acute effects. In addition, chronic nicotine treatment upregulates the NR 2 B subunit in the PFC but not in the VStr suggesting that chronic nicotine exposure induces regionally selective neuroadaptative changes in the composition of NMDA receptor subunits. These observations are of potential interest not only for our understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms involved in nicotine dependence but also for some psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders known to be associated with disturbances in the interplay between dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{cigarettes}} (ECIGs) use {{an electric}} heater to aerosolize a liquid that usually contains propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavorants, and the <b>dependence-producing</b> drug nicotine. ECIG-induced nicotine dependence {{has become an}} important concern, as some ECIGs deliver very little nicotine while some may exceed the nicotine delivery profile of a tobacco cigarette. This variability is relevant to tobacco cigarette smokers who try to switch to ECIGs. Products with very low nicotine delivery may not substitute for tobacco cigarettes, so that ECIG use is accompanied by little reduced risk of cigarette-caused disease. Products with very high nicotine delivery may make quitting ECIGs particularly difficult should users decide to try. For non-smokers, the wide variability of ECIGs on the market is especially troublesome: low nicotine products may lead them to initiate nicotine self-administration and progress to higher dosing ECIGs or other products, and those that deliver more nicotine may produce nicotine dependence where it was not otherwise present.

40|$|The {{search for}} an {{effective}} analgesic without <b>dependence-producing</b> properties has continued for years. Buprenorphine, introduced in Ireland in 1980, {{has been described as}} a potent analgesic with low abuse potential, however sporadic reports in the literature seem to contradict this view. This article is an attempt to establish the extent of Buprenorphine abuse among opiate addicts in Ireland. A retrospective survey was carried out of all opiate addicts first presenting at the National Drug Advisory & Treatment Centre between September 1 st 1986 and August 31 st 1987. The study relied on self-reporting by addicts of drugs abused. Buprenorphine is a major drug of abuse among Dublin's opiate addicts and its use is increasingly common. In Dublin, Buprenorphine tablets are sold on the illicit drug market for ¬£ 3 -¬£ 5 each. They may be crushed, taken sublingually, snorted or more frequently dissolved and injected intravenously. Buprenorphine is rarely the preferred drug, and its use is primarily in preventing the withdrawal symptoms of heroin. Buprenorphine was available without a prescription until July 1987. The findings of the study have major implications for the prescribing of Buprenorphine. It has since become a prescription-only medicine and it is clear that contrary to initials beliefs, this drug has high abuse potential. It is remarkable that more widespread abuse of Buprenorphine has not been reported in other countries...|$|E
40|$|The 1988 {{classification}} by the International Headache Society (IHS) first defined {{drug-induced headache}} {{as a specific}} disorder, belonging to secondary headaches, subtype 8. 2 (headache induced by chronic substance use or exposure). In 2004 ICHD-II, this definition was replaced by medication-overuse headache (MOH). It was established that a definite diagnosis of MOH required {{the improvement of the}} disorder after cessation of medication overuse. The specific characteristics of the various subforms were also indicated. Later revisions have first eliminated these headache characteristics and then the diagnosis of probable MOH. The diagnosis of MOH has therefore become more useful to clinical aims. However, the last revision has eliminated the need to prove that the disorder is caused by drugs, that is, the headache improves after cessation of medication overuse. The classification of MOH as a secondary headache has therefore been modified, too. Clinical trials can consequently include in the same group patients with primary headache and drug overuse and patients with MOH. We therefore propose to continue to use the diagnosis of probable MOH to research aims. We also propose to modify the classification of MOH subforms according to {{the presence or absence of}} a <b>dependence-producing</b> property of overused drugs. This will allow to better analyze the role of the various medications in inducing chronic headache and the outcomes of treatments...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco-smoking {{represents}} {{a form of}} drug addiction to nicotine (NlC) and thereinforcing and <b>dependence-producing</b> properties of NIC depend largely on centraldopamine (DA) neurons, located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projectingmainly to the nucleus accumbens (NAc; mesolimbic DA system) and the medial prefrontalcortex (PFC; mesocortical DA system). Generally, the mesolimbic DA system plays apivotal role in the reinforcing effects of natural rewards {{as well as of}} drugs ofabuse. Thus, in the present study the mode of action of NIC on these two centralDA systems was further explored in the rat. Microdialysis of extracellular DA was carried out in freely moving animals. Dopamineoutput was also monitored with differential normal pulse voltammetry (DNPV) in anesthetizedanimals. Neuronal activity of VTA DA cells was registered by means of single cellrecordings in vivo. Moreover, measurements of locomotor activity in an open fieldwere performed as well as assessments of expression of immediate early genes, e. g. c-fos, in several brain regions by means of immunohistochemical detection of theirprotein products, i. e. Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI). By means of local infusions of the nicotinic receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine(MEC), systemic nicotine-induced DA release in the NAc was found to be mainly executedwithin the VTA. Systemic NIC also increased DA release in the PFC and this effectwas enhanced during subchronic NIC treatment, whereas NIC-induced accumbal DA releasewas unaltered by the same treatment. In addition, a selective DA D,-mediated increasein FLI was observed both in the PFC and in the shell region of the NAc, a subdivisionof the NAc intimately coupled to the PFC, during chronic NIC administration. By meansof DNPV, NIC was found to preferentially stimulate DA release in the shell of theNAc, both in acute and chronic experiments. Moreover, behavioral sensitization toNIC-induced locomotor stimulation was observed in chronic experiments both with systemicand intra-VTA application of NIC. The latter treatment also increased FLI in theNAc. In addition, systemic NIC preferentially increased VTA DA neuronal burst activity,i. e. an effect similar to the physiological reward response of these cells, startingat a lower dose in NIC-pretreated than in drug-naive animals. The effects of systemic NIC on mesolimbic DA neurotransmission, including neurochemicalalterations in postsynaptic regions, as well as on DA-related behavior, seem thusto be essentially mediated via stimulation of nAChRs located within the VTA. Theobserved pattern of response of central DA systems to chronic NIC administrationappears rather unique among <b>dependence-producing</b> drugs, and its subjective benefitsmay accordingly be related to augmented DA activity in the PFC, and include, forexample, focused attention and cognitive enhancement, at least under certain conditions. A preferential facilitation of prefrontal DA output seems to be a common denominatorfor several atypical antipsychotic drugs which, similarly to chronic NIC, have beenshown to augment burst firing in VTA DA neurons as well as DA release and c-fos expressionpreferentially in the shell of the NAc and in the PFC. The data underline the notion,that the extremely high prevalence of cigarette smoking in schizophrenia may indeedrepresent a forrn of attempted self-medication.

40|$|Introduction: Waterpipe tobacco smoking {{involves}} self-administration of the <b>dependence-producing</b> drug nicotine. Few {{studies have}} examined if dependence in waterpipe smokers influences toxicant exposure and smoking behavior. Method: Current waterpipe tobacco smokers were categorized based on Lebanese Waterpipe Dependence Scale- 11 (LWDS- 11) score (LWDS- 11 : LOW 13; N = 59). Participants abstained from smoking for 12 hr and then completed a single 30 -min waterpipe tobacco smoking episode. Expired-air carbon monoxide (CO) was measured before and 5 min after smoking and puff topography was measured during smoking. Results: Total mean smoking time was 30. 9 min (SD = 3. 5) and {{did not differ significantly}} by LWDS- 11 score. CO boost was greater for participants in the HIGH versus LOW groups (62. 3 vs. 43. 6 ppm, p <. 01). Similarly, those in the HIGH versus LOW group took more puffs (198. 6 vs. 157. 1 puffs, p <. 01), longer duration puffs (2. 7 vs. 2. 3 s, p <. 05), puffs with lower flow rate (10. 3 vs. 12. 6 L/min, p <. 01), and less time between puffs (8. 0 vs. 12. 4 s, p <. 001). Conclusion: The puff topography of waterpipe tobacco smokers can be predicted by LWDS- 11 score, with those scoring higher taking longer duration and lower velocity puffs at a higher frequency. These behavioral differences may underlie the 40 % greater CO exposure observed for those with higher LWDS- 11 scores. To the extent that waterpipe dependence is associated with more smoke inhalation, more dependent smokers will be exposed to greater amounts of toxic smoke constituents. ¬© The Author 2013.

40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} shown that {{nicotine}} facilitates in-tracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) reward and that nico-tinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are of primary importance for its reinforcing and <b>dependence-producing</b> actions. Recently, we have shown that a 7 nicotinic receptors in the VTA contribute to both the acute effects of nicotine on the me-solimbic dopamine system, as well as to nicotine with-drawal reactions. However, it is not yet known whether the same receptor conformation is directly involved in the reinforcing actions of nicotine. Here, using the curve-shift method we studied the effects of methyllyc-aconitine (MLA), a selective a 7 receptor antagonist, mi-croinjected (graded doses: 1, 3, 9 ¬µg/¬µl per side) into the VTA on the rewarding efficacy of lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation and on the systemic nicotine-induced potentiation of brain stimulation reward. MLA did not affect baseline self-stimulation. Nicotine produced a sig-nificant reduction in ICSS threshold, without altering maximal rates of responding, while MLA attenuated the effect of nicotine at the two lower doses. Given the re-ported interaction between nicotine and cocaine at both the neuronal and the behavioral level, we also examined whether a 7 receptor antagonism within the VTA can af-fect the reinforcing action of cocaine, as measured with ICSS. Interestingly, MLA attenuated the reinforcing ef-fect of cocaine in all doses tested, without altering the maximal rate of responding, i. e. the performance of the animals. These results suggest that a 7 nAChRs in the VTA are involved in mediating the reinforcing actions of drugs of abuse, such as nicotine and cocaine, and pro-vide evidence that a 7 nAChR antagonists may be clini-cally useful in attenuating the rewarding effects of addic-tive drugs.

40|$|Drug {{dependence}} is {{a devastating}} disorder {{present in all}} parts of the world. It is manifested by craving and a general loss of control over the drug intake and the life situation, ultimately leading to compulsive use of the addictive drug at the expense of normal behavioral patterns. This condition is associated with a marked risk for relapse, even after extended periods of drug abstinence. These behavioral impairments have been ascribed the <b>dependence-producing</b> effects of the addictive drugs. The aim of the present thesis was to investigate the effects of subchonic nicotine exposure on animal (rat) behaviors proposed to correlate to craving and drug-taking (i. e. locomotor sensitization) and on brain mechanisms involved in the inhibitory control of such inappropriate motivational impulses and behaviors (i. e. behavioral inhibition). The present experiments demonstrate that repeated treatment with nicotine or amphetamine for 15 consecutive days results in, at least, two distinct behavioral effects: locomotor sensitization and behavioral disinhibition. The expression, but not the induction, of the nicotine-induced behavioral alterations was counteracted by pharmacological manipulations that enhance brain 5 -HT neurotransmission. In amphetamine-treated rats, however, these manipulations only antagonized the expression of behavioral disinhibition, and not locomotor sensitization. On the contrary, manipulations that decrease brain 5 -HT activity, causing behavioral disinhibition, tended to augment the expression of locomotor sensitization. Behavioral and neurochemical evidence was also obtained indicating that the effects of 5 -HT acting drugs on locomotor sensitization and behavioral disinhibition are mediated via distinct neurochemical mechanisms, in which the 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 2 receptors are differentially involved. Finally, the present experiments demonstrated a strong positive correlation between nicotine-induced behavioral disinhibition and high voluntary ethanol consumption, suggesting that the drug-induced reduction of inhibitory control may have implications for the intake of addictive drugs. Taken together, the findings presented in this thesis indicate that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse concurrently augments the incentive motivational impulse to use the drug and impairs the brain functions involved in inhibitory control of behavior. It is suggested that these drug-induced behavioral changes reflect critical components of the drug-induced neuroadaptive processes which ultimately lead to compulsive drug use, and the pharmacological treatments which antagonized the expression of these behavioral impairments may have beneficial effects in the treatment of drug abuse...|$|E
40|$|The mesolimbocortical {{dopamine}} (DA) {{system is}} pivotal for {{the mediation of}} the reinforcing effects of many <b>dependence-producing</b> drugs. It consists of cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that project to e. g. the nucleus accumbens (NAC), the central nucleus of amygdala (CNA) and the medial prefrontal cortex. In experimental animals, nicotine increases DA output in the NAC, exerts a locomotor stimulatory effect and is readily self-administered. These effects of systemic nicotine appear largely mediated via nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) in the VTA. Moreover, recently the a 7 nAChR subtype has been implicated {{in some of the}} acute effects of nicotine. The effects of nicotine withdrawal on behavior and mesolimbocortical dopaminergic neurotransmission in rats have remained largely unknown. Therefore, utilizing behavioral methods, in vivo microdialysis, intracerebral drug injections and immunohistochemistry, we explored in detail the effects of nicotine withdrawal on these parameters. Rats were, by means of subcutaneously implanted minipumps, treated chronically with a dose of nicotine that yielded plasma levels similar to those encountered in heavy smokers. A somatic nicotine abstinence reaction was induced through removal of the infusion pump or through administration of a nAChR antagonist, acting either centrally and peripherally or peripherally only. Administration of nicotine or of a peripherally acting nAChR agonist both reversed the withdrawal reaction. Systemic administration of the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine significantly reduced DA output in the NAC selectively in the nicotine-treated group. The somatic withdrawal signs and the reduction in NAC DA appeared not to be specifically or causally related. Also intrategmental injection of mecamylamine elicited a reduction in accumbal DA output, somatic withdrawal signs as well as hypolocomotion, whereas intraaccumbal administration of mecamylamine failed to elicit any changes in NAC DA output or in somatic signs. Similarly, intrategmental application of an a 7 nAChR antagonist resulted in a decreased NAC DA output and a reduction in locomotor activity. Finally, nicotine withdrawal precipitated by a systemic injection of mecamylamine both attenuated DA output and activated c?fos in the CNA. These results demonstrate a significant contribution of peripheral nAChRs to the nicotine withdrawal reaction and predict that drugs stimulating selectively peripheral nAChRs may have some usefulness in smoking cessation. The withdrawal-induced reduction in NAC DA, if it occurs also in man, may have bearing on clinical symptoms such as depression and dysphoria that are often encountered in association with smoking cessation. In addition, the clinical efficacy of bupropion in smoking cessation programmes may largely be due to its ability to restore a compromised mesolimbic DA function. Specifically, nAChRs {{at the level of the}} VTA rather than in the NAC seem to contribute to the behavioral and biochemical consequences of nicotine withdrawal precipitated with systemic mecamylamine, and a role for a 7 nAChRs within the VTA is indicated in this regard. The withdrawal-induced selective activation of c-fos in the CNA may have bearing on anxiety and distress, symptoms that in animals can be elicited from this brain region and frequently occur in nicotine abstinent humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} {{synthetic}} opioids as alternatives to opium-based derivatives has provided an important impulse to drug development around the globe.

A rich {{source of information about}} these research efforts {{can be found in the}} scientific literature. However, the exploration of these important discoveries has also been increasingly mined by largescale producers of these materials, which are then offered for sale. These so-called ‚Äòresearch chemicals‚Äô or new psychoactive substances (NPS) [1] have created challenges to policy makers, clinicians, and law enforcement around the world. [2] Recent examples of synthetic opioids that emerged as NPS on the market, and which were associated with severe cases of adverse effects, include 3, 4 -dichloro-N-[1 -(dimethylamino) cyclohexyl]methylbenzamide (AH- 7921), 1 -cyclohexyl- 4 -(1, 2 - diphenylethyl) piperazines (MT- 45) and N-phenyl-N-[1 -(2 -phenylethyl) piperidin- 4 - yl]acetamide (acetylfentanyl), respectively (Figure 1). Following the recommendation provided by the World Health Organization‚Äôs Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD),[3] AH- 7921 was placed in Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention, as amended by the 1972 Protocol in 2015. [4] Furthermore, ECDD‚Äôs recommendation to place MT- 45 into Schedule I and acetylfentanyl in Schedules I and IV of the same Convention[5] have been recently confirmed by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. [6] -Dichloro-N-[2 -(dimethylamino) cyclohexyl]-N-methylbenzamide (U- 47700) (Figure 1) has recently emerged on the market and can be purchased from various Internet retailers and is a structural isomer of AH- 7921 (Figure 1). The preparation of U- 47700 and other derivatives was disclosed by the Upjohn Company in the 1970 s[7] followed by the recognition that U- 47700 showed increased analgesic properties and morphine-like behavioural features in mice compared to morphine itself. [8, 9] The presence of two chiral centres gives rise to a cis- and trans- racemic mixture with the trans-form being advertised for sale. Binding studies also revealed that U- 47700 displayed an appreciable selectivity for the Œº-opioid receptor over the ÔÉ™‚àíopioid receptor. [10, 11] A variety of cyclohexyl trans- 1, 2 -diamines have been found to be potent analgesics and the vicinal 1, 2 -diamine pattern has provided access to a large range of substances with diverse biological activities. [12 - 14] Since U- 47700 did not progress to clinical trials, there is no direct clinical information pertaining to its effects. Keeping in mind the various limitations that may be associated with descriptions obtained from self-reporting users, its effects have been described with various positive and negative symptoms but appeared to be essentially comparable to other opioids. Specifically, euphoria was reported in individuals, sometimes being short-lived, as well as general lift in mood with these desired effects being experienced in waves. The negative effects were also opioid based, including nausea with some users describing respiratory depression. For some users, U- 47700 had a shorter duration of action and the urge to keep re-dosing was stated as being very high...|$|E
