5|$|By 22 September, Croatian {{forces had}} besieged and {{captured}} all major garrisons of the 32nd Corps, <b>except</b> <b>those</b> in Bjelovar and Koprivnica. The JNA garrisons {{in those two}} cities were ordered to extract themselves to territory near Okučani that was {{under the control of}} the 5th Corps. The Koprivnica-based garrison was ordered to break out to Bjelovar, link up with the 265th Mechanised Brigade, then proceed towards Daruvar via Grubišno Polje. At the same time, the Bjelovar garrison had been blockaded, and its utilities and supplies were cut. Negotiations ensued for the surrender of the garrison, led by the civilian crisis headquarters presided over by Jure Šimić. The negotiations stalled when the JNA demanded that the 265th Mechanised Brigade be allowed to evacuate to Okučani or Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the time, a number of Croatian Serb civilians took refuge in the barracks either fearing for their safety or in order to isolate themselves from the Croatian authorities.|$|E

The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, <b>except</b> <b>those</b> belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018.
