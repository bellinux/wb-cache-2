40|$|Sole juveniles {{concentrate}} {{along the}} western Adriatic coast where they are targeted from spring to autumn by small-scale <b>gill</b> <b>netters.</b> As in spring–early summer 20 to 30 % of catch biomass consists of individuals smaller than MLS (TL = 20 cm), the selectivity of sole gill nets was investigated in 2004 - 2005 {{in order to obtain}} useful information for developing management measures aimed at reducing the retention of undersized specimens and assuring the sustainability of this fishery. Twenty-eight fishing trips were performed using sole gill nets with 5 mesh openings (64. 2, 65. 2, 67. 8, 70. 2 and 71. 8 mm) simultaneously. The gill net selectivity was estimated indirectly by applying the SELECT method and between-set analysis. The log-normal curve was found to fit single set data better than other models. The catch yields did not significantly decrease with the increment of mesh size: the biomass of undersized individuals in catches noticeably decreased from 16 % down to 9 % in the largest mesh size, whilst the sole that were longer than the MLS increased proportionally. In view of the lower economic value of smaller specimens with respect to the larger ones, adopting the 71. 8 mm mesh represents a good compromise between the need to protect juveniles and the economic profit of <b>gill</b> <b>netters...</b>|$|R

5000|$|From the 1950s {{through the}} early 1990s the Thompson River was {{considered}} one of the premier steelhead angling destinations in North America. The river hosted large runs of both summer and winter run anadromous coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus). In the late 1980s the runs were estimated at over 10,000 fish. The river attracted anglers from around the world seeking powerful Thompson River steelhead. In 1982, the average male winter run Thompson River steelhead was 16 lbs kg. [...] By the late 1990s, steelhead populations began to decline due {{to a wide variety of}} adverse environmental conditions and overfishing by commercial and First Nations <b>gill</b> <b>netters.</b> In 2016, annual steelhead numbers entering the Thompson were estimated to be less than 400 fish. Low numbers have prompted conservation organizations and sportsman’s associations to petition Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), for Canada's Species At Risk Act (SARA) protections. [...] The river is subject to catch and release angling only for steelhead and has severely restricted seasons to protect the wild stocks of remaining steelhead.|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe {{theoretical}} {{economic performance}} of the year 2000 Norwegian fishing fleet in the Barents Sea cod fisheries are studied under different stock biomass levels and age compositions by applying the EconMult fleet model. Quarterly stock conditions during the period 1946 - 2004 have been investigated as this represent stock conditions which may naturally occur. Cost profiles and prices are from Norwegian official statistics of year 2000, while the harvest production equations are from the EconSimp 2000 model. The study confirms a close relationship between relative economic performance between fleet segments and the stock properties. No dominant factor is found, as both stock properties, stock-output elasticities and fleet cost compositions are all important factors influencing the final result. Stock size and age composition in stock are however important factors, particularly the latter. The study indicates that bottom trawl may be relatively more efficient {{the second half of}} each year when the cod availability is reduced, while <b>gill</b> <b>netters</b> and long liners dominate the first half; except in years of extreme biomasses, as these often are characterised by large biomasses of young cod which suits the trawler fleet better than the conventional fleet...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{economic}} efficiency of purse seiners, trawlers and drift <b>gill</b> <b>netters</b> operating along Kerala Coast was studied from 1982 to 1986.

40|$|Parallel fishing trials with 0. 30 mm {{diameter}} monofilament gill {{nets and}} longlines using small hooks {{were carried out}} in the Algarve (southern Portugal) over a one-year period, 1997 - 1998, with the objective of comparing species composition, catch rates, discards and size ranges. Four hook sizes of 'Mustad' brand, round bent, flatted sea hooks (numbers 15, 13, 12 and 11) and four mesh sizes of 25, 30, 35 and 40 mm (nominal bar length) of gill nets were used in the trials. Overall, 84 species were caught, with gill nets taking 71 species and longlines 54 species and with 41 species caught by both gears. The amount of discarding was higher for gill nets than for longlines. The catch species composition differed between the two gears, with the commercially valuable sea breams dominating the longline catches whereas small pelagics were relatively more important in the gill nets. Multivariate analysis showed a clear separation between the different sizes of the two gears both in terms of numbers and weights per species. Algarve <b>gill</b> <b>netters</b> and longliners fish the same species assemblage on the same fishing grounds, but have clearly different impacts in terms of catch species composition, catch rates and sizes. This information will be useful for the improved management of these small-scale, multi-species, multi-gear fisheries, where different gears compete for scarce resources. In particular this study provides a basis for a more rational allocation of licenses and control of fishing effort...|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{discarding}} of plaice Pleuronectes platessa in the North Sea flatfish fisheries, {{the major}} nursery areas were closed to large trawlers in 1995. The area closed {{was named the}} ‘Plaice Box’ (PB) and beam trawl effort fell by over 90 %,while the exemption fleets of small flatfish beam trawlers, <b>gill</b> <b>netters</b> targeting sole (Solea solea) and shrimp (Crangon crangon) trawlers increased their effort. Contrary to the expectation, plaice landings and biomass declined. The initial support for the PB from the fisheries was lost, whereas other stakeholder groups claimed that any failure {{was due to the}} fact that fishing had never been completely prohibited in the area. To evaluate whether the PB has been an effective management measure, the changes in the ecosystem (plaice, demersal fish, benthos) and fisheries are analyzed to test whether the observed changes are due to the PB or to changes in the environment unrelated to the PB. Juvenile growth rate of plaice decreased and juveniles moved to deeper waters outside the PB. Demersal fish biomass decreased, whereas the abundance of epibenthic predators (Asterias rubens and Cancer pagurus) increased in the PB. Endobenthos, in particular the main food items of plaice (polychaetes and small bivalves) remained stable or decreased both inside and outside the PB. Currently catches of both plaice and sole from within the PB are lower than in the late 1980 s and the exemption fleet often prefers to fish outside the Plaice Box alongside much larger competitors. It is concluded that the observed changes are most likely related to changes in the North Sea ecosystem, which may be related to changes in eutrophication and temperature. It is less likely that they are related to the change in fishing. This case study highlights the importance of setting testable objectives and an appropriate evaluation framework including both ecological and socio-economic indicators when implementing closed area...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{biology and}} {{population}} characteristics of Sardinella gibbosa and Sardinella fimbriata landed by <b>gill</b> <b>netters</b> from north west Bay of Bengal was studied during 2005 – 2010. Average annual catch was 21080 t, {{in which the}} contribution of S. gibbosa was 12790 t and the contribution of S. fimbriata was 8290 t. SST, rainfall and chlorophyll a were found to affect the annual catch of lesser sardines. Length weight relation showed differential growth between adults and indeterminates for both the species. Overall sex ratio varied between 1 : 1. 28 to 1 : 1. 33 for S. gibbosa and between 1 : 1. 02 to 1 : 1. 025 for S. fimbriata with length at first maturity of 13. 03 cm for S. gibbosa and 13. 27 cm for S. fimbriata. Peak spawning season was February – April for S. gibbosa and May - July for S. fimbriata. Total fecundity ranged between 12786 ova to 68377 ova for S. gibbosa and between 11066 ova to 60981 ova for S. fimbriata. Mature ovaries in lesser sardines contained both immature and mature ova. Von Bertalanffy growth equation was Lt = 20. 7 [1 – e - 0. 96 (t + 0. 018) ] for S. gibbosa and Lt = 20. 7 [1 – e - 0. 85 (t + 0. 023) ] for S. fimbriata.
