50|$|A {{benefit of}} a <b>full-floating</b> <b>axle</b> is that even if an axle shaft (used to {{transmit}} torque or power) breaks, the wheel will not come off, possibly preventing a serious accident.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>full-floating</b> <b>axle</b> shaft {{does not}} carry the vehicle's weight; it serves only to {{transmit}} torque from the differential to the wheels. It [...] "floats" [...] inside an assembly {{that carries the}} vehicle's weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). <b>Full-floating</b> <b>axle</b> shafts are retained by a flange bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut. In contrast, a semi-floating design carries {{the weight of the}} vehicle on the axle shaft itself; there is a single bearing {{at the end of the}} axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through.|$|E
50|$|The full-floating {{design is}} {{typically}} used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, {{as well as}} most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a semi-floating or non-floating axle assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed spindle. A <b>full-floating</b> <b>axle</b> can be identified by a protruding hub to which the axle shaft flange is bolted. The semi-floating design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Jeep {{developed}} the M715 1.25-ton army truck, a militarized {{version of the}} civilian J-series Jeep truck, which served extensively in the Vietnam War. It had heavier <b>full-floating</b> <b>axles</b> and a foldable, vertical, flat windshield. Today, it serves other countries, and is still being produced by Kia under license.|$|R
5000|$|The Dana 61 {{was made}} in semi-float and <b>full-float</b> <b>axles</b> for select 4×2 and 4x4 Ford -ton and 1 Ton Pickups and Vans from 1974 to 1987. A Dana 61 front axle was {{selectively}} used in Dodge 4×4 -ton and 1 Ton pickups from 1987 to 1993. Although 3.07:1 and 3.31:1 gear sets are common for a Dana 61, lower gear sets deeper than (4.10:1 on down) are not.|$|R
50|$|The entire {{engine air}} intake and the axle system was fully vented {{to allow for}} {{operation}} while submerged under water. Its <b>full-floating</b> front <b>axle</b> (Dana 25) {{was supported by the}} wheel hub, rather than the axle itself, and provided greater load capacity. The rear axle (Dana 44) was semi-floating. Its drivetrain was the L-head 134.2 cuin L with a T-90 transmission and the Dana 18 transfer case.|$|R
50|$|The {{most radical}} {{vehicles}} {{built for the}} film were the Chevy trucks constructed for the fuel heist. Powered by 502ci GM big block motors, the '67 had a giant ladder-bar suspension with airbags using a massive 10-ton semi rear axle with the biggest and widest truck tires they could find. The '88 Chevy Crew Cab was built with twin <b>full-floating</b> GM 1-ton <b>axles</b> equipped with Detroit Lockers and a transfer case directing power to both axles and capable of four-wheel burnouts.|$|R
