40|$|Experiments were {{initiated}} to increase seed yield and physical quality in a New Zealand Pinus radiata controlled pollinated (CP) seed orchard. To do this an irrigation treat-ment; {{and other treatments}} such as girdling, <b>foliar</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and hormones, were applied {{during the period of}} rapid cone growth commencing some 14 months after pollination. Irrigation significantly increased cone growth and seed yield; giving e. g. an increase of 53 % in cone fresh weight, 39 % in seed weight, 31 % in the number of filled seeds per cone and 53 % in seed germinative energy. Girdling and <b>foliar</b> <b>fertiliser</b> application also increased cone and seed parameters to comparable levels, but only in the absence of irrigation. Hormone application was ineffective unless combined with girdling or <b>foliar</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatments. While the results were based on only 2 clones, the magni-tude of the increase in seed yield would indicate a potential for significant returns from commercial application of these treat-ments...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of the soil type and differential sulphur rates used with or without Basfoliar 36 Extra on the soil pH as well as the amount of available forms of copper, zinc and manganese based on the micro plots field experiment. Moreover, the relationship between the studied microelements was examined. The experiment was performed in two-factor design; the first-order factor was the soil type (Typic Hapludolls, Typic Hapludalfs, Typic Haplorthods, Typic Endoaquolls), while the second-order factor - fertilization with sulphur and compound fertilizer - Basfoliar 36 Extra. The plant tested was Rota cultivar maize. The use of sulphur and sulphur combined with Basfoliar 36 Extra changed the classification of the soils in terms of their pH. In the soils under study, as a result of the 10 -years application of sulphur and/or <b>foliar</b> <b>fertiliser</b> with NPK fertilization as well as growing maize in monoculture showing a high uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients, there was reported a clear decrease in the content of zinc, copper and manganese, as compared with the initial content.

At international level there are few industrial plants for hide and leather reclaiming 1 - 6, obtaining of leather fibre boards, organic fertilisers and separation of fatty matters for direct use as boiling installation fuel. The European reglementations regarding organic waste disposal {{are more and more}} restricted and create a demand for research on new technology development for hide and leather wastes reclaiming.

40|$|Two {{field studies}} (I and II) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln: John Seaton Anderson Turfgrass Research Facility near Mead, NE, USA, were {{conducted}} {{to determine if a}} new ultra-low volume (ULV) sprayer can apply foliar nutrient, growth regulator, and fungicide treatments, {{in a manner similar to}} that of a conventional sprayer. Treatments were applied over creeping bentgrass ‘L- 93 ’ (Agrostis stolonifera L.) managed as a fairway at 561 l · ha− 1 and 47 l · ha− 1 with the conventional and ULV sprayer, respectfully. Data were collected for chlorophyll content with a chlorophyll meter, and for the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a turf colour meter. Each plot was harvested for biomass at 21 days after treatment. Study II compared the ULV sprayer and a conventional sprayer, for the control of brown patch (Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn) in creeping bentgrass. The treatments were propiconazole and azoxystrobin. Spray volume was 561 l · ha− 1 for the conventional sprayer, and 19 l · ha− 1 for the ULV sprayer. Statistical differences in turf quality or dry weight reductions between the conventional and ULV sprayer were not detected. Brown patch control was also similar between the two sprayers, but azoxystrobin provided better control than propiconazole. Even with a 30 -fold decrease in application volume, the results indicated that the Kamterter ULV sprayer may be a useful and effective management option for <b>foliar</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and fungicide applications in turfgrass...|$|E
40|$|Rye is a cereal {{which is}} very much demanded at the market, for making {{a special kind of}} bread, but it is little grown in Serbia. The aim {{of this paper is to}} {{investigate}} possibilities of organic growing of winter rye, comparing with the conventional one, in agroecological conditions of Valjevo hilly region during 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010 cropping seasons. The trial was set up in a village of Kotešica, on soil which had not been used for agriculture for 7 years. In organic cropping system three combinations of microbiological fertiliser baktofil with zeolite and hydrogel were used prior to sowing. Half of each plot was treated with foliar microbiological fertiliser Slavol during crop growing period. In conventional cropping system three variants with mineral fertilisers were included: NPK, NPK+zeolite, NPK+hydrogel. Results of the yield obtained in the experiment showed a significant difference between two seasons, 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010. In comparison with the control, the treatments in an organic cropping system resulted with statistically insignificant differences for mean values in both years, while the mean in conventional cropping system has significantly higher yield of winter rye. Organic cropping system under conditions of Valjevo hilly region did not give significantly lower rye yield compared with the conventional one in a moderate growing season such was 2008 / 2009. The combination of soil microbiological fertiliser (Baktofil) with <b>foliar</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (Slavol) and zeolite gave the highest winter rye grain yield in all other treatments in the second year of investigation.

40|$|Boron is an {{essential}} element for higher plants and its fundamental role in plant vegetative growth and reproductive process is clearly recognised. Several studies report its crucial function in improving flower fertility and fruit setting percentage in olive. Deficiencies phenomena, responsible also for suboptimal yield, are observed in olive groves and are sometimes not identified. As {{recent studies have shown}} that B is mobile in the phloem of all species that utilize polyols as a primary photosynthetic metabolite, such as olive, then B deficiencies may be treated with foliar applications. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the efficacy of a <b>foliar</b> <b>fertiliser</b> containing B in increasing fruit set and yield in olive. The study was carried out in 2004 on an olive orchard, cv. Leccino, located in Southern Italy (BR), during a bearing year. A control was compared to a B fertilised treatment that received two foliar applications with a product containing 9 g B 100 g- 1, at 270 mg B L- 1, in pre and post anthesis. During the crop cycle, the fruit setting percentage, on 2 plants per plot and 2 shoots per cardinal direction and, at harvesting, the main quantitative yield parameters were determined. Total number of flowers and fruits per shoot varied significantly with shoot length and canopy exposition. Neither fruit set nor yield were influenced by B foliar application. Average values of 4. 29 and 4. 65 %, for fruit set percentage, and 32. 2 and 30. 6 kg olives per plot, for yield, were recorded, respectively for treated and not treated plants. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of different application timing and amounts and to assess plant response in low fruit load years...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to apply phosphorus (P) to the soil {{at the beginning of}} the crop growth cycle to provide essential P for early growth and to replace P exported in previous crops. With low rates of P added at sowing there may be sufficient P supply to grow crops to tillering, but in seasons of increased yield potential a top-up application of P may be required. Foliar P can be applied directly to the plant when required and in some cases have been shown to provide benefits for increasing P-use efficiency and the P concentration in grain. Wheat (Triticuum aestivum cv. Frame) was grown in two soils of marginal P status with soil moisture maintained at 80 % of field capacity. Seven foliar P treatments labelled with 33 P as a tracer were applied at Zadoks growth stage 39, at 1. 65 kg P/ha with 120 L water/ha equivalent. Grain, chaff and shoots were harvested to measure yield and then digested to measure P concentrations and 33 P activities. There was no crop response to top-up soil or foliar P on one soil, but on the other soil, foliar phosphoric acid plus adjuvant gave a 25 % wheat grain yield response. The use of the tracing technique enabled measurement of the portioning of <b>foliar</b> P <b>fertiliser</b> between stem, chaff and grain.

40|$|Agricultural practices, {{particularly}} land use, {{inputs and}} soil management, {{have a significant}} impact on the carbon cycle. Good management of agricultural practices may reduce carbon emissions and increase soil carbon sequestration. In this context, organic agricultural practices may have a positive role in mitigating environmental burden. Organic olive cultivation is increasing globally, particularly in Italy, which is ranked first worldwide for both organic olive production and cultivated area. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of agricultural practices in organic and conventional olive systems on global warming potential (GWP) from a life cycle perspective and to identify the hot spots in each system. The impacts assessed were associated with the efficiency of both systems at sequestering soil in order to calculate the net carbon flux. There was a higher environmental impact on GWP in the organic system because of higher global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from manure fertilisation rather than the synthetic <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisers</b> used in the conventional system. However, manure was the main reason behind the higher soil organic carbon (SOC) content and soil carbon sequestration in the organic system. Fertilisation activity was the main contributor to carbon emissions, accounting for approximately 80 % of total emissions in the organic system and 45 % in the conventional system. Conversely, given the similarity of other factors (land use, residues management, soil cover) that may affect soil carbon content, manure was the primary contributor to increased SOC in the organic system, resulting in a higher efficiency of carbon sequestration in the soil following the addition of soil organic matter. The contribution of the manure to increased SOC compensated for the higher carbon emission from the organic system, resulting in higher negative net carbon flux in the organic versus the conventional system (- 1. 7 vs - 0. 52 tCha- 1 year- 1, respectively) and higher efficiency of CO 2 mitigation in the organic system...|$|R
40|$|Tea {{plantations}} of Southdown estate are {{deficient in}} nutrients such as Copper, Magnesium, and Zinc. This was shown by leaf analysis done in 2012 to mature tea in several tea gardens of Southdown estate. These nutrients {{have been given}} little attention in Zimbabwe tea fertilizer recommendations despite their continual removal from the tea fields during harvesting. A study was therefore conducted to assess the effect of Copper, Magnesium and Zinc foliar fertilizers on yield and quality of tea at Southdown estate, Chipinge in Zimbabwe. The experiment was laid in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. The treatments were; no fertilizer application (control), Copper sulphate, Zinc oxide, Magnesium oxide and a combination of Copper sulphate, Magnesium oxide and Zinc oxide. The different foliar fertilizers affected yield (shoot weight and shoot density) significantly (P< 0. 05), Copper sulphate reduced the yield significantly, 27. 3 % lower than the control. Zinc oxide increased yield significantly, 23. 82 % higher than the control. Magnesium oxide {{did not have a}} significant effect on yield of tea. Tea quality parameters (brightness, briskness, colour of liquor, strength of liquor and milk take) were affected significantly (P< 0. 05) by the different foliar fertilizers. Copper sulphate gave the highest average score implying highest quality, whilst the control (no fertilizer application) gave the lowest total average score, thus the lowest yield. The different <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisers</b> increased the quality of tea. Results from this study showed that application of Copper sulphate results in increase in quality but not in yield. Application Zinc oxide increases both yield and quality of tea. Application of Magnesium oxide results in increase in quality but not yield. Application of the combination of Copper sulphate, Magnesium oxide and Zinc oxide only improved quality but not yield of tea. There is need for further researches on the different concentrations of foliar fertilizers to determine the best concentration which improves both quality and yield of tea. There is also need to repeat the experiment for more than one season and also in different sites...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{growing concern}} about {{the harmful effects of}} {{pesticides}} on humans and non-target organisms has resulted in an increasing demand from international markets for fruit that is produced using sustainable management systems. This study measured the effects of fungicides on population density and species richness of phylloplane microorganisms in apple orchards under different management systems. A secondary objective was to identify one or a few microorganisms that could be easily recognised by colony morphology and be used as bioindicators of sustainable orchard management. During the 1998 / 1999 season, a sampling, isolation and enumeration method was developed that determined the amount of natural variation in microorganism populations among trees, among locations within trees and between spring and autumn, in an unsprayed orchard. The results showed that during spring, the variation among trees, locations within trees, and dilution plates were responsible for 49, 39 and 12 percent, respectively, of the total variation. During autumn, the variation among trees, locations within trees, shoots, and dilution plates were responsible for 34, 0, 49 and 17 percent, respectively of the total variation. The information gained from the first study was used to modify the methods, which were used in a second study in 1999 / 2000, to compare microorganism populations from apple orchards under different management systems, at four times during the season. Three orchards followed ENZA-IFP (Integrated Fruit Production) requirements for export, three produced for the local market (IFP-local market) and two produced apples organically, complying with BIO-GRO standards. An unsprayed orchard was also included in the study. The results showed that populations increased during the season, by factors of 11, 47, 774 and 80 for bacteria, 'smooth yeasts', Aureobasidium spp. and filamentous fungi, respectively. Throughout the season, population densities of bacteria and 'smooth yeasts' were similar in all orchards (1 x 10 ⁵ to 1 X 10 ⁶ colony forming units per leaf [CFU/leaf]), whereas those of Aureobasidium spp. and filamentous fungi were lower in IFP orchards (about 1 x 10 ³ and 1 x 10 ⁴ CFU/leaf respectively) than in BIO-GRO and unsprayed orchards (3 x 10 ⁴ and 1 x 10 ⁵ CFU/leaf respectively). The mean species richness (number of recognisable taxonomic units per sample [RTU/sample]) varied from 5. 3 in IFP orchards to 6. 6 in the BIO-GRO and unsprayed orchards, but species richness was lower in IFP orchards (5) than in BIO-GRO and unsprayed orchards (13) during spring, and it increased during the season and became similar to that of BIO-GRO orchards in autumn. In a third study, the direct effects were determined of the fungicides, captan, copper hydroxide, myclobutanil, dodine, inorganic sulphur and a fish-based <b>foliar</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> on phylloplane microorganism populations. Products were sprayed four times during the 1999 / 2000 season, and the microorganism populations assessed immediately before treatment and at 1, 3 and 7 days after treatment. With all microorganisms combined there were significant differences (P≤ 0. 05) in the level of increase or decrease in microorganism populations among the four treatment dates, but differences among products were only significant at P≤ 0. l. 'Smooth yeasts', filamentous fungi and species richness, showed significant (P≤ 0. 05) changes in population densities due to foliar treatments. Although this trend was observed only in a few (3 / 60) cases, this indicates that a single isolated foliar application of a chemical product can affect microbial population densities and species richness. The effect of repetitive fungicide applications, different products and product combinations and insecticide use on non-target microorganism as applied in commercial situations requires further investigation. During the second and third study, Cladosporium spp. were identified as having potential to be suitable indicators of sustainable orchard management, because they were present in most orchards, during most of the growing season, and most often showed a significant response to orchard management systems and fungicide treatments...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{of disease}} {{epidemiology}} {{and the impact}} of plant nutrient status on development of disease is fundamental in establishing effective management strategies for crop pathogens such as Podosphaera aphanis Br. (Braun et al., 2002), the causal agent of powdery mildew on strawberries. The following study investigated the conditions conducive for powdery mildew in strawberry crops in South Australia, the effect of foliar concentration of potassium and calcium on yield and pathogen development on the strawberry cultivars Aromas (resistant to powdery mildew) and Selva (susceptible), the potential for use of foliar-applied potassium silicate to control disease and identification of genes differentially expressed during disease. Meteorological conditions associated with establishment of powdery mildew were observed over three consecutive seasons in commercial strawberry crops grown in Woodside, South Australia. Conducive conditions appear to be > 28 oC, 10 oC, > 90 % RH and no rain (for germination). Colony development was then promoted by days of > 15 oC and 8 oC, > 80 % RH and less than 2 mm rain in every 24 hour period. These are consistent with epidemiological studies of this pathogen (Peries, 1962 a; Jhooty and McKeen, 1964; Mukerji, 1968; Perera and Wheeler, 1975; Byrne et al, 2000; Miller et al, 2003; Blanco et al, 2004; Davik and Honne, 2005; Amsalem et al, 2006). This knowledge may facilitate prediction of times considered high risk for establishment of powdery mildew in strawberry crops. Subsequently, this may allow optimisation of fungicide application and improved management of this disease and reduced yield loss and management expenses. P. aphanis developed at an increased rate on leaves of Selva with low calcium content compared with development on normally fertilised leaves. Increased numbers of conidia germinated successfully on leaves of Aromas with low calcium content compared with development on normally fertilised Aromas leaves, however, the germinated conidia still failed to develop into sporulating colonies. Potassium nutrition had no obvious effect on P. aphanis development. Foliar concentration found to be adequate for growth of cultivars, Selva and Aromas were 6. 0 mg/g and 4. 5 mg/g Calcium, dry weight and 11. 0 mg/g and 12. 5 mg/g potassium, dry weight (respectively). Potassium silicate, buffered to pH 7. 0 and applied as a <b>foliar</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> reduced the severity of powdery mildew below the economic threshold, though not below the disease severity on plants treated with the fungicide, Systhane® (Bayer CropScience). As potassium silicate can be produced organically this compound may provide a useful management tool for both organic and conventional strawberry growers. Although the cultivar Aromas was not immune to disease under conducive conditions and high inoculum load in the field, inoculation of healthy Aromas plants with P. aphanis in the laboratory failed to produce disease. Conidia were seldom found attached to the leaf surface of healthy Aromas leaves. Germination and subsequent colony development were also not observed in inoculated samples. This suggests there is some mechanism of Aromas that inhibits development of this fungus. Preliminary investigation of differential expression in Aromas inoculated with P. aphanis, identified sequences with homology to a putative antimicrobial protein and photosynthesis-related genes. The results of these studies should enable growers to increase both crop yields and control of powdery mildew, one of the major economic diseases in South Australia. The epidemiological knowledge attained will be valuable, and may provide the basis for future forecast modelling for P. aphanis in strawberry crops in South Australia. Recommendations for calcium and potassium leaf content will allow growers to monitor their fertiliser regime for increased yield of these cultivars. Aromas was identified as a powdery mildew resistant cultivar potentially suitable for production in South Australia, and the genes associated with this resistance response may be used in studies of Fragaria species and breeding for powdery mildew resistant cultivars.

However, these claims are not supported by robust data indicating the necessity for a comprehensive research experiment in order to prove or disprove the hypothesis. A set of experiments was conducted to determine the herbicidal effect of steam in conjunction with two fish fertilisers and two vegetable oils, one containing high levels of omega- 3 and omega- 6 fatty acids and the other of low chemical reactivity, on a range of pasture plant species. No evidence of a systemic weed kill was found. Similar claims exist regarding the systemic effect of the organically certified contact herbicide Interceptor® in combination with steam. No experimental evidence was found for this either. It was considered that a solid refutation of the concept would be if steam heating plants prevented a systemic herbicide from working. An experiment testing this found that when applied immediately after steaming, Roundup® (glyphosate) was still effective. It can be concluded that while the idea that steam can turn fertilisers and contact herbicides into systemic ones can not entirely be refuted, there is no concrete scientific evidence to support the concept...|$|R
40|$|Food {{security}} {{for a growing}} population presents a significant challenge for crop production, with increasing pressures upon agriculutral productivity. There is a vast need to improve crop yield and quality using an efficient approach that does not present negative environmental impacts. A novel interrogation technique that is able to provide information of the overall health of a plant, would be extremely beneficial in an agriculutral, as well as research, setting. This information could be utilised {{to better understand the}} mechanisms of plant functions, including stress responses. Vibrational spectroscopy encompasses a range of techniques that are able to derive chemically specific information from a biological sample in a rapid, nondestructive and cost-effective manner. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy are two such approaches and have been readily implemented across biological samples. However, their applications in the field of plant science have been relatively underexploited. This is largely associated with the presence of water and fluorescent metabolites found in plant tissues. The application of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) -FTIR and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy for in vivo plant monitoring to elucidate spectral alterations indicative of healthy plant growth in a non-destructive manner. These approaches are able to characterise the biochemical signature of leaves at distinct developmental stages, and correspond to known biological processes within the leaf such as cell wall expansion. This information is useful prior to monitoring studies as normal leaf growth could be considered background variance. No significant local or systemic effects manifest as a consequence of interrogation with these techniques, establishing this as a non-destructive approach for plant system investigations. Raman microspectroscopy as a tool for monitoring nutrient uptake at the leaf surface is also considered, alongside complementary ion probe and elemental analysis. Such a technique is useful in the agrochemical production of <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> where the efficiency of specific formulae can be rapidly compared. This can also further the current understanding of nutrient transport into plant tissues, as well as translocation. Agriculturally relevant levels of calcium were applied to the leaf surface and uptake was successfully illustrated at concentrations as low as 15 mM using Raman microspectroscopy. Ion probe analysis also complemented these findings, with elemental analysis unable to detect this subtle uptake of nutrients. This assay is now being implemented in agrochemical practise as a fertiliser screening method. Deficiencies in essential nutrients such as calcium are detrimental to crop yield and thus are a potential target for improving crop production. A range of spectroscopic methods, including the use of synchrotron radiation, were utilised to presymptomatically detect these deficiencies prior to their onset in live samples. Coupled with multivariate analysis, these techniques discriminate between deficient and control samples with high sensitivity and specificity, without extensive sample preparation that traditional analytical techniques require. These results suggest that Raman and ATRFTIR spectroscopic approaches could highly valuable in the field, where plant health and nutrient status could be assessed rapidly in situ. Here it is shown that these issues can be overcome and that qualitative spectral measurements can be obtained from plant samples. Due to the non-destructive nature of these approaches, they can be applied for a wider range of crop screening investigations, including the efficiency of nutrient uptake, as well as distinguishing nutrient deficiencies presymptomatically. As such, these spectroscopic methods may be implemented to unearth further details regarding nutrient use efficiency during crop production...|$|R
30|$|The wood density {{model is}} {{intended}} to be applied to stands that are not being fertilised. The adjusted soil C/N ratio reflects the effects of land use history differences on soil nitrogen fertility and hence on wood density. Use of this model therefore implies that all rings from pith-to-bark have low density if the outerwood density is low, or conversely, that all rings will have a high density if the outerwood density is high. This site-determined pattern is clearly evident in the within-tree density trends illustrated in Kimberley et al. (2017). In contrast, fertilised stands exhibit an ephemeral reduction in wood density of between 5 and 16 %, which persists as long as foliar N levels are elevated in response to fertilisation (Jozsa and Brix 1989; Erickson and Lambert 1958; Erickson and Harrison 1974). Given the generally ephemeral nature of <b>foliar</b> responses to <b>fertiliser</b> additions, applying the new wood density model, which was developed using data from unfertilised stands, to fertilised stands is unlikely to lead to significant prediction errors.|$|R
