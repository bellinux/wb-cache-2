Kioe Lie, meanwhile, has become the manager of a tapioca factory, but is planning to leave for competing business run by Tjio Tam Bing, who has offered him twice the salary. Kioe Gie asks him to reconsider, or at least not take any customers, but Kioe Lie is set on his goals. Before Kioe Lie leaves, the brothers discuss marriage: since Kioe Lie has no <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Hap Nio soon, Kioe Gie asks permission to marry first. Though Kioe Lie disapproves of Kioe Gie's sweetheart, a poor orphan girl named Oeij Ijan Nio, he agrees.|$|E
500|$|After the {{boarding}} school was discontinued in 1850, Liliʻuokalani {{lived with her}} hānai parents at Haleʻākala, which she referred to in later life as her childhood home. Around this time, her hānai sister Pauahi married the American Charles Reed Bishop against the wishes of their parents but reconciled with them shortly before Pākī's death in 1855. Kōnia died two years afterward and Liliʻuokalani came under the Bishops' guardianship. During this period, Liliʻuokalani {{became a part of}} the young social elite under the reign of Kamehameha IV who ascended to throne in 1855. In 1856, Kamehameha IV announced his <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Emma Rooke, one of their classmates. However, according to Liliʻuokalani, certain elements of the court argued [...] "there is no other chief equal to you in birth and rank but the adopted daughter of Paki," [...] which infuriated the King and brought the Queen to tears. Despite this upset, Liliʻuokalani was regarded as a close friend of the new Queen, and she served as a maid of honor during the royal wedding alongside Princess Victoria Kamāmalu and Mary Pitman. At official state occasions, she served as an attendant and lady-in-waiting in Queen Emma's retinue. Visiting British dignitaries Lady Franklin and her niece Sophia Cracroft noted in 1861 that the [...] "Honble. Lydia Paki" [...] was [...] "the highest unmarried woman in the Kingdom".|$|E

Erik then took her to her father's house and announced his <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Gunnhild. The older Fagrskinna, however, says simply that Erik met Gunnhild during an expedition to the Finnish north, where she was being [...] "fostered and educated ... with Mǫttull, king of the Finns".

Gethin is taken aback, then spitefully reminds her of the Prothero luck and the promise her ancestors made. He storms out of the cottage, leaving the group behind. Soon after, Mari and her newfound friends cook up a scheme by which she is wed forcibly to Idwal, and the two are married and soon Mari is happily pregnant.|$|R

2500|$|After {{same-sex}} marriage became legal in 2014, Archbishop Kari Mäkinen announced {{his support for}} gay marriage. In 2016, the Synod did not authorize a rite for {{same-sex marriage}}, but did, as before, allow pastors [...] "to pray with and for all couples who have entered into a civil [...] marriage". Therefore, while the bishops did not agree to performing same-sex marriages, [...] "the bishops have taken the position {{that it is possible}} to hold prayer services to bless same-sex couples." [...] The bishops' announcement also said that [...] " [...] change to marriage laws means that members of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church, persons in high office and workers stand with same-sex [...] in marriage." [...] Some clergy announced their <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> same-gender couples arguing that [...] "public servant's rights grant [...] the possibility of marrying same-sex couples". Nevertheless, the Diocese of Helsinki disciplined a pastor for performing a same-sex marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The king's {{personal}} {{life was a}} frequent source of discontent not just amongst Dutch politicians and occasionally the populace, but also abroad (he became exceptionally notorious for his exhibitionism at Lake Geneva). His solitary decision, {{a few weeks after}} Queen Sophie of Württemberg's death, to raise French opera singer Emilie Ambre to 'comtesse d'Ambroise', granting her a luxurious residence in Rijswijk and expressing the <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> her without the cabinet's consent, led to political upheaval. His cousin Prince Frederick demanded William to abdicate if he were to continue his plans. Eventually, William conceded and married 20-year-old Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont instead. All of these actions gave the monarchy a bad name, so much so that throughout the 1880s there were serious calls to abolish the kingship. Outspoken republican writers, journalists and their publishers were increasingly Socialist such as Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis (together with Sicco Roorda van Eysinga thought to be behind the 1887 anonymous libel against William III, titled [...] "From the Life of King Gorilla"). Unlike his father though, William III would not pay to keep his critics silent, but had them arrested and jailed or exiled. Seeing the rise of Socialism as a threat, several Liberals who had been traditionally republican, started the Orangist countermovement. The death of William III, who had no male successor (his sons William and Alexander died in 1879 and 1884, respectively), was seized on by Luxembourg to declare its independence by breaking the personal union with the Netherlands {{on the grounds of the}} lex Salica; however, via the Nassau-Weilburg branch, the monarchy was continued there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Lebanon is {{perceived}} to be suffering from excessive nurse migration, low job satisfaction, poor retention and high turnover. Little is known about the magnitude of nurse migration and predictors of <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the extent of nurses' <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave and examine the impact of job satisfaction on <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave. <b>Intent</b> <b>to</b> leave was explored to differentiate between nurses who intend to leave their current hospital and those intending to leave the country. Methods A cross-sectional design was used to survey nurses currently practicing in Lebanese hospitals. A total of 1, 793 nurses employed in 69 hospitals were surveyed. Questions included those relating <b>to</b> demographic characteristics, <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave, and the McCloskey Mueller Satisfaction Scale. Univariate descriptive statistics were conducted on sample's demographic characteristics including gender, age, marital status and educational level. Bivariate associations between <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave and demographic characteristics were tested using Pearson Chi-square. Differences in satisfaction scores between nurses with and without <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave were tested using t-test and ANOVA f-test. A multinomial logistic regression model was created <b>to</b> predict <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave the hospital and <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave the country. Results An alarming 67. 5 % reported <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave within the next 1 to 3 years, many of whom disclosed <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave the country (36. 7 %). Within nurses who reported an <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave the hospital but stay in Lebanon, 22. 1 % plan to move to a different health organization in Lebanon, 29. 4 % plan to leave the profession and 48. 5 % had other plans. Nurses reported being least satisfied with extrinsic rewards. A common predictor of <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave the hospital and the country was dissatisfaction with extrinsic rewards. Other predictors of <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave (country or hospital) included age, gender, marital status, degree type, and dissatisfaction with scheduling, interaction opportunities, and control and responsibility. Conclusion Study findings demonstrate linkages between job satisfaction, <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave, and migration in a country suffering from a nursing shortage. Findings can be used by health care managers and policy makers in managing job satisfaction, <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> leave and nurse migration. </p...|$|R
