25|$|There {{are many}} {{threading}} processes including: cutting threads with a tap or die, thread milling, single-point thread cutting, thread rolling, cold root rolling and forming, and thread grinding. A tap {{is used to}} cut a <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> on the inside surface of a pre-drilled hole, while a die cuts a male thread on a preformed cylindrical rod.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood. There {{is no need for}} any force to push the bit into the workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a bit for a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.|$|E

5000|$|Jointing threads: These are {{pipe threads}} where pressure-tightness is made through the mating of two threads together. They always use a taper male thread, but can have either {{parallel}} or taper <b>female</b> <b>threads.</b> (International standards require all <b>female</b> <b>threads</b> to be parallel.) ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{roots and}} crests of mating male and <b>female</b> <b>threads</b> need {{clearance}} {{to ensure that}} the sloped sides of the V meet properly despite (a) error in pitch diameter and (b) dirt and nick-induced burrs.|$|R
50|$|Usually the {{standoff}} has a #6-32 UNC male thread {{on one end}} which screws into a threaded hole in the case or motherboard backplate, and a #6-32 UNC <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> in the other end which accepts a screw to retain the motherboard. Less often, {{the standoff}} has a <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> in both ends and a second screw is used to attach it to the case. Some standoffs use the M3 <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> (which faces the motherboard) instead of #6-32 UNC, and on a rare occasion a mixture of types {{can be used in}} the same case.|$|E

5000|$|The pipe {{segments}} (called [...] "joints") {{are typically}} about 40 ft in length, male threaded on each end and connected with short lengths of double-female threaded pipe called couplings. (Some specialty casing is manufactured {{in one piece}} with a <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> machined directly into one end.) ...|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve a}} predictably {{successful}} mating {{of male and}} <b>female</b> <b>threads</b> and assured interchangeability between males and between females, standards for form, size, and finish must exist and be followed. Standardization of threads is discussed below.|$|R
50|$|Threadolets {{are like}} {{different}} olets; the main contrast {{is that this}} olet is furnished with <b>female</b> <b>threaded</b> connection. No welding is required in this association. These are regularly created in 3000 and 6000 pressure weight class.|$|R
50|$|Every {{matched pair}} of threads, {{external}} and internal, {{can be described}} as male and female. For example, a screw has male threads, while its matching hole (whether in nut or substrate) has <b>female</b> <b>threads.</b> This property is called gender.|$|R
5000|$|C-mount lenses {{provide a}} male thread, which mates with a <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> on the camera. The thread is {{nominally}} 1.000 in in diameter, with 32 threads per inch, designated as [...] "1-32 UN 2A" [...] in the ANSI B1.1 standard for unified screw threads. The flange focal distance is 17.526 mm for a C mount.|$|E

50|$|British Standard Pipe (BSP) is {{a family}} of {{technical}} standards for screw threads that has been adopted internationally for interconnecting and sealing pipes and fittings by mating an external (male) thread with an internal (<b>female)</b> <b>thread.</b> It has been adopted as standard in plumbing and pipe fitting, except in the United States, where NPT and related threads are the standard used.|$|E
5000|$|Truncation is {{achieved}} by using a slightly larger [...] {{in the case of}} <b>female</b> <b>threads,</b> or by slightly reducing the diameter of the threaded area of workpiece in the case of male threads, the latter effectively reducing the thread's major diameter. In the case of <b>female</b> <b>threads,</b> tap drill charts typically specify sizes that will produce an approximate 75 percent thread. A 60 percent thread may be appropriate in cases where high tensile loading will not be expected. In both cases, the pitch diameter is not affected. The balancing of truncation versus thread strength is similar to many engineering decisions involving the strength, weight and cost of material, as well as the cost to machine it.|$|R

2500|$|Thread {{engagement}} is {{the length}} or {{number of threads}} that are engaged between the screw and the <b>female</b> <b>threads.</b> Bolted joints are designed so that the bolt shank fails in tension before the threads fail in shear, but for this to hold true, a minimum thread engagement must be achieved. The following equation defines this minimum thread engagement: ...|$|R
50|$|A double-tapped bushing is {{more compact}} than a reducer, {{but not as}} flexible. While a double-tapped bushing has a smaller <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> {{concentric}} to a larger male thread (and thus couples a smaller male end to a larger female), a reducer may have large and small ends of either gender. If both ends are the same gender, it is a gender-changing reducer.|$|E
5000|$|Where Le is {{the thread}} {{engagement}} length, At is the tensile stress area, D {{is the major}} diameter of the screw, and p is the pitch.

If {{they are not the}} same, then the following equations can be used to determine the additional thread length that is required: ...|$|E
50|$|In an {{external}} (male) thread (e.g., on a bolt), the major diameter Dmaj and the minor diameter Dmin define maximum {{dimensions of the}} thread. This means that the external thread must end flat at Dmaj, but can be rounded out below the minor diameter Dmin. Conversely, in an internal (<b>female)</b> <b>thread</b> (e.g., in a nut), the major and minor diameters are minimum dimensions, therefore the thread profile must end flat at Dmin but may be rounded out beyond Dmaj.|$|E
50|$|The {{uninterrupted}} {{flow path}} of impact heads makes them {{less vulnerable to}} damage and clogging by dirt and sand in the water. Thus, they are suitable for systems fed by well water.One defining feature of impact heads is they almost always have male pipe threads, {{as opposed to the}} <b>female</b> <b>threads</b> found on virtually all other sprinkler types.|$|R

50|$|A faucet aerator can be {{classified}} {{on the basis of}} its flow rate and the type of water stream (aerated, non-aerated, spray) it produces.In general, standard-sized aerators are available with female (M22x1) or male threading (M24x1). Bathtub spouts often have a bigger diameter with a male M28x1 thread. The United States use different thread sizes: 15/16"-27 for standard-sized male and 55/64"-27 for standard-sized <b>female</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
50|$|A screw is an {{inclined}} plane {{wrapped around a}} nail. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> (internal thread), often {{in the form of}} a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it. Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted. The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.|$|E
50|$|A tee, {{the most}} common pipe fitting, is used to combine (or divide) fluid flow. It is {{available}} with <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> sockets, solvent-weld sockets or opposed solvent-weld sockets and a female-threaded side outlet. Tees can connect pipes of different diameters or change {{the direction of a}} pipe run, or both. Available in a variety of materials, sizes and finishes, they may also be used to transport two-fluid mixtures. Tees may be equal or unequal in size of their three connections, with equal tees {{the most common}}.|$|E
5000|$|A {{split nut}} is a nut that is split {{lengthwise}} into two pieces (opposed halves) {{so that its}} <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> may be opened and closed over the male thread of a bolt or leadscrew. This allows the nut, when open, to move along the screw without the screw turning (or, vice versa, to allow the screw {{to pass through the}} nut without turning). Then, when the nut is closed, it resumes the normal movement of a nut on a screw (in which axial travel is linked to rotational travel) ...|$|E

25|$|Inspection of the {{finished}} screw threads can be achieved in various ways, with {{the expense of the}} method tailored to the requirements of the product application. Shop-floor inspection of a thread is often as simple as running a nut onto it (for male threads) or a bolt into it (for <b>female</b> <b>threads).</b> This is plenty good enough for many applications (e.g., MRO or hobbyist work), although it is not good enough for most commercial manufacturing. Higher-precision methods are discussed below.|$|R
50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal <b>female</b> <b>thread,</b> with the male externally threaded screw shaft extending from that. The threaded-head type {{can be used to}} panel-mount one connector and provide a means to attach the mating connector to the first connector.|$|E

5000|$|The thread {{standard}} for garden hose connectors in the United States, its territories and Canada {{is known as}} [...] "garden hose thread" [...] (GHT), which is 3/4 in diameter straight (non-tapered) thread with a pitch of 11.5 threads per inch (TPI). The <b>female</b> <b>thread</b> is abbreviated FHT and the male part MHT which has an outer diameter of 1+1/16 in. This fitting is used with -inch, -inch, and -inch hoses. In other countries, a British Standard Pipe (BSP) thread is used, which is [...] inch and 14 TPI (male part outside diameter is 26.441 mm). The GHT and BSP standards are not compatible, and attempting to connect a GHT hose to a BSP fitting will damage the threads, and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|In photography, {{a tripod}} {{is used to}} {{stabilize}} and elevate a camera, a flash unit, or other photographic equipment. All photographic tripods have three legs and a mounting head to couple with a camera. The mounting head usually includes a thumbscrew that mates to a <b>female</b> <b>threaded</b> receptacle on the camera, {{as well as a}} mechanism to be able to rotate and tilt the camera when it is mounted on the tripod. Tripod legs are usually made to telescope, in order to save space when not in use. Tripods are usually made from aluminum, carbon fiber, steel, wood or plastic.|$|R
50|$|A barb (or hose barb), which connects {{flexible}} hose or tubing to pipes, typically has a male-threaded end which mates with <b>female</b> <b>threads.</b> The {{other end of}} the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tube—a long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a {{flexible hose}}. An adjustable worm drive screw clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|R
