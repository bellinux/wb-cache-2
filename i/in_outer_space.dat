Flying through a nebula involves impaired vision, and occasional disruptions to flight electronics. Nebulae have become known as an eerie and suspenseful arena of play.|$|E

5|$|While {{promoting}} Stargate in Europe, Emmerich came up {{with the}} idea for the film when fielding a question about his own belief in the existence of alien life.

Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in Sonic Colors, Doctor Eggman is left {{stranded}} <b>in</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> with his robot henchmen Orbot and Cubot.

The two convert it to a robot to erase their past defeats from history. The Time Eater proceeds to attack Classic Sonic as he travels through Green Hill {{at the beginning of the}} original Sonic the Hedgehog, and interrupts a birthday celebration being held for the present ("Modern") Sonic by his friends, scattering them. Modern Sonic awakens in White Space and rescues Tails after traveling through Green Hill.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Kitchen O'Neill (February 6, 1927 â€“ April 27, 1992) was an American {{physicist}} and space activist. As {{a faculty member}} of Princeton University, he invented a device called the particle storage ring for high-energy physics experiments. Later, he invented a magnetic launcher called the mass driver. In the 1970s, he developed a plan to build human settlements <b>in</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> including a space habitat design known as the O'Neill cylinder. He founded the Space Studies Institute, an organization devoted to funding research into space manufacturing and colonization.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic {{molecules}} discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation {{left over from}} the big bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors. Additionally, there are signs of human life <b>in</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft.

5|$|Super Mario Galaxy is set <b>in</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space,</b> where Mario {{travels through}} {{different}} galaxies to collect Power Stars, earned by completing missions, defeating a boss, or reaching a particular area. Each galaxy contains planetoids and orbiting structures for the player to explore. Each astronomical object {{has its own}} gravitational force, allowing the player to completely circumnavigate the planetoids, walking sideways or upside down. The player can usually jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby. Although the main gameplay is in 3D, there are several areas in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2-dimensional plane.|$|E
5|$|The Outer Space Treaty {{provides}} the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of outer space the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states {{to explore and}} {{is not subject to}} claims of national sovereignty. It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons <b>in</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2008 the treaty has been ratified by 98 states and signed by an additional 27 states.|$|E

5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma <b>in</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before <b>in</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space).</b> This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond {{to each other in}} various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) â€” which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth â€” in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E
5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter <b>in</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E
