40|$|Multi-robot {{foraging}} {{has been}} widely studied in the literature, and the general assumption is that the robots are simple, i. e., with limited processing and carrying capacity.

We formally define the multi-robot <b>item</b> <b>delivery</b> problem and show that the continuous foraging problem is a special case of it. We contribute distributed multi-robot algorithms that solve the <b>item</b> <b>delivery</b> and foraging problems and describe how our shared world model is synchronized across the multi-robot team.
