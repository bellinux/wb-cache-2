5000|$|B. burgdorferi is {{a highly}} specialized, motile, two-membrane, flat-waved spirochete, ranging from about 9 to 32 {{micrometers}} in length. Because of its double-membrane envelope, it is often mistakenly described as Gram negative, though it stains weakly in Gram stain. The bacterial membranes in at least the B31, NL303 and N40 strains of B. burgdorferi do not contain lipopolysaccharide, which is extremely atypical for Gram negative bacteria; instead, the membranes contain glycolipids. [...] However, the membranes in the B31 strain {{have been found to}} contain a lipopolysaccharide-like component. B. burgdorferi is a microaerophilic organism, requiring little oxygen to survive. Unlike most bacteria, B. burgdorferi does not use iron, hence avoiding the difficulty of acquiring iron during infection. [...] It lives primarily as an <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogen,</b> although in vitro it can also hide intracellularly (see Mechanisms of persistence section).|$|E
40|$|The <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogen</b> enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) uses a type III {{secretion}} {{system to}} inhibit its uptake by macrophages. We show that EPEC antiphagocytosis {{is independent of}} the translocated intimin receptor Tir and occurs by preventing F-actin polymerization required for bacterial uptake. EPEC–macrophage contact triggered activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI)   3 -kinase, which was subsequently inhibited in a type III secretion-dependent manner. Inhibition of PI  3 -kinase significantly reduced uptake of a secretion-deficient mutant, without affecting antiphagocytosis by the wild type, suggesting that EPEC blocks a PI  3 -kinase-dependent phagocytic pathway. EPEC specifically inhibited Fcγ receptor- but not CR 3 -receptor mediated phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan. We showed that EPEC inhibits PI  3 -kinase activity rather than its recruitment {{to the site of}} bacterial contact. Phago cytosis of a secretion mutant correlated with the association of PI  3 -kinase with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, which wild-type EPEC prevented. These results show that EPEC blocks its uptake by inhibiting a PI  3 -kinase-mediated pathway, and translocates effectors other than Tir to interfere with actin-driven host cell processes. This constitutes a novel mechanism of phagocytosis avoidance by an <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogen...</b>|$|E

We challenged wild-type and eiger mutant flies with a collection of facultative intracellular and <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogens,</b> including a fungus and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The response of eiger mutants divided these microbes into two groups: eiger mutants are immunocompromised with respect to <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogens</b> but show no change or reduced sensitivity to facultative intracellular pathogens. Hence, eiger helps fight infections but also can cause pathology.

40|$|The {{neutrophil}} is {{the major}} phagocyte and the final effector cell of the innate immunity, with a primary role in the clearance of <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Using the broad array of cytokines, extracellular traps, and effector molecules as the humoral arm, neutrophils {{play a crucial role}} in the host defense against pathogen infections. On the other hand, the pathogen has the capacity to overcome neutrophil-mediated host defense to establish infection causing human disease. Pathogens, such as S. aureus, have the potential to thwart neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis and thereby succeed in evading killing by neutrophils. Furthermore, S. aureus surviving within neutrophils promotes neutrophil cytolysis, resulting in the release of host-derived molecules that promote local inflammation. Here, we provide a detailed overview of the mechanisms by which neutrophils kill the <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogens</b> and how pathogens evade neutrophils degradation.

We investigated the interaction between the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii and the bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus. We found that Acanthamoeba castellanii does not prey on Vibrio parahaemolyticus but instead secretes a factor that promotes the survival of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in coculture.

40|$|Abstract: A classic proinflammatory T {{helper cell}} type 1 (TH 1) {{response}} directed against intracellu-lar pathogens includes the cytokine osteopontin, which acts predominantly on macrophages, where it induces the secretion of interleukin (IL) - 12 and suppresses the secretion of IL- 10. As cell-mediated immune responses {{play an important}} role in the resistance to Lyme arthritis, a manifestation of in-fection by the <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogen</b> Borrelia burgdorferi, we tested the hypothesis that os-teopontin may be required to induce TH 1 re-sponses and inflammation. The role of osteopontin was tested in vivo and using ex vivo macrophages in B 6129 F 3 mice susceptible to experimental Lyme arthritis. Mice of this genetic background and those fully backcrossed to C 57 BL/ 6, which lacked osteopontin expression (spp 1 /), were as suscep-tible to B. burgdorferi-induced arthritis as litter-mate controls. Furthermore, equal numbers of spi-rochetes, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of the B. burgdorferi gene recA in spp 1 / and B 6129 F 3 wild-type littermates, sug-gested that susceptibility to infection was not de-pendent on this cytokine. Neither of the B 6129 F 3 parental mouse strains lacked the ability to secrete osteopontin. spp 1 /mice and controls had immu-noglobulin G 2 titers, suggestive of a TH 1 response. B. burgdorferi was able to directly stimulate the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL- 12 and tumor necrosis factor from wild-type and spp 1 / macrophages alike. These results indicate that the usually critical role of osteopontin in the induction of cellular immune responses to intracel-lular pathogens was circumvented by the ability of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogen</b> B. burgdorferi to induce macrophages directly to produce proinflammatory cytokines.

Although S. aureus has conventionally been considered an <b>extracellular</b> <b>pathogen,</b> much evidence demonstrates that it can survive intracellularly. In this Opinion article, we propose that phagocytes, and specifically neutrophils, represent a privileged site for S. aureus in the bloodstream, offering protection from most antibiotics and providing a mechanism by which the bacterium can travel to and infect distant sites. Furthermore, we suggest how this can be experimentally confirmed and how it may prompt a change in the current paradigm of S. aureus bacteraemia and identify better treatment options for improved clinical outcomes...|$|E

In this study, we have examined the processing of iron by the reticuloendothelial system during infection. Normal and hypoferremic meningococcus-infected mice were injected with 59 Fe-labeled erythrocytes. Kinetics of uptake and redistribution of the label indicated that during the hypoferremic phase of the infection, reticuloendothelial system-processed iron was not returned to the plasma transferrin pool. Fractionation of hepatic cellular compartments showed that this impaired release of iron resulted from a preferential incorporation of heme-derived iron into the intracellular ferritin pool during the hypoferremic phase of the infection.
