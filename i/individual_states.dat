5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} {{argument}} in favor of the sovereignty of the <b>individual</b> <b>states,</b> for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the <b>individual</b> <b>states</b> were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E

5|$|The Minority Treaties, {{recognized}} as history's first minority treaties, were {{an important step}} in protection of minorities and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized that there are people living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within <b>individual</b> <b>states</b> itself may not be sufficient.

5|$|To {{finance the}} war, the Confederate {{government}} initially issued bonds, but investment {{from the public}} never met the demands.

5|$|Although the {{liberalization}} of sexuality in American film had increased during the 1920s, the pre-Code era is either dated {{to the start of}} the sound film era, or more generally to March 1930, when the Hays Code was first written. Over the protests of NAMPI, New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in Mutual Film vs. Ohio by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the next year, and eight <b>individual</b> <b>states</b> had a board by the advent of sound film.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins be struck by the <b>individual</b> <b>states.</b> Since there were no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E
5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v.
