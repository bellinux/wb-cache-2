The role of endogenously expressed miRNA in downregulating gene expression was first described in C. elegans in 1993. In plants this function was discovered when the [...] "JAW microRNA" [...] of Arabidopsis was shown {{to be involved in the}} regulation of several genes that control plant shape. In plants, the majority of genes regulated by miRNAs are transcription factors; thus miRNA activity is particularly wide-ranging and regulates entire gene networks during development by modulating the expression of key regulatory genes, including transcription factors as well as F-box proteins. In many organisms, including humans, miRNAs are linked to the formation of tumors and dysregulation of the cell cycle. Here, miRNAs can function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors.|$|E

2500|$|While {{these are}} the three [...] "main" [...] checkpoints, not all cells have to pass through each of these checkpoints in this order to replicate. Many types of cancer are caused by {{mutations}} that allow the cells to speed through the various checkpoints or even skip them altogether. Going from S to M to S phase almost consecutively. Because these cells have lost their checkpoints, any DNA mutations that may have occurred are disregarded and {{passed on to the}} daughter cells. This is one reason why cancer cells have a tendency to exponentially accrue mutations. Aside from cancer cells, many fully <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> types no longer replicate so they leave the cell cycle and stay in G0 until their death. Thus removing the need for cellular checkpoints. An alternative model of the cell cycle response to DNA damage has also been proposed, known as the postreplication checkpoint.|$|E
40|$|SummaryHuman {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) are highly sensitive to DNA damage and have low survival ability relative to <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells.</b> We investigated {{the source of this}} difference by comparing damage response pathways in hESCs and <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells.</b> We found that hESCs undergo more rapid p 53 -dependent apoptosis after DNA damage than <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells</b> do. However, p 53 localization and function are similar between hESCs and <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells,</b> suggesting that p 53 alone cannot explain the difference in sensitivity. Instead, we show that mitochondrial readiness for apoptosis, known as mitochondrial priming, differs between hESCs and <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells.</b> Specifically, the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins is shifted closer to the apoptotic threshold in hESCs than in <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells.</b> Altering this balance in <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells</b> increases their sensitivity and results in cell death, suggesting that manipulation of mitochondrial priming could potentially alter the sensitivity of other stem cells, including cancer stem cells...|$|R
