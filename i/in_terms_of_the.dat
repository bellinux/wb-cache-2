The second one is given <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> a Newton polytope associated to the vector field.

5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E
