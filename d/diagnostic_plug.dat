40|$|<b>Diagnostic</b> <b>plug</b> for the ITER core charge {{exchange}} recombination spectroscopy (core CXRS) {{is located in}} the upper port 3. It transfers the light emitted by interaction of plasma ions with the diagnostic neutral beam (DNB). Conceptual design study of the core CXRS port plug has indicated several challenging technical problems: (1) likely too short lifetime of the first mirror, (2) quite contradictory requirements to the first mirror holder, (3) harsh environmental conditions for the "shutter", that is a movable element protecting the first mirror, (4) a task to combine a sufficient structural integrity and nuclear shielding capability of the plug with a wide enough optical path, (5) excessive electromagnetic loads caused by the halo current and applied at the plug as a whole. This paper describes possible design solutions for the listed technical problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{polarimeter}} {{system for}} ITER features 10 viewing chords covering almost the full poloidal {{cross section of}} the plasma in a fan-like arrangement. The 10 laser beams all enter the plasma via 150 mm diam penetrations through the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>plug</b> at the low-field side. Small retroreflectors at the high-field side mirror the laser beams back towards the penetrations at the low-field side. Extensive feasibility calculations have led {{to the conclusion that the}} optimum wavelength for the polarimeter is around 100 mu m. At this wavelength counterproductive effects like refraction and electron cyclotron absorption are negligibly small. However, the anticipated Faraday rotation angles are still very large, such that several important plasma parameters can be measured within the requirements set by the ITER team. In this article the status of the conceptual design of the polarimeter system for ITER will be presented. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. [S 0034 - 6748 (99) 63801 - 1]...|$|E

40|$|ITER <b>diagnostic</b> port <b>plugs</b> perform many functionsincluding {{structural}} support of diagnostic systems under high electromagnetic loads while allowing for diagnostic {{access to the}} plasma. The design of <b>diagnostic</b> equatorial port <b>plugs</b> (EPP) are largely driven by electromagnetic loads and associate responses of EPP structure during plasma disruptions and VDEs. This paper summarizes results of transient electromagnetic analysis using Opera 3 d {{in support of the}} design activities for ITER diagnostic EPP. A complete distribution of disruption loads on the Diagnostic First Walls (DFWs), Diagnostic Shield Modules (DSMs) and the EPP structure, as well as impact on the system design integration due to electrical contact among various EPP structural components are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} component concepts {{developed for}} the ITER core charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (cCXRS). They {{are based on the}} cCXRS layout of 2009, named as reference design option. It includes an outer shell, carrying a blanket shield module and a shielding cassette. The cassette, attached to the outer shell, carries secondary mirrors and a retractable tube. The tube holds a first mirror (M 1) and a shutter. Development priority is given to the M 1, M 1 holder, shutter, calibration system and retractable tube. These units are the most critical from reliability point of view. The developed design approaches could be likely used as generic or prototype solutions for a cCXRS <b>diagnostic</b> port <b>plug</b> in future. Before prototyping critical components as the M 1 holder and shutter, the final cCXRS conceptual design has to meet forthcoming changes in the ITER <b>diagnostic</b> upper port <b>plug</b> (UPP) and blanket system. The integrated first wall - diagnostic shield modules, first wall recession, blanket shaping and generic UPP layout have considerable impact on the layout of the cCXRS and its components. The paper presents a preliminary solution for integration of the customized reference cCXRS into expected ITER blanket and UPP layouts. © 2011 FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JULICH GMBH-EURATOM-FZJ...|$|R
40|$|In 2010 the ITER Organization (IO) {{proposed}} {{to eliminate the}} beryllium armour on the plasma-facing surface of the <b>diagnostic</b> port <b>plugs</b> and instead to use bare stainless steel (SS), simplifying the design and providing significant cost reduction. Transport simulations at the IO confirmed that charge-exchange sputtering of the SS surfaces would not affect burning plasma operation through core impurity contamination, but a second key issue is the potential melt damage/material loss inflicted by the intense photon radiation flashes expected at the thermal quench of disruptions mitigated by massive gas injection. This paper addresses this second issue {{through a combination of}} ITER relevant experimental heat load tests and qualitative theoretical arguments of melt layer stability. It demonstrates that SS can be employed as material for the port plug plasma-facing surface and this has now been adopted into the ITER baselin...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this computational engineering design study is to assess whether the ITER confined plasma will be adversely affected if the <b>diagnostic</b> port <b>plug</b> and tritium breeding module plasma-facing surfaces are left as bare stainless steel or armoured with W, rather than with Be as {{on the rest of}} the main chamber first wall. The OSM-EIRENE-DIVIMP code package is employed to determine the 2 D steady-state impurity distribution, after benchmarking the OSM plasma calculations against reference SOLPS simulations. For far-SOL transport, the computational domain is extended to explicitly include plasma contact with the wall. To sample a large area of the foreseen ITER parameter space, a range of boundary plasmas are assigned via OSM based on observed experimental trends, including radial decay lengths, parallel flows, and pedestal profiles. Taking core impurity limits from ASTRA simulations, the results indicate that Be cladding of the port plugs under consideration is not required, with the proviso that neutral particle injection directly in front of the ports is avoided.

40|$|The {{development}} of components for fusion devices includes numerous simulations to validate their design compatibility with specified loads according to applicable codes and standards. The strategy of multifield finite element analyses {{is determined by}} the iterative nature of the design process. The level of structural complexity dictates the analytical approaches and modeling techniques. Even though nowadays powerful software exploiting the performance of modern computers allows structures to be simulated in a very detailed way, direct meshing of CAD models with all their complexity is often not beneficial for nonlinear and multifield analyses. Reasonable modeling simplifications, submodeling, and integration with analytical modeling and testing can optimize the analysis process. This paper gives examples of simplified modeling for engineering purposes with a clear understanding of the analysis goal and the role of simulations in the design process, such as for the W 7 -X stellarator busbar system. Engineering methods to perform multifield analyses including electromagnetic transients for ITER <b>diagnostic</b> port <b>plug</b> components are also presented. An engineering material model is discussed for calculating the superconducting coil steel structures operating in the inelastic range...|$|R
40|$|The Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) is {{studied as}} a {{powerful}} tool to detect hard or soft faults in star-shaped networks of nonuniform lossless transmission lines. Processing the FDR measurements leads to solve an inverse scattering problem for a Schrodinger operator on a star-shaped graph. Throughout this paper, we restrict ourselves {{to the case of}} minimal experimental setup corresponding to only one <b>diagnostic</b> port <b>plug.</b> First, by studying the asymptotic behavior of the reflection coefficient in the high-frequency limit, we prove the identifiability of the geometry of this star-shaped graph: the number of edges and their lengths. The proof being rather constructive, it provides a method to detect the hard faults in the network. Next, we study the potential identification problem by inverse scattering, noting that the potentials represent the inhomogeneities due to the soft faults in the network wirings. Here, the main result states that the measurement of two reflection coefficients, associated to two different sets of boundary conditions at the extremities of the tree, determines uniquely the potentials; it is a generalization of the theorem of the two boundary spectra on an interval...|$|R
40|$|Inter-Vehicles Networks (IVNs) {{have emerged}} as a new envi-ronment for {{intelligent}} transportation applications. Usually, some mortal accidents are mainly caused by human errors, because {{it is difficult for}} a driver to be aware of road context. An embedded system to collect important context informa-tion like the ABS triggering and warn drivers in order to improve the safety of driving is required. In this paper, a context-aware embedded system was designed and imple-mented to deploy context-aware applications. This system uses a <b>diagnostic</b> interface to <b>plug</b> into the vehicle existing network (i. e. CAN bus system) and extract relevant infor-mation messages. This information should be shared with surrounding vehicles via wireless communication technolo-gies by warning their drivers about an unexpected event. A real experimental test was conducted and some preliminary results are reported to first shed more light on the effective-ness of the proposed solution...|$|R
40|$|The generic upper {{port plug}} (GUPP) {{structure}} in ITER is a 6 m long metal box which deploys diagnostic components into the vacuum vessel. This structure {{is commonly used}} for all the diagnostic upper ports. The final design of the GUPP structure, which has successfully passed the final design review in 2013, is described here. The <b>diagnostic</b> port <b>plug</b> is cantilevered to the vacuum vessel with a heavy payload at the front, so called the diagnostic first wall (DFW) and the diagnostic shield module (DSM). Most of electromagnetic (EM) load (∼ 80 %) occurs in DFW/DSM. Therefore, the mounting design to transfer the EM load from DFW/DSM to the GUPP structure is challenging, which should also comply with thermal expansion and tolerance for assembly and manufacturing. Another key design parameter to be considered is {{the gap between the}} port plug and the vacuum vessel port. The gap should be large enough to accommodate the remote handling of the heavy port plug (max. 25 t), the structural deflection due to external loads and machine assembly tolerance. At the same time, the gap should be minimized to stop the neutron streaming according to the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle. With these design constraints, the GUPP structure should also provide space for diagnostic integration as much as possible. This requirement has led to the single wall structure having the gun-drilled water channels inside the structure. Furthermore, intensive efforts have been made on the manufacturing study including material selection, manufacturing codes and French regulation related to nuclear equipment and safety. All these main design and manufacturing aspects are discussed in this paper, including requirements, interfaces, loads and structural assessment and maintenance...|$|R
40|$|The upper port of the ITER {{vacuum vessel}} {{contains}} the core charge exchange spectroscopy (cCXRS) port <b>plug</b> <b>diagnostic</b> system. Electromagnetic (EM) loads caused by plasma transients {{are critical for}} the port plug. An ANSYS 3 D EM model of the ITER magnet system, addressing main port plug features (conceptual design 2009), was developed by Forschungszentrum Julich (FZJ). EM forces on main plug components have been calculated and main integral mechanical moments are represented. Two external contracts on independent global EM models were launched and are being successfully benchmarked against the FZJ model. In support of the cCXRS design its components are structurally analyzed under EM loading. Four different approaches to calculate EM loads for detailed structural models have been used and are described. One of them, called an "express" analysis, allows a prompt choice between different design solutions. The "air" elements, which should fill gaps between assembled conducting parts in the electromagnetic FE models, are neglected in this approach. This may save up to 90 % of time for building and calculating complex EM models. Applicability and use of this method for small critical plug components like a fast shutter are demonstrated in this paper. (C) 2010 FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JULICH GMBH-EURATOM-FZJ.

40|$|The ITER {{diagnostics}} generic upper {{port plug}} (GUPP) is {{developed as a}} standardized design for all <b>diagnostic</b> upper port <b>plugs,</b> in which a variety of payloads can be mounted. Here, the remote handling compatibility analysis (RHCA) of the GUPP design is presented that was performed for the GUPP final design review. The analysis focuses mainly on the insertion and extraction procedure of the diagnostic shield module (DSM), a removable cassette that contains the diagnostic in-vessel components. It is foreseen that the DSM is a replaceable component – the procedure {{of which is to}} be performed inside the ITER hot cell facility (HCF), where the GUPP can be oriented in a vertical position. The DSM removal procedure in the HCF consists of removing locking pins, an M 30 sized shoulder bolt and two electrical straps {{through the use of a}} dexterous manipulator, after which the DSM is lifted out of the GUPP by an overhead crane. For optimum access to its internals, the DSM is mounted in a handling device. The insertion of a new or refurbished DSM follows the reverse procedure. The RHCA shows that the GUPP design requires a moderate amount of changes to become fully compatible with RH maintenance requirements...|$|R
40|$|The means used {{to prevent}} the {{recurrence}} of tetralin leakage into the SRE sodium systems are discussed. Included is {{a description of the}} redssign of system components to utilize alteraate coolants such as nitrogen, air, and NaK. The use of kerosene to replace tetralin, where double containment is provided, is discussed. The physical properties are compared, and kerosene is shown to be free of the undesirable characteristics of tetralin. The fuelelement cleaning systsm was redesigned for steam washing, followed by a water rinse and vacuum drying. Hydrogen gas evolved during washing is oxidized with copper oxide to eliminate the possibility of a hydrogen-oxygen explosion if air should accidentally enter the vent system. The fuel element was changed from a seven- to a five-rod cluster to provide additional clearance in the channel. Element hardware was modified to provide an orifice location which will permit more precise flow calculations; a redesigned hanger assembly which will minimize sodium holdup; and filter screene at the channel entrance to prevent in-cluster <b>plugging.</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> instrumentation was provided for the reactor to monitor: fission-product activity in the reactor cover gas; rapidly varying reactor parameters during a reactor scram; internnl and aheath fuel temperatures; and fuinctions being performed whioh wiIl indicate the mode of operation.

40|$|The ITER <b>diagnostic</b> Upper Port <b>Plug</b> (UPP) is a {{water-cooled}} {{stainless steel}} structure aimed to integrate within vacuum vessel the plasma diagnostic systems, shielding them from neutron and photon irradiation. Due {{to the very}} intense heat loads expected, a proper cooling circuit {{has been designed to}} ensure an adequate UPP cooling with an acceptable thermal rise and an unduly high pumping power and to perform its draining and drying procedure by injection of pressurized nitrogen. A theoretical research activity has been launched at the Department of Nuclear Engineering of the University of Palermo aiming to investigate the hydraulic behaviour of the UPP Trapezoid Section cooling circuit under steady state conditions and during its draining and drying transient procedure. The research activity has been performed following a theoretical-computational approach and adopting the RELAP 5 thermal-hydraulic system code. The Trapezoid Section cooling circuit characteristic functions have been derived under steady state conditions at various coolant temperatures for both the coolant flow paths at the present under consideration for this circuit. The distributions of coolant mass flow rates along the channels of the cooling circuit have been calculated too. Results show that the flow path characterized by right plate inlet has improved hydraulic performances. The transient behaviour of the Trapezoid Section cooling circuit has been investigated during the draining and drying operational transient procedure, considering realistic operative scenarios, for both the coolant flow paths at the present under consideration for the cooling circuit. In particular, it has been found out that the recently proposed flow path seems to allow the complete draining of the Trapezoid Section circuit, eliminating the need for the drying procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{severity}} of electromagnetic (EM) loads produced by plasma disruptions {{is one of}} the most concerning issues for the ITER in-vessel components design because of the possible severe structural damage they can induce. EM loads are produced by the interaction of the currents induced in the structures by the fast variation of toroidal and poloidal field associated with the quenching plasma with the strong external field produced by the ITER magnet system. To investigate the effects of fast EM transients on the plasma surrounding structures during a disruption, the Secondary Excitations (SE) method that is an interface procedure to couple 2 D plasma equilibrium codes with Finite Element (FE) codes is used. In addition, the Zooming Approach (ZA) was implemented. It groups the system and the main toroidal components in a SE array by considering, in addition to the plasma source field, also the effect of the eddy currents induced in the main toroidal continuous structures. The aim of this work is the implementation of the ZA in the ANSYS Maxwell 3 D code in order to evaluate the EM loads acting on the ITER <b>Diagnostic</b> Equatorial Port <b>Plug</b> (EPP) during major disruptions scenario. The basic idea is to take advantage of the implementation in a user-friendly code of a numerical procedure that reduces the computational efforts without loss of accuracy compared to the Global Approach (GA). To this intent, a 20 º sector of ITER Vacuum Vessel completed of Diagnostic EPP and Blanket Modules has been modelled and reshaped to fit the SE zooming region. The current input data for the SE have been obtained from the SE method interface software: the EMAG code. In order to overcome some limits in the post-processing phase of ANSYS Maxwell 3 D, a dedicated algorithm has been developed for the extrapolation of EM forces and moments acting on the Diagnostic EPP. The results showed a good agreement with those obtained from a previous GA analysis carried out by the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). A further study has been also developed for the evaluation of EM loads in presence of ferromagnetic materials in order to investigate the ANSYS Maxwell code capabilities in simulating ferromagnetism effects. In this case, the new simulation assumes that the central first walls of the Diagnostic EPP are made of ferritic-martensitic steel...|$|R
