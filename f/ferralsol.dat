The multilobed pyrolysis S 2 peaks recorded in the course of programmed pyrolysis under inert atmosphere (N 2) provides basic and straightforward information on the heterogeneity of SOM and its degree of evolution. Then, the deconvolution of S 2 peaks enables the separation and quantification of three main organic compartments: minor labile compounds, humic-like compounds abundant in the topsoil, and a refractory fraction that may be considered as black carbon after optical examination under the microscope.

Size distribution of five classes of microaggregate was determined (1000 ? 2000 µm, 500 ? 1000 µm, 250 ? 500 µm, 105 ? 250 µm and < 105 ?µm). From the soil spectra, we determined the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage) red index (RICIE) and the absorption intensities of kaolinite (IKa) and gibbsite (IGb). The predominant fraction of microaggregates exhibited sizes between 250 and 1000 µm (&# 934; 250 ? 1000). The proportional increase of this microaggregate class in the soils increased the scattering and variability of reflected light, particularly when soil samples showed more than 0. 50 g g? 1 of &# 934; 250 ? 1000. The microaggregate size explained over 55 % of reflectance intensity variability of wavelengths in the vis?NIR regions, principally on reflectance intensity and concavity of the spectra at 436 nm, 546 nm and 2236 nm, which decreases with increased proportion of &# 934; 250 ? 1000.
