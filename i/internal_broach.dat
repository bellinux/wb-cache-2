5|$|A {{common type}} of <b>internal</b> <b>broach</b> is the keyway broach (C & D). It uses a special fixture called a horn to support the broach and {{properly}} locate the part with relation to the broach.|$|E
5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large <b>internal</b> <b>broaching</b> applications. They are similar to shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{an effort}} to improve the {{property}} of escort mechanism of vertical <b>internal</b> <b>broaching</b> machine, a new-style escort mechanism is designed. Work process and defect about structure of escort mechanism in existence is firstly analyzed in depth, design concept and implementation methods of the new escort mechanism are then studied. Three-dimensional structure and work process are presented, and performance comparison between the new-style structure and the old one is conducted. Application study is launched at last. The innovative escort mechanism and slide board are movably connected and lumped together. In consequence, the escort mechanism will stop and then be hung at the column, while the tool slide continues to move down until broaching stop. The new-style escort mechanism has superiority such as low cost, high robust and good safety, and so on, which make it adaptive and useful for structural optimization of <b>broaching</b> machine.

5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for <b>internal</b> <b>broaching.</b>|$|R
5|$|For <b>internal</b> <b>broaching</b> {{the sides}} of the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for {{external}} broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|R
500|$|The only {{limitations}} on broaching are {{that there are}} no obstructions over the length of the surface to be machined, the geometry to be cut does not have curves in multiple planes, and that the workpiece is strong enough to withstand the forces involved. Specifically for <b>internal</b> <b>broaching</b> a hole must first exist in the workpiece so the broach can enter. Also, there are limits on the size of internal cuts. [...] Common internal holes can range from [...] in diameter but it is possible to achieve a range of [...] Surface broaches' range is usually , although the feasible range is [...]|$|R
50|$|The only {{limitations}} on broaching are {{that there are}} no obstructions over the length of the surface to be machined, the geometry to be cut does not have curves in multiple planes, and that the workpiece is strong enough to withstand the forces involved. Specifically for <b>internal</b> <b>broaching</b> a hole must first exist in the workpiece so the broach can enter. Also, there are limits on the size of internal cuts. Common internal holes can range from 0.125 to 6 in in diameter but it is possible to achieve a range of 0.05 to 13 in. Surface broaches' range is usually 0.075 to 10 in, although the feasible range is 0.02 to 20 in.|$|R
5|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>broaching</b> is more involved. The {{process begins}} by {{clamping}} the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Current {{automotive}} industry uses {{various types of}} sheets for car production. These sheets differ mainly in the strength and plastic properties. The first one of the operations during the processing of automotive sheets is blanking. Quality of the blanked edge often affects the next processing of these sheets (bending, drawing and <b>internal</b> <b>broaching).</b> That´s why we deal, in the article, with {{the analysis of the}} influence of punch-die clearance on the quality of blanked edge. The experiments were done on the three-active blanking tool for the fine blanking. For the examination {{of the quality of the}} blanked edge there was used parameter characterizing the size of the plastic shear hv. Experiments were done on the two types of sheets, used in {{automotive industry}}, different in the strength and plastic properties. Experimental sheets were cut at the two different punch-die clearances...|$|R
