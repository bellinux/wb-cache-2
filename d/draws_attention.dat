5|$|Cotton Mather, in his 1693 book The Wonders of the Invisible World, {{concerning}} the Salem Witch Trials, specifically <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to the Suffolk trial, and the Salem judge stated that although spectral evidence {{should be allowed}} in order to begin investigations, {{it should not be}} admitted as evidence to decide a case.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist John A. Gutowski {{sees in the}} Douglas jackalope {{an example}} of an American tall tale publicized by a local {{community}} that seeks wider recognition. Through a combination of hoax and media activity, the town or other community <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to itself for social or economic reasons. A common adjunct to this activity involves the creation of an annual festival to perpetuate the town's association with the local legend.|$|E
5|$|La Grange <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as {{brief and}} unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both {{extensive}} and demanding, requiring {{on several occasions}} {{to be heard over}} the choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E

30|$|Attunement to noticing {{patterns}} and structure {{is a key}} part of the ‘looking for structure’ strand. Attention to juxtaposing examples in ways that <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to variations, invariances, and connections between examples has been argued as one way to develop this attunement (Watson and Mason 2006). Careful sequencing can <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to ideas like ‘doing and undoing’ and the regularities within sets of related examples in ways that <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to underlying mathematical structure.|$|R

5|$|Two men, Brad and Ryan, {{wake up in}} a {{metropolitan}} storefront window, bound at the wrists to opposite sides of a worktable with a circular saw {{in front of each}} of them. Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw. As the scene <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> and police arrive, a puppet informs the men that they can kill each other or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut, but ultimately choose to allow Dina to die instead.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E
5|$|The sitters are {{presented}} in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo {{and in many ways}} counterbalance each other. Brand Philip <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially {{the manner in which the}} folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.|$|E

25|$|Subordination {{strives to}} use all objects and {{features}} {{in the service of}} the design and its intended effect. It can be seen in the subtle use of naturally occurring plants throughout the park. Non-native species planted for the sake of their own uniqueness defeat the purpose of design, as that very uniqueness <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to itself where the intention is to enable relaxation: utility above all else.|$|E
25|$|Brad Evans and Julian Reid criticize {{resilience}} {{discourse and}} its rising popularity in their book, Resilient Life. The authors assert that policies of resilience {{can put the}} onus of disaster response on individuals rather than publicly coordinated efforts. Tied {{to the emergence of}} neoliberalism, climate change theory, third-world development, and other discourses, Evans and Reid argue that promoting resilience <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> away from governmental responsibility and towards localized, laissez-faire responses.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the ability}} to drive the {{predator}} away, mobbing also <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to the predator, making stealth attacks impossible. Mobbing plays {{a critical role in}} the identification of predators and inter-generational learning about predator identification. Reintroduction of species is often unsuccessful, because the established population lacks this cultural knowledge of how to identify local predators. Scientists are exploring ways to train populations to identify and respond to predators before releasing them into the wild.|$|E
25|$|Aeschylus's {{works were}} {{influential}} beyond his own time. Hugh Lloyd-Jones <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to Richard Wagner's reverence of Aeschylus. Michael Ewans argues in his Wagner and Aeschylus. The Ring and the Oresteia (London: Faber. 1982) that the influence {{was so great}} as to merit a direct character by character comparison between Wagner's Ring and Aeschylus's Oresteia. A critic of his book however, while not denying that Wagner read and respected Aeschylus, has described his arguments as unreasonable and forced.|$|E
25|$|Hahn {{encourages}} {{the viewer to}} think deeper, not only {{through the use of}} different physical processes in her artwork, but also through the multiplicity of meanings in her photographs. In most of her work, Hahn integrates humor and irony as she explores the meanings generated by formal combinations. Some of her prints include the sprocket holes of the 35mm negative, which allude to its 35mm film origins: but by hand coloring with bright paints, she <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to the mixture of craft with industrial mediums.|$|E
