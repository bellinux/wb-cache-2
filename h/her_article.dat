5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains in <b>her</b> <b>article</b> “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - {{like many other}} black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

25|$|However, {{despite the}} {{uncertain}} origins, {{there are enough}} similarities in the ideas of practices of Chinese alchemy and the Daoist tradition so that one can conclude that Laozi and Chang Tao Ling are the creators of this tradition. In <b>her</b> <b>article,</b> Radcliffe tells that Chang Tao Ling rejected serving the Emperor and retreated {{to live in the}} mountains. At this time, he met Laozi and together they created (or attempted to create) the Elixir of Life (Radcliffe, 2001), by creating the theory that would be used in order to achieve the making of such an elixir. This is the starting point to the Chinese tradition of alchemy, whose purpose was to achieve immortality.|$|E
25|$|Jointly with Meitner and his pupil and {{assistant}} Fritz Strassmann (1902–1980), Otto Hahn furthered the research begun by Enrico Fermi {{and his team}} in 1934 when they bombarded uranium with neutrons. Until 1938, {{it was believed that}} the elements with atomic numbers greater than 92 (known as transuranium elements) arose when uranium atoms were bombarded with neutrons. The German chemist Ida Noddack proposed an exception. She anticipated the paradigm shift of 1938/39 in <b>her</b> <b>article</b> published in the journal Angewandte Chemie, Nr. 47, 1934, in which she speculated:It is conceivable that when heavy nuclei are bombarded with neutrons these nuclei could break down into several fairly large fragments, which are certainly isotopes of known elements, but not neighbors of the irradiated elements.But no physicist or chemist really took Noddack's speculation seriously or tested it, not even Ida Noddack herself. The idea that heavy atomic nuclei could break down into lighter elements was regarded as totally inadmissible.|$|E

25|$|While Maddy {{gets out}} with her story, the two men set out for Captain Poison's encampment. Dia, {{stationed}} with the RUF garrison there, is confronted by Vandy, but having been brainwashed he refuses to acknowledge his father. Archer radios the site's coordinates to Coetzee, who directs a combined air and ground assault on the camp; Vandy finds Captain Poison and beats him {{to death with a}} shovel as the mercenaries overwhelm the RUF defenders. Coetzee then forces Vandy to produce the diamond, but is killed by Archer, who realizes Coetzee would eventually kill them both. Dia holds the pair briefly at gunpoint, but Vandy confronts him again and renews their bond. Pursued by vengeful mercenaries, Archer discloses he has been mortally wounded and entrusts the stone to Vandy, telling him to take it for his family. Vandy and his son rendezvous with Archer's pilot, who flies them to safety while Archer makes a final phone call to Maddy; they share final farewells as he asks her to assist Vandy, and gives her permission to finish <b>her</b> <b>article.</b> Archer finally takes in the beautiful African landscape before dying.|$|E
25|$|Having {{spent time}} amongst the artists of Paris in the 1920s, McKay was intimately {{acquainted with the}} {{dynamics}} between painters and models {{and the manner in}} which modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In <b>her</b> <b>article,</b> “Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys,” Leah Rosenberg writes, “The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism”. The inclination to stereotype and caricatures the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew up with in Jamaica. “Sexuality and black culture,” Rosenberg explains, “held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein”. In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter Andre Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shined a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself.|$|E

500|$|Through a metafictional and [...] voice, the contemporary, postmodern narrator {{questions}} {{the role of}} the author and the historian in thinking about the past. In <b>her</b> <b>article</b> discussing the use of paratext, or the contextualizing text printed in the book such as the footnotes and epigraphs, Deborah Bowen argues that the novel's paratext forces the reader, like in other postmodern works, to rethink the importance of such peripheral material that in other contexts will get overlooked in light of preference for the main text. Instead of nicely complementing the main plot and adding meaning, these paratextual elements can distract from the effectiveness of the novel and challenging the authority of the narrative voice.|$|E

Maria Tallarico of Cosmopolitan observed {{that a number}} of Monica's storylines, specifically one in which the character unintentionally has sex with a high school senior, [...] "probably wouldn't fly on TV today". Writing for Mic.com, Samantha Allen believes that Monica helped [...] "set the standard for how sitcoms could and would talk about sex" [...] by both engaging in casual sex and dating a much older man. According to Dustin Levy of The Diamondback, Monica inspired [...] "any ensemble cast in a sitcom with a female character who is bossy or neurotic," [...] citing Scrubs’ Elliot Reid and Happy Endings’ Jane Kerkovich-Williams as examples of Monica's influence. Additionally, Levy identified Claire Dunphy from the sitcom Modern Family as Monica's modern-day equivalent, explaining that the character [...] "acts like Monica plus children".
