40|$|The SAICA {{recently}} issued Circular 1 / 2006, Disclosures {{in relation}} to deferred tax. The purpose of this Circular is to provide guidance on additional disclosures required for deferred tax where the expected manner of recovery of the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of an asset could materially influence the deferred tax balance. However, {{the contents of the}} Circular is likely to raise a fresh debate amongst preparers and auditors of financial statements around some of the measurement issues resulting from paragraph 51. The interpretation of paragraph 51 is discussed, the application thereof to various types of assets is examined, as well as the application of the Circular. The meaning of the phrase "recovery of the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of an asset" is explored. This is done, firstly, by considering the meaning of the "carrying amount" of an asset and, secondly, by considering the potential manners in which the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of an asset can be "recovered". The application of these principles is then considered for revalued property, plant and equipment. Finally, the requirements of the Circular are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{several of}} the {{mandatory}} disclosures for investments in associates. An important investigation {{of this study is}} whether or not the information content in disclosed fair values for investments in associated companies subsumes their equity accounted <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts.</b> The study modifies existing value-relevance models for its purposes and compares alternative measurement bases for investments in associates by investigating the significance of changes in error terms. Differences across time and between countries are investigated utiling various statistical approaches as well as an indicator variable approach. Findings suggest that equity accounted <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts</b> and disclosed fair values of listed associates are incrementally value-relevant. This implies that investors utilise fundamental information of the associate to develop their own intrinsic valuation of listed associates, which is not equal to current market values. However, this does not equally apply in the case of unlisted associates, where disclosed fair values are not incrementally value-relevant to equity accounted <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts.</b> Other findings suggest that the value-relevance of the equity accounted <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts</b> and disclosed fair values of associates differ significantly across time and between countries for both listed and unlisted associates. In addition, findings confirm that an exceptional economic event, such as the global financial crisis of 2007 – 2008, impacts significantly on the overall value-relevance of accounting information. Lastly, findings of this study imply that the disclosed summarised financial information of associates, although not individually value-relevant, is incrementally value-relevant when considered as a group.

5000|$|For example, {{assume a}} company has an {{investment}} in Company A bonds with a <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of $37,500. If {{the market value of}} the bonds falls to $33,000, an impairment loss of $4,500 is indicated. Therefore an Impairment cost is calculated: ...|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the cost}} model, the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the asset is {{measured}} at cost less accumulated depreciation and eventual impairment (similar to the inventory's Lower of cost or market prudent principle).

40|$|Recent {{circular}} {{issued by}} SAICA, Circular 1 / 2006, Disclosures {{in relation to}} deferred tax, recognizes that the debate surrounding paragraph 51 of IAS 12 (AC 102) has focused particularly on measuring deferred tax in relation to investment properties. The appropriate rate {{to be used to}} measure deferred tax is not an accounting policy choice. The rate should be determined based on the expected manner of recovery of the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the asset. Secondly, the 14. 5 % rate is only appropriate, in the case of buildings, if it is expected that the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the asset will be recovered through sale, and then only to fair value adjustments above the CGT valuation date value of the asset...|$|R
50|$|If a {{receivable}} {{has been}} impaired its <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> is written {{down to its}} recoverable amount, being the higher of value in use and its fair value (less costs to sell).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the accounting treatment for property, plant and equipment, in according with the IAS 16, including: timing of the recognition of assets, determination of asset <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts</b> using both the cost model and a reevaluation model, depreciation charges and impairment losses to be recognized in relation to these values. ...|$|R
50|$|International Accounting Standard 16 Property, Plant and Equipment or IAS 16 is an {{international}} financial reporting standard adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). It concerns accounting for property, plant and equipment (known more generally as fixed assets), including recognition, determination of their <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts,</b> and the depreciation charges and impairment losses to be recognised in relation to them.|$|R
50|$|Items of property, {{plant and}} {{equipment}} are derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefit is expected from its use. An entity should recognise any gain or loss on disposal in its income statement. The gain or loss on disposal {{is the difference between}} the proceeds received in exchange for the asset disposed and the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> at the time of disposal.|$|R
5000|$|A {{change in}} {{accounting}} estimate is [...] "an adjustment of the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of an asset or liability, or {{the amount of}} the periodic consumption of an asset, that results from the assessment of the present status of, and expected future benefits and obligations associated with, assets and liabilities. Changes in accounting estimates result from new information or new developments and, accordingly, are not correction of errors." ...|$|R
5000|$|An asset {{should also}} be {{impaired}} in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets if its recoverable amount falls below its <b>carrying</b> <b>amount.</b> Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use (estimate of future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset). An impairment cost under the revaluation model is treated as a revaluation decrease (decrease of other comprehensive income) {{to the extent of}} previous revaluation surpluses. Any loss that takes the asset below historical depreciated cost is recognised in the income statement.|$|R

If the investor does not exercise the premium put, the put expires. At the issue date, the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the bonds is {{in excess of the}} market value of the common stock that would be issued under the conversion terms. The issues are: 1. Whether the issuer should accrue a liability so that, at the date the put is exercisable, the issuer has a recorded liability equal to the redemption price 2. Whether accrual should continue if subsequent changes {{in the value of the}} debt or common stock make exercise of the put unlikely 3. If the put expires unexercised, whether the liability should be recognized as income, credited to capital, maintained as part of the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the debt, or amortized as a yield adjustment over the remaining term of the debt.

40|$|Objective of IAS 36 Impairment {{of assets}} is to {{prescribe}} procedures {{that apply to}} an undertaking to ensure that its assets are <b>carried</b> at <b>amounts</b> not exceeding their recoverable <b>amount</b> if the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> is recoverable in full. An asset is <b>carried</b> at an <b>amount</b> not exceeding the amount will be recovered through its use or sale. If this case proves, is described as impaired assets and IAS 36 requires the company to account for a loss of value. Also, the rule specifies that a business case should include (lessen) a loss of value and should provide information on assets that have depreciated. There may be situations in which external influences or changes in production methods within the entity led to decreased value of an asset far more than is acknowledged in annual depreciation costs. In this case, {{it is said that}} the asset is impaired. Impairment, recoverable amount, value in use...|$|R
