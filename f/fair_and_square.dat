We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality."

50|$|On March 15, 1552, King Sigismund II Augustus {{specified}} {{the boundaries}} of the town. In its center there was a main market square, with six streets, and with parish church of St. Jacob.

It changed during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1656), when both Krzepice and the ancient castle were destroyed by the Swedes. Ruins of the castle remained until 1927, when they were finally demolished. The town frequently burned (1450, 1527, 1656, 1867, 1881, 1903, 1904 1906), which was due to its wooden architecture. In 1870, Russian authorities of Congress Poland reduced Krzepice to the status of a village, as a reprisal for its inhabitants' participation in the January Uprising. Krzepice regained its town status in 1919, when already it was part of Kielce Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic.|$|R
