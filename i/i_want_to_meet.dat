500|$|Originally, {{there were}} several aspects of the {{character}} that were cut before appearing on screen: in early drafts, {{he was the son}} of Henry van Statten. In the DVD commentary for [...] "The Long Game" [...] director Brian Grant and actor Bruno Langley discuss Adam's scripted motive of bringing future medical knowledge back home to cure his father, who was suffering from ill health, though this motive did not remain in the final episode. To promote the character during the week [...] "The Long Game" [...] was first broadcast, the in-universe tie-in website [...] "Who is Doctor Who?" [...] announced that [...] "14 year-old Adam Mitchell from Nottingham" [...] had won a competition arranged by van Statten the previous week. Adam's winning essay on [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Meet</b> An Alien" [...] mentions a desire to acquire advanced knowledge from them with the explanation [...] "I don't think it's cheating, really. It's just a shortcut".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative reviews, a few reviewers {{had positive}} {{things to say}} about the song and video. Entertainment Weekly writer Joseph Lynch noted that there was [...] "something sickeningly catchy about this tune that keeps you coming back for more." [...] Rolling Stones Perpetua stated, [...] "When you see this video, you immediately notice everything that it does 'wrong', but it actually gets {{a lot of things about}} pop music right, if just by accident." [...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet.</b> I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E

6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh! I don’t {{care about}} the London season! It is too matrimonial.

60|$|And now I {{return to}} what I {{said at the}} beginning--that there were several reasons for {{including}} this little girl in my series of impressions. The most important one has been left until now. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> her again, but how shall I find her in this immensity of London-- these six millions of human souls! Let me beg of any reader who knows Rose Mary Angela Catherine Maude Caversham--a name like that--who has identified her from my description--that he will inform me of her whereabouts.|$|E

6000|$|The President's {{attitude}} {{to his colleagues}} had now become: <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> you so far as I can; I see your difficulties and I should {{like to be able}} to agree to what you propose; but I can do nothing that is not just and right, and you must first of all show me that what you want does really fall within the words of the pronouncements which are binding on me. Then began the weaving of that web of sophistry and Jesuitical exegesis that was finally to clothe with insincerity the language and substance of the whole Treaty.

6000|$|Like a true philosopher, Flambeau had no aim in his holiday; but, {{like a true}} philosopher, he had an excuse. He {{had a sort of}} half purpose, {{which he}} took just so seriously that its success would crown the holiday, but just so lightly that its failure would not spoil it. Years ago, when he had been a king of thieves and the most famous figure in Paris, he had often {{received}} wild communications of approval, denunciation, or even love; but one had, somehow, stuck in his memory. It consisted simply of a visiting-card, in an envelope with an English postmark. On the back of the card was written in French and in green ink: [...] "If you ever retire and become respectable, come and see me. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> you, for I have met all the other great men of my time. That trick of yours of getting one detective to arrest the other was the most splendid scene in French history." [...] On the front of the card was engraved in the formal fashion, [...] "Prince Saradine, Reed House, Reed Island, Norfolk." ...|$|E

Kennedy runs the {{politics}} of the place, and Mrs. K. makes or mars people socially. It's my first invitation there and it's necessary I should accept it--necessary every way. Mrs. K. would never forgive me if I disappointed her at the last moment. Not that I, personally, am of much account--yet--to her. But it would leave a vacant place. Mrs. K. would never notice me again and, as she bosses Kennedy, I can't afford to offend her. Besides, there's a girl who'll be there. I've met her once. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> her again. She's a beauty and no mistake. Toplofty as they make 'em, though. However, I think I've made an impression on her. It was at the Harvey's dance last week. She was the handsomest woman there, and she never took her eyes off me. I've given Mrs. Kennedy a pretty broad hint that I want to take her in to dinner. If I don't go I'll miss all round." ...|$|E
