5000|$|Some {{property}} {{lies in a}} [...] "gray" [...] area, {{in which}} the testator's specific intent must be determined. For example, where the testator bequeathes [...] "500 shares of stock" [...] in a company, this may {{be read as a}} <b>general</b> <b>bequest</b> (that the estate should purchase and convey the particular stocks to the beneficiary), or it may be read as a specific bequest, particularly if the testator used a possessive ("my 500 shares"). Such a gift is deemed to be a demonstrative gift. Such demonstrative gifts are deemed to be a hybrid of both specific and general gifts. If one were to bequeath [...] "500 shares of stock," [...] most states would deem that to be a demonstrative gift. The resultant gift to the heir receiving [...] "500 shares," [...] would be the date of death value of 500 shares of that particular stock.|$|E
50|$|<b>General</b> <b>bequests</b> or <b>general</b> gifts - {{gifts of}} cash amounts - are never adeemed. If the cash in the testator's estate is not {{sufficient}} to satisfy the gift, then other assets in the residuary estate will need to be sold to raise the necessary cash.|$|R
50|$|Guide Dogs for the Blind (or GDB) is a nonprofit, tax-exempt {{organization}} supported {{entirely by}} private donations. GDB receives no government funding {{and there are}} no costs for individuals who receive a guide dog. Donors contribute through <b>general</b> contributions, <b>bequests,</b> grants, memorial and honor donations, charitable remainder trusts and other planned giving options.|$|R
50|$|By a deed {{witnessed}} by a notary on 8 August 1894, Thomas Dobrée left the palais and his collections to the Département de Loire-Inférieure - the bequest planned that the Départemenat {{would be able}} to transfer its archaeological museum into the manoir de la Touche, but stipulated that Dobrée's collections had to be kept separate from the archaeological collections, as is still the case. The conseil <b>général</b> accepted the <b>bequest</b> and decided to name the museum the Musée Thomas Dobrée. In 1896 the archaeological collections were moved in and in 1899 the museum opened its doors to the public. In 1974 an extension was built and a modern building constructed {{in a corner of the}} palais' garden - it was there that the old archaeological museum's collections (notably the Egyptian antiquities) were displayed, with the palais itself given over entirely to Dobrée's collection.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s when an Old Collyerian (OC), Dr. William W. Duckering (1861-1945) bequeathed £22,000 {{to the school}} ‘for its <b>general</b> purposes’. The <b>bequest</b> paid for a new {{laboratory}} block, gymnasium and changing rooms in 1961, and an assembly and dining hall with theatrical stage facilities, modern kitchens attached, and a ‘Small Upper Hall’ above the new foyer, all completed in 1963. The new hall was named the ‘Duckering Hall’, and the smaller hall the ‘Duckering Room’. (The final phase of building work, {{to be a new}} classroom block replacing the World War Two emergency wooden huts, was never undertaken.) Between 1960 and 1963 the playing fields were also extended, levelled, and new sports facilities were added. In 1964 a headmaster’s house was built on the site, replacing the accommodation that was originally included in the 1892 school block.|$|R
500|$|Any {{collection}} formed {{before the}} 20th century (and many later ones) {{is likely to}} contain pieces that can no longer sustain their original attributions. [...] In <b>general</b> the Waddesdon <b>Bequest</b> {{can be said to}} have held up well in this regard, and the most significant brush with forgery has been to benefit the collection. [...] In 1959 it was confirmed that the Waddesdon Holy Thorn Reliquary had been in the Habsburg Imperial Schatzkammer ("treasure chamber") in Vienna from 1677 onwards. It remained in Vienna until after 1860, when it appeared in an exhibition. Some time after this it was sent to be restored by Salomon Weininger, an art dealer with access to skilled craftsmen, who secretly made a number of copies. He was later convicted of other forgeries, and died in prison in 1879, but it was still not realised that he had returned one of his copies of the reliquary to the Imperial collections instead of the original, and later sold the original, which is now in the bequest. One of the copies remained in the Ecclesiastical Treasury of the Imperial Habsburg Court in Vienna, where the deception remained undetected for several decades.|$|R
40|$|This paper derives optimal {{inheritance}} tax formulas that capture the key equityefficiency trade-off, {{are expressed in}} terms of estimable sufficient statistics, and are robust to the underlying structure of preferences. We consider dynamic stochastic models with <b>general</b> and heterogeneous <b>bequest</b> tastes and labor productivities. We limit ourselves to simple but realistic linear or two-bracket tax structures to obtain tractable formulas. We show that long-run optimal {{inheritance tax}} rates can always be {{expressed in terms of}} aggregate earnings and bequest elasticities with respect to tax rates, distributional parameters, and social preferences for redistribution. Those results carry over with tractable modifications to (a) the case with social discounting (instead of steady-state welfare maximization), (b) the case with partly accidental bequests, (c) the standard Barro-Becker dynastic model. The optimal tax rate is positive and quantitatively large if the elasticity of bequests to the tax rate is low, bequest concentration is high, and society cares mostly about those receiving little inheritance. We propose a calibration using micro-data for France and the United States. We find that for realistic parameters the optimal inheritance tax rate might be as large as 50 %– 60 %–or even higher for top bequests, in line with historical experience...|$|R
5000|$|In 1839 {{the will}} of Brigadier-General John Floyd was probated in Camden County Georgia Inferior Court. Charles Rinaldo Floyd, Richard Ferdinand Floyd and Everard Hamilton {{qualified}} as Executors. General John Floyd wrote it in 1833, six years before his death. [...] He bequeathed his lands, including Bellevue Plantation, a few slaves, out buildings, tenements, appurtenances, all physical property, including the townhouses owned in St. Marys, cash and bonds, to his wife, Isabella Maria Floyd, {{with the proviso that}} nothing was to be sold during her lifetime unless it was for payment of debts, and after her death, all property would revert into the Estate. [...] <b>General</b> Floyd directed <b>bequests</b> to his heirs, all of his living children, also with a proviso that should a difference of opinion arise, contrary to his wishes or intentions, the disagreeing parties shall call in an umpire whose final decision would be binding. (Fairfield Plantation had long before been given to Charles Rinaldo Floyd; Richard Ferdinand Floyd lived at The Hermitage; Sarah Catherine Wigg Floyd and her husband, Dr. Aime DeLaroche, lived at Black Point). [...] His remaining Estate was then divided; the slaves were equally allotted and not to be transferred out of the family; his war and hunting weapons were to be equally distributed among his sons.|$|R
