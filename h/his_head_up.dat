5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E

In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E
500|$|Wario World {{received}} fairly positive reviews. The US {{version of}} Play magazine gave the game a perfect score, and the reviewer commented that Wario World [...] "pays off every second [...] holding the controller, and that, to , is greatness". Nintendo Power {{said that the}} game was [...] "tons of fun". GamePro stated that Wario World [...] "stays addictive by weight of sheer design innovation". The American-based publication Game Informer praised the game for including [...] "droves of awesome boss battles". Matt Casamassina of IGN declared that Wario World had [...] "some great control mechanics and inventive level work". Electronic Gaming Monthlys Greg Ford said, [...] "Wario [...] delivers a great time while it lasts and is well worth checking out. Just don't expect a Mario-quality adventure". Worthplaying gave the game 9 out 10, stating that [...] "Treasure has done itself proud with this title, and Wario himself can lift <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> high. At least in my book, he's got at least one game that's better than Mario's." ...|$|E

500|$|Hartlepool United manager Chris Turner then offered Humphreys {{the chance}} to train with the club. Shortly after Humphreys signed a new {{contract}} with the club, much {{to the dismay of}} Cambridge fans who wanted him to stay and described him as [...] "a big loss". Humphreys started the 2001–02 season partnering Kevin Henderson up front for the first 9 league matches. However, after a bad run Humphreys was dropped and replaced by new signing Gordon Watson. However, Humphreys would force his way back into the team and replace Henderson to partner Watson instead, these two players were already familiar with each other from their days at Sheffield Wednesday. Despite not scoring many goals Hartlepool manager Chris Turner was pleased with his performances. Humphreys was then moved into central midfield due to the injury of Tommy Widdrington and after impressing played there {{for the remainder of the}} season. Humphreys' first season at the club would end in disappointment as he missed the decisive penalty in the play-off semi-final defeat to Cheltenham Town, which cost Hartlepool a place in the Second Division. The penalty struck the woodwork twice and stayed out. Humphreys' miss would send him to tears and he was photographed by Frank Reid, a photograph that would prove to be one of the most memorable images of Reid and Humphreys' career. After his miss Humphreys was devastated but he was cheered up by Chris Turner and the players who rang him and told him to keep <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>up.</b> Humphreys also received lots of letters of support from the Hartlepool fans.|$|E
500|$|On race day California Chrome did {{not break}} boldly. Espinoza later {{explained}} something felt [...] "off" [...] and he held the horse back a bit {{instead of going to}} the lead. When asked to move to the front, the horse did not unleash his usual burst of speed. Immediately following the race, Espinoza said [...] "He was just a little bit empty today". [...] Tonalist won the race, and California Chrome finished fourth in a dead heat with Wicked Strong. [...] Initial post-race analysts criticized Espinoza for not taking the horse to the front early on, but noticed that California Chrome had had some blood on his right front heel. After the race, review of photos taken at the start showed that the horse next to him, Matterhorn, moved too far to the left and stepped on California Chrome's heel as both horses broke from the gate. [...] As a result, California Chrome had run the race with a [...] "chunk" [...] of tissue taken out of his right front heel and a small cut on his tendon. The tendon injury was superficial, but the heel injury may have been a factor in his loss. [...] Sherman explained that he knew that something was not right when he saw the horse throw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> in the homestretch, and speculated later that the sand and dirt of the racetrack caused pain in the open wound. [...] The following day, Sherman assured the press that both injuries would heal.|$|E

The survivors make plans to escape by stealing helicopters but must fight past the remaining zombies. Abby dies, along with hope for a cure, when a ballistic projectile blows <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>up.</b> The survivors use the blade tips of their helicopter to kill the rest. However, while saving Cherry from a zombie, El Wray is fatally wounded. In the epilogue, Cherry, now sporting a minigun leg, leads the group and many more survivors to the Caribbean beach at Tulum, where they start a peaceful new society during a world-wide zombie outbreak.

2500|$|Tension between Wayne and American rapper, Pusha T, {{had been}} going on for years, {{beginning}} soon after Clipse and Birdman worked on [...] "What Happened to That Boy", the latter's 2002 single. In 2006, Wayne felt the Clipse song [...] "Mr. Me Too" [...] was directed at him which caused more tension between the two. In 2012 after much speculation that Pusha T was subliminally dissing Canadian rapper and Wayne's Young Money signee Drake in several songs, the speculation heightened after the release of Pusha T's [...] "Exodus 23:1" [...] song. Lil Wayne quickly responded on online social networking service Twitter and later released a diss track titled [...] "Goulish". In the first verse Wayne raps [...] "Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him / <b>His</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> his ass, I'mma have to head-butt him". Pusha T has called Wayne's diss track [...] "horrible" [...] and said he felt it didn't deserve a response. Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne saying he's over it. However, in late November, Pusha T dissed Wayne and Birdman on a new Ludacris song titled [...] "Tell Me What They Mad For". However, once the feud between Lil Wayne and Birdman arose, Pusha T sent out a tweet encouraging Lil Wayne to sign to G.O.O.D. Music, which also insulted Birdman for his hand-rubbing habit.|$|E

2500|$|During the Reconstruction Era, in 1870, former slave James Webster Smith, {{through private}} sponsorship, {{became the first}} African American cadet to enroll at West Point. Smith, however, was {{immediately}} and severely hazed by white cadets. It is believed that the Academy's military establishment was determined to force Smith out. One of Belknap's nephews, a cadet at the Academy, had been reprimanded (but not otherwise punished) for hazing Smith. In one instance, Smith was arrested and taken to a military court for fighting a white cadet. However, Major General Oliver O. Howard, an advocate for African American civil rights and {{in charge of the}} trial, acquitted Smith of all charges and gave him a light punishment for unruly conduct. This outraged the Academy's Bureau of Military Justice, who made a formal protest to Belknap on November 20, 1870. In a second instance in January 1871, Smith was arrested again for not holding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> when marching, after being severely harassed by white cadets. This time Smith was convicted and his case was appealed to [...] Belknap. Smith was recommended for expulsion, but Belknap intervened with President Grant, who changed the sentence to setting Smith back one academic year, which caused him to repeat his Plebe year. Smith continued at West Point until 1874, when Professor Peter S. Michie, a white supremacist, gave Smith a private test, in defiance of traditional West Point practice. Smith was forced out of West Point after having supposedly failed the test and being denied a chance to retest. Belknap concurred when Major General Thomas H. Ruger, appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871, reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the [...] "discreditable" [...] practice. Belknap admired Ruger's performance as West Point Superintendent and stated, [...] "I am pretty satisfied with the success of your management, and private conversations with officers of all grades, & with civilians too, who have been there since your accession..." [...] Other African Americans followed Smith's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877. In 1997, President Bill Clinton attempted to acknowledge and right the wrong done to Smith by awarding him a posthumous commission as a second lieutenant.|$|E
