5|$|The League {{oversaw the}} Permanent Court of <b>International</b> <b>Justice</b> {{and several other}} {{agencies}} and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These included the Disarmament Commission, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the Mandates Commission, the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation (precursor to UNESCO), the Permanent Central Opium Board, the Commission for Refugees, and the Slavery Commission. Three of these institutions were transferred to the United Nations after the Second World War: the International Labour Organisation, the Permanent Court of <b>International</b> <b>Justice</b> (as the International Court of Justice), and the Health Organisation (restructured as the World Health Organisation).|$|E
5|$|The main {{constitutional}} {{organs of}} the League were the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. It also had two essential wings: the Permanent Court of <b>International</b> <b>Justice</b> and the International Labour Organisation. In addition, {{there were several}} auxiliary agencies and commissions. Each organ's budget was allocated by the Assembly (the League was supported financially by its member states).|$|E
5|$|The International Court of Justice (ICJ), {{located in}} The Hague, in the Netherlands, {{is the primary}} {{judicial}} organ of the UN. Established in 1945 by the UN Charter, the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of <b>International</b> <b>Justice.</b> The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9-year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly; every sitting judge must be from a different nation.|$|E
40|$|The era of romanticization of <b>international</b> {{criminal}} <b>justice,</b> {{ushered in}} during the 1990 s is over. As romance fades, we are confronted with grim reality: the constraints and complexities of <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice,</b> the selectivity, the price tag, the inordinate length of international trials. Yet, the goals and objectives of <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice</b> must be (re) defined {{in order to assess}} success or failure. Success is when the International Criminal Court (ICC) remains idle: by preventing the commission of mass atrocities in the first place, and by empowering national jurisdictions. Reconciliation, on the other hand, can be no more than an incidental outcome of <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice,</b> not its purpose. All in all, {{there is a need to}} creatively confront the challenges the ICC's normative empire faces today, for <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice</b> to rise again with adjusted expectations...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> {{criminal}} <b>justice</b> as {{a discipline}} throws up numerous conceptual issues, engaging disciplines such as law, politics, history, sociology and psychology, to name but a few. This book addresses themes around <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice</b> from a mixture of traditional and more radical perspectives. While law, and in particular international law, {{is at the heart}} of much of the discussion around this topic, history, sociology and politics are invariably infused and, in some aspects of <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice,</b> are predominant elements. Fundamentally the exploration concerns questions of coherence and legitimacy, which are foundational to both the content and application of the discipline, and the book charts an illuminating path through these diverse perspectives. The contributions in this book come from some of the eminent scholars and practitioners in the area, and will provide some profound insight into and an enriched understanding of <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice,</b> helping to advance the field of study. This ambitious and necessary book will appeal to academics and students of international criminal law, <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice,</b> <b>international</b> law, transitional <b>justice</b> and comparative criminal law, as well as practitioners of international criminal law...|$|R
40|$|This piece retraces {{the genesis}} of the ideals of <b>international</b> {{criminal}} <b>justice</b> as stemming from liberal political ideals about the philosophy of peace through law and utilitarianism. It shows how their implementation is confronted, on the one hand, with politics understood as a balance of power, and on the other, with the reactivation of a critique of humanist universalism. In its final section, it examines the justifications for truth commissions, today sometimes presented as palliative measures in the absence of penal justice, while at other times considered as its ancillaries. It demands whether the unprecedented promotion of these commissions is perhaps ? much more so than the intertwining of law and politics ? the greatest obstacle to <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice.</b> <b>International</b> criminal <b>justice,</b> <b>international</b> law, democracy, liberalisme, war, peace...|$|R

5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of <b>International</b> <b>Justice</b> (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
5|$|The Permanent Court of <b>International</b> <b>Justice</b> was {{provided}} {{for by the}} Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and the Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by the Council and the Assembly, and its budget {{was provided}} by the latter. The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. It might also give an advisory opinion on any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly. The Court was open to all {{the nations of the world}} under certain broad conditions.|$|E
50|$|Finally, 36(5) {{provides}} for jurisdiction {{on the basis}} of declarations made under the Permanent Court of <b>International</b> <b>Justice's</b> statute.

40|$|Why do {{states of}} the Global South {{initiate}} <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice</b> processes for domestic atrocity crimes? The phenomenon of Southern agency regarding <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice</b> presents an empirical and theoretical puzzle given the Southern states' defence of Westphalian sovereignty, or the juridical equality of states and domestic non-intervention. <b>International</b> criminal <b>justice</b> challenges this notion of sovereignty by directly prosecuting individuals under international law through international courts. This thesis rejects this theoretical notion that <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice</b> curbs sovereignty, and argues that the initiative for <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice</b> processes {{is a type of}} short-term political strategy adopted by Southern state actors to strengthen specific aspects of their statehood. In doing so, the thesis challenges the dominant theoretical explanations of Southern state preference that relies on their relative weakness and the power of external factors, such as Great Power interests or transnational activist networks, and reclaims the possibility of agency for Southern state actors. The argument is derived from a theory developed in this thesis, referred to as judicial extraversion, or a counter-structural theory of strategic action that links the politics of statehood in the Global South and the political opportunities inherent in the nature of <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice,</b> namely, the individualisation of responsibility, criminalisation of specific forms of violence, and the privileged status of the state in the <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice</b> system. It develops this theory through the qualitative case studies of Ugandaâs self-referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC), Cambodiaâs request for an international criminal tribunal to the UN, and the counterexample of Colombiaâs special domestic criminal justice process for paramilitary demobilisation. The thesis finds that relative weakness of Southern states is insufficient to explain engagement with <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice,</b> and highlights the possibility of paradoxical agency. Finally, the findings suggest that, under particular circumstances, <b>international</b> criminal <b>justice</b> can be used to entrench the authority of weaker states in the international system. </p...|$|R

5|$|In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled {{during the}} Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was {{definitively}} ceded to the Albanian state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 the Albanian government, during the country's {{entrance to the}} League of Nations, committed itself {{to protect the rights}} of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, and none of the main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a potential threat to the territorial integrity of the Albanian state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of <b>International</b> <b>Justice,</b> in April 1935, did the Albanian side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.|$|E

5|$|The League {{resolved}} {{a dispute}} between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey {{over control of the}} former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul {{did not want to be}} part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq. In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations' arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of <b>International</b> <b>Justice,</b> which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admittance.|$|E
