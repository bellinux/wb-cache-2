40|$|In {{a simple}} oligopsonistic model, firms compete for labour through wages and <b>job</b> <b>qualities.</b> We modify the product market model {{developed}} by Vandenbosch/Weinberg 1995 {{and apply it}} to the job market with jobs being defined by two vertically differentiated non-wage characteristics. Workers differ in their valuation of these two characteristics but do not differ in their productivity. In equilibrium firms offer different wages and differ in only one of these non-wage characteristics. Whereas our labour market model is based on firms, we apply subclasses according to the UK SIC(2003) in our empirical analysis. When comparing subclasses within selected sectors (WERS) we found evidence that firms compete in both wages and <b>job</b> <b>qualities.</b> (author´s abstract) Series: Department of Economics Working Paper Serie...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of popular, real-world uses of infusing Positive Psychology in the workplace. In such contexts {{such as a}} workplace, researchers often hope to examine and measure variable levels of such factors such as productivity and organization. One such popular model is the aforementioned Job Characteristics Model (JCM), which applies influential theories of work as it correlates to the five central characteristics of skill variety, task identity, task significance, task autonomy, and task feedback. However, such practices such as business teams within a workplace often present the varying dynamics of positivity and negativity in business behaviors. There are often a plethora of special research teams that go into looking at certain workplaces {{in order to help}} report to employers the status of their employees. Furthermore, the three psychological states often measured and examined are: meaningfulness of performed work, responsibility of outcomes, and results knowledge. In mixing together these aspects, a score is generated in order to observe a range reflecting a <b>job</b> <b>quality.</b> In addition, each score details the differing degrees of autonomy and necessary feedback as it relates to ensuring high quality work. Most research points to the fact that typical teams of high performance are those that function high on positivity in their workplace behaviors.|$|E
