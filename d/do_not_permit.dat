5|$|Sections 9A(3)(b) and 9A(3)(c) of the Interpretation Act {{contemplate}} {{the use of}} explanatory statements to a tabled bill or a speech made by a minister {{on the occasion of}} the motion for the second reading of the bill as interpretive aids. However, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> reference to other explanatory statements or speeches. The statements the court may refer to under these provisions are strictly the statements concerning the bill in question.|$|E
5|$|Mother rodents {{provide both}} direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, and indirect parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> youngsters other than their own to nurse.|$|E
25|$|When {{interactions}} between factors are not negligible, {{they are often}} confounded in Plackett–Burman designs with the main effects, meaning that the designs <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> one to distinguish between certain main effects and certain interactions. This is called aliasing or confounding.|$|E

The RTM sells tickets allowing the use of both its trains and the Metro (TRAM titles) while the STM tickets <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> the boarding of trains.|$|E
25|$|The current mascot for Oklahoma is the Sooner Schooner, a conestoga wagon {{similar to}} the primary method of {{transportation}} used by early settlers in Oklahoma. The Schooner is driven by two white ponies named Boomer and Sooner. In 2005, the university also introduced two costumed mascots also named Boomer and Sooner to serve as mascots for football games and events that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> a covered wagon.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} major {{publishers}} providing printed handbell music {{such as the}} Hope Publishing Company, The Lorenz Corporation and Alfred Music Publishing as well as free sites from individual composers and arrangers. Costs associated with handbell music typically result from shipping (many scores are only published in hard-copy) and dissemination; as most scores <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> duplication and must be purchased individually for each ringer.|$|E

25|$|Morrison, like Boerne, Kimel and Garrett, {{was part}} of a series of Rehnquist Court {{decisions}} from 1999 through 2001 holding that Congress' enumerated powers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> various federal civil rights laws. The United States v. Morrison decision was also seen by the press as part of the Rehnquist Court's series of federalism decisions, mainly because of the Court's previous decisions in Lopez and other cases.|$|E
25|$|Double down: The {{player is}} allowed to {{increase}} the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet {{is placed in the}} betting box next to the original bet. Some games <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> the player to increase the bet by amounts other than 100%. Non-controlling players may double their wager or decline to do so, but they are bound by the controlling player's decision to take only one card.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} the IIHF, NHL and Hockey Canada <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> goaltenders to be {{designated}} as on-ice captains, because of the logistical challenge of having the goaltender relay rules discussions between referees and coaches {{and then return to}} the crease. (The Vancouver Canucks named goaltender Roberto Luongo as their captain during the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, but due to NHL rules, he did not serve as the official on-ice captain.) In the NCAA, there is no position-based restriction on the team captain.|$|E

25|$|Individual {{states have}} protested their own {{lack of control}} over gaming. Some even cite the tenth {{amendment}} – the right for states to have all other powers not specifically designated to the federal government– to fight against gambling. Others feel {{the federal government is}} forcing states to enter into unfair gaming-related compacts with Native American tribes. A few states, like Utah and Hawaii, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> gambling or casinos. State officials, in general, do not believe Native Americans should be exempt from state laws.|$|E
25|$|In addition, sexual {{coercion}} {{can lower}} body condition and immunity in ways other than physical damage. Harassment {{can lead to}} stress, which can result in weight loss, decreased immune function and energy stores, and less feeding, which has been seen in red-spotted newts. Furthermore, when females are constantly moving around to avoid violent males, they {{are not able to}} form female social ties (for example, Grévy's zebra/Equus grevyi). This also happens in species where herding males sometimes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> females to join their family in different groups, like in hamadryas baboons.|$|E
25|$|The Conservative halakha {{committee}} in Israel {{has ruled that}} women do not receive such aliyot and cannot validly perform such functions (rabbi Robert Harris, 5748). Therefore, not all Conservative congregations or rabbis permit these roles for bnot kohanim (daughters of priests). Moreover, many egalitarian-oriented Conservative synagogues have abolished traditional tribal roles and do not perform ceremonies involving kohanim (such as the Priestly Blessing or calling a kohen to the first aliyah), and many traditionalist Conservative synagogues have retained traditional gender roles and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> women to perform these roles at all.|$|E

25|$|Nearing Savannah, Clementine's {{walkie-talkie}} goes off. An unknown man {{tells her}} {{she will be}} safe once he deals with Lee and the group, and promises her that her parents are waiting for her. The group takes shelter in a well-fortified mansion, and Lee and Kenny head towards the pier to find a boat. There, they discover {{that there are no}} boats left in the city, and whatever useful supplies remain are being held in Crawford, a fortified elitist community who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> the elderly, the sick, or children into their ranks.|$|E
25|$|Lens {{cleaning}} systems come in {{two main}} varieties: a small motor-driven rubber wiper or brush conceptually similar to windshield wipers, or a fixed or telescopic high-pressure sprayer which cleans the lenses with a spray of windshield washer fluid. Most recent lens cleaning systems are of the spray type, because UN regulations <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> mechanical cleaning systems (wipers) {{to be used with}} plastic-lens headlamps, and most recent headlamps have plastic lenses. Some cars with retractable headlamps, such as the original Mazda MX-5, have a squeegee {{at the front of the}} lamp recess which automatically wipes the lenses as they are raised or lowered, although it does not provide washer fluid.|$|E
25|$|Central {{guidelines}} {{laid down}} by the CPC <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> the public advocacy of the legalisation of prostitution. Arguments concerning legalisation are not absent, however, from mainland China. On the contrary, some commentators contend that legally recognising the sex industry, in conjunction with further economic development, will ultimately {{reduce the number of}} women in prostitution. Domestic commentators have also been highly critical of the PRC's prostitution controls, with a consistent Marxist-informed focus of complaint being the gender-biased and discriminatory nature of such controls, as well as human rights abuses. Some commentators in China and overseas contend that the PRC's policy of banning prostitution is problematic because it hinders the task of developing measures {{to prevent the spread of}} HIV.|$|E

25|$|In his commentary, Ibn Taymiyya {{stresses}} that {{the primacy of}} the Sharia forms the soundest tradition in tasawwuf, and to argue this point he lists over a dozen early masters, as well as more contemporary shaykhs like his fellow Hanbalis, al-Ansari al-Harawi and Abdul-Qadir, and the latter's own shaykh, Hammad al-Dabbas the upright. He cites the early shaykhs (shuyukh al-salaf) such as Al-Fuḍayl ibn ‘Iyāḍ, Ibrahim ibn Adham, Ma`ruf al-Karkhi, Sirri Saqti, Junayd of Baghdad, and others of the early teachers, as well as Abdul-Qadir Gilani, Hammad, Abu al-Bayan and others of the later masters— that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> the followers of the Sufi path to depart from the divinely legislated command and prohibition.|$|E
25|$|The {{x-system}} {{has become}} as popular as the h-system, but {{it has long been}} perceived as being contrary to the Fundamento de Esperanto. However, in its 2007 decision, the Akademio de Esperanto has issued a general permission for the use of surrogate systems for the representation of the diacritical letters of Esperanto, under the condition that this is being done only when the circumstances <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> the use of proper diacritics, and when due to a special need the h-system fixed in the Fundamento is not convenient. This provision covers situations such as using the x-system as a technical solution (to store data in plain ASCII) yet still displaying proper Unicode characters to the end user.|$|E
25|$|Intermediate plains {{material}} is less abundant than the intercrater plains unit {{and has a}} density of superposed small craters that is intermediate between those of the intercrater plains and smooth plains units. The intermediate plains {{material is}} most readily mapped on the floors of those c1, c2, and c3 craters and basins that are surrounded by intercrater plains material with a distinctly higher crater density (FDS 27428). Contacts between intercrater plains and intermediate plains units that occur outside mapped craters and basins are gradational and uncertain.
