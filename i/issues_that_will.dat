25|$|Many {{believe that}} {{physiological}} adaptation to Mars gravity (0.38 G) and re-adaptation to Earth gravity (1 G) would {{be enhanced by}} frequent exposure to artificial gravity on board the spacecraft en route to and from Mars. This would require an on-board human-rated centrifuge or spacecraft rotation to produce a centrifugal force similar to gravity. This solution, while potentially effective, raises a number of operational, engineering, and physiological <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> need to be addressed. The human physiological responses to long-duration exposure to anything other than zero-gravity or Earth's gravity are unknown. Research is needed to identify the minimum level, duration, and frequency of gravity level required to maintain normal CNS functions, {{as well as the}} importance of a gravity gradient across the body.|$|E
25|$|Pre-session Strategy {{refers to}} the leader’s ability to {{understand}} the importance of small talk just prior to group discussion. The facilitator must cordially greet the group members and begin small talk {{while at the same time}} avoid the topics and <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> be discussed during the sessions. This will allow the group leader to observe the kind of interactions and understand which participant has what qualities. Recording is beneficial for the leader via tape recording and note taking. Note taking is useful as they can be utilized even if the tape recorder stops working. Someone other than the group leader or the facilitator should take detailed and in depth notes of the discussion. Beginning of the Discussion includes the usual pattern of discussion which is welcome, overview and topic, ground rules and first question. The overview must provide an explanation of the purpose and importance of the topic of discussion. Ground rules must be stated explicitly. Some of the examples are, minimizing or eliminating side conversations, one person talks at a time, no criticizing what others have to say and treating everyone’s opinion with respect and dignity. The initial conversation should include an “ice breaker” in order to make the members more comfortable and open.|$|E

2500|$|IMF {{managing}} director Christine Lagarde wrote in August 2011: [...] "For the advanced economies, {{there is an}} unmistakable need to restore fiscal sustainability through credible consolidation [...] plans. At {{the same time we}} know that slamming on the brakes too quickly will hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects. So fiscal adjustment must resolve the conundrum of being neither too fast nor too slow. Shaping a Goldilocks fiscal consolidation is all about timing. What is needed is a dual focus on medium-term consolidation and short-term support for growth and jobs. That may sound contradictory, but the two are mutually reinforcing. Decisions on future consolidation, tackling the <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> bring sustained fiscal improvement, create space in the near term for policies that support growth and jobs." ...|$|E
