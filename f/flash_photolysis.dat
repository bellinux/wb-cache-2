After the pulse of radiation, the concentration of different substances within the material are measured by emission spectroscopy or Absorption spectroscopy, hence the rates of reactions can be determined. This allows the relative abilities of substances to react with the reactive species generated by the action of radiation on the solvent (commonly water) to be measured.

50|$|Caged NAADP is an inactive, membrane-impermeant analog of NAADP {{that can}} be {{introduced}} into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette. <b>Flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP, allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> is an {{alternative}} to pulse radiolysis that uses high-power light pulses (e.g. from an excimer laser) rather than beams of electrons to initiate chemical reactions.

5000|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> was {{developed}} shortly after World War II {{as a result}} of the military's attempts to build cameras fast enough to photograph missiles in flight. The technique {{was developed}} in 1949 by Manfred Eigen, Ronald George Wreyford Norrish and George Porter, who won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this invention. [...] Over the next 40 years the technique became more powerful and sophisticated due to developments in optics and lasers. Also, the interest in this method grew considerably as the practical applications expanded from chemistry to areas such as biology, materials science, and environmental sciences. Today <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> facilities are extensively used by researchers to study light-induced processes in organic molecules, polymers, nanoparticles, semiconductors, photosynthesis in plants, signaling, and light-induced conformational changes in biological systems.|$|E
50|$|The law {{is further}} {{restricted}} to conventional photochemical processes using light sources with moderate intensities; high-intensity light {{sources such as}} those used in <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> and in laser experiments are known to cause so-called biphotonic processes; i.e., the absorption by a molecule of a substance of two photons of light.|$|E

As {{a result of}} the {{development}} of <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis,</b> Norrish was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 along with Manfred Eigen and George Porter for their study of extremely fast chemical reactions.

Disperse Orange 1 contains approximately 25% dye by weight, {{with the}} remaining mass consisting of NaCl and other salts. [...] This dye is useful in conducting experiments with <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> due to the isomerization effect between the trans-4A4N and cis-4A4N states that occurs during photo relaxation.|$|E
50|$|Thrush {{studied the}} atom and free radical {{reactions}} {{in the gas}} phase of spectroscopic methods. He made the first comprehensive examination of the absorption spectra of free radicals in homogeneous explosions using <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis.</b> He discovered the absorption spectra of several free radicals (for example, the azide, cyclopentadienyl and tropyl radicals), and he determined the ionisation potential of the tropyl radical.|$|E
5000|$|Transient {{kinetics}} experiments. In these experiments, reaction behaviour is tracked {{during the}} initial fast transient as the intermediate reaches the steady-state kinetics period. These experiments {{are more difficult to}} perform than either of the above two classes because they require specialist techniques (such as <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> of caged compounds) or rapid mixing (such as stopped-flow, quenched flow or continuous flow).|$|E
50|$|He {{was also}} {{credited}} as having {{insight into what}} was needed to make successful scientific research:His contribution to industrial research was characterized by an ability to excite the interest of (and to support financially) academically experienced scientists. He not only awarded many postgraduate research studentships {{in order to train}} future staff but was also perceptive enough to finance more senior university research workers very early in the development of such diverse topics as organic crystal structure analysis, digital computers, <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> and fluidised beds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> is a pump-probe {{laboratory}} technique, {{in which}} a sample is firstly excited by a strong pulse (called pump pulse) of light from a laser of nanosecond, picosecond, or femtosecond pulse width or by a short-pulse light source such as a flash lamp. This first strong pulse starts a chemical reaction or leads to an increased population for energy levels other than the ground state within a sample of atoms or molecules. Typically the absorption of light by the sample is recorded within short time intervals (by a so-called test pulses) to monitor relaxation or reaction processes initiated by the pump pulse.|$|E
50|$|The {{main focus}} of George's {{researches}} were centered on the mechanical implications of the thermal and photochemical organic reactions. His studies covered different areas of organometallic chemistry and he worked on electron transfer processes, organic reactions and functional group transformations. Thus he studied the organic reactions and functional group transformations, heterohexa-1, 3, 5-triene systems with regard to its electrocyclic reactions and the synthetic utility and phototransformations of dibenzobarrelenes. He also studied the picosecond laser <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> techniques and the transient intermediates involved in photoreactions. He was noted for the original approach in his studies of hetero-aromatic systems.|$|E
50|$|EWM is an {{effective}} mechanism by which to get a short duration high intensity light source. The peak intensity for copper wire, for example, is 9.6*108 candle power/cm2. J.A. Anderson wrote in his initial spectrography studies that the light was comparable to a black body at 20,000K. The advantage of a flash produced {{in this way is}} that it is easily reproducible with little variation in intensity. The linear nature of the wire allows for specifically shaped and angled light flashes and different types of wires can be used to produce different colors of light. The light source can be used in interferometry, <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis,</b> quantitative spectroscopy, and high-speed photography.|$|E
50|$|Many {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to measure the rates of radical reactions. The two possible ways to measure the reaction rates are direct and indirect approaches. Direct approaches such as the rotating sector method have restrictions that hinder their expansion or application to the wide variety of types of radical reactions of chemical interest. In addition, direct methods such as <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> and pulse radiolysis require a relatively large amount of time and expensive equipment. With an indirect approach, one can still obtain relative or absolute rate constants without the need for instruments or equipment beyond those normally needed for the reaction being studied.|$|E

5000|$|Porter {{became a}} {{professor}} in the Chemistry department at the University of Sheffield in 1954-55. It was here he started his work on <b>Flash</b> <b>Photolysis</b> with equipment designed and made in the departmental workshop. During this tenure he also took part in a television programme describing his work. This was in the [...] "Eye on Research" [...] series. Porter became Fullerian Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Royal Institution in 1966. During his directorship of the Royal Institution, Porter was instrumental in the setting up of Applied Photophysics, a company created to supply instrumentation based on his group's work. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 along with Manfred Eigen and Ronald George Wreyford Norrish. In the same year he became a Visiting Professor at University College London.|$|E
50|$|Focusing his {{researches}} on photochemistry, Natarajan studied various araas of {{the discipline}} such as polymer dynamics using fluorescence, <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> studies using picosecond and femtosecond lasers and solar energy conversion. He demonstrated that micromolecular dye coatings of electrodes used in photoelectrochemical cells returned high current density. This led to his subsequent studies of solar energy conversion using chemically modified electrodes. He published his researches in peer-reviewed journals including Nature, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Journal of Physical Chemistry A, Inorganic Chemistry and Chemical Communications by way of 107 articles and he was granted patents for four of his findings. He mentored over 30 doctoral scholars and {{was associated with a}} number of journals as their editorial board member. He also sat in a number of government committees including those of the Department of Science and Technology and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and delivered several featured talks and orations.|$|E

A rough correlation exists between quenching rate constants and peroxide thermal lability.

The reactivity of these species were investigated by uv/vis <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> studies {{and in the case}} of CpMn(C 0) 3 by tnr <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis.</b> The rate constants for the reaction of theses species with a variety of nucleophiles were determined and the thermodynamic parameters associated with these reactions were measured. The chelation reactions of chromium carbonyl complexes, containing multidentate ligands, were investigated by uv/vis and ir spectroscopy. These chelation reaction were seen to proceed via bridging intermediates, even in those cases where the initial complex was coordinated in a monodentate fashion. The crystal structures of a number of chromium and tungsten complexes were determined and correlated with their spectroscopic features...|$|E

This series of experiments used laser <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> to study the effect of ionic liquids on the rate constants of the recombination of ketyl radicals, created from <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> of benzophenone in the presence of benzhydrol.

40|$|Low-temperature <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> with IR {{and visible}} {{spectroscopy}} {{was used to}} probe {{the influence of the}} distal histidine His- 64 (E 7) of sperm-whale myoglobin (Mb) on the orientation of bound carbon monoxide (CO) and on the kinetics of CO rebinding. The synthesis and high-level expression of a sperm-whale myoglobin gene in Escherichia coli permits the efficient substitution of the distal histidine through site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of His-E 7 with glycine [GlyE 7]Mb bound with CO (CO[GlyE 7]Mb) results in one broad bound-CO IR stretch band, v(C-O), centered at 1973 cm- 1 at 10 K, in contrast to three distinct bands for native and synthetic wild-type MbCO at 1966, 1945, and 1929 cm- 1. After <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> at 10 K, the unbound state of CO[GlyE 7]Mb exhibits two CO stretch bands, whereas MbCO has three. Fourier transform IR spectroscopy measurements of the linear dichroism after photoselective <b>flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> of CO bound to [GlyE 7]Mb at 10 K reveals the bound CO to be oriented at an angle of alpha = 20 degrees +/- 2 degrees with respect to the heme normal. <b>Flash</b> <b>photolysis</b> data from 10 to 300 K provide evidence for a larger distal pocket and a smaller enthalpy barrier (by approximately 4 kJ/mol) for [GlyE 7]MbCO as compared with wild-type MbCO. These results reinforce the notion that the dominant control of the binding step at the heme iron comes from the proximal side through the protein structure...|$|E
