40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of alum (aluminum sulfate) {{in reducing the}} concentrations of potential pollu- tants in pond effluents was investigated in catfish production ponds. Application of alum at 50 mg/l to water remaining in ponds immediately after seining for harvest did not generally result in significantly greater removal of nutrients and solids than did settling alone, although removal rates of some variables were initially higher in the alum treated ponds. Within four hours of sein- <b>ing</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> alum treated and untreated ponds, there was removal of more than 85 % of total sus- pended solids, 75 % of total phosphorus, 72 % of turbidity, and more than 40 % of biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand.

As stated in [4] “ [...] . while calculation of the noise-free capacity of constrained sequences is well known, the computation of the capacity of a constraint in the presence of noise [...] . has been an unsolved problem in the half-century since Shannon’s landmark paper [...] ” We express the constrained capacity of a binary symmetric channel with (d, k) -constrained input as a limit of the top Lyapunov exponents of certain matrix random processes. We compute asymptotic approximations of the noisy constrained capacity for cases where the noise parameter ε is small. In particular, we show that when k≤ 2 d, the error term with respect to the constraint capacity is O(ε), whereas it is O(ε log ε) when k> 2 <b>d.</b> <b>In</b> <b>both</b> cases, we compute th...|$|R

Holstein cows (n. =. 20) were fed a controlled-energy (CON) diet (1. 24 Mcal/kg) for the entire dry period (~ 50 d) or the CON diet during the first 29 d of the dry period followed by a moderate-energy (OVE) diet (1. 47 Mcal/kg) during the last 21 d prepartum. All calves were weighed at birth before first colostrum intake. Calves chosen for this study (n. =. 6 per maternal diet) had blood samples harvested before colostrum feeding (d 0) and at 2 and 7 d of age. Blood samples {{were used to determine}} metabolites, acute-phase proteins, oxidative stress markers, hormones, phagocytic capacity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes, and total RNA was isolated from PMN. Calves from OVE dams weighed, on average, 5. kg less at birth (44. 0 vs. 48. 6. kg) than calves from CON dams. Blood glucose concentration in OVE calves had a more pronounced increase between 0 and 2 d than CON, at which point phagocytosis by PMN averaged 85 % in OVE and 62 % in CON. Compared with CON, calves from OVE had greater expression of TLR 4, but lower expression of PPARA and PPARD at birth. Expression of PPARG and RXRA decreased between 0 and 2 <b>d</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> groups. Concentrations of leptin, cholesterol, ceruloplasmin, reactive oxygen metabolites, myeloperoxidase, retinol, tocopherol, IgG, and total protein, as well as expression of SOD 2 and SELL increased markedly by 2 <b>d</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> groups; whereas, cortisol, albumin, acid-soluble protein, NEFA, insulin, as well as expression of IL 6, TLR 4, IL 1 R 2, LTC 4 S, and ALOX 5 decreased by 2 d. By 7 d of age, the concentration of haptoglobin was greater than precolostrum and was lower for OVE than CON calves. Our data provide evidence for a carry-over effect of maternal energy overfeeding during the last 3 wk before calving on some measurements of metabolism in the calf at birth and the phagocytic capacity of blood neutrophils after colostrum feeding. It might be feasible to design nutrient supplements to fortify colostrum in a way that metabolic and immunologic capabilities of the calf are improved. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association...|$|R

40|$|Batch {{culture of}} Isochrysis galbana clone T-ISO is {{difficult}} {{due to its}} unstable biomass production; hence, the effect of continuous cultivation at different dilution rates was investigated to compare its productivity with that of batch culture. Significantly higher total algal cell yield was attained in continuous cultures (1. 70 Ã— 10 8 and 1. 03 Ã— 10 8 cells L - 1 at 0. 60 d - 1 and 0. 30 d - 1 dilution rates, respectively) compared with batch culture (0. 16 Ã— 10 8 cells L - 1); the batch culture did not receive any inflow of nutrients. The amount of protein per cell was similar <b>in</b> <b>both</b> batch and continuous cultures at 0. 60 d - 1 dilution rate after 24 h and 5 <b>d</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> culture systems. Chlorophyll a yield was not affected by dilution rate but decreased as the culture aged. The dry weight yield was also similar <b>in</b> <b>both</b> batch and continuous cultures. The higher nitrate concentration supplemented in the batch culture resulted in higher cell density and elevated protein content of the alga. Rotifer (Brahionus rotundiformis) cultures that received inflow of nutrients from the algal tanks had significantly higher (P< 0. 05) peak population count (28 and 33 individuals mL - 1 at 0. 30 and 0. 60 d - 1 dilution rates, respectively) compared with rotifer cultures that did not receive an inflow of food (18. 22 individuals mL - 1). The higher biomass yield of T-ISO using continuous cultivation method can increase the population growth of rotifer under tropical conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} a {{detailed}} study of the electronic properties {{of a series of}} boron-doped diamond epilayers with dopant concentrations ranging from 1. 10 ^ 20 to 3. 10 ^ 21 cm − 3 and thicknesses (d ⊥) ranging from 2 µm to 8 nm. By using well-defined mesa patterns that minimize the parasitic currents induced by doping inhomogeneities, {{we have been able to}} unveil a new phase diagram differing from all previous reports. We show that the onset of superconductivity does actually not coincide with the metal-insulator transition in this system. Moreover a dimensional crossover from 3 D to 2 D transport properties could be induced by reducing <b>d</b> ⊥ <b>in</b> <b>both</b> the metallic non-superconducting and superconducting epilayers, without any reduction of Tc with <b>d</b> ⊥ <b>in</b> the latter...|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} retrobulbar ocular {{blood flow}} changes after phacoemulsification. METHODS:Prospective consecutive study. Forty-six eyes from 46 cataract patients scheduled for phacoemulsification surgery at Affiliated Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical College were recruited, of which 22 patients with normal {{blood pressure and}} 24 patients with hypertension. All eyes were examined by a color Doppler imaging at before, 4 h, 1 d after surgery. Resistance indexes(RIs), peak systolic flow velocity(PSV), end-diastolic flow velocity(EDV) were assessed in the ophthalmic artery(OA), central retinal artery(CRA), and short posterior ciliary arteries(PCA). RESULTS:RIs of a retrobulbar ocular vessels are stable at 4 h and 1 <b>d</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> group postoperatively. A slight decrease in PSV of PCA in hypertension patients, while a slightly increase in normal patients at 4 h postoperatively was observed(10. 22 ± 4. 39 vs 11. 73 ± 4. 69). There were {{no significant difference between}} them(P = 0. 089). PSV and EDV in CRA are lower in hypertension patients but without statistical significance compared with normal patients. There was a statistically significant decrease in EDV of the PCA in hypertension patients at 4 h postoperatively compared with preoperatively(3. 23 ± 1. 10 vs 3. 63 ± 1. 15, P = 0. 036). CONCLUSION:Retinal blood flow was disturbed at super-early after phacoemulsification. Age and hypertension are important risk factors to phacoemusification...|$|R

In Expt 2 plastic compliance, coefficient of extension, extensibility, and hydraulic conductance were calculated from changes in leaf extension rate occasioned by imposing linear stress. Plastic and elastic compliances of growing zones were 10 ? 20 times greater than those of mature laminae. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> species, drought reduced (a) leaf extension rate, (b) the length of the growing zone, (c) the height of maximum growth, (d) the plastic compliance of whole bases (Expt 1), and (e) hydraulic conductance. The elastic compliance of whole leaf bases was unaffected by drought, but when expressed per unit length of growing zone was increased by drought. Killing with methanol reduced the plastic compliance of leaf bases in control plants, but not in droughted plants. F. arundinacea differed from L. multiflorum in having (a) a lower leaf extension rate (although drought reduced extension by the same proportion <b>in</b> <b>both</b> species), (b) a longer growing zone in droughted plants in Expt 2, (c) a lower elastic and plastic compliance of whole killed leaf bases and laminae, (d) slightly higher plastic compliance in attached growing leaves, and (e) lower plastic compliance per unit length of growing zone in attached leaves. The hybrid was generally intermediate between the parents. The results are discussed in relation to methodology and to crop improvement. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background: The rate {{limiting}} step in progesterone synthesis by corpus luteum {{appears to be the}} movement of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane that is facilitated by a novel protein named steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. Recently we have found a reduction in S tAR protein expression following lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment in gonadotropin-stimulated rat. In t he present study, the effect of lithium on the expression of StAR gene and serum levels of progesterone were investigated. Methods: Immature 23 days old Wistar rats were induced with injection of pregnant mare 's serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) followed by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Then, rats were injected with either LiCl or saline at 12 hours post- hCG injection. Ovaries were collected at 4 -hour interval from 8 to 24 hour post- hCG injection. Expression of StAR gene was determined by semi- quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, serum levels of progesterone were measured by ELISA. Results: Our results showed that in response to the gonadortopin treatment, serum levels of progesterone increase <b>d</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> control and LiCl-treated animals, but it significantly decreased in LiCl-treated animals as compared with the control. Also significant decreases were observed in expression of StAR gene in ea rly stage of luteinization following LiCl treatment. Conclusion: It is concluded that LiCl is an effecti ve suppressor of StAR expression, and also the critical step of the progesterone synthesis was affected by LiCl treatment in gonadotropin-stimulated rat...|$|R
