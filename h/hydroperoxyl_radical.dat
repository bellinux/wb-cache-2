40|$|The third {{explosion}} limit of hydrogen oxidation in closed vessels {{has always been}} {{thought to be the}} result of the competition between homogeneous gas-phase reactions and diffusion of <b>hydroperoxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> to the walls, where they are destroyed.

40|$|A flux of {{hydroxyl}} radicals {{generated by}} gamma-irradiation can fragment monoamine oxidase in the membrane of submitochondrial particles. This fragmentation can be inhibited by mannitol {{and in addition}} is more extensive in monoamine oxidase preparations that have been depleted of lipid. This latter observation {{is consistent with the}} higher yields of fragmentation induced by hydroxyl radicals in soluble proteins in the absence of added lipids. In the absence of oxygen, gamma-irradiation of submitochondrial particles leads to cross-linking reactions. A flux of <b>hydroperoxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> also causes fragmentation, whereas one of superoxide is virtually inactive in this respect. The irradiation of submitochondrial particles leads in addition to the accumulation of products of lipid peroxidation. When these irradiated preparations are exposed to ferrous or cupric salts a further fragmentation of monoamine oxidase ensues, especially at acid pH. These transition-metal-catalysed reactions do not occur with irradiated preparations depleted of lipid, and the post-irradiation protein modifications are concomitant with further lipid peroxidation. The data indicate roles for lipid radicals in both fragmentation and cross-linking reactions of proteins in biological membranes.

Herein, we calculate reaction rate constants for H abstraction from primary, secondary and benzylic sites in nPB. Rate of abstraction of a benzylic H atom dominates that of a secondary H atom with negligible abstraction of the primary H atom at T ⩾ 600 K. We present the reaction enthalpies for 1 -phenyl- 1 -propyl (R 1), 1 -phenyl- 2 -propyl (R 2) and 1 -phenyl- 3 -propyl (R 3) radicals, and compare the computed reaction rate constants and bond dissociation enthalpies with analogous scarce literature values. Addition of HO 2 radicals to radical sites in R 1, R 2 and R 3 proceeds in a highly exothermic process and results {{in the formation of}} HO 2 –phenylpropyl adducts. Mapped potential energy surfaces illustrate all plausible exit channels of the three HO 2 –phenylpropyl adducts. Master equation calculations for the three phenylpropyl + HO 2 reactions indicate that direct O–OH bond fission and water elimination control the fate of the adducts leading to the formation of ketonic-type structures.

One prevailing theory shows that glutathione-complexed iron clusters can create new fluorescence quenching, replacing that of ROS-GSH. Other common metal ions and ROS did not cause interference [9, 10]. Thus, iron-based oxides have potential applications in GSH detection. Currently, the use of bismuth ferrite (BFO) provides an alternative method for GSH monitoring [11]. Compared with semiconductor [12] and organic [13] thin films, the anti-ferromagnetic phase of the BFO membrane has several outstanding features: (i) the creation of one-dimensional conductive channels activated at voltages as low as 1 V demonstrates artificially created ferroelectric vortices in BiFeO 3 thin films [14]. (ii) The presence of non-toxic, highly stability, highly remnant polarisation (58.9 μC·cm− 2) and fatigue resistance (up to 4.6 × 107 cycles) [15, 16]. (iii) The divalent iron (Fe 2 +) as reductant that can capture the active GSH groups such as the carboxyl (-COO−) and sulfhydryl (−SH) groups [17].

40|$|Photocatalysis over {{semiconductors}} [1 - 4] {{is based}} on the excitation of the semiconductor by photons whose energy is at least equal to that of the band gap. The electrons thus promoted to the conduction band can be transferred to surface/adsorbed electron-acceptor groups, molecules or ions, and the associated electron vacancies/positive holes in the valence band can be filled by electron-donor surface/adsorbed species. Therefore redox reaction can be produced. However, the charge carriers and the radicals or radical ions resulting from the capture of electrons and holes coexist in or on the same semiconductor particles. Consequently, the probability of recombination of charges and radicals or of back electron transfers is high. This draws the attention on the main flaw of photocatalysis over semiconductors which is the low rates of the desired chemical transformations with respect to the photonic power employed. Methods to enhance these rates are indicated below.
