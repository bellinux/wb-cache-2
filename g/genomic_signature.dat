40|$|Abstract — The {{advent of}} {{sequencing}} technologies allows to reassess {{the relationship between}} species in the hierarchically organized tree of life with respect to pat-terns in their <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures.</b> Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) in Euclidean and hyperbolic space are applied to <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures</b> of 350 different organisms of the two superkingdoms Bacteria and Archaea to link the sequence signature space to pre-defined taxonomic levels, i. e. the tree of life. In the hyperbolic space the SOMs are trained by either the standard algorithm (HSOM) or in a hierarchi-cal manner (H 2 SOM), which is naturally supported by a lattice structure in hyperbolic space. <b>Genomic</b> <b>signatures</b> containing estimated statistics of oligonucleotide of certain lengths are used as features for training. For evaluating the SOM performances, distances between organisms in the feature space, on the SOM grid and in the taxonomy tree are compared pair-wise using a correlation measure and Spearman’s ρ.

The distances between species are better preserved when using the HSOM or H 2 SOM which makes the hyperbolic space better suited for embedding the high dimensional <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{beauty of}} {{microarray}} analysis of gene expression (MAGE) {{is that it}} can be used to discover some genes that were previously thought to be unrelated to a physiologic or pathologic event. During the period from 1999 to 2007, applications of MAGE in cancer investigation have shifted from molecular profiling, identifying previously undiscovered cancer types, predicting outcomes of cancer patients, revealing metastasis signatures of solid tumors, to guiding the use of therapeutics. The roles of cancer <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures</b> have evolved through three phases. In the first phase, <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures</b> were described in stored cancer specimens and dubbed as molecular portraits of cancer. When gene expression profiles were carefully correlated with sufficient clinical information of cancer patients, new subgroups of cancers with distinct outcomes were revealed. In studies of the second phase, validation of cancer signatures was emphasized and commonly performed with independent groups of cancer specimens or independent data set. In the third phase, cancer <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures</b> have been further expanded beyond depicting the molecular portrait of cancer to predicting patient outcomes and guiding the use of cancer therapeutics. Cancer <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures</b> have become an essential part of a new generation of cancer clinical trials. It is advocated that, in future clinical trials of cancer therapy, the cancer specimens of each participant should be tested for currently available predictor <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures,</b> so that the most effective treatment with the least adverse effects for each patient can be identified.

25|$|Codon usage bias, {{a measure}} related to codon frequencies, {{was one of}} the first {{detection}} methods used in methodical assessments of HGT. This approach requires a host genome which contains a bias towards certain synonymous codons (different codons which code for the same amino acid) which is clearly distinct from the bias found within the donor genome. The simplest oligonucleotide used as a <b>genomic</b> <b>signature</b> is the dinucleotide, for example the third nucleotide in a codon and the first nucleotide in the following codon represent the dinucleotide least restricted by amino acid preference and codon usage.|$|E
2500|$|To detect HGT using {{parametric}} methods, the host's <b>genomic</b> <b>signature</b> {{needs to}} be clearly recognizable.

Not accounting for such intra-genomic variability in the host can result in over-predictions, flagging native segments as HGT candidates. Larger sliding windows can account for this variability at the cost of a reduced ability to detect smaller HGT regions.|$|E

For example, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a predatory δ-Proteobacterium, has homogeneous GC content, and it might be concluded that its genome is resistant to HGT. However, subsequent analysis using phylogenetic methods identified a number of ancient HGT events in the genome of B. bacteriovorus. Similarly, if the inserted segment was previously ameliorated to the host's genome, as is the case for prophage insertions, parametric methods might miss predicting these HGT events. Also, the donor's composition must significantly differ from the recipient's to be identified as abnormal, a condition that might be missed in the case of short- to medium-distance HGT, which are the most prevalent. Furthermore, it has been reported that recently acquired genes tend to be AT-richer than the recipient's average, which indicates that differences in GC-content signature may result from unknown post-acquisition mutational processes rather than from the donor's genome.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. -The {{molecular}} systematics of vertebrates {{has been}} based entirely on alignments of primary structures of macromolecules; however, higher order features of DNA sequences not used in traditional studies also contain valuable phylogenetic information. Recent molecular data sets conflict over the phylogenetic placement of flightless birds (ratites- paleognaths), but placement of this clade critically influences interpretation of character change in birds. To help resolve this issue, we applied a new bioinformatics approach to the largest molecular data set currently available. We distilled nearly one megabase (1 million base pairs) of heterogeneous avian genomic DNA from 20 birds and an alligator into <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures,</b> defined as the complete set of frequencies of short sequence motifs (strings), thereby providing a way to directly compare higher order features of nonhomologous DNA sequences. Phylogenetic analysis and principal component analysis of the signatures strongly support the traditional hypothesis of basal ratites and monophyly of the nonratite birds (neognaths) and imply that ratite genomes are linguistically primitive within birds, despite their base compositional similarity to neognath genomes. Our analyses show further that the phylogenetic signal of <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures</b> are strongest among deep splits within vertebrates.

Therefore, many different methods have been used to assess Brucella taxonomy. In the current work, we examine 32 sequenced genomes from genus Brucella representing the six classical species, as well as more recently described species, using bioinformatical methods. Comparisons were made at the level of genomic DNA using oligonucleotide based methods (Markov chain based <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures,</b> <b>genomic</b> codon and amino acid frequencies based comparisons) and proteomes (all-against-all BLAST protein comparisons and pan-genomic analyses). Results We found that the oligonucleotide based methods gave different results compared to that of the proteome based methods. Differences were also found between the oligonucleotide based methods used. Whilst the Markov chain based <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures</b> grouped the different species in genus Brucella according to host preference, the codon and amino acid frequencies based methods reflected small differences between the Brucella species. Only minor differences could be detected between all genera included in this study using the codon and amino acid frequencies based methods. Proteome comparisons were found to be in strong accordance with current Brucella taxonomy indicating a remarkable association between gene gain or loss on one hand and mutations in marker genes on the other. The proteome based methods found greater similarity between Brucella species and Ochrobactrum species than between species within genus Agrobacterium compared to each other. In other words, proteome comparisons of species within genus Agrobacterium were found to be more diverse than proteome comparisons between species in genus Brucella and genus Ochrobactrum. Pan-genomic analyses indicated that uptake of DNA from outside genus Brucella appears to be limited. Conclusions While both the proteome based methods and the Markov chain based <b>genomic</b> <b>signatures</b> were able to reflect environmental diversity between the different species and strains of genus Brucella, the genomic codon and amino acid frequencies based comparisons were not found adequate for such comparisons.
