40|$|The initial {{wireless}} phone {{industry in}} the United States had many competitors, but due to mergers and acquisitions the industry has become highly consolidated. This paper documents {{the history of the}} consolidation. More importantly, I use the geographic path of consolidation to distinguish whether consolidation has been motived by retail market power or efficiency explanations. One efficiency explanation is that consumers prefer national coverage areas. I use <b>data</b> on <b>roaming</b> agreements in the early cellular industry to analyze whether contracts can substitute for roaming agreements. Finally, in joint work with Patrick Bajari and Stephen Ryan we estimate the consumer valuation for national coverage areas using plan demand data. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWith the {{emergence}} of the Internet of Things, billions of new devices will be wirelessly-connected to the Internet in the next decade, thus yielding a growth of the data traffic, especially in the network infrastructures maintained by mobile operators. Intermittently-connected hybrid networks (ICHNs), which combine an infrastructure part and loosely-connected mobile ad hoc parts, offer interesting perspectives to cope with the growing data traffic. Abstract. This paper presents a decentralized unstructured peer-to-peer overlay system that aims at supporting communications in ICHNs deployed in wide geographical areas. It also presents the simulation results we obtained for our system for an ICHN composed of a few hundreds of fixed stations (with Internet access) and thousands of mobile devices used by people to exchange <b>data</b> while <b>roaming</b> a medium-size city...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Reusable {{software}} components are of primary importance for software developers. Unfortunately, {{until very recently}} C++ provided no standard basic data structures (such as linked lists and vectors) or algorithms. Instead, each new software project included a development phase for these basic structures. Algorithms would then be created to operate on these structures. If the structures changed, the algorithms needed to be modified. Each programming team also had {{to be concerned about}} efficiency of data structure access and algorithms. This problem is particularly acute in the parallel programming realm, where data structures must be built to utilize concurrency whenever possible. With no widely accepted standard of serial data structures, the parallel <b>data</b> structures <b>roam</b> even farther afield. Each new parallel C++ library provides either non-standard tools to build and support data structures or includes a set of specialized data structures. Clearly, if cost-effec...|$|R

50|$|In telecommunications, {{bill shock}} is the {{negative}} reaction a subscriber can experience if their phone bill has unexpected charges. Bill shock can happen when, for example, a user grossly overuses data applications without an appropriate data plan, or uses a mobile device while roaming (whether domestically or internationally) without understanding the voice or <b>data</b> <b>roaming</b> charges involved.|$|E
40|$|In today’s {{environment}} every user {{wants to}} access their data {{at any time}} and at anywhere. In an organization they store their data only on their computers, if they want to access their <b>data</b> during <b>roaming</b> situation, it is not possible one to carry the data at every time, this is a difficult factor for an organization. Cloud computing can address this problem by providing data storage mechanism to access the data at anywhere. This is one of the storage device used to access their data at anywhere through networks which is called cloud provider. For this service user is worried about the security and privacy issue. For this issue survey shows various techniques for the security and privacy mechanism for the user data. There are many data storage techniques available, but we are trying to combine cloud database service along with data security and also can perform independent operations on encrypted data.

50|$|The {{business}} {{strategies of}} operators also create important barriers to increased usage. The price of data traffic is one example, even though {{more and more}} flat rate offers are introduced. Expensive or complex <b>roaming</b> <b>data</b> pricing is still a major issue for travelers. Aside from pricing constraints, operators often run “walled garden” approaches for value added mobile services, as premium services represent a significant revenue potential for them. This restricts the end user from freely exploring the Mobile Internet. Another barrier has been that phone settings are often not correct, and have not been possible to monitor and manage remotely.|$|R
