2500|$|One study {{published}} in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol concluded that high doses (0.28mg/kg) of thujone in alcohol had negative effects on attention performance in a clinical setting. It delayed reaction time, and caused subjects to concentrate their attention into the central field of vision. Low doses (0.028mg/kg) did not produce an effect noticeably different from the plain alcohol control. While the effects of the high dose samples were statistically significant in a <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> <b>test,</b> the test subjects themselves were unable to reliably identify which samples contained thujone. For the average [...] man, the high dose samples in the study would equate to 18.2mg of thujone. The EU limit of 35mg/L of thujone in absinthe means that given the highest permitted thujone content, that individual would need to consume approximately 0.5 litres of high proof (e.g. 50%+ ABV) spirit before the thujone could be metabolized in order to display effects detectable in a clinical setting, which would result in a potentially lethal BAC of >0.4%.|$|E

50|$|Applicant Fei Wang {{appeared}} before the skeptic audience July 2014 with the claim that he could send energy through his hand using a type of therapeutic touch. The organizers set up a <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> <b>test</b> involving a volunteer selected by Wang to place their hand in a box while wearing noise canceling headphones and a blindfold. Wang or the control person (Jamy Ian Swiss) depending on the roll of a die would insert their hand also in the box (not touching the volunteer) for several seconds. Swiss was selected to be the control because Wang felt that Swiss {{does not have the}} ability that is being tested. After either Wang or the Control (Swiss) had placed their hand in the box, the volunteer would state which energy was felt. Wang had to get 8 out of 9 correct in order to pass to the final Million Dollar challenge. After the volunteer was unable to feel the energy that Wang said he was sending through his hand, on the first two tries, the test was concluded as it was not statistically possible for Wang to win the challenge even if he was chosen correct on the remaining tries.|$|E
50|$|In the {{consumer}} (home theater) market, AC-3 and DTS are close {{in terms of}} audio performance. When the DTS audio track is encoded at its highest legal bitrate (1509.75 kbit/s), technical experts rank DTS as perceptually transparent for most audio program material (i.e., indistinguishable to the uncoded source in a <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> <b>test).</b> Dolby claims its competing AC-3 codec achieves similar transparency at its highest coded bitrate (640 kbit/s). However, in program material available to home consumers (DVD, broadcast, and subscription digital TV), neither AC-3 nor DTS typically run at their highest allowed bitrate. DVD and broadcast (ATSC) HDTV cap AC-3 bitrate at 448 kbit/s. But even at that rate, consumer audio gear already enjoys better audio performance than theatrical (35 mm movie) installations, which are limited to even lower bitrates. When DTS audio {{was introduced to the}} DVD specification, a few studios authored DTS tracks on some DVDs at the full bitrate (1509.75 kbit/s). Most later DVD titles that offered DTS tracks were encoded at 754.5 kbit/s (about half the rate of 1536kbps). At this reduced rate, DTS no longer retains audio transparency. This was done to make room for more audio tracks and content to reduce costs of spreading extra material on multiple discs.|$|E

The calculated values showed the significant difference between PPC group and the controls, which means that the clinical effect of PPC is precisely more excellent than those of PA and PG for the treatment of subjective symptoms associated with prostatic hyperplasia.

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{perceptually}} lossless coder {{is presented}} for the compression of medical images. Built on the JPEG 2000 coding framework, {{the heart of}} the proposed coder is a visual pruning function, embedded with an advanced human vision model to identify and to remove visually insignificant/irrelevant information. The proposed coder offers the advantages of simplicity and modularity with bit-stream compliance. Current results have shown superior compression ratio gains over that of its information lossless counterparts without any visible distortion. In addition, a case study consisting of 31 medical experts has shown that no perceivable difference of statistical significance exists between the original images and the images compressed by the proposed coder.

Statistical analysis of the evolution of symptoms and the results obtained by psychological testing has revealed the positive action of Pervincamine on the postconcussional syndrome and on mental as well as motor functioning in general.

The test was conducted by two physicists, members of the Mexican Academy of Science, and several military men and policemen participated, including two certified expert operators of the GT200. More than 1600 amphetamine capsules and four bullets were hidden in one of eight cardboard boxes distributed on a large abandoned ballroom. In a first stage the substances were hidden in plain view of all the participants and the GT200 was 100% successful (four successes in four tries). However, the second stage was <b>double</b> <b>blind,</b> and only three searches succeeded out of twenty tries, a result consistent with chance but not with any useful effectiveness.

Methods : 84 healthy adult men and women were selected through a survey whom had never received the bee venom therapy in the past. The concentration of Normal Saline, SBV and NSBV pharmacopuncture was equally at 0. 1 mg/mL and the experiment was conducted as the <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> <b>test.</b> Results : Participants of the study was comprised of 63 men and 21 women with the average age of 28. 3 years.
