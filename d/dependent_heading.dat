One of the major limitations, especially of approaches based on Decision Trees, is that the questions that guide the search for effective contexts must be known in advance. However, the variation in the speech signals is caused by multiple factors, not all {{of which may be}} known during the training procedure. State tying methods, on the other hand, are strictly local, and therefore do not allow to reap the benefits of variation that spans longer length units such as syllables. In this paper, we present an approach that does not require prior knowledge and that still can find the most important variants of speech units of arbitrary length. The method is based on clustering the multi-dimensional dynamic trajectories corresponding to speech units. Thus, we define multipath model topologies based on automatically derived clusters of dynamic trajectories (Trajectory Clustering based hidden Markov models, TCHMMs). In this paper we compare the clusters obtained with Trajectory Clustering and knowledge based context <b>dependent</b> <b>Head</b> and Tail models in a Head-Body-Tail model (HBT) connected digits recognition task.

The adult hydra hypostome functions as head organiser. After hydra head removal it is newly formed and complete heads can be regenerated. The molecular components of this organising region involve Wnt-signalling and β-catenin. However, it is not known how correct patterning of hypostome and tentacles are achieved in the hydra head and whether other signals in addition to HyWnt 3 are needed for re-establishing the new organiser after head removal. Here we show that Notch-signalling is required for re-establishing the organiser during regeneration and that this is due to its role in restricting tentacle activation. Blocking Notch-signalling leads to the formation of irregular head structures characterised by excess tentacle tissue and aberrant expression of genes that mark the tentacle boundaries. This indicates a role for Notch-signalling in defining the tentacle pattern in the hydra head. Moreover, lateral inhibition by HvNotch and its target HyHes are required for head regeneration and without this the formation of the β-catenin/Wnt <b>dependent</b> <b>head</b> organiser is impaired. Work on prebilaterian model organisms has shown that the Wnt-pathway is important for setting up signalling centres for axial patterning in early multicellular animals.

40|$|Abstract. Sudden {{closure of}} {{a control valve}} or {{stopping}} of a pump, either planned or accidental, produces excess pressure in a fluid-filled pipeline known as water hammer. Water hammer, or hydraulic transient, refers to pressure fluctuations caused by a sudden increase or decrease in flow velocity. Pressure waves in the fluid interact with axial, bending, shear a torsional stress waves in the pipe wall. The interaction between axial stress waves and fluid pressure takes place via the radial expansion and contraction of the pipe wall. It is essential to determine the magnitude and frequency of pressures and forces triggered due to these transients to estimate the stresses and vibration levels in the pipeline. This unsteady state phenomenon deals with the change between kinetic energy and pressure energy. If the pressure induced exceeds the pressure rating of a pipe given by the manufacturer, the pipe may rupture. Detrimental consequence may result unless a pressure protection device is installed. Today the designer is compelled to reduce the safety margins and as well as furnish proof of the expected fluid transient behavior by using analytical methods {{in support of his}} claim. The unsteady, one dimensional, incompressible fluid flow in closed conduits is governed by two partial differential equations, viz., the momentum and continuity equations. In this work, an effort is made to study these transients solving numerically and analytically the momentum and continuity equations. The program used incorporates the method of characteristics for the calculation of the time <b>dependent</b> <b>head</b> and velocity of the fluid at any point of a closed conduit.

40|$|Recent {{contributions}} to {{the debate on the}} structural architecture of small clauses (SCs) have provided new insights into (what will be called here) Williams’s (1983) puzzle – a dilemma arising when SCs are compared to embedded infinitives. Williams (1983) attributed the lack of narrow scope readings with SCs to the inexistence of a subject position inside the small clause. More recently, Sportiche (2005), as well as Moulton (2013) have challenged this conclusion. Under the assumption that the quantificational force of noun phrases is <b>dependent</b> on <b>heads</b> situated in the extended projection of the clause (Beghelli and Stowell 1997, etc.), the two accounts solve the puzzle by assuming that adjectival (Adj) SCs are too small to contain the heads relevant for nominal quantification licensing, while still housing a subject position (clausal analysis - CA). This paper addresses further data which appear to require refinements of the quantification picture. The preliminary conclusion is that once the CA is enriched with a restructuring account (developing on Stowell 1991) as well as domain-based locality conditions (similar to Bobaljik and Wurmbrand’s 2005 Domain Impenetrability Condition) yet more aspects related to the nature of embedded adjective configurations become less puzzling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} flow of an {{incompressible}} viscous fluid through a long tube with compliant walls. The flow is governed by a given time <b>dependent</b> pressure <b>head</b> difference. The Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous fluid are used to model the flow, and the Navier equations for a curved, linearly elastic membrane to model the wall. Employing the asymptotic techniques typically used in thin domains, we derive a set of effective equations that hold in medium-to-large compliant vessels for laminar flow regimes. The main novelty is the derivation of the effective equations that do not assume any ad hoc closure, typically assumed in the derivation of one-dimensional models. Using ideas from homogenization theory for porous media flows, we obtain a closed system of effective equations that are of Biot type with memory. Memory accounts for the wave-like phenomena in the problem. Although the equations are two-dimensional, their simple structure enables a design of a numerical algorithm that has complexity of a one-dimensional solver. Our numerical simulations show that our model captures two-dimensional effects that cannot be captured using standard one-dimensional methods. Key words.

50|$|In linguistics, {{the head}} of a phrase is the word that determines the {{syntactic}} category of that phrase. For example, {{the head of}} the noun phrase boiling hot water is the noun water. Analogously, {{the head of a}} compound is the stem that determines the semantic category of that compound. For example, the head of the compound noun handbag is bag, since a handbag is a bag, not a hand. The other elements of the phrase or compound modify the head, and are therefore the <b>head's</b> <b>dependents.</b> Headed phrases and compounds are called endocentric, whereas exocentric ("headless") phrases and compounds (if they exist) lack a clear head.

Given the task of understanding a speech signal {{in the presence of a}} simultaneous noise, listeners could potentially use head orientation to either maximize the level of the signal in their better ear, or to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in their better ear. To establish what head orientation strategy listeners use in a speech comprehension task, we used an infrared motion-tracking system to measure the head movements of 36 listeners with large (> 16  dB) differences in hearing threshold between their left and right ears. We engaged listeners in a difficult task of understanding sentences presented at the same time as a spatially separated background noise. We found that they tended to orient their heads so as to maximize the level of the target sentence in their better ear, irrespective of the position of the background noise. This is not ideal orientation behavior from the perspective of maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the ear, but is a simple, easily implemented strategy that is often effective in an environment where the spatial position of multiple noise sources may be difficult or impossible to determine...|$|R

The experiments in this paper test, modify and extend Gibson’s (1998) claims. Each experiment manipulated noun phrases (NPs) in the subject positions of object-extracted relative clauses in order to determine how different types of NPs affected sentence complexity. Experiments 1, 2 and 3 used questionnaires to gauge sentence complexity, whereas Experiments 4 and 5 used self-paced reading. The results from Experiments 1, 2, 4 and 5 suggest that the complexity of the experimental items was more closely related to the Givenness status of the embedded subject in the Givenness Hierarchy than to whether the embedded subject was old or new to the discourse. Experiment 3 compared materials in which a quantifier was rotated through subject positions of a nested relative clause structure.
