40|$|Copolymerization with nonconjugated dienes {{offers an}} {{attractive}} route for introducing long-chain branching in polypropylene. From a simplified set of rate equations for such copolymerization with a metallocene catalyst, we derive the probabilities of branch formation {{at different stages}} of the reaction in a semibatch reactor. Using these probabilities, we generate an ensemble of molecules via a Monte Carlo sampling. The knowledge of the branching topology and segment lengths allows us to compute the flow properties of the resins from computational rheology. We compare our model predictions with existing experimental data, namely the molar mass distribution and small amplitude oscillatory shear response, for a set of resins with varying <b>diene</b> <b>content.</b> The rheology data suggest that the entanglement time Ï.,e depends sensitively and in a well-defined fashion on the <b>diene</b> <b>content...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} type of frying oil and {{temperature}} on the oxidative stability {{of potato chips}} during storage was studied. Cottonseed oil, soybean oil, olive kernel oil and palmolein were used as frying media. The chips were packaged in metallized cellophane bags and incubated at 63 degrees C. At definite time intervals the absorbed oil was extracted and analyzed for peroxide value, Totox number and conjugated <b>diene</b> <b>content.</b> Olive kernel oil and palmolein absorbed into the chips showed better stability, whereas soybean oil presented the higher oxidation rate. Frying temperature (170, 180 or 190 degrees C) {{did not affect the}} oxidation rate during storage, with the exception of conjugated diene formation which was greater for chips fried at 190 degrees C. Ground oregano or oregano extract, obtained by petroleum ether extraction, were added to the chips as antioxidants. Both retarded significantly the oxidation rate of the oil absorbed into the chips, with results comparable to tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) during storage at 63 degrees C for 7 days; however TBHQ proved significantly more effective after that time.

40|$|Virgin {{olive oil}} is valued for its flavor, but {{unacceptable}} off-flavors may develop on storage in food products containing this oil due to oxidation. The oxidative stability of oil-in-water emulsions containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and {{virgin olive oil}} phenolic compounds was studied. Four oil-in-water emulsions with and without BSA and phenols isolated from virgin olive oil were prepared. These model systems were stored at 60 degrees C to speed up lipid oxidation. Primary and secondary oxidation products were monitored every three days. Peroxide values and conjugated <b>diene</b> <b>contents</b> were determined as measures of the primary oxidation products. p-Anisidine values and volatile compounds were determined as measures of the secondary oxidation products. This latter determination {{was carried out by}} headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography. Although olive oil phenolic compounds and BSA contributed some antioxidant activity when present as individual additives, the combination of BSA with phenols in an emulsion showed 58 - 127 % synergy, depending on which analytical method was used in the calculation. The emulsion containing phenolic compounds and BSA showed a low level of deterioration after 45 days of storage at 60 degrees C...|$|R
40|$|Peroxide-cross-linked ethylene−propylene−(diene) rubbers, EP(D) M, have complex network {{structures}} {{with various}} types of chemical cross-links as well as both temporary and trapped chain entanglements. To obtain a detailed picture of the respective contributions of these different types of cross-links and entanglements to the total network density, solid-state 1 H NMR relaxometry and spectroscopy have been applied {{to a series of}} peroxide-cured EPDM with systematic variation of the peroxide and <b>diene</b> <b>contents.</b> The effective Hahn-echo decay time T 2 reflects the volume-average network density, which correlates well to mechanical properties, such as torque and modulus, and linearly depends on the initial peroxide content for the compositions probed. The slope reflects the peroxide-induced chemical cross-links. The chain-entanglement density that is estimated from the intercept agrees with published neutron scattering values. The observed differences in cross-link density between EPDM an EPM are consistent with the double bond conversion estimated from magic angle spinning 1 H NMR and Raman spectra. By comparing T 2 relaxation times in solid and swollen EPDM, we can distinguish between the contributions of temporary and trapped entanglements. The shapes of the Hahn-echo decays suggest strong network heterogeneity, which has also been probed by use of double-quantum-filtered T 2 relaxometry. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Silver-ion {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} was used to fractionate a mixture of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers (as the free fatty acids, CLAFFA) in commercial CLA mixtures and biological samples. Due to the unchanged retention mechanism, {{it was assumed that}} the elution order of the isomers remained {{the same as that of}} methyl esters separated on the same column. The most abundant isomers, cis/trans 10, 12 - 18 : 2 and cis/trans 9, 11 - 18 : 2, were separated better as free acids on a single column than in the methyl ester form. Quantification of the CLA standard was used as the reference profile to evaluate different methylation methods commonly used to prepare CLA methyl esters for quantitation. Acid-and base-catalyzed derivatization methods resulted in CLA intraisomerization and losses in total conjugated <b>dienes</b> <b>content.</b> Acid (HCl and BF 3) methylations significantly elevated the level of trans,trans isomers and significantly reduced the cis/trans isomers. Base methylation, tetramethylguanidine/methanol, resulted in loss of trans,trans isomers, and a substantial loss of total underivatized conjugated dienes. Other catalysts such as the trimethylsilyldiazomethane produced additional peaks of unidentified artifacts.

40|$|Various uncompounded ethylene–propylene–diene (EPDM) {{elastomers}} were photo-oxidized using standard Weather-O-Meter (WOM) {{aging and}} oxygen absorption measurements during UV irradiation. The {{influence of the}} type and amount of diene on the UV stability was investigated. FTIR (ATR) measurements of the carbonyl absorbance after WOM aging were comparable with {{the outcome of the}} oxygen absorption tests. Both techniques showed a decrease in UV stability with increasing <b>diene</b> <b>content.</b> In addition, EPDM containing 5 -ethylidene- 2 -norbornene (ENB) as the third monomer showed a higher UV stability compared to EPDM containing dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) as the third monomer. Furthermore, a linear relation was found between the carbonyl absorbance after WOM aging and the third monomer content for DCPD- and ENB-containing EPDM samples with comparable ethylene/propylene (C 2 /C 3) ratio. The microhardness (International Rubber Hardness Degree) and the Young's modulus of the various EPDMs as function of the WOM irradiation time showed a maximum. This maximum is the result of parallel photo-crosslinking and chain-scission reactions, the latter being dominant in the later stages of the oxidation process. Combining the results from the FTIR measurements with the Young's modulus showed that DCPD-containing EPDM has a higher propensity to crosslinking reactions compared to ENB-containing EPDM...|$|E

The employed metallocenes were (BzCp) 2 ZrCl 2 (1), (C 18 H 37 Cp) 2 ZrCl 2 (2), (CH 3) 2 Si(Ind) 2 ZrCl 2 (3) and / 2 C(Cp,Flu) ZrCl 2 (4). Diene incorporation and thermal {{characteristic of the}} polymers were determined by 13 CNMR and DSC. For the homogeneous systems, only the unbridged metallocene (1) showed {{a decrease in the}} activity as the <b>diene</b> <b>content</b> was increased. The ability for diene incorporation in the polymer chain followed the catalyst order (1) < (3) < (2) < (4). Regarding the supported systems, it was observed that all of them showed lower activity than the corresponding homogeneous catalysts. A sharp loss of activity in relation to the homogeneous counterpart was noticed by employing the ansa-metallocenes on MCM- 41, especially the complex (4) supported catalyst. The effect of the mesoporous material as support on the behavior of the studied metallocene homogeneous systems in ethylene–diene copolymerization was an increase of polymer molecular weight, maintaining the same level of diene incorporation, except for catalyst (2), when a decrease of the diene incorporation was observed...|$|E

Oxidation of the oil was monitored by determination of the PV, conjugated <b>diene</b> <b>content,</b> and hexanal formation. Emulsions containing EGCG, caffeic acid, and, to a lesser extent, Trolox were much more stable during storage {{in the presence of}} BSA than in its absence even though BSA itself did not provide an antioxidant effect. BSA did not have a synergistic effect on the antioxidant activity of TBHQ. The BSA structure changed, with a considerable loss of fluorescent tryptophan groups during storage of solutions containing BSA and antioxidants, and a BSA-antioxidant adduct with radical-scavenging activity was formed. The highest radical-scavenging activity observed was for the isolated protein from a sample containing EGCG and BSA incubated at 30 degreesC for 10 d. This fraction contained unchanged BSA as well as BSA-antioxidant adduct, but 95. 7 % of the initial fluorescence had been lost, showing that most of the BSA had been altered. It can be concluded that BSA exerts its synergistic effect with antioxidants because of formation of a protein-antioxidant adduct during storage, which is concentrated at the oil-water interface owing to the surface-active nature of the protein...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of the effect of}} dehydration temperatures (40 °C, 50 °C, and 60 °C) on the microbiological quality, antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of lipids of buckwheat-based minimally processed "raw food" (MPRF) was performed. Buckwheat flakes with various ingredients were soaked in sterile distilled water for 20 h, then MPRF samples were formed and dehydrated at constant temperature. Total viable counts, coliform, fungi, yeasts and aerobic spore-forming bacteria counts were evaluated in dehydrated products. While fungi were effectively reduced at all drying temperatures, higher total viable and coliform counts were found in MPRF samples after drying at 40 °C and 50 °C. Generally, antioxidant activity of MPRF samples did not significantly differ, and superoxide dismutase activity remained constant with the increase of drying temperature. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation was significantly higher in MPRF samples dehydrated at 40 °C than in those dehydrated at higher temperatures. Lipid oxidation stability measured by peroxide value, conjugated <b>dienes</b> <b>content</b> and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assay was not substantially affected during the dehydration process. Preparing MPRF by dehydration at 40 °C and 50 °C was considered as representing a microbial hazard whereas overall antioxidant activity was found to be minimally influenced by the dehydration temperatures. © 2016 National Agricultural and Food Centre (Slovakia).

All the methods were applied to samples of minced herring (Clupea harengus) differing in quality and composition. In addition to comparisons of total lipid yield, the extracted lipids were compared with respect to content of triglycerides, phospholipids, free fatty acids, α-tocopherol, lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated <b>dienes.</b> The <b>content</b> of phospholipids was found to differ most between the lipids extracted by the four methods. Here, the chloroform/methanol/water system was the most efficient, followed by heptane/ethanol/water/sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and then iso-propanol/hexane. However, by decreasing the level of SDS, the efficiency of the heptane/ethanol/water/SDS system in extracting phospholipids was increased to the same level as that of the chloroform/methanol/water system. This decrease in SDS also resulted in a higher recovery of free fatty acids. The lack of correlation between yields of phospholipids and yields of lipid oxidation products throughout this study was surprising because of the often-described susceptibility of phospholipids to oxidation...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors found}} that autoxidized methyl linolenate (oxd MLn) {{inhibited}} trypsin, so {{the relation between}} the autoxidation of MLn and the inhibition of trypsin by oxd MLn was studied. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. The inhibition by oxd MLn was observed only in the absence of Ca^ 2 + and the rate of inhibition increased under the condition that trypsin activity lowered owing to the autolysis of trypsin. 2. The inhibitory action of oxd MLn depended on the reaction with trypsin but not on the substrates used in the determination of trypsin activity. 3. Peroxide value, conjugated <b>diene</b> <b>content</b> and TBA value of oxd MLn were the highest in one day, when oxidized at 40 ℃. The inhibition by oxd MLn was not so serious at the early stage of oxidation and increased gradually with the progress of oxidation. The fact indicated that the inhibition was not due to methyl linolenate hydroperoxides but to the secondary products of oxd MLn. 4. The polymer inhibited trypsin definitely among the fractions obtained from oxd MLn by chromatography on Bio-Beads S-X 3. 5. The inhibitory action of polymer on trypsin was found to be the noncompetitive type by employing the Lineweaver-Burk method of plotting. 著者らは酸化リノレン酸メチルがtrypsinを阻害することを明らかにしたので,リノレン酸メチルの自動酸化とtrypsin阻害との関連を研究した. 結果は次の通りである. 1. 酸化リノレン酸メチルによるtrypsin阻害はCa^ 2 +の存在していない系でのみ観察され,その阻害率はtrypsinの自己分解によってtrypsin活性が低下する条件で上昇した. 2. 酸化リノレン酸メチルの阻害作用は基質とではなくtrypsinとの反応に依存していた. 3. 自動酸化させたリノレン酸メチルによるtrypsin阻害は,POV,共役ジエン量およびTBA値が最高を示した 40 ℃で 1 日間自動酸化させたリノレン酸メチルでは大でなく,酸化の進行に伴って漸増した. このことからtrypsin阻害はリノレン酸メチルハイドロパーオキサイドによるものでなく酸化二次生成物によることが明らかとなった. 4. 酸化リノレン酸メチルのBio-Beads S-X 3 カラムクロマト法による分画画分の中で,多量体による阻害が顕著であった. 5. 多量体の阻害作用はLinewever-Burkプロット法により非競合型であることが明らかとなった...|$|E

However, the mechanism leading to the final disease status is not fully understood. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for nuclear factor (NF) -κB in muscle degeneration as well as regeneration in DMD patients and mdx mice. We investigated the effects of blocking NF-κB by inhibition of oxidative stress/lipid peroxidation on the dystrophic process in mdx mice. Five-week-old mdx mice received {{three times a week}} for 5 weeks either IRFI- 042 (20 mg/kg), a strong antioxidant and lipid peroxidation inhibitor, or its vehicle. IRFI- 042 treatment increased forelimb strength (+ 22 %, P < 0. 05) and strength normalized to weight (+ 23 %, P < 0. 05) and decreased fatigue (− 45 %, P < 0. 05). It also reduced serum creatine kinase levels (P < 0. 01) and reduced muscle-conjugated <b>diene</b> <b>content</b> and augmented muscle-reduced glutathione (P < 0. 01).

Two different rubbers with a similar ethylene to propylene ratio and <b>diene</b> <b>content</b> but with {{a significant difference in}} molar mass and level of long chain branching were used in the study. The molecular mechanisms of the chemical degradation occurring at the surface were determined using surface analysis (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). The results reveal formation of several oxygenated species on the surface {{as a consequence of the}} acid attack. Furthermore, the crosslink sites of the exposed rubber samples are also found vulnerable to hydrolytic attack as evidenced by the decrease in crosslink density. The extent of surface degradation was strong enough to affect the bulk mechanical properties. Changes in mechanical properties were also monitored through determining retention in tensile strength, (%) elongation at break, modulus at 50 % elongation, and change in micro-hardness. A negative correlation is also established between retention in modulus at 50 % elongation and decrease in crosslink density. Scanning electron microscopy reveals the topographical damage at the surface due to the aqueous acid induced chemical degradation. The results indicate that the chemical degradation proceeds mainly via hydrolysis of crosslinks but upon prolonged exposure, the oxygenated species tend to combine with each other.

Seeding following alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) was compared to establishment after wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Treatments used were a control (no N applied), and two rates of N (50 and 100 kg/ha) applied at two dates (March and May). Comparisons were also made of ammonium sulfate (AS) and ammonium nitrate (AN) forms of N applied in March the second year. Seed samples were taken for analysis of protein, oil content, and fatty acid composition of oil. From the second year studies, seed weight, germination, and seedling growth determinations were made. Relationships of relevant parameters were also studied. Most all applications of N resulted in greater protein content, with 100 kg N as AS applied in March producing the greatest increase. Oil content was reduced by almost every rate of N at either date and in either form. Seed yields were affected by N application {{in the first year}} of study, but not in the second. March application of N increased seed yields whereas the May application decreased yields when L. alba followed wheat. When following alfalfa, seed yields were decreased with the high rates of N at both dates of application. Protein yield was increased by 100 kg N in March when L. alba followed wheat. After alfalfa, protein yields were decreased when high rates of N were applied. Oil yields were reduced in all three studies from N application. The fatty acid composition of seed oil was influenced by N application. C 20 monoene content was reduced from N treatments, while C 22 monoene content increased the first year but not in the second. The C 22 <b>diene</b> <b>content</b> was decreased by N application in the first year, but increased in the second.

Seed weight was positively correlated to oil content and negatively correlated to protein content. Germination percent was increased from plots receiving the 100 kg N as AS treatment. Protein was positively and oil negatively correlated to germination percent. Seedling root and shoot growth from the seed from treated plots was increased by both rates of AN.

Purpose of study. Establishing pathognomonic criteria and biochemical mechanisms of adverse effect of EMR on the organism of laboratory animals in conditions of cold stress. Materials and methods. The laboratory subacute experiment was carried out on mature white male rats of WAG line, weighing 190 - 220 g for 1 month. The animals were divided into 4 groups of 10 animals in each group. The first group was subjected to the isolated action of electromagnetic radiation (frequency 70 kHz, tension 600 V/m) at a comfortable air temperature of 25 ± 2 ° C. The second group was subjected to the mixed action of EMR and low temperature 4 ± 2 °C. The third group served as a control {{with regard to the}} first group, and the fourth group - with regard to the second, at air temperature of 25 ± 2 °C. Expositions were carried out 5 times a week (for 4 : 00 every day). To identify changes in biochemical parameters studied during the experiments, blood sampling was performed at the stages of 5, 15, 30 days and urine sampling – at the stages of 15, 30 days in dynamics. Blood serum was used as biomaterial. It was determined the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated <b>diene,</b> <b>content</b> of SH-groups, superoxide dismutase, ceruloplasmin, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, atherogenic index was determined, the level of urea, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, content of chlorides, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, glucose, and catalase activity. Renal function was studied by the content of creatinine, cholinesterase, urea, uric acid, chlorides, potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus and glucose in urine. Results and discussion. The findings showed that the isolated action of EMR only led to a change in the activity of catalase and a trend toward an increase in MDA level. Values of lipoprotein profile also did not have reliable changes, but high values of atherogenic index throughout the study showed the negative impact of EMR on lipid metabolism. Reliable changes in liver function tests indicated a disorder of liver detoxification function and possible derangement of protein metabolism. A decrease in creatinine and uric acid in the urine of rats is also evidence of this. The mixed effect of EMR and positive low temperature predetermined deeper violations practically in all components of metabolism, which exhibit low levels of SH-groups and the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase, an increase in the concentration of ceruloplasmin. The observed increase in VLDL and triglycerides indicated the increase of the processes of atherogenesis. Acid phosphatase activity increased, increased alkaline phosphatase tends to raise the level of serum phosphorus levels in rats of the experimental group. There were more pronounced changes in the functioning of the liver. The level of urea in the blood serum was reliably increased. In the mixed action of EMR and positive low temperature, the level of uric acid in urine reliably increased, indicating that the development of renal failure in this group of animals, which was also indicated by elevated levels of chlorides in the urine. Conclusions. 1. The leading biochemical mechanisms of adverse effects of mixed action of EMR and positive low temperature is a disorder of the antioxidant system of blood, lipid metabolism and renal excretory function. 2. The mixed effect of EMR and positive low temperature on the organs and systems was more pronounced compared to the isolated action of electromagnetic radiation. 3. The above determines the need to consider the increase of biological effect of EMR established in the experiment on laboratory animals in the conditions of cold stress, when substantiating hygienic standards, the development and introduction of prophylactic measures into the practice of sanitary supervision...|$|E

The hyperlipidemic rat model is suitable to study the physiological effect of table beet on the metabolic alterations and the redox homeostasis in the liver. In fatty liver, {{as a consequence of}} hyperlipidemy, the redox homeostasis is strongly injured. General biologically active compounds of table beet have indirect lipid lowering effect and antioxidant properties. Therefore, the effect of lyophilised table beet powder was studied on altered lipid metabolism and redox parameters in hyperlipidemic rats. Hyperlipidemy was induced by a fat-rich diet, and both in the control group and in the hyperlipidemic group, animals were treated with the lyophilised table beet powder (2 g bwkg− 1) added into rat chow for 10 days parallel with the feeding. Significant antioxidant activity of table beet was recorded in the hyperlipidemic liver. This phenomenon was expected because of the significant amount of betanin and the high total polyphenol content of the beet. Significant beneficial changes were also observed in the serum cholesterol level, alkaline phosphatase and alanine-aminotransferase activities, although a non-expected elevation was observed in the serum bilirubin level in hyperlipidemy. Non-specific H-donor activity was not changed, but protein related free SH-group concentration was decreased in the plasma. Serum triglyceride level was better after table beet treatment in normolipidemy, only. Change of redox-homeostasis was more favourable in the liver during the treatment. <b>Diene</b> conjugate <b>content</b> and the level of induced free radicals decreased during the table beet treatment in case of fatty liver. These changes were due to the bioactive components of the commercially available table beet. Consequently, table beet due to its specific qualities beneficially influences several metabolic pathways, therefore it can be considered as a functional food. ...|$|R

The radical scavenging {{activity of the}} non-fractionated fresh oil, {{as well as the}} lipophilic and hydrophilic fractions of the oil was determined using a 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The fatty acid composition of the fresh and stored oils was analyzed by gas chromatography. The acid value, peroxide value, p-anisidine value and conjugated <b>diene</b> and triene <b>contents</b> in the fresh oils, as well as in those stored throughout the whole period of their shelf life, were measured by CEN ISO methods. The antioxidant activity of the oils expressed as Trolox equiv-alent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), ranged from 0. 17 to 2. 32 mM. The lipophilic fractions of the oils were char-acterized by much higher antioxidant activity than the hydrophilic ones. There were no significant changes in fatty acid composition and only slight changes in the oxi-dative stability parameters of the oils during their shelf life. Through the assessment of the relationship between anti-radical activity and the oxidative stability of oils, it is proposed that a DPPH assay predicts the formation of oxidation products in cold-pressed oils—however, the correlations differ in fractionated and nonfractionated oils...|$|R

We also sought to evaluate the efficacy of mango and acerola pulps as antioxidants in film-forming dispersions using a response surface methodology design experiment. The bio-based films were used to pack palm oil (maintained for 45 days of storage) under accelerated oxidation conditions (63 % relative humidity and 30 C) to simulate a storage experiment. The total carotenoid, total polyphenol, and vitamin Ccontents of films were evaluated, while the total carotenoid, peroxide index, conjugated <b>diene,</b> and hexanal <b>content</b> of the packaged product (palm oil) were also monitored.

A STUDY ON THE LIPID PEROXIDATION STATUS AND THE ANTIOXIDANT SYSTEM IN RATS AT EXPERIMENTAL DIABETIC RETINOPATHY 1 Volodymyr Volodymyrovych Semenko, 1 Valeriy Mykolayovych Serdyuk, 2 Ivan Volodymyrovych Savytskyi 1 Dnipropetrovsk Regional Clinical Ophthalmologic Hospital 2 Odessa National Medical University Abstract Activation of free radical oxidation is one of the key elements of the diabetes mellitus pathogenesis that leads to structural and functional disruption of membranes. Oxidative stress and imbalance between its intensity and the antioxidant system condition, comply with the data obtained from the literature, play an important role in the development of this disease complications. The defect of β-cells of Langerhans islets caused by hyperglycemia enhanced oxidative stress, is also substantially affect the progression of diabetes and its complications. The aim of this work is to study the status of lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant system at experimental diabetes, as well as to study the effectiveness of arginine corrective action. Wistar outbreeding white rats were used in the study, with the weight of 180 - 200 g. Comply with objectives of the work, animals were ranked into 3 groups: group 1 – 20 animals that were not subjected to any influence; they served as control; group 2 – 30 animals in which diabetes mellitus was simulated; group 3 – 30 animals were aimed to receive a 7 % arginine solution, against the backdrop of diabetes. Diabetes was modeled with an intraperitoneal three times delivery of alloxan at a dose of 7. 5 ml, with 5 days interval. Delivery of alloxan have been carried out with the animals free drinking of 5 % fructose solution. The experiment lasted 30 days. Scientists witnessed 100 % survival of experimental rats while applying this model. Activation of lipid peroxidation was detected with the alloxan diabetes model, as evidenced by an increase in the MDA and <b>diene</b> conjugates <b>content</b> in blood serum.

Additionally, the study of the oxidative stability of acylglycerols synthesized by lipases was intended. Urea complexation was used to concentrate polyunsaturated fatty acids from seal blubber oil. The concentration of docosapentaenoic acid in final products reached as high as 24 %. Enzymatic synthesis of acyglycerols directly from glycerol and fatty acid concentrates in organic solvents was studied. Three lipases (Lipase SP 435 from Candida Antactica, lipase IM 60 from Mucor miehei, lipase PS 30 from Pseudomonas sp.) were used as biocatalysts for esterification. Lipase SP 435 from Candida Antarctica showed the highest activity for esterification. Effects of reaction parameters, namely temperature, time course and mole ratio of glycerol to fatty acids were followed with all three lipases. The optimal reaction time was 24 h at 30 °C and the mole ratio of glycerol to fatty acid was 14 for lipase SP 435. The maximum degree of acylglycerol synthesis exceeded 90 %. The effect of time course and mole ratio of glycerol to fatty acids on acylglycerols distribution was also determined. The proportion of monoacylglycerols in samples was low and remained almost constant as the reaction proceeded. However, the proportion of diacylglycerol was increased rapidly in a short time period and then decreased gradually to some extent, depending on the lipase, and then plateaued. The proportion of triacylglycerol was increased gradually to some extent depending on the lipase, than it was maintained constant. The effect of mole ratio of glycerol to fatty acids on the acylglycerols distribution was studied. The higher mole ratio of glycerol to fatty acids, the higher was the proportion of monoacylglycerols and the lower the proportion of triacylglycerols.

One of these pathogens was an apparent complex of C. gloeosporioides and Pseudocercospora sp. (CgP complex). Inoculation of harvested and unharvested fruits with C. gloeosporioides at approximately 240 d after fruit set caused an increase in diene and triene levels as measured by HPLC and HPLC-MS compared with controls. In both experiments, these levels reached a maximum during the first 2 d, and subsequently decreased during the 7 d monitoring period. However, there were some notable differences in fluxes of these compounds between experiments. In harvested fruits during the active period, diene levels {{were higher in the}} flesh than the peel, whereas triene levels were higher in the peel than the flesh and triene levels decreased to below those of controls in the later stages whereas diene levels did not. Similar patterns emerged for unharvested fruits but diene levels in unharvested fruits were relatively higher than in harvested fruits whereas triene levels were similar in harvested an unharvested fruits. By employing SEM ellipsoid spores characteristic of C. gloeosporioides were first observed on the harvested inoculated fruit surfaces at 2 d, followed by surface hyphae at 3 d. However, the infection process of C. gloeosporioides in unharvested fruits was delayed, relative to harvested fruits, probably due to high antifungal <b>diene</b> and triene <b>contents</b> of unharvested fruits. In contrast to SEM observations, ellipsoid spores of C. gloeosporioides were observed on the inoculated fruit surfaces at 7 d by using CLSM, and no surface hyphae were noted.

40|$|Postmortem aging {{has been}} {{extensively}} practiced in the meat industry for decades due to its beneficial impact on improving eating quality attributes. However, prolonged postmortem aging may adversely impact color and/or lipid oxidation stabilities of meat, leading to decreased display shelf-life and increased rancid off-flavor. As physical/biochemical changes occur during postmortem aging, metabolites that impart antioxidant or pro-oxidant activities are generated or consumed, which {{could be related to}} the oxidation stabilities of postmortem muscles with aging. However, the underlying mechanism of the aging-induced oxidation susceptibility has not been fully established. Therefore, the overall objective of this thesis was to understand the effect of postmortem aging on oxidation related metabolites in different bovine muscles. ^ The first chapter of this thesis is the literature review, and the second chapter focuses on determining the effect of postmortem aging on color and lipid oxidation stabilities in different bovine muscles. Three muscles, longissimus lumborum (LL), semimembranosus (SM), and psoas major (PM) were chosen (n= 7) for the study due to the distinct features in muscle fiber composition, oxidation stabilities, and metabolic properties of those muscles. At 1 -day postmortem, the three muscles were separated from 7 beef carcasses, divided into 3 sections, vacuum-packaged, and assigned to 9, 16, and 23 days of aging. After each aging time, steaks made from each sections were overwrap PVC-packaged and displayed for 7 days. Instrumental and sensory color characteristics were measured. Lipid oxidation by measuring TBARS and conjugated <b>dienes</b> (CD), myoglobin <b>content,</b> and non-heme iron contents were determined. Intensified discoloration and decreased redness of meat were observed with prolonged aging, where LL was the most color-stable followed by SM and PM (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Lipid oxidation increased with aging, and LL was more oxidative stable (lower TBARS and CD) compared to SM and PM. Lower myoglobin and non-heme iron contents were observed in LL compared to SM and PM (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). A significant increase in non-heme iron contents during aging was found. The results of the current study indicate that color and lipid oxidation stability could be negatively associated with aging, and different muscles have different susceptibilities to oxidation. This observation suggests that developing a post-harvest aging strategy to track optimal aging times for different muscles would be beneficial for the meat industry to minimize the oxidation-related quality defects while maintaining consistent eating attributes. ^ The third chapter of this thesis was a study to identify key metabolites that could be associated with oxidation stabilities of aged bovine muscles using metabolomics approach. Selected raw samples (n= 4; at day 0 of display of each aging) from the previous study (Chapter 2) were analyzed using the HPLC-ESI-MS metabolomics. The metabolomics data were analyzed using PCA and split-plot ANOVA. Spearman correlations between metabolites and oxidation related quality attributes were conducted using R software. The metabolomics platform detected 1012 compounds, among which 243 were significantly responsive to either aging or muscle treatments. Most distinct metabolites being identified were carnitines, free amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins /coenzymes, and glucuronides. NAD showed a positive correlation to the redness of meat color (r = 0. 672) and negative correlations to discoloration (r = - 0. 535), TBARS (r = - 0. 554), and non-heme iron (r = - 0. 667), indicating its relevance to myoglobin redox form stability and/or lipid oxidation stability. A group of carnitines that decreased with aging was associated with decreased redness (r = - 0. 67) and intensified discoloration (r = 0. 70), which may be explained by their roles in the mitochondria matrix and/or their potential antioxidant properties. Glucuronides increased with extended aging and associated with discoloration (r = 0. 56) and non-heme iron accumulation (r = 0. 65). Some nucleotides, nucleosides and free amino acids were more liberated with aging and positively correlated to chemical/phenotypic oxidation indicators. ^ The results from the current study suggest that some metabolites could be associated with oxidation stabilities of beef muscles. In particular, our study confirmed the relevance of the NAD/NADH system in myoglobin redox stability. Further, we identified potential compounds, such as carnitines and glucuronides, which could be related to color/lipid oxidation stabilities of aged beef muscles. The identified key metabolites should be further investigated to reveal the chemical basis of oxidation stabilities of beef muscle and could be validated into biomarkers for industry to track the quality development of beef during aging. ...|$|R
