25|$|STV {{has some}} {{history in the}} United States. Many cities, {{including}} New York City, once used it {{to break up the}} Democratic Party monopolies on elective office. Cincinnati, Ohio, adopted STV in 1925 to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Republican Party monopoly, but the Republicans returned the city to FPTP in 1957. From 1870 to 1980, Illinois used a semi-proportional cumulative voting system to elect its House of Representatives. Each district across the state elected both Republicans and Democrats year-after-year. Cambridge, Massachusetts, (STV) and Peoria, Illinois, (cumulative voting) continue to use PR. San Francisco had citywide elections in which people would cast votes for five or six candidates simultaneously, delivering some of the benefits of proportional representation.|$|E
25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located in out of the way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so they can help eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one does have to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nest, it is recommended that the job is done by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after dark when the wasps are most docile.|$|E

Orlov, accompanied by Gustav Orreus and four regiments of troops, arrived in Moscow on September 26, immediately calling an emergency council with local doctors. They confirmed presence of both bubonic and septicemic forms of plague. Orlov established and supervised an executive medical commission charged with developing the ways to check the epidemic. More important, he succeeded in changing public opinion in favor of the state's emergency measures, at the same improving the efficiency and quality of medical quarantine (in particular, varying quarantine duration for different groups of exposed but yet healthy people, and paying them for the quarantine stay).|$|E
25|$|Route26 {{along with}} State Highway Route25 soon became high-use routes to get drivers from Philadelphia to New York via New Brunswick as the large {{high-speed}} roadway. In the 1927 renumbering, a connection from Route26 to Route25 was also assigned, bypassing {{to the south}} of New Brunswick. This route was designated as State Highway RouteS-26, a route completely concurrent with U.S. Route 1. In 1931, the State Highway Department contracted plans for a new bridge over the Delaware and Raritan Canal near Barker's Basin. Although Route26 was considered the longest straight section of highway in the state, the new freeway would <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dangerous S-curve along the highway. On January 30, 1932, the State Highway Department opened the newly constructed Calhoun Street Extension to traffic. This new freeway, designated as part of Route26, was constructed as a bypass of the business districts in Trenton and Morrisville, Pennsylvania with a new traffic circle from the Route26 mainline (now the Brunswick Circle). Calhoun Street was realigned in the process to help make traffic flow.|$|E

500|$|Gunsmoke was {{originally}} a half-hour program filmed in black-and-white. The series expanded {{to an hour}} in length with season seven and began filming in color in season twelve. During its run 635 episodes were broadcast, of which 233 were 30 minutes in length and 402 were 60 minutes in length. [...] Of the hour-long episodes 176 were in black-and-white and 226 in color. During season two, Gunsmoke {{became one of the}} ten most popular programs on American television and moved to number one in the third season. It remained at number one until 1961 and stayed in the top twenty until 1964. The series returned to prominence in 1967 following a shift in its programming time from Saturday to Monday night. [...] From there Gunsmoke remained in the top twenty for the next seven years, dropping out only in its final season. [...] In May 1975 CBS canceled the series. [...] Alan Wagner, the network's vice president at the time, said, [...] "It's better to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> program one year too soon than one year too late." [...] Between 1987 and 1994 five television movies based on the series were aired by CBS.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{laboratory}} on 2 October 1925, Baird successfully transmitted the first television picture with a greyscale image: {{the head of}} a ventriloquist's dummy nicknamed [...] "Stooky Bill" [...] in a 30-line vertically scanned image, at five pictures per second. Baird went downstairs and fetched an office worker, 20-year-old William Edward Taynton, to see what a human face would look like, and Taynton became the first person to be televised in a full tonal range. Looking for publicity, Baird visited the Daily Express newspaper to promote his invention. The news editor was terrified and he was quoted by one of his staff as saying: [...] "For God's sake, go down to reception and <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lunatic who's down there.

These included ammunition, motor oil, gasoline, aviation gasoline and other materials to help in a potential civil war in US Navy tankers sailing from Aruba. About 110 tons of ammunition and CS gas were made ready in New Jersey for a potential airlift to Viracopos Airport in Campinas.

They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of [...] "Black Jesus", and that he gives his followers [...] "the strength to kill whites". In a flashy stage performance in his [...] "church", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression—represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for [...] "donations". Rabbit and his friends quickly realize Savior's [...] "revolution" [...] is merely a money making scam. Rabbit openly steals {{a large portion of the}} donation money, prompting Savior to try to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. Rabbit lays out his plan to keep all organized crime money in Harlem.

[...] Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was [...] "shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse trying to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> troublesome fly." [...] Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. [...] "High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!" [...] Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, [...] "In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!" [...] Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] "And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!" [...] "You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley – shocked to his toes!" [...] "They are going wild at Dodger Stadium – no one wants to leave!" [...] As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective. [...] "Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back." ...|$|E
