This study aimed to identify possible socio-behavioral correlates of ECC focusing 6 – 36 [*]months old children and their caretakers. Methods Cross sectional studies were conducted in a high fluoride rural area, Manyara, Tanzania and a low fluoride urban area, Kampala, Uganda. Totals of 1221 and 816 child - caretaker pairs attending health care <b>facilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>growth</b> monitoring were recruited in Manyara and Kampala, respectively. All caretakers completed face to face interviews at the health care facility. Children underwent oral clinical examination whereby ECC and Enamel hypoplasia were recorded using the dmft (WHO 1997) and the DDE index (FDI 1992). Results The prevalence of ECC was 3. 7 % in Manyara and 17. 6 % in Kampala. According to multiple logistic regression analyses, received oral health information from health worker was the strongest determinant of ECC in Manyara, adjusted OR 0. 3, 95 % CI 0. 09 – 0. 93.

Objective To examine the profile of day care centers in correla- tion with growth and development of toddlers, and to understand the characteristics of <b>facilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>growth</b> and development in tod- dlers at day care centers. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted at the day care centers (DCC) of the Department of Social Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia Harapan Ibu (HI) in Salemba, Central Jakarta and Teratai in Bekasi from February 1 -August 1, 2004. Results There were 106 children enrolled in this study; 47 chil- dren in DCC HI and 59 in DCC Teratai, male:female ratio was 1 : 1, mostly at age 3. 1 - 5 years. Growth status was measured accord- ing to body weight/age, body height/age, height circumference/ age and found good, normal, and proper growth status in 85 chil- dren (80. 2 %), 48 children (45. 3 %), 102 children (96. 2 %), respec- tively. We found good nutritional status in 44 children (41. 5 %) and normal developmental status (Denver II) in 81 children (76. 4 %). Ratio of caregivers to child was 1 : 10. All children had complete immunization. No trauma or upper respiratory tract infection was recorded as frequent morbidity.

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{development}} impact fees (DIFs) to finance public facilities necessary to accommodate new growth {{is a concept}} that has gained acceptance in recent years. California and Florida are {{considered by many to be}} the leading areas for the development of theory, practical models, and legislation for determining growth-related costs and calculating impact- fees for new construction. Two methods of calculation of impact fees are discussed: inductive and deductive. A total of 22 potential impact fees <b>for</b> public <b>facilities</b> have been identified, including the conventional water, sewer, and street impact fees. Other potential impact fees include public safety facilities (police and fire), library, public art, and day-care facilities. The consequences of not using impact fees to offset the cost of providing adequate public <b>facilities</b> <b>for</b> new <b>growth</b> are far-reaching.

CGF operated for 286 hours and processed seven samples, three more than scheduled, including two gallium arsenide semiconductor crystals. Gallium arsenide crystals are used in high-speed digital integrated circuits, optoelectronic integrated circuits, and solid state lasers.

Currently, existing entrepreneurial programs start with self-identified entrepreneurs and provide <b>facilities</b> <b>for</b> their <b>growth.</b> However, these programs fail to tap into a whole community of latent youth entrepreneurs. Can more of such youth, with no prior exposure to entrepreneurship, be catalyzed into starting new ventures? If so, how? These questions are addressed in this study with a particular focus on engineering student communities in small town India. By conducting experiments we test {{the hypothesis that the}} entrepreneurial attitude of students can be changed through a specially designed learning workshop on innovation, fabrication and entrepreneurship. The subject of this research is the design of the curriculum for this workshop, and the analysis {{of the effects of the}} workshop on two experimental student communities. The students were selected without any requirements on academic performance or entrepreneurial experience and aptitude. The results of the experiments show, overwhelmingly, that a significant change in entrepreneurial thinking can be achieved and indicate clearly that innovators and entrepreneurs can be created from ordinary student populations with the right kind of teaching. This can have huge implications for building entrepreneurship ecosystems in different parts of the world, giving average individuals the opportunity to be entrepreneurs. by Rajesh Muraleedharan Nair.

The FSIS has proposed that by following these guidelines, allowable growth of Clostridium perfringens {{is limited to}} a 1 -log 10 multiplication during cooling after cooking of ready-to-eat meat products. Numerous small meat processors have difficulties complying with these performance standards. Several attempts, mainly focused on microbiological aspects, have been made to develop predictive models <b>for</b> <b>growth</b> of C. perfringens within the range of cooling temperatures of the guidelines. Conversely, studies dealing with heat transfer models to predict cooling rates in meat products, do not address microbial growth.
