5|$|Since all {{meetings}} had to end by nightfall, {{a senator}} could talk {{a proposal to}} death (a filibuster) if he could keep the debate <b>going</b> <b>until</b> nightfall. Any proposed motion could be vetoed by a tribune, {{and if it was}} not vetoed, it was then turned into a final senatus consultum. Each senatus consultum was transcribed into a document by the presiding magistrate, and then deposited into the aerarium.|$|E
5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate <b>going</b> <b>until</b> nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
5|$|In reality, he had {{continued}} as Scientific Adviser to the Armed Forces, moving {{to help out}} at Singapore General Hospital when Raffles College {{was on the front}} line. At the hospital, he kept the X-ray machines <b>going</b> <b>until</b> Singapore fell a few days later. He was then interned in Changi, then Sime Road camps, along with the senior medical staff of the hospital. In September 1945 he was reunited with his family in New Zealand for six months compulsory sick leave, returning to Singapore in March 1946 to restart both Physics and Chemistry Departments at Raffles College. Both departments had been looted and the Professor of Chemistry and his senior lecturer were both dead. Dr. Elizabeth Alexander wound up her work in Wellington and took her children to England, leaving them with her sister as guardian. She rejoined Norman Alexander briefly in England to buy equipment for the College, before they returned to Singapore together. She then took up the post of Government Geologist, restarted her work on tropical weathering and acted as registrar for the conversion of Raffles College to the University of Malaya.|$|E

The mission had acquired a printing press and the Joneses began publishing a monthly newspaper called the Cherokee Messenger. The paper was printed partly in Cherokee and partly in English.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 he {{published}} a book Physical Culture and Self-Defense (Philadelphia: D. Biddle). In 1902, he and Jeffries had a rematch, once again with the World Heavyweight Champion at stake. Fitzsimmons battered Jeffries, who suffered horrible punishment.

25|$|Mariehamn was {{the base}} for the last large oceanic {{commercial}} sailing ships in the world. Their final tasks were bringing Australian wheat to Great Britain, on which Åland shipowner Gustaf Erikson kept <b>going</b> <b>until</b> after WW2, 1947 being his last year. The ships latterly made only one round-trip from South Australia to Britain per year, (the grain race), after each marathon voyage going back to Mariehamn to lay up for a few months. The ship Pommern, now a museum in Mariehamn, {{was one of these}} last vessels.|$|E
25|$|Southport grew {{quickly in}} the 19th century as it gained a {{reputation}} for being a more refined seaside resort than its neighbour-up-the-coast Blackpool. In fact Southport had a head start compared to all the other places on the Lancashire coast because it had easy access to the canal system. Other seaside bathing areas couldn't really get <b>going</b> <b>until</b> the railways were built some years later. The Leeds and Liverpool canal brought people from Liverpool, Manchester, Bolton and Wigan amongst others. By 1820 Southport had over 20,000 visitors per year.|$|E
25|$|The i3 {{performance}} in range-extending mode {{may be more}} limited than when it is running on battery power, as BMW clarified the range extender is designed not for long-distance travel but purely as an emergency backup to keep the electric system <b>going</b> <b>until</b> the next recharging location. According to BMW, {{at the beginning of}} the i3 release, the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected, more than 60%. Over time it has decreased significantly, with some people almost never using it, and by 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5% of i3s.|$|E

25|$|The Flight cost £10,380 {{and offered}} {{electric}} front windows, a three-speed fan and a cassette player. For an additional £1,000 the Finesse added alloy wheels, air conditioning, a CD player, fog lamps and metallic paint. The more competitive prices {{managed to keep}} European Escort sales <b>going</b> <b>until</b> the last one rolled off the Halewood assembly line in July 2000, making it the last Ford car to be assembled there. The plant was transferred to Jaguar that year for the new X-Type saloon, and following the later merger with Land Rover and {{the sale of the}} plant to Tata, Ford now only has a small presence at Halewood - retaining the transmission works at the site.|$|E
25|$|In 1942 {{there was}} some initial {{speculation}} among the scientists developing the first nuclear weapons {{that there might be}} a possibility of igniting the Earth's atmosphere with a large enough nuclear explosion. This would concern a nuclear reaction of two nitrogen atoms forming a carbon and an oxygen atom, with release of energy. This energy would heat up the remaining nitrogen enough to keep the reaction <b>going</b> <b>until</b> all nitrogen atoms were consumed. Hans Bethe was assigned the task of studying whether there was a possibility in the very early days, and concluded there was no possibility due to inverse Compton effect cooling of the fireball. Richard Hamming, a mathematician, was asked to make a similar calculation just before Trinity, with the same result. Nevertheless, the notion has persisted as a rumor for many years, and was the source of black humor at the Trinity test.|$|E
25|$|The main Axis use {{the airport}} was {{to serve as}} a forward {{mechanical}} center for Norway. The decision was largely based on existence of the aircraft factory. A new hall was built, which along with upgrades to the existing gave four halls. In addition a paint shop and large warehouse were built. New workshops had to be built for instruments, radio and electrical equipment. From the summer of 1940 the factory became a division of Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke. It relied largely on the existing Norwegian workforce, but was forced to extensive retraining because of the advanced construction of the German aircraft. Junkers eventually withdrew and was replaced by Brinker Eisenwerk. The operation kept <b>going</b> <b>until</b> 1944. There was also established two separate motor repair shops, one operated by Daimler-Benz and one operated by Bayerische Motorenwerke (BMW). Both received new concrete halls. The work at the various companies was often met with passive resistance, such as through slow work, demands for work to be redone and occasionally sabotage.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1970s, Sydvaranger started {{planning}} using {{natural gas}} to produce pellets through direct reduction. Originally Karmøy was envisioned as a proper site, but it was eventually decided that {{there would not be}} built a pipeline there. Korf Stahl took contact with Sydvaranger and proposed a joint venture to establish a facility in Emden, Germany. They established Norddeutsche Ferrowerke (NFW) in 1976, which was owned 74.9 percent by Sydvaranger and 25.1 percent of Korf Stahl. Construction cost 400million Deutsche Mark (NOK1100million) and had an annual production of 1.2million tonnes. Financing was in part secured through state guarantees, loans from German banks and a DM45million loan from the European Coal and Steel Community. Natural gas was delivered from Norway via Norpipe. Construction started on 17 July 1978 and was taken into use {{in the second half of}} 1980. Rising natural gas prices and interest rates combined with sinking ore prices made the plant a financial disaster. The Norwegian government agreed in April 1981 to subsidize operations, which kept the plant <b>going</b> <b>until</b> July 1982, when it filed for bankruptcy. Sydvaranger had guaranteed for NOK45million of the loans; this and the bill for the natural gas was covered by the state.|$|E

According to the [...] "propagandist interpretation" [...] of Adams popularized by historian John Miller, Adams deliberately provoked the incident to promote his secret agenda of American independence. According to Pauline Maier, however, [...] "There is no evidence that he prompted the Boston Massacre riot".|$|E
