"First of all <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to the songs, because I {{thought that}} he painted great {{pictures}} in his lyrics, particularly for someone {{who had not been}} around the typical Music Row co-writes. I {{thought that he}} sang very well too. But more than anything {{there was a kind of}} this ‘I-will-do-it’ look in his eyes - I was really drawn in by the fact that he was so set on being successful in this business." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{studied the}} flute {{as a child}} at the university-preparatory school of the Peabody Institute. At the age of 15, he entered an {{accelerated}} college program at the University of Chicago where he studied mathematics and philosophy. In Chicago he discovered the serialism of Anton Webern and composed a twelve-tone string trio. In 1954 Glass traveled to Paris, where he encountered the films of Jean Cocteau, which made a lasting impression on him. He visited artists' studios and saw their work; [...] "the bohemian life you see in [...] Orphée was the life <b>I</b> ... <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to, and those were the people I hung out with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul was {{attracted}} to her {{for a number of}} reasons, he explained: [...] "I liked her as a woman, she was good-looking with a good figure, so physically <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to her." [...] But he also liked her sense of independence: [...] "Her mental attitude was quite rebellious... she was the kind of kid who would hang out in the kitchen with the black maids" [...] to learn cooking. She disliked [...] socializing. They both liked natural surroundings, he said, and they shared a love of nature, which became one of their most important emotional links. He knew that because of her [...] "very free spirit," [...] she was considered a rebel and a black sheep by her family for avoiding excelling in education, unlike her father and brother. [...] "She was an artist," [...] Paul said, [...] "and was not cut out to be an academic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Truffaut {{first began}} work on The Green Room in December 1970 after reading the works of Henry James. Truffaut {{especially}} liked [...] "The Altar of the Dead" [...] and asked his friend Aimée Alexandre to translate a new French version for him. Alexandre also recommended works by Anton Chekov and Leo Tolstoy with similar themes, while Truffaut did his own research on James's life and visited his home in Boston. Truffaut worked on other projects until 1974, when a new French version {{of the short story}} was published, renewing his interest. Truffaut commented on the film, [...] "the story was difficult to construct, but at the same time, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to the subject." [...] In July of that year he then reached a contract agreement with screenwriter Jean Gruault to begin drafting a film adaptation. [...] Truffaut and Gruault had previously collaborated on Jules and Jim (1962), The Wild Child (1970), and Two English Girls (1971).|$|E
2500|$|Following his Australian {{citizenship}} ceremony, Coetzee {{said that}} [...] "I did {{not so much}} leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia. I came because {{from the time of}} my first visit in 1991, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> by the free and generous spirit of the people, by the beauty of the land itself and– when I first saw Adelaide– by the grace of the city that I now have the honour of calling my home." [...] When he initially moved to Australia, he had cited the South African government's lax attitude to crime in that country as a reason for the move, leading to a spat with Thabo Mbeki, who, speaking of Coetzee's novel Disgrace stated that [...] "South Africa is not only a place of rape". In 1999, the African National Congress submission to an investigation into racism in the media by the South African Human Rights Commission named Disgrace as a novel exploiting racist stereotypes. However, when Coetzee won his Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him [...] "on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa".|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>attracted</b> to {{straight}} angles or to {{the straight}} line, hard and inflexible, created by man. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to free-flowing, sensual curves. The curves that I find {{in the mountains of}} my country, in the sinuousness of its rivers, in the waves of the ocean, and on the body of the beloved woman. Curves make up the entire Universe, the curved Universe of Einstein.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conversation}} roughly translates as:Lady: [...] "Kenneth, I like you, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to {{your two}} healthy kidneys."Kenneth: [...] "What?"(Man {{breaks down the}} door with gun drawn)Kenneth: [...] "I had no idea!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am.</b> Ingua and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> both {{children}} of nature. The only difference <b>is</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> older {{and have been}} taught diplomacy and self-control, which she still lacks. I mask my feelings, while Ingua frankly displays hers. That's why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to her." ...|$|R

60|$|The cameras got busy. Then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> by {{something}} flashing {{in the water}} nearer the boat than my fish. Suddenly a sailfish leaped, straightaway, over my line. Then two leaped at once, both directly over my line.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] he said, [...] "I am as yet in {{ignorance of}} your name. I am the Chevalier Philip Fletcher, an English gentleman {{fighting}} {{for the cause of}} the reformed religion, under Admiral Coligny. I am on my way east, with important despatches; and I was bivouacking with my three followers in the wood, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> by the singing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! my dear Mirabel, it is past {{even your}} skill. I thought I could never speak {{on these things}} to human being, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to you by the same sympathy which you flatter me by expressing for myself. I want a confidant, I need a friend; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> most wretched.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2013, Morrissey {{released}} a statement through his semi-official website, which said, [...] "Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not homosexual. In technical fact, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> humasexual. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to humans. But, of course ... not many." [...] Simpson noted that many questioned why Morrissey does not identify as bisexual, given his sexual experiences with both men and women.|$|R
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to ontological pluralism, the {{doctrine}} {{that some things}} exist {{in a different way}} than other things. 1 For the ontological pluralist, there is more to learn about an object’s existential status than merely whether it is or is not: there is still the question of how that entity exists. By contrast...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to this grove, however, by {{memorials}} {{of a more}} touching character. It {{had been}} one of the favorite haunts of the late Lord Byron. In his farewell visit to the Abbey, after he had parted with the possession of it, he passed some time in this grove, in company with his sister; and as a last memento, engraved their names on the bark of a tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] the Duchess said impressively, [...] "David Thain {{may have}} his peculiarities, {{but he is}} really a most simple and sincere person. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to him upon the steamer simply because of his shyness, and {{a good thing for}} you, dear, that I was. It must make quite a {{difference}} to have Broomleys properly let to a man who can pay a good rent for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He had no dissipations," [...] said Miss Raleigh. [...] "His {{character}} was unimpeachable. In very many ways <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to him, in very many ways I endeavored {{to make life}} pleasant for him; and I am afraid that sometimes I neglected Mrs. Easterfield's interests so that I might do little things for him, such as dusting, keeping his ink-pots full, providing fresh blotting-paper, and many other trifling services which devotion readily suggested." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Sunday Times in August 2007, she announced that she and Budgie had divorced. In {{an interview}} with The Independent, she said, [...] "I've never particularly said I'm hetero or I'm a lesbian. <b>I</b> know there <b>are</b> people who are definitely one way, but not really me. I suppose if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to men then they usually have more feminine qualities".|$|R
50|$|When I {{entered the}} Fontainhas area, there were colors and smells {{that made me}} {{remember}} the things and events of the past, and also ideas about people to which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted.</b> These ideas nestled close to each other, living together even as they led very solitary lives because of violent and painful separation. A form of interesting and incompatible relationships existed in this.|$|R
5000|$|Later that year, Miller was subpoenaed by the HUAC, and Monroe {{accompanied}} him. In {{her personal}} notes, {{she wrote about}} her worries during this period: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so concerned about protecting Arthur. I love him—and {{he is the only}} person—human being I have ever known that I could love not only as a man to which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to practically out of my senses—but he is the only person—as another human being that I trust as much as myself...|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{answered}} a little vaguely. He had some calls to make, {{and he was}} not altogether sure. I left him in a few minutes and descended to the street. I turned westward and walked for some little distance, when suddenly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> by the sight of a familiar figure issuing from the door of a large, gray stone house. We came face to face upon the pavement. It was the man whose life I had probably saved only a few hours ago.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} large, {{and had a}} fine old ceiling, and almost church-like windows of coloured-glass; but it was desolate, and {{in the shadow of}} a coming storm, looked strangely lowering. Within--opened a smaller room; there, however, the blind of the single {{casement}} was closed; through the deep gloom few details of furniture were apparent. These few I amused myself by puzzling to make out; and, in particular, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> by the outline of a picture on the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely certain," [...] Burton {{declared}} sadly. [...] "I {{found myself}} this evening trying to kiss my landlady's daughter, {{who is not}} in the least good-looking. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> by the programme of a music hall and had hard work to keep from going there. A man asked me the way to Leicester Square just now, and I almost directed him wrongly for the sheer pleasure of telling a lie. I nearly bought some ties at an outfitter's shop in the Strand--such ties! It's awful--awful, Mr. Waddington!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In her poems, Sheila Black {{writes in}} a confessional style, often {{referencing}} past conflicts {{that resulted from}} her diagnosis of XLH, such as in her poem What You Mourn. According to Sheila Black, “As a poet, a storyteller, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to the unruly and confrontational elements of the confessional, to the ways it complicates personal truth through a presentation that makes the audience continually question whether the speaker is to be trusted” ...|$|R
50|$|Her {{second husband}} was on 15 February 1534 in Dessau prince John V of Anhalt-Zerbst (1504-1551). Her {{marriage}} to John soon proved unhappy. Margaret fled {{from her husband}} to her wittum, Roßlau Castle. Martin Luther tried to mediate between John and Margaret. He visited her at Roßlau Castle and blamed her for leaving her husband cheekily. This started a fierce war or words. Luther later reported: I must have told her clearly enough, until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracting</b> her wrath.|$|R
40|$|The hurried {{aspects of}} daily living exhaust me. Speed is the {{operative}} word. Apparently everyone wants more of it. Not me. While I value the innovations that speed up my onerous tasks, in my artwork <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to its opposite [...] repose. I try to slow the pace of life around me, capturing those moments of stillness. This thesis examines a body of work, eight paintings and four drawings, that reflect this aversion to speed...|$|R
60|$|When {{we arrived}} at the Palazzo Orsi, many of the guests had already come. Matteo was {{immediately}} surrounded by his friends; and a score of ladies beckoned to him from different parts of the room, so that he was torn away from me, leaving me rather disconsolate alone in the crowd. Presently <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to a group of men talking to a woman whom I could not see; Matteo had joined them, and they were laughing at something he had said. I had turned away to look at other people when I heard Matteo calling me.|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} circumstance, too, which {{interested}} me much. During the two wakeful nights in question, {{and immediately after}} the disappearance of Mrs. Wyatt into the extra state-room, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> by certain singular cautious, subdued noises in that of her husband. After listening to them for some time, with thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly in translating their import. They were sounds occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box, {{by means of a}} chisel and mallet--the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped.|$|E
60|$|After observing these lively {{indications}} for awhile, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to a neighbouring grove by {{a prodigious}} squeaking which I heard there. On reaching the spot I found it proceeded {{from a large}} hog which a number of natives were forcibly holding to the earth, while a muscular fellow, armed with a bludgeon, was ineffectually aiming murderous blows at the skull of the unfortunate porker. Again and again he missed his writhing and struggling victim, but though puffing and panting with his exertions, he still continued them; and after striking {{a sufficient number of}} blows to have demolished an entire drove of oxen, with one crashing stroke he laid him dead at his feet.|$|E
5000|$|While at Yeshivat Har Etzion, he <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to {{a fellow}} student and {{concluded}} that he was bisexual. He went to consult with rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv, a respected old rabbi in Jerusalem, telling him: [...] "Master, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> to both men and women. What shall I do?" [...] And the rabbi replied according to Greenberg: [...] "My dear one, my friend, then you have twice the power of love. Use it carefully." [...] Greenberg remembers that he left with the trust that it would all work out. However, he realised that the rabbi wasn't permitting him {{to have sex with}} men, but was telling him that his desire was not ugly in and of itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since you {{force me}} to <b>be</b> candid, <b>I</b> believe she <b>is</b> <b>attracted</b> by another man; perhaps I ought to say {{interested}} in him. I cannot suspect any attachment yet; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{followers}} here will, no doubt, discover in a {{very short}} time that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an Englishman.
