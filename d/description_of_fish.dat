40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a fish-based product. Through the innovative sensorial check all that apply (CATA) technique, employed in two stages of the development of the product – market research and the sensorial and hedonistic characterization of the final product – the aim was to develop a fish by-product that could respond to the needs of the consumer market. Results showed that the CATA technique is an important instrument for researching the consumer market and indicated the kind of fish by-product to be developed and its desired features. Nugget was the resulting by-product. The second application of CATA made possible the sensorial description of the by-product as being crisp, with little fish odor, light in color, well-seasoned and tasty. Therefore, the CATA technique proved to be an important research instrument in the fish consumption market as well as a quick technique for the complete <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> nuggets...|$|E

40|$|Taim Hydrological System is {{a unique}} {{subtropical}} wetland in southern Brazil harboring an exceptional biological diversity. In 1978, an ecological reserve was established to protect part of this area from increasing anthropogenic impacts in its surroundings. Fishes have been poorly investigated in this system. Based on a multi-gear sampling study encompassing several years (2001 - 2005), and on comparisons with previous fish inventories, we provide an up-to-date species list of fishes occurring in the Taim Wetland. In addition, we made the first preliminary <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> dominance patterns found in the main lakes of the system (Flores, Nicola, Jacaré and Mangueira). Checklist comparison resulted in 62 fish species distributed in 24 families, with Characidae (19 species) and Cichlidae (7) showing the highest species richness. Six species are cited {{for the first time}} in the reserve: Trachelyopterus lucenai (Auchenipteridae), Hoplosternum littorale (Callichthyidae), Rineloricaria cadeae (Loricariidae), Eigenmannia trilineata (Sternopygidae), Odontesthes mirinensis and O. perugiae (Atherinopsidae). Apparently, the black catfish T. lucenai invaded the system in the last decade and became one of the dominant species in the pelagic waters.

40|$|Indicators {{of growth}} and {{condition}} were {{used to compare the}} habitat quality of nurseries of juvenile sole (Solea solea L.) in the Bay of Biscay, based on one survey in 2000. The four biological indicators are poorly correlated with each other, suggesting that no single measure may give an adequate <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> health and of its habitat’s quality. Growth indicators showed significant differences between northern and southern areas. Juveniles from the two southernmost nurseries, the Gironde estuary and the Pertuis Antioche, displayed significant lower otolith increment widths and mean sizes. These differences were inversely related to water temperature and unrelated to genetic or age differences, and are unlikely to be due to limiting trophic conditions in the nurseries. Hence, they may be considered in terms of differences in habitat quality and potential anthropogenic impacts. Condition indices do not show this north-south pattern but highlight low condition values in the Pertuis Antioche. Short-term and fluctuating biochemical indicators such as RNA/DNA ratios appeared to be unreliable over a long-term study, while morphometric indices seemed to be relevant, complementary indicators as they integrate the whole juvenile life-history of sole in the nurseries. The growth and condition indices of juveniles in September 2000 from nursery grounds exposed to the Erika oil spill in December 1999 were relatively high.

40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceEuropean Union legislation, {{through the}} Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 / EC), {{as well as}} national legislation, such as the 'Grenelle Environnement' (2007) in France, requires restoration of ecological connectivity in streams to improve free circulation of migratory fish. Different methods (e. g. capture by trap or net, teleme-try, hydroacoustics) are {{used to evaluate the}} efficiency of fish passes to estimate the migratory species abundance and analyse changes in their within-river distri-butions. Among these methods, hydroacoustics is non-intrusive, allowing long-term observation and <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> populations based on physical properties of sound in water. However, the main limit to hydroacoustic tools is their difficulty in identifying species. Initially designed for military purposes, dual-frequency identifi-cation sonar (DIDSON) has been used in environmental management for a decade. This acoustic camera uses higher frequencies and more sub-beams than common hydroacoustic tools, which improves image resolution and then enables observation of fish morphology and swimming behaviour. The ability to subtract static echoes from echograms and directly measure fish length improve the species-identification process. However, some limits have been identified, such as automatic dataset recording and the low range of the detection beam, which decreases accuracy, but efficient tools are now being developed to improve the accuracy of data recording (morphology, species identification, direction and speed). The new technological properties of acoustic cameras, such as the video-like visualization of the data, have greatly improved monitoring of diadromous fish populations (abundance, distribu-tion and behaviour), helping river and fisheries managers and researchers in mak-ing decisions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} {{a method to}} extract patterns of local fish movement from acoustic tagging data in small scale surveys covering distances {{in the order of}} tens of kms. The purpose of our analysis is two-fold: first, to provide a general insight into fish movement which allows us to approximately evaluate the efficiency of current local protected areas; second, to provide a statistical <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> movement as input to ecological numerical models which can be used to evaluate alternative design for sanctuary zones. We analysed 3 months of data from 41 Spangled Emperors (Lethrinus nebulosus) in the Ningaloo Marine Park, in Western Australia. The data was collected via 38 acoustic receivers spread over an area of approx 180 km 2 covering roughly 5 different habitats typical of shallow water, reef environments. The frequency of fish detection from the acoustic receivers has a strong seasonal and daily pattern with detections decreasing at day-time and from December to February. Our initial analysis suggests {{that this is not the}} result of biological factors, rather of environmental factors (mostly waves due to sea breeze) and that the pattern of fish movement is mostly uniform during the sampled period. Using wind data from a nearby station we devised an approximate rule relating the effective variability in the receivers ’ detection range with wind speed, which in turns is transformed into uncertainty on the fish position as a function of time. This has been further processed to generate a) the statistics of fish transitioning fro...|$|E
40|$|An {{historical}} {{account is}} given {{of the development}} of the Lake Albert fisheries since Worthington's survey in 1928. It is noted that the development of the fisheries was related to, and dependent upon, improvements in the type of gear and canoes, an incFease in the number of canoes and outboard engines in use, improved marketing facilities and better road communications. Summarized data, collected mainly since 1954, has been analysed and tabulated to show annual exports to the Congo, total annual catches 'and annual catches of individual species. A change in the relative abundance of the various species in the annual catches is described. It is noted that this change was caused by a change-over from large to small mesh size gill-nets, and that it was associated with an increased demand within Uganda for the smaller species of fish, such as Aleste's baremose and Hydrocynus forskahlii. A brief <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> processing and marketing in the Lake Albert region is given, which emphasizes the suitability of salt-cured fish to the social and physical environment of the area. Finally, a summary of a recent survey of the potential fish resources of the lake is given in the discussion, and estimates of the 1965 catch at the north and south ends of the lake are compared with the findings of the survey. This showed that there is little danger of overfishing the Alestes baremose stocks of the Wanseko area at the 1965 rate of exploitation of the species, and that the total catch for 1965 {{at the south end of}} the lake was well below the estimated annual sustainable yield from the area...|$|E
40|$|According {{to global}} climate change models, e,g. that from the Columbia University Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), Minnesota's mean air {{temperature}} will increase by an annual average of approximately 4. 0 'C if atmospheric C 02 doubles. This {{is likely to have}} many environmental consequences, including changes in lake water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations which in turn are likely to affect fish populations. This interaction between climate parameters, lake water quality parameters and fish populations has been investigated through model simulations of Minnesota lakes. Previous results of this study were summarized in September 1991 (Stefan et al., 1991, 1992). Specifically the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> habitat is extended herein to include lake benthic area, in addition to lake volume used in the previous report. The findings are as follows: After the projected climate change, good growth habitat bottom area (GGHA) and good growth habitat volume (GGHV) will be reduced for coldwater fish. In contrast, GGHA and GGRV will be increased for coolwater and warmwater fish. Coldwater, coolwater and warmwater fish habitat will change approximately by the same percentage in terms of GGHA or GGHV. The reduction in good growth habitat area or volume for coldwater fishes will be about twice as high for southern Minnesota as it will be for northern Minnesota lakes. The increases for cool water and wa. rmwater fishes will be three times greater for northern Minnesota lakes than for southern Minnesota lakes.

40|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, {{empirical}} {{evidence shows that}} a number of marine littoral fish species tend to remain in a small geographic area. Despite the growing awareness about the consequences of reduced mobility (e. g. design of marine protected areas), an accurate <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> movement is technically difficult; thus, it is usually not considered. Mark-release-(single) -recapture (MRsR) data obtained from externally tagged fish that are returned by fishermen or recreational fishers are potentially useful for describing fish movement. The present study is a methodological contribution aimed at demonstrating a simple analytic strategy for estimating the size of the circular home range (i. e. the area where a fish spends most of the time) from MRsR data. This analytic strategy is not adequate for pelagic or large predators moving at the oceanic scale but could be suitable for some reef or littoral fish. The estimates obtained by this method are robust even if (1) the number of recaptured fish is small, (2) fishing effort or habitat suitability displays some spatial variability and (3) fish display some intra-specific variability. Based on only 32 recaptures, our data demonstrate that Coris julis (a small labrid targeted by recreational fishers) is more sedentary than previously assumed; this fish spends 95 % of its time within an area 227 m in radius (Bayesian 95 % credibility interval: 192 to 275 m). © Inter-Research 2011.

40|$|Sound {{production}} {{is a widespread}} phenomenon in fishes; however, the importance of acoustic signals and their potential to influence reproduction has not been determined. This dissertation examines fish acoustic courtship signals to investigate whether sound has a role in reproductive success. The pre-spawning sounds of several fishes were recorded and analyzed. The male advertisement call of two species of Belizean toadfish, Sanopus astrifer and Batrachoides gilberti, were found to significantly differ. These data, coupled with data in the literature suggest an influence of habitat characteristics on the calling behavior of toadfishes. Additionally, acoustic playback experiments were employed to investigate the role of male courtship sounds in the Malawi cichlid species, Tramitichromis intermedius. Playback results indicated that male sounds may initiate egg-laying behavior in females, but may not be behaviorally relevant to conspecific males. A discussion of confounding factors in aquarium playback experiments is presented. Technical aspects of fish sound recording, playback, and analysis were also examined to provide information for future fish bioacoustics studies. It was determined that digital cameras are a useful method of recording fish sounds to describe metric characteristics; however, temporal parameters are more accurately captured by hydrophones, which are optimal for use in scientific <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> sounds. Underwater speakers commonly used in fish playback experiments were tested for fidelity when producing a low-frequency pulsed fish sound. The Electro-Voice UW 30 speaker was found to perform the best playback at low sound pressure levels (120 dB re 1 μPa) and at greater distances than the UW 30. Many fish sounds have been described in the literature; however, there is no standardization of sample size used in species descriptions. A method is presented {{that can be used}} to estimate the level of inclusiveness of sound variability in sound descriptions, and to approximate sufficient sample sizes of recordings. The courtship calls of Dascyllus albisella and Batrachoides gilberti were examined to illustrate this method and to provide a benchmark for future sound descriptions...|$|E
40|$|In {{considering}} {{the use of}} estuarine habitats by fish assemblages, alternative views of the assemblage are increasingly being explored, based on functional rather than taxonomic aspects. The allocation of all taxa {{to a number of}} functional guilds allows a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> assemblages in terms of vertical zonation, habitat preferences, including the substratum preference of benthic/demersal species, and dietary preferences. This paper presents the first comparison {{of the structure of the}} fish assemblages in the tidal marshes of 6 European estuaries (Bay of Cadiz, Spain; Mira, Portugal; Loire, France; Westerschelde, The Netherlands; Humber, UK; Forth, UK). Cluster analysis was used to compare the assemblages recorded in 29 tidal marsh and associated estuary reference sites. Distinct differences between estuaries were apparent in comparing the taxonomic structure (species, family) of the assemblages, indicating a division between assemblages of northern and southern Atlantic European tidal marshes. The use of ecological guilds successfully separated marsh assemblages dominated by freshwater adventitious/diadromous taxa (Loire) from those dominated by marine juvenile taxa (Mira, Forth). Comparisons of vertical distribution guilds indicated a major division between pelagic-dominated (Forth, upper Loire) and benthic-dominated (Cadiz, Westerschelde, Mira, Loire) assemblages. This division was also partly reflected by the dietary preference guilds, with a strong separation between assemblages dominated by planktivores (Forth) and those in which most taxa are either invertebrate feeders (Humber, Cadiz, Westerschelde) or invertebrate/fish feeders (most Mira sites, lower Loire). The very low representation of a primarily piscivorous guild in all sites (in contrast to the fish assemblages of the main estuaries) supports the view that European tidal marshes contain fish assemblages with high proportions of juvenile individuals and may provide significant refugia for life stages vulnerable to predation. Although the comparability of datasets is limited by differences in sampling regimes and methodologies, the use of functional guilds, reflecting different aspects of the use of the marshes, reveals that functional similarities exist between the fish assemblages of European tidal marshes, despite considerable taxonomic, physical and chemical differences between the sites. Further modifications to the use of functional guilds are discussed, and recommendations made to refine their value for studying fish assemblages in tidal marsh environments...|$|E
