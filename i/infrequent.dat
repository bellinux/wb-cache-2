5|$|The heavy {{rationalisation}} {{process in}} British Railways in the 1960s, {{often referred to}} as the Beeching Axe, resulted in a re-assessment of those lines, at a time when efficient bus services were abstracting passengers from often <b>infrequent</b> and inconvenient train services.|$|E
5|$|Although each race {{is unique}} in its composition, no race has an innate {{advantage}} over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths, powers, and abilities their overall strength is the same. The balance stays complete via <b>infrequent</b> patches (game updates) provided by Blizzard.|$|E
5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} of {{horizontal}} gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and <b>infrequent</b> gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second concern is to what extent such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E
5|$|Bonsecours is a commune on {{a plateau}} to the {{southwest}} of Rouen. Until 1890 only an <b>infrequent</b> bus service linked it to Rouen. However, it attracted many hikers, with its splendid panoramas over the meandering Seine, and pilgrims visiting the shrine to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war, her encounters with the enemy were <b>infrequent.</b> In fact, her next submarine contact did not occur until 17December and, like those before, resulted in no definite damage to the enemy. Although the opening months of 1918 brought no new U-boat contacts, Wadsworth worked hard escorting convoys and patrolling British waters.|$|E
5|$|Impossible {{to ignore}} was Day's {{disparity}} to his rival, Paige. Historians {{have noted that}} Paige had a boisterous approach compared to Day's reserved demeanor; Paige was tall and Day was short and slender; and Paige worked hard to promote his name while Day shied away from attention. The pitchers' <b>infrequent</b> head-to-head matchups led to remarkable pitching duels, three of which Day won.|$|E
5|$|It does so by {{preventing}} {{the formation of}} the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly <b>infrequent</b> or nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that Type Ia supernovae that were considered the same are in fact different; moreover, a form of the Type Ia supernova that is relatively <b>infrequent</b> today was far more common earlier {{in the history of}} the universe. This could have far reaching cosmological significance and could lead to revision of estimation of the rate of expansion of the universe and the prevalence of dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{struggled}} {{to settle in}} Paris, however, {{and by the end}} of the year he had only started in one of his nine league appearances for the club. His lack of form and <b>infrequent</b> game time, which totaled 358 minutes, prompted manager Unai Emery to suggest that he would be leaving the club during the January transfer window in order to rediscover his form.|$|E
5|$|The Peak District {{is formed}} almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Carboniferous period. They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone, the overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins of the area and <b>infrequent</b> outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates.|$|E
5|$|As Jolie {{preferred}} to dedicate {{herself to her}} humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained <b>infrequent.</b> First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed {{for the use of}} an exclusively Khmer cast and script. Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if fires are too <b>infrequent,</b> populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around {{six years to}} reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} via infected blood products and through organ donation. In countries such as Singapore, where dengue is endemic, the risk {{is estimated to be}} between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 transfusions. Vertical transmission (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively <b>infrequent,</b> despite dengue emerging in new regions in recent decades.|$|E
5|$|Following No Reservations, Zeta-Jones {{significantly}} decreased her workload in {{the next}} five years. She instead chose to focus on her family and health, having been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, and her <b>infrequent</b> acting appearances were in smaller-scale and less successful productions. She took on the role of a 40-year-old mother attracted to a younger man (Justin Bartha) in the romantic comedy The Rebound. The production was released theatrically in markets outside of the United States in 2009–10, but due to financial troubles of its distributor, The Film Development, the film failed to release theatrically in America.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th century on, the {{crossbow}} (called , tzangra in Greek) {{became increasingly}} important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made <b>infrequent</b> use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the land walls of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no indication that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.|$|E
5|$|Groups often {{form when}} {{individuals}} converge on a food source, whereupon {{a feeding frenzy}} may occur. This seems to be triggered not by blood in the water or by bloodlust, but by the species' highly strung and goal-directed nature (conserving energy between <b>infrequent</b> feeding opportunities {{when it is not}} slowly plying the open ocean). The oceanic whitetip is a competitive, opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand, rather than avoiding trouble in favour of a possibly easier future meal.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} <b>infrequent)</b> part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, local councillors from Kent and Pas-de-Calais {{announced}} {{they were in}} talks to establish a frequent local rail service between the regional stations along the route. Trains would leave Lille and stop at Calais, Ashford and Stratford before reaching London St Pancras. Currently, Ashford and Calais have an <b>infrequent</b> service and Eurostar trains do not call at Stratford. The initiative is part of Calais' branding {{as part of the}} UK in order to benefit from the 2012 London Olympics but is supported {{on both sides of the}} channel to bring in more commuters.|$|E
5|$|In the North Atlantic, feeding areas {{range from}} Scandinavia to New England. Breeding {{occurs in the}} Caribbean and Cape Verde. In the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, whales may breed off Brazil, as well the coasts of central, {{southern}} and southeastern Africa (including Madagascar). Whale visits into Gulf of Mexico have been <b>infrequent,</b> but occurred in the gulf historically. In the South Atlantic, about 10% of world population of the species possibly migrate to the Gulf of Guinea. Comparison of songs between those at Cape Lopez and Abrolhos Archipelago indicate that trans-Atlantic mixings between western and southeastern populations occur.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while {{there appears to be}} no reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates <b>infrequent</b> and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>infrequent</b> {{occasions}} when they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 silky sharks (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after this}} however, {{in the early}} 7th century, {{as a result of}} extreme {{military}} and political pressure on the Byzantine Empire, public bathing changed from being a common luxury to a rare and <b>infrequent</b> one, and many public facilities and venues began to be used for the austere purposes of the military. They are last attested as being used as baths in 713, before being converted to other uses: part of the building became the prison known as Noumera, while another part appears to have been used as a silk workshop.|$|E
5|$|The G {{operates}} {{at all times}} between Court Square in Long Island City, Queens, and Church Avenue in Kensington, Brooklyn, making local stops along its entire route. The G is the only non-shuttle service in the system that does not serve Manhattan. It suffers from constant service disruptions, <b>infrequent</b> train headways, few free transfers to other services, and low rolling stock capacity, leading to criticism from politicians and residents of the neighborhoods through which it travels. Since the 2000s, several improvements {{have been made to}} the G, including a route extension in Brooklyn and a full-route audit that identified solutions for issues on the G service.|$|E
5|$|The Oort cloud is a {{hypothetical}} spherical cloud {{of up to}} a trillion icy objects that {{is thought to be}} the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000AU (around 1light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000AU (1.87ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by <b>infrequent</b> events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the spore print is pale yellow. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have {{dimensions}} of 8–10 by 5–6µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped, two- to four-spored, and measure 24–30 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the inner walls of the tubes) are light yellow brown in color, club shaped, <b>infrequent,</b> and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The false {{catshark}} is an <b>infrequent</b> bycatch of longlines {{and bottom}} trawls. It has minimal economic value, though its meat, fins, and liver oil may be utilized. In Okinawa, its oil is traditionally used {{to seal the}} hulls of wooden fishing boats. Like other deepwater sharks, this species {{is thought to be}} highly susceptible to overfishing due to its slow reproductive rate. However, it is rarely caught and there is no information available on its population. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the wrens {{increased}} northward and westward in several regions {{over the past few}} centuries. In Massachusetts, the wrens had expanded westward and northeastward from its former southeastern location in approximately 35 years, in New York the population increased three-fold in roughly 25 years, while in midwest states such as Ohio and Michigan have seen numbers of the birds increase since the mid-1800s and early 1900s, respectively. Expansion around Ontario occurred since early reports in 1890 and 1905. Explanations given include <b>infrequent</b> winter storms in the 20th century, expanded forest habitats, and the wrens taking advantage of urban areas containing feeders, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of the {{district}} in the Vale of York borders on and is drained by the River Derwent. The landscape is generally low-lying and flat although minor ridges and glacial moraines provide some variations in topography. Where there are dry sandy soils there are remnants of historic heathlands and ancient semi-natural woodlands. Arable fields dominate the land cover of the area and grasslands are <b>infrequent.</b> There are very few flood meadows left, although some significant areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland {{was covered by}} ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the {{landscape}} is much affected by glaciation, {{and to a lesser}} extent by subsequent sea level changes. In the post-glacial epoch, circa 6100 BC, Scotland and the Faeroe Islands experienced a tsunami up to 20 metres high caused by the Storegga Slides, an immense underwater landslip off the coast of Norway. Earth tremors are <b>infrequent</b> and usually slight. The Great Glen is the most seismically active area of Britain, but the last event of any size was in 1901.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} five {{alternative}} routes similar to route X43 operated in the past. When route X43 was diverted away from Bury in 1978, some journeys continued {{to serve the}} town. These were numbered 743 and were operated by Ribble Motor Services {{with a mixture of}} coaches and buses. Route X43's <b>infrequent</b> extension to Skipton was also transferred onto route 743. The route was withdrawn in 1985 due to a fall in passenger numbers which coincided with the rebranding of the main route as Timesaver.|$|E
5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of <b>infrequent</b> errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E
5|$|Allen played less {{frequently}} in 1932, {{even though he}} wanted to secure {{a place in the}} MCC team to tour Australia during the 1932–33 season. He played four times for Middlesex and played in two Test trial games, but did not play in the season's only Test match. His most important game of the season was the Gentlemen v Players match, in which many of those involved were potential selections for the touring team; he took eight wickets in the game, and after the second trial was named in the MCC team. The press reaction to his inclusion was mixed, and there were several who criticised the selectors. He was low in the national batting and bowling averages; critics pointed out his <b>infrequent</b> appearances in first-class cricket and questioned his stamina for a long tour. Having been named in the team, Allen did not play again in the season. In eight first-class matches, he scored 113 runs at 11.30 and took 25 wickets at 25.36.|$|E
5|$|Andriamasinavalona {{established}} {{new rules}} {{to strengthen the}} authority of the tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam-pangady) to the local lord, and offered him the hindquarters of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property of those who died without children would revert to the king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was <b>infrequent,</b> in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E
5|$|As {{newspapers}} were banned and letters <b>infrequent,</b> the Romanovs {{under house arrest}} knew little of the fate of Tsar Nicholas and his family. Nicholas, his wife, and their children, were originally held at their official residence, the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, but the provisional government under Alexander Kerensky relocated them to Tobolsk, Siberia. Eventually, in July 1918, after being transferred to Yekaterinburg, Nicholas {{and his family were}} killed by their Bolshevik guards. In the Crimea, the Grand Duchess's family were condemned to death by the Yalta revolutionary council but the executions were stayed by the Sevastopol council, who refused to act without orders from Moscow. In March 1918, German forces advanced on the Crimea, and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones.|$|E
5|$|As {{opportunities}} for slow bowling became <b>infrequent,</b> he contemplated retirement. Although he dismissed Cyril Washbrook {{in the first}} over of Victoria's match against Wally Hammond's touring England team of 1946–47, he was skeptical about his pace bowling. After that match {{he did not take}} a wicket for the next two months. It took further encouragement from Australian captain Don Bradman after he played against Bradman's South Australians. Bradman told Johnston that the selectors thought highly of his potential as a medium-fast bowler to reinforce the short bursts of pace spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and that pace bowlers were in short supply, whereas spinners were plentiful. In the same season, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson, Bruce Dooland and George Tribe had all played in Tests as specialist spinners. Johnston ended the season with only 12 wickets at 33.16 from six matches.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very <b>infrequent.</b>|$|E
