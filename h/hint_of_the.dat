The juvenile is like the female, but young males have black markings on the head from an early age.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} of Ælfwald shows, while the written sources for later Northumbria are few and often written down centuries after the events they describe, archaeological {{evidence}} from coinage is independent of the surviving annals. Anglo-Saxon coins usually named the king on whose orders they were issued and sometimes named the mint where they were struck—Northumbrian coinage names York as the place of issue—and the moneyer who produced them. Their weight and silver content can be compared with other reigns, providing a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevailing economic conditions, and the style and size may also throw light on cultural influences when the coins are {{compared with those of}} neighbouring kingdoms and with other forms of art. The evidence of Northumbrian coinage is particularly valuable in the ninth century, when contemporary written evidence all but disappears.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{scrutiny}} about the stub end at Exit 6A for Route 138 {{that was to}} be a part of an extension of the freeway for its final five miles (8km) from Route 138 to the Brielle Circle. Some of the right-of-way that was acquired in the 1960s for the Route 35 freeway were transformed into a multi-use trail for bicycles and other vehicles to link the Wall Township Municipal Complex to the existing Edgar Felix Bikeway that runs from Manasquan to Allaire State Park. In 2001, the Brielle Circle was replaced with a new four-approach interchange between Route 35, Route 34 and Route 70, but the project included no <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Route 18 Extension. NJDOT is in planning to create a Park & Ride at the southern terminus of the Route 18 freeway. It will be placed along the four lane right of way just south of Route 138. Residents are in opposition to this proposal for fear of loitering and vandalism that may accompany the parking lot.|$|E

5|$|Whilst the Coronation {{class was}} {{represented}} at the 1948 British Railways locomotive exchange trials, designed {{to compare the}} performances of similar locomotives from {{all four of the}} pre-nationalised companies, the representative engine performed disastrously. Gone was any <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power that could be unleashed by these engines; instead, uncharacteristically low coal consumption was the target. If the trials were forgettable, other achievements of the class are certainly memorable. Firstly, No. 6220 Coronation held the British steam speed record between 1937 and 1939. Secondly, No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn holds the record to this day for the greatest British power output to be officially recorded on an attached dynamometer car, achieved in 1939. Unfortunately the most memorable event {{in the history of the}} class was the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash precipitated by 46242 City of Glasgow. This was the second worst rail crash in British history, the death toll being 112.|$|E
5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have come next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feud between father and son {{is the fact that the}} image of Ivan Sratsimir was not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff {{missed the}} Third Test in Durban {{and spent a}} month on the sidelines, before {{returning}} against a combined team from Orange Free State and Border {{at the end of}} January. He took 6/29 in the first innings, his best return of the tour, and earned a recall for the final two Tests of the five-match series. He was not as effective as he was on debut, taking two and one wickets for the matches respectively, and scoring 26 runs in his only innings of the Fourth Test. Overall, the Victorian paceman had made a steady start to his international career, with 11 Test wickets at an average of 32.09, and 56 runs at 18.66. In the entire tour, he took 33 first-class wickets at 23.09. However, there was a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controversy that was to end his career six years later. A year after the series, the South African Test umpire Bill Marais said he was prepared to no-ball Meckiff and his team-mate Jim Burke for throwing. There were reports that Craig had been tipped off about Marais's intentions and therefore operated the two bowlers exclusively from the end at which Marais was not officiating.|$|E

25|$|Covert spells {{are those}} that do not {{outwardly}} appear magical, and therefore do not automatically risk backfiring (called Paradox), while Vulgar spells are unmistakably magical, and risk backfiring. All spells have a greater risk of Paradox when they are cast in the presence of Sleepers, or non-Awakened humans. Supernatural beings, or humans that have some <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supernatural about them (i.e. Ghouls, Sleepwalkers, and Wolfblooded) do not contribute to Paradox.|$|E

40|$|After {{reviewing}} three astrophysical <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> axion-like particles (ALPs), {{we describe}} {{in more detail}} a new similar hint involving flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Detection of FSRQs above about 20 GeV pose a challenge to very-high-energy (VHE) astrophysics, because at those energies the ultraviolet emission from their broad line region should prevent photons produced by the central engine to leave the source. Although a few astrophysical explanations have been put forward, they are totally ad hoc. We show that a natural explanation instead arises within <b>the</b> conventional models <b>of</b> FSRQs provided that photon-ALP oscillations occur inside the source. Our analysis takes the FSRQ PKR 1222 + 206 as an example, and it looks tantalizing that basically <b>the</b> same choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free model parameters adopted {{in this case is}} consistent with those that provide <b>the</b> other three <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> ALPs...|$|R

The KLM Constellation that crashed near Prestwick six years earlier had also been carrying diamonds, then valued at over £5,000.|$|E
25|$|This mix of evangelism {{with rock}} placed Petra among the early pioneers of Jesus Music, {{part of the}} larger {{counterculture}} Jesus Movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Church authorities struggled with and frequently opposed the use of churches for rock concerts, and few Christian radio stations, with the exception of some college-based signals, would play the band's songs. Petra was criticized for its rock sound, a <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposition it would experience as its popularity grew.|$|E
25|$|While Shoshenq's tomb is {{currently}} unknown, the burial {{of one of}} his prominent state officials at Thebes, the Third Prophet of Amun Djedptahiufankh, was discovered intact in Tomb DB320 in the 19th Century. Inscriptions on Djedptahiufankh's Mummy bandages show that he died in or after Year 11 of this king. His Mummy was discovered to contain various gold bracelets, amulets and precious carnelian objects and give a small <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vast treasures that would have adorned Shoshenq I's tomb.|$|E
