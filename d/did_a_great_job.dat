At sixteen, Horn headed to the American Southwest, where he was hired by the U.S. Cavalry as a civilian scout, packer and interpreter under Al Sieber during the Apache Wars. Horn <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> in his work for the army, and soon he rose through the ranks. In one instance, as Sieber, Horn, and the army were crossing the Cibicue Creek, they were ambushed by Apaches warriors positioned on high ground. The officer in charge of their squad, Captain Edmund Hentig, was instantly killed, and the men became pinned down under overwhelming fire. Desperate, Sieber ordered Horn and another scout, Mickey Free, to break away and return fire from a hill. Together with the soldiers, the men managed to repel the attack. Tom Horn and Al Sieber participated during the Battle of Big Dry Wash, and gained recognition when he and Lt. George H. Morgan slipped through the banks opposite of the Apache line, and provided covering fire for the cavalry as well as killing a number of Apaches warriors.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} the lead vocals, Swivel decided {{to rework the}} 1980s sound on the snares as they were originally very tight. He therefore added a gated reverb for the snap sound which was long and drawn‑out snap sound. He also subbed in an additional kick underneath to add some real oomph to the bottom. Owing to the work Swivel had accomplished during production, the final mix took only a few hours. He said: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} tracks, but I just enjoyed it, to be honest. I knew how I wanted it to sound, and it was pretty much the last song we cut; a lot of the mixing was nailed in the production as well, which helped.

500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode".

500|$|The battle system {{gained the}} highest amount of praise. Matt Elliot of Official PlayStation Magazine said the battle system was fun and [...] " [...] like Final Fantasy: an energetic, modern {{approximation}} of combat that was previously turn-based." [...] IGN's Marty Sliva greatly enjoyed the battle system, saying that [...] "Lightning Returns <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of empowering me {{to create a}} [...] that felt unique and personal." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer was also pleased with the system which he {{considered to be an}} improvement over the previous two XIII games, noting that the switching of Schema created [...] "a fast-paced, high-tension system that makes fights exciting." [...] Eurogamer's Simon Parkin called it [...] "perhaps the best and certainly most flexible version yet" [...] when compared to the other XIII games, while GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd stated that {{if it were not for}} a few flaws such as the blocking, [...] "it may have even found a place among Final Fantasy's better battle systems." [...] Famitsu generally cited the battle system as [...] "excellent", noting it as fast-paced and fun, but also noting that some enemies were tricky even on Easy mode. It also praised the level of [...] "uniqueness" [...] available in garb customization.|$|E

500|$|According to lead vocalist Bart Millard, MercyMe {{had started}} as a rock band and had {{wanted to make a}} rock record. Following the success of their {{breakthrough}} single [...] "I Can Only Imagine", a ballad, they were advised to [...] "duplicate [...] on the next two records". Millard says they felt that they were at a point where [...] "we are known more for ballads than the rock band we wanted to be". With the consent of their label, which felt there was a trend towards heavier music, MercyMe decided to make an [...] "edgier" [...] record. In particular the band focused on up-tempo songs, trying to put more edge into what they were making. Millard noted that while the songs are still pop rock songs, the band tried to put a bit more edge into them. Additionally, the band decided to work with producer Brown Bannister, who had produced the group's Christmas record and Millard's solo album Hymned No. 1, as opposed to Pete Kipley, who had produced the band's previous three albums. Bannister's producing style was different from Kipley's; while Kipley was a hands-on producer, [...] "involved in every part of the song", Bannister would wait until the band had [...] "run down all [...] avenues" [...] before giving input. The band felt Bannsiter was an [...] "amazing encourager" [...] and were satisfied with the Christmas album Bannister had produced with him; although they felt Kipley <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> on their previous records, improving themselves as a band and as songwriters, they felt it was [...] "time for a change". Another factor in the decision to use Bannister was his previous recording experience; Bannister had produced one of Millard's favorite albums, White Heart's 1989 album Freedom. The different approach the band took with Bannister resulted in a sometimes [...] "radical" [...] approach, with the band [...] "taking songs apart, putting them back together and, at times, totally reinventing them". One song, [...] "Something About You", shifted from [...] "an aggressive rock song to a soaring anthem".|$|E
500|$|In the postseason, Maryland {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job.</b> He's a heck of a back, no question about it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E
500|$|The {{stage was}} {{designed}} by production designer Steven Cohen and production manager Rob Brenner for the HBO special. This {{was the first time}} Spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end-stage with a ramp and stairs at the center as on her first 3 tours (the ...Baby One More Time Tour, the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, and the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour). Cohen designed the main stage with an oval shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said {{that the rest of the}} stage was created with three main components in mind: a runway, a B-stage, and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, [...] "around this Cleopatra's barge concept I got into my head while designing when the movie Cleopatra was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech, because it was going to have to be traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." [...] Brenner continued, [...] "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the same experience as the one in the first 10 rows." [...] The runway uniting the main stage and the B-stage was suggested by one of Spears's managers, Johnny Wright. The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. Cohen said, [...] "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> on executing the fine details like the hand railings and the floor lights and the MR-16 covers.
