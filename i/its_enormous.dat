The product underwent a change in 1987 due to consistency issues in manufacturing, and again in around 2003 when original parts from KEF ran out.

5|$|To {{have reached}} <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> size within its {{relatively}} short (geologically speaking) 600,000 to 1,000,000 years of life, Mauna Loa would logically {{have had to}} have grown extremely rapidly through its developmental history, and extensive charcoal-based radiocarbon dating (perhaps the most extensive such prehistorical eruptive dating on Earth) has amassed a record of almost two hundred reliably dated extant flows confirming this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a {{large ship}} heading {{directly}} towards them {{and as it}} drew nearer, <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle for five hours.|$|E
5|$|Setting out on Double D's monthly insect expedition, the Eds {{venture into}} a forest. While Double D admires {{the bounty of}} nature, Eddy discovers a giant spiderweb and fearfully {{suggests}} that they leave. His friends are intrigued by <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> size however, and Ed starts bouncing on the web. Suddenly, nearby voices start chanting the Eds' names. Double D and Eddy urge Ed to climb down from the web, but {{he is unable to}} break free on his own. After his friends manage to pull him down, the three of them frantically try to run away. Before they are able to escape the forest though, they fall into a muddy swamp and are surrounded by three seemingly ominous figures.|$|E
50|$|Nogales {{is known}} for <b>its</b> recent <b>enormous</b> {{population}} growth which covers the hills along the central narrow north-south valley. Dispersed among the houses, the visitor will find a mixture of factories, stores, etc. In 2006, the southern half of the city experienced a modern urbanization development including shopping malls, wide avenues, and modern housing conglomerations.|$|R

25|$|Another eating {{area was}} the Dutch Room (or German Grill). It was noted for <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> red brick {{supports}} which supported the heavy-beamed and paneled ceilings.

50|$|Peterborough Cathedral {{is known}} for its {{imposing}} Early English Gothic West Front (façade) which, with <b>its</b> three <b>enormous</b> arches, is without architectural precedent and with no direct successor. The appearance is slightly asymmetrical, as one of the two towers that rise from behind the façade was never completed (the tower on the right as one faces the building), but this is only visible from a distance.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, the Chinese {{population}} {{centered on}} the Chinese central plain and oriented itself toward <b>its</b> own <b>enormous</b> inland market, developing as an imperial power whose center lay {{in the middle and}} lower reaches of the Yellow River on the northern plains. More recently, the 18000 km coastline has been used extensively for export-oriented trade, causing the coastal provinces to become the leading economic center.|$|R

25|$|Hermit's Rest, {{another one}} of Colter's fantasy buildings, was {{constructed}} {{at the head of}} the Hermit Trail in 1914 to serve as a refreshment stand and gift shop.

Its most impressive feature was <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> fireplace.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} {{feature of the}} city is <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> aqueduct, consisting of seventy four arches, each twenty meters wide with a total extension of 1,280 meters and an average height of twenty three meters. It was built by the Marquis Juan Antonio de Urrutia y Arana between 1726 and 1738 {{at the request of the}} nuns of the Santa Clara Convent to bring water to the residents of the city from La Cañada.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{due to an}} {{increasing}} need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel. This is probably because China prefers not {{to be dependent on}} foreign oil, instead utilizing <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> domestic coal reserves. As oil prices were increasing {{during the first half of}} 2009, the coal liquefaction projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.|$|E

25|$|The western {{coasts of}} Central Luzon are {{typically}} flat extending east from the coastline to the Zambales Mountains, {{the site of}} Mount Pinatubo, made famous because of <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> 1991 eruption. These mountains extend to the sea in the north, forming the Lingayen Gulf, and to the south, forming the Bataan Peninsula. The peninsula encloses the Manila Bay, a natural harbor considered {{to be one of}} the best natural ports in East Asia, due to its size and strategic geographical location.|$|E
25|$|According to Chertok, {{after the}} U.S. {{developed}} its Space Shuttle programme, the Soviet military became suspicious {{that it could}} be used for military purposes, due to <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> payload, several times that of previous U.S. launch vehicles. The Soviet government asked the TsNIIMash (ЦНИИМАШ, Central Institute of Machine-building, a major player in defense analysis) for an expert opinion. Institute director, Yuri Mozzhorin, recalls {{that for a long time}} the institute could not envisage a civilian payload large enough to require a vehicle of that capacity.|$|E
25|$|The Wehrmacht's {{failure to}} achieve {{victory in the}} Soviet Union before 1941 was not a {{complete}} disaster for the German war effort as on all fronts the Germans still held the strategic initiative. The entry of the United States into the war, {{on the side of}} the Allies, in December 1941 however, would pit <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> industrial power against Germany. Hitler had stated that he would avoid a war on two fronts and knew he needed to end the war on the Eastern Front before the Americans built up significant strength in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Tew {{reached the}} Red Sea {{and ran down}} a large Ghanjah dhow en route from India to the Ottoman Empire, some time in late 1693. Despite <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> {{garrison}} of 300 soldiers, the Indian dhow surrendered without serious resistance, inflicting no casualties on the assailants. Tew's pirates helped themselves to the ship’s rich treasure, worth £100,000 in gold and silver alone, not counting {{the value of the}} ivory, spices, gemstones, and silk taken. Tew's 45 men afterward shared out between £1,200 and £3,000 per man, and Tew himself claimed about £8,000.|$|E
25|$|The Belgian command was {{counting}} on Eben-Emael {{to be the key}} defense of the northern frontier at Liège. It naturally attracted the first German attacks. <b>Its</b> <b>enormous</b> dimensions dictated an unconventional attack strategy, using airborne troops. The fort was attacked on 10 May 1940 and rendered ineffective in a few hours by a team of 75 men armed with new shaped-charge explosives. Ineffective Belgian defense of the fort's surface allowed the German assault team to use their explosive charges to destroy or render the fort's gun turrets and machine gun cloches uninhabitable.|$|E
25|$|Angraceum sesquipedale {{was first}} {{brought to the}} United Kingdom in 1855 to be grown outside of its natural {{environment}} by William Ellis. Subsequently, Ellis achieved the first flowering of the plant in cultivation in 1857. Angraecum sesquipedale has been attributed as having a nicer appearance when grown in cultivation than when found in the wild, since wild specimens appear as a long stem surrounded by a few struggling leaves. Additionally, A. sesquipedale is seldom grown in private collections, despite <b>its</b> <b>enormous</b> importance to Darwin's concept of co-evolution and subsequently the fields of botany and evolutionary biology.|$|E

One potential tool is the use of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, which are based on the trisubstituted derivatives of purine. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse alterations of the regulatory pathways in both androgen sensitive and androgen insensitive prostatic cancer cell lines (LNCaP and DU- 145, respectively) after blockage of the cell cycle by the synthetic CDK inhibitors, olomoucine and bohemine...|$|R
