[...] He especially praised the musical segments, and the portrayal of the North Pole, writing that [...] "the way the episode kept piling more and more ridiculous horrors {{on top of each}} other kept the whole thing funny." [...] He rated the episode an [...] "A-". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the songs and the depiction of Santa's factory, though he found the delivery of the episode's message [...] "heavy-handed." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.6 out of 5 stars. She said, [...] "I had mixed feelings about this one, despite its clever moments and hopeful ending. [...] While <b>I</b> <b>normally</b> have no problems about Family Guys shocking or offensive themes, I felt bit disconcerted about the direction of this Christmas episode." [...] She went on to say, [...] "Perhaps it was the way that the series stomped on something as innocent as Santa and his elves and twisted them all around. Or perhaps it was the cannibalistic reindeer. [...] Whatever the specific reason, the irreverent nature of Family Guy seemed just a little too graphic for me this time around." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number twelve on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "Christmas comedy gold", praising the 'Christmastime is Killing Us' song and Boreanaz's cameo.|$|E

40|$|Low {{temperature}} corrosion proof {{heat exchangers}} {{designed to reduce}} boiler flue gas temperatures to 150 ?F or lower are now being commercially operated on gas, oil and coal fired boilers. These heat exchangers, when applied to boiler flue gas, are commonly called condensing economizers. It has traditionally been common practice in the boiler industry to not reduce flue gas temperatures below the 300 ?F to 400 ?F range. This barrier has now been broken by the development and application of corrosion proof heat exchanger technology. This opens up a vast reservior of untapped recoverable energy that can be recovered and reused as an energy source.
