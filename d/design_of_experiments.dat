40|$|In this thesis, the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> is studied. Firstly, a theoretic {{background}} in mathematical statistics necessary for understanding is built (chapter 2). The <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> is then presented in chapters 3 and 4.

Chapter 4 deals with particular types <b>of</b> the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> (Factorial experiments or Response surface design).

Prioritizing of these factors whit combination of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>Of</b> Taguchi help designers to develop the performance of projectile structure.

For this purpose first by <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>Of</b> Taguchi the influence of every these factors on two criteria of range and drift were calculated and then by AHP method these factors were prioritized. By considering of equal weight for both range and drift, the result shows between 11 factors, Firing Angle whit value of 0. 3398, Muzzle Velocity whit value of 0. 2918 and Burning Time whit value of 0. 1257 were the most influenced factors in projectile performance respectively.

25|$|Fisher {{emphasized}} the importance of measuring the tail – the observed value of the test statistic and all more extreme – rather than simply the probability of specific outcome itself, in his The <b>Design</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experiments</b> (1935). He explains this as because a specific set of data may be unlikely (in the null hypothesis), but more extreme outcomes likely, so seen in this light, the specific but not extreme unlikely data should not be considered significant.|$|E

Designs have also been popular in recreational mathematics, such as Kirkman's schoolgirl problem (1850), and in practical problems, such as the scheduling of round-robin tournaments (solution published 1880s).

They were producing carbon foam used in atomic bombs for the Atomic Energy Commission. 85 percent of the foam was defective and they were considering re-tooling the factory {{at a cost of}} $100 million. Instead, Holland questioned the workers and management team for ideas on how to decrease defects and tested 15 factors like the size and position of mixing blades. Holland’s multivariable experiments were based on the 1935 book The <b>Design</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experiments</b> and the work of two British statisticians that used multivariable testing to make better shells to shoot down German planes in World War II. The success rate of foam production increased from 15 percent to 60 percent, and eventually to 99 percent.|$|E

30|$|The main {{objective}} in <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> is {{to study the}} relationship between the response and variables. The <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> is a method to minimize the number <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> in order to reach optimum conditions. To explore {{the relationship between the}} response and the independent variables, the required data are obtained experimentally. To reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>experiments,</b> the number <b>of</b> data was kept at minimum. A response surface is an analytical function such as a polynomial that relates the behavior of one or more response variables to several independent variables. RSM has many applications in design, development, and optimization. An important step in response surface modeling is to define an appropriate approximation for the actual relationship between the response and the set of independent variables [10].|$|R
