50|$|A <b>grassed</b> <b>waterway</b> {{consists}} in a 2 m to 48-metre-wide (157 ft) native grassland strip of green belt. It is generally {{installed in the}} thalweg, the deepest continuous line along a valley or watercourse, of a cultivated dry valley {{in order to control}} erosion. A study carried out on a <b>grassed</b> <b>waterway</b> during 8 years in Bavaria showed that it can lead to several other types of positive impacts, e.g. on biodiversity.|$|R
50|$|In this context, a <b>grassed</b> <b>waterway</b> allows {{increasing}} {{soil cohesion}} and roughness. It also prevents {{the formation of}} rills and gullies. Furthermore, it can slow down runoff and allow its re-infiltration during long winter rains. In contrast, its infiltration capacity is generally not sufficient to reinfiltrate runoff produced by heavy spring and summer storms. It can therefore be useful to combine it with extra measures, like the installation of earthen dams across the <b>grassed</b> <b>waterway,</b> in order to buffer runoff temporarily.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} is to apply other measures than {{can be referred to}} as intermediate measures.

30|$|The {{observed}} {{changes in}} water balance such as decreased evapotranspiration and increased percolation, groundwater flow and recharge {{as well as}} total water yield (Fig.  23) are dependent on land and water management practices. Contours and terracing reduce the steep slope of the land and, therefore, reduce and delay the surface runoff and allows {{a long time for}} rainwater percolation (Dou et al. 2009). Deep ripper tillage increases soil depth and enhances percolation and ultimately reduces overland surface flow (Lacey 2008). <b>Grassed</b> <b>waterways</b> reduce runoff volumes due to their comparably high infiltration rates and the reduction in runoff velocity. The <b>grassed</b> <b>waterways</b> reduced runoff by 10 and 90 %, respectively, in the two watersheds in Munich (Fiener and Auerswald 2003). This is contrary to the unexpected increased surface runoff in the current study of about 31 % under both <b>grassed</b> <b>waterways</b> and terrace and contouring (Fig.  23). Nevertheless, in this study, the surface runoff under filter strips was higher than in other management interventions (Fig.  23). This {{is due to the fact}} that filter strips do not affect the surface runoff in SWAT (Arnold et al. 2013). Moreover, high increase in percolation, shallow aquifer and groundwater flow, groundwater recharge and ultimately total water yield under the filter strips compared to other management interventions is attributed to this increased infiltration rate (Arnold et al. 2013).|$|E

Contamination of surface waters with pollutants from agricultural land is a major threat to the environment. A field-size watershed study in Northeast Missouri showed that vegetated filter strips containing grass and grass+trees (agroforestry) buffers placed on contours reduced sediment and nutrient loadings by 11 - 35 %. Watershed scale studies are overly expensive while computer simulated hydrologic models offer efficient and economical tools to examine environmental benefits of conservation practices. The current study used the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model and a fuzzy logic model to predict environmental benefits of buffers and <b>grass</b> <b>waterways</b> of three adjacent watersheds at the Greenley Memorial Research Center. During {{the second phase of the}} study, an automated computer technique was developed to optimize parameter sets for the APEX model for runoff, sediment, total phosphorous (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) losses. The APEX model was calibrated and validated satisfactorily for runoff from both pre- and post-buffer watersheds. The sediment, TP, and TN were calibrated only for larger events during the pre-buffer period (> 50 mm). Only TP was calibrated by post-buffer models. The models simulated 13 - 25 % TP reduction by <b>grass</b> <b>waterways,</b> and 4 - 5 % runoff and 13 - 45 % TP reductions by buffers. The fuzzy model predicted runoff for the study watersheds and for watersheds 30 and 50 times larger in northern Missouri. A stepwise multi-objective, multi-variable parameter optimization technique improved calibration of sediments, TP, and TN after optimization for runoff parameters. The results of the study show that models can be used to examine environmental benefits provided long-term data are available...|$|R

40|$|During the {{previous}} decade, 68 % of the municipalities in the Belgian loam belt have been confronted with muddy floods from agricultural catchments after intense rainfall. A muddy flood means that runoff concentrates {{in a dry}} valley causing damage to infrastructure and housing property downstream. A typical problem area is the village of Velm where a permanent river is constrained by a culvert designed to accommodate its peak discharge. However, {{the design of the}} culvert does not take the local flooding from seven dry valleys just upstream into account. This study focuses on peak discharge from one of these agricultural catchments (ca. 300 ha). The Meshed Hydrological Model (MHM) is used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} mitigation measures to reduce flooding. Seasonal variation of soil cover in cropland and difference in land use patterns, i. e. before and after land consolidation is explicitly taken into account. The land cover spatial pattern was mapped at regular intervals during 2003. The largest potential of runoff generation occurs in December, and therefore represents a worst-case scenario. Mitigation measures implemented after the extreme event of August 2002 (i. e. a 12 ha <b>grassed</b> <b>waterway</b> and a retention dam in the thalweg) alleviate the flooding risk in Velm. The model simulates a peak discharge and a runoff volume reduction of more than 40 %. The retention pond would buffer the generated runoff volume entirely for the worst-case scenario. Land consolidation carried out in the 1970 s has led to an increase in peak discharge by 33 % and in runoff volume by 19 %. The major role played by a new consolidation road built in the thalweg on runoff concentration is highlighted. Implementation of additional soil conservation measures is therefore needed to limit runoff generation within the catchment. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Discussed are {{a variety}} of {{remotely}} sensed data sources that may have utility in the identification of conservation practices and related linear features. Test sites were evaluated in Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma using one or more of a variety of remotely sensed data sources, including color infrared photography (CIR), LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) data, and aircraft-acquired Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) data. Both visual examination and computer-implemented enhancement procedures were used to identify conservation practices and other linear features. For the Kansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma test sites, photo interpretations of CIR identified up to 24 of the 109 conservation practices from a matrix derived from the SCS National Handbook of Conservation Practices. The conservation practice matrix was modified to predict the possibility of identifying the 109 practices at various photographic scales based on the observed results as well as photo interpreter experience. Some practices were successfully identified in TM data through visual identification, but a number of existing practices were of such size and shape that the resolution of the TM could not detect them accurately. A series of computer-automated decorrelation and filtering procedures served to enhance the conservation practices in TM data with only fair success. However, features such as field boundaries, roads, water bodies, and the Urban/Ag interface were easily differentiated. Similar enhancement techniques applied to 5 and 10 meter TIMS data proved much more useful in delineating terraces, <b>grass</b> <b>waterways,</b> and drainage ditches as well as the features mentioned above, due partly to improved resolution and partly to thermally influenced moisture conditions.

Use of 4 habitat classes by 9 birds monitored by radio telemetry was compared with habitat availability over 4 seasonal periods. Strip cover was used at higher than expected frequencies in all periods. Partridge utilized the periphery of fields at a relatively high frequency while use of the central portion was less than expected. Three partridge broods utilized soybeans at a high frequency and corn at a relatively low frequency through the 1 st 4 weeks of life, but use of corn increased from 5 to 8 weeks of age. Hay and strip cover were used at a relatively high frequency through 2 weeks of age as were the edges of fields. Average overall activity range for 6 mated birds that were monitored over 4 or more months was 1. 93 km(2 ̆ 72) (range = 0. 84 to 3. 66 km(2 ̆ 72)).
