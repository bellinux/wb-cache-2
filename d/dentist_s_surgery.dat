40|$|Although surgery {{has been}} {{performed}} {{for thousands of}} years, until mod-ern times people underwent surgery only in desperation, {{in part because they}} were likely to die of postoperative infection. With the advent of antiseptic techniques in the late 1800 <b>s,</b> <b>surgery</b> became significantly safer; however, postoperative infection remained a major cause of operative morbidity and mortality. Soon after antimicrobials entered medical practice in the 1950 s, surgeons began to use them prophylactically with the goal of preventing postoperative infections. Over the subsequent 50 years, there have been many trials investigating the benefits and risks of prophylactic antimicro-bials. Although many uncertainties remain, prophylactic antimicrobials are currently an important part of good perioperative care for many types of surgery. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgical site infection and sepsis Postoperative infections Bacteria introduced into normally sterile body sites are the dominant cause of postoperative infection. Immunosuppression from perioperative stress, and from concomitant treatments such as blood transfusion, may also contribute to postoperative infection [1].

40|$|Background. From the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), {{autism is}} {{considered}} a pervasive developmental disorder. It manifests as a behavioral syndrome characterised by impairment in social interaction and communica tion, restricted interests and activities, as well as repetitive and stereotyped patterns. Such profile renders prevention measures and dental care seriously compromised so that usually autistic children are treated and cared following general anesthesia. Aims. We aimed at developing a target - specific educational approach allowing to avoid general anesthesia in autistic patients subjected to dental care treatments (e. g. sealing, plaque ablation, minimal carious lesions etc.); such protocol should also facilitate the implementation of prevention measures. Design. It is proposed a target - specific educational research protocol adopting individual strategies and methodologies, including Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) for patients with speech and language impairments. The <b>dentist</b> <b>s</b> are trained by the educator, who acts as a filter between {{the patient and the}} medical team. The team is required until a relationship of trust with the patient is built and the dentist is able to continue independently Results. We present a pilot clinical trial in which out of 34 patients between 6 and 12 years old showed a positive response to the application of the protocol, allowing the execution of dental therapies together with a long -term prevention programme and in 32 of them the general anesthesi a was avoided. Negative results regarded two patients who had not undergone any behavioral, psychomotor or speech rehabilitation therapy Conclusions.

30|$|Up to the 1990 <b>s,</b> <b>surgery</b> was {{typically}} performed using the transthoracic approach through a right thoracotomy (most diverticula {{arise from the}} right side of the esophagus) [20 – 22]. With advances in minimally invasive operative techniques [23 – 25], laparoscopy has also become a reasonable alternative to open surgery, and laparoscopic diverticulectomy with myotomy and fundoplication are now considered to be the approach of choice in most cases [5, 9, 26]. Although there have been some case reports of epiphrenic esophageal diverticula that were resected laparoscopically [27, 28], almost the entire diverticulum could be visualized laparoscopically from the esophageal hiatus by pulling the esophagus caudally. In the present case, although the left-sided diverticulum could be identified by a transhiatal approach, the huge diverticulum present in the upper part of the esophagus could not be observed. To resect both diverticula, both a thoracic and an abdominal approach were necessary. On the other hand, HALS has the advantage of allowing better visualization and is useful for the transhiatal procedure by avoiding the liver, pulling the esophagus, as well as for protecting the stomach. We have employed the HALS technique for gastric conduit reconstruction in esophageal surgery [29]. In our experience, postoperative complications were significantly less in HALS than in open surgery when performing esophageal cancer surgery with gastric conduit reconstruction.|$|R

MethodsIn 2008, the authors surveyed a stratified random sample of 6, 825 U. <b>S.</b> <b>dentists.</b> The response rate was 49 percent. The authors gathered data regarding dentists 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 demographic and practice characteristics, attitudes toward infection control, sources of instruction regarding the guidelines and knowledge {{about the need to}} use sterile water for surgical procedures. Then they assessed the impact of those factors on the implementation of four recommendations: having an infection control coordinator, maintaining dental unit water quality, documenting percutaneous injuries and using safer medical devices, such as safer syringes and scalpels. The authors conducted bivariate analyses and proportional odds modeling. ResultsResponding dentists in 34 percent of practices had implemented none or one of the four recommendations, 40 percent had implemented two of the recommendations and 26 percent had implemented three or four of the recommendations. The likelihood of implementation was higher among dentists who acknowledged the importance of infection control, had practiced dentistry for less than 30 years, had received more continuing dental education credits in infection control, correctly identified more surgical procedures that require the use of sterile water, worked in larger practices and had at least three sources of instruction regarding the guidelines. Dentists with practices in the South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic or East South Central U. S. Census divisions were less likely to have complied. ConclusionsImplementation of the four recommendations varied among U. <b>S.</b> <b>dentists.</b> Strategies targeted at raising awareness of the importance of infection control, increasing continuing education requirements and developing multiple modes of instruction may increase implementation of current and future Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

40|$|Introduction Metastatic spinal {{cancer is}} a common {{condition}} {{that may lead to}} spinal instability, pain and paralysis. In the 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>surgery</b> was discouraged because results showed worse neurological outcomes and pain compared with radiotherapy alone. However, with the advent of modern imaging and spinal stabilisation techniques, the role of surgery has regained centre stage, though few studies have assessed quality of life and functional outcomes after surgery. Objective We investigated whether surgery provides sustained improvement in quality of life and pain relief for patients with symptomatic spinal metastases by analysing the largest reported surgical series of patients with epidural spinal metastases. Methods A prospective cohort study of 922 consecutive patients with spinal metastases who underwent surgery, from the Global Spine Tumour Study Group database. Pre- and post-operative EQ- 5 D quality of life, visual analogue pain score, Karnofsky physical functioning score, complication rates and survival were recorded. Results Quality of life (EQ- 5 D), VAS pain score and Karnofsky physical functioning score improved rapidly after surgery and these improvements were sustained in those patients who survived up to 2 years after surgery. In specialised spine centres, the technical intra-operative complication rate of surgery was low, however almost a quarter of patients experienced post-operative systemic adverse events. Conclusion Surgical treatment for spinal metastases produces rapid pain relief, maintains ambulation and improves good quality of life. However, as a group, patients with cancer are vulnerable to post-operative systemic complications, hence the importance of appropriate patient selection. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is {{widespread}} among the human population. HSV infection can have subtle symptoms and often go undiagnosed. There {{are two types}} of HSV infections. HSV type 1 (HSV- 1) is associated with orofacial blisters transmitted through saliva whereas HSV type 2 (HSV- 2) causes genital ulcers, genital herpes and in severe cases meningitis. HSV- 2 is transmitted through sexual contact. Current methods of detecting HSV infection are labour intensive and time consuming. Patients that attend a doctor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>surgery</b> often have to wait weeks to obtain a result due to transportation of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s sample to a laboratory with suitable facilities and personnel with expertise to diagnose HSV infection. Currently, {{there is a need to}} develop a rapid point-of-care (POC) device that is capable of detecting HSV infections from a patient 2 ̆ 7 s bedside, doctor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>surgery</b> or a remote location. Currently, there are capillary flow driven devices for the detection of HSV infections but the microdevice developed in this study for the fluorescent detection of HSV infection has a novel method of detection via capillary flow through open microchannels made of a cyclo-olefin polymer. In this thesis, a capillary driven microdevice was developed with the goal of fluorescent detection of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 as a first step toward developing a POC microdevice. The first step in the development of this microdevice was to assess the influence of surfactants on the capillary flow through open hydrophobic microchannels and the hydrophilisation of the hydrophobic microchannels through the use of surfactant coatings which to the author’s knowledge has not been explored to date. An algorithm was developed which measured the meniscus position of the fluid in the microchannels by processing digitally captured high speed images of the fluid flow. It was found for the surfactant solutions flowing in hydrophobic open microchannels via capillary action did not follow conventional capillary flow theory possibly due the adsorption of surfactant molecules to the microchannel surfaces. To the author’s knowledge, the dynamic contact angles of fluids flowing in open microchannels have never been measured and in this thesis an algorithm was used to measure dynamic contact angles non-invasively by analysing digital images of the fluid flow. Surfactant coating of flat hydrophobic surfaces increased their wettabilty although surfactant coating of hydrophobic open microchannels promoted capillary flow of water but as the concentration of surfactant increased the flow through the microchannels decreased. The surfactant coating created a hydrophobic barrier that increased in strength with increasing surfactant concentration. Also, the meniscus shape started to deform from conventional capillary flow into a nonconventional shape which has not been documented before. This hydrophobic barrier and deformation of the meniscus shape may be due to the water adsorbing surfactant molecules from the surface of the microchannels. The second step was to assess the performance of the fluorescent detection of HSV infection using the microdevice based on a miniaturised ELISA technique. The detection method was based on the immobilisation of 100 - 1000 μg/ml of capture antibodies specific for either HSV- 1 or HSV- 2 antigens. The concentration of HSV specific antigens and fluorescent detection antibodies used were 75 - 200 and 20 μg/ml respectively. The concentration of HSV antigens used was 4 - 5 orders of magnitude higher than a POC device would use. An algorithm was developed that eliminated background noise allowing accurate qualitative and quantitative measurement of fluorescent detection. The microdevice failed in fluorescently detecting both HSV- 1 and HSV- 2. This technique requires substantial modifications to improve its performance...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that laparoscopic Ivor Lewis (IL) oesophagectomy reduces postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. However, data related to the long-term outcomes of this hybrid minimally invasive procedure are scarce. METHODS: All of the patients who had an IL oesophagectomy for cancer were extracted from a prospective database. Patients were matched one to one according to the surgical approach (laparoscopy versus laparotomy) and {{on the basis of a}} propensity score including eight variables: age, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiologists score, forced expiratory volume in 1 <b>s,</b> <b>surgery</b> (first-line treatment, after neoadjuvant treatment and salvage surgery), histology, location and pathological stage. The first end point was the assessment of the 5 -year survival and disease-free survival rates. The secondary end points were R 0 resection rate, number of resected lymph nodes (LNs) and patterns of recurrence. RESULTS: Over a 12 -year period, 272 IL oesophagectomies were performed. A total of 140 patients were matched in two homogeneous groups: laparotomy (n = 70) and laparoscopy (n = 70). The 5 -year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 65 % and 48 % in laparotomy group and 73 % and 51 % in the laparoscopy group (P = 0. 891; P = 0. 912). R 0 resection rates were, respectively, 93 % vs 97 % (P = 0. 441). The number and distribution of resected LNs were similar between the groups except at the level of the celiac axis (P < 0. 001). Depending on the surgical approach, the patterns of recurrence were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic IL oesophagectomy does not compromise the long-term oncological outcome compared to open IL oesophagectomy. The quality of the operations is similar for both techniques except for the number of resected LNs at the level of the celiac trunk.

40|$|AbstractObjective. To analyse {{the effect}} of {{superficial}} and perforating veins surgery on deep vein incompetence. Methods. During a six-month period between 2000 and 2001 24 patients (32 limbs) with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) were treated. They were selected because they had varicose veins and proximal deep vein incompetence with photoplethysmography (PPG) venous refilling time (VRT) 1. 5 s on duplex ultrasound. The group was divided according to aetiology into 21 legs with primary (Ep) and 11 with secondary CVI (Es). All patients underwent removal of varices with stripping of the saphenous veins, if appropriate. In 21 cases subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery (SEPS) was performed to ligate incompetent perforating veins. Results. The average VRT for the entire group increased from 9. 8 s before to 15 s after operation (p 0. 001, paired t test). Duplex ultrasonography before surgery showed femoral vein incompetence in 28 and the popliteal incompetence in 26 cases. The average femoral vein RT was 1. 9 s before and 1. 4 <b>s</b> after <b>surgery</b> (p< 0. 001, paired t test). The femoral RT in the Ep group decreased from 1. 9 to 1. 3 s (p< 0. 001, paired t test) and in the Es group from 1. 9 to 1. 6 s (N. S.).

Even when local control was achieved, more than 50 % of patients with soft-tissue sarcoma and 80 % of patients with skeletal sarcoma (osteogenic and Ewing’s sarcoma) eventually developed distant metastasis and died, usually within 2 years. 2 – 11 Nonsurgical treatment modalities (i. e., radiation therapy and chemotherapy) were subsequently found to exhibit reproducible anti-tumor effects against these neoplasms. Initially used only in the treatment of metastatic disease, they were later used as a part of combined-modality therapy in the adjuvant (postoperative) setting, and then as preoperative (neoadjuvant, induction) therapy in an attempt to preserve limb function and/or increase long-term survival. 2 – 11 The routes of chemotherapy administration have included intravenous (IV) bolus, continuous IV infusion, and local (regional) drug delivery directly to the tumor via a feeding artery. 1...|$|R
