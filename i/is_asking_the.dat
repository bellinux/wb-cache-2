500|$|The {{first draft}} {{libretto}} that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences {{from the final}} libretto, relatively minor {{in the first two}} acts but much more appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn that opens the third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi's tragic aria, the eventual [...] "E lucevan le stelle", has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the final scene, she cradles her lover's head in her lap and hallucinates that she and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she <b>is</b> <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> gondolier for silence. Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death. Puccini agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to abandon the work. The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini what they hoped was a final version of the libretto in 1898.|$|E

500|$|Jenijoy La Belle takes a {{slightly}} different view in her article, [...] "A Strange Infirmity: Lady Macbeth’s Amenorrhea." [...] La Belle states that Lady Macbeth does not wish for just a move away from femininity; she <b>is</b> <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> spirits to eliminate the basic biological characteristics of womanhood. The main biological characteristic that La Belle focuses on is menstruation. La Belle argues that by asking to be [...] "unsex" [...] and crying out to spirits to “make thick [...] blood / Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse,” Lady Macbeth asks for her menstrual cycle to stop. By having her menstrual cycle stop, Lady Macbeth hopes to stop any feelings of sensitivity and caring {{that is associated with}} females. She hopes to become like a man to stop any sense of remorse for the regicide. La Belle furthers her argument by connecting the stopping of the menstrual cycle with the persistent infanticide motifs in the play. La Belle gives examples of [...] "the strangled babe" [...] whose finger is thrown into the witches’ cauldron (4.1.30); Macduff’s babes who are [...] "savagely slaughter’d" [...] (4.3.235); and the suckling babe with boneless gums whose brains Lady Macbeth would dash out (1.7.57–58) to argue that Lady Macbeth represents the ultimate anti-mother: not only would she smash in a baby’s brains but she would go even further to stop her means of procreation altogether.|$|E

One discussant (William Bell) considered it a matter of taste whether or not one explicitly mentions that (under the standard conditions), which door is opened by the host is independent of whether or not one should want to switch.|$|E
