50|$|In modern radios, a ferrite {{loop antenna}} is used, {{consisting}} of fine wire wound on a ferrite rod. Litz wire {{is often used}} to reduce skin effect losses. The ferrite rod increases the magnetic permeability, allowing the physically small antenna to have a larger effective area. Other names for this type of antenna are loopstick antenna, ferrite rod antenna, <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> <b>aerial,</b> Ferroceptor, or ferrod antenna.|$|E
5000|$|Other names include loopstick antenna, ferrod, and ferrite-rod antenna. [...] "Ferroceptor" [...] is {{an older}} {{alternative}} {{name for a}} <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> <b>aerial,</b> particularly used by Philips where the ferrite core would be called a [...] "Ferroxcube" [...] rod (a brand name acquired by Yageo from Philips in the year 2000). The short terms ferrite rod or ‘loop-stick’ sometimes refers to the coil-plus-ferrite combination that {{takes the place of}} both an external antenna and the radio’s first tuned circuit, or just the ferrite core itself (the cylindrical rod or flat ferrite slab).|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> <b>aerials</b> (or antennae) are a type {{of small}} {{magnetic}} loop (SML) antenna very common in AM radio broadcast band transistor radios, although they began {{to be used in}} vacuum tube ("valve") radios in the 1950s. They are also useful in very low frequency (VLF) receivers, and can sometimes give good results over most of the shortwave frequencies assuming a suitable ferrite is used). They consist of a coil of wire wound around a <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> core (usually several inches longer than the coil, but sometimes over 3 feet long). This core effectively ‘concentrates’ the magnetic field of the radio waves to give a stronger signal than could be obtained by an air core loop antenna of comparable size, although still not as strong as the signal that could be obtained with a good outdoor wire aerial.|$|R

50|$|The {{first product}} {{launched}} was the RP10 Herald. In common {{with many of}} their 1960s designs, this was built into a wooden case covered in leathercloth, with foam padding under {{the front and rear}} panels and a turntable to enable the set to be rotated for best reception (the internal <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> <b>aerial</b> being highly directional). It featured a large (5 inch by 8 inch) 30Ω loudspeaker, and was powered by two PP9 batteries. Initial sets used Ediswan transistors; later sets used Mullard devices, including the AF117, which unfortunately went on to suffer from tin whisker formation within the encapsulation.|$|E
50|$|Receiving antennas do {{not have}} to be as {{efficient}} as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The most common receiving antenna is the ferrite loopstick antenna (also known as a <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> <b>aerial),</b> made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, ferrite antennas are also used in portable radio direction finder (RDF) receivers. The ferrite rod antenna has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the rod points exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.|$|E
40|$|We propose and {{investigate}} a compact, low-loss and broadband circulator {{based on a}} star-type <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> in two-dimensional square-lattice photonic crystals. Only one <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> is required to be inserted in our structure. Firstly, the performances of circulator based on the star-type, circle, and square <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> are compared, showing that the circulator with the star-type <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> performs {{better than the other}} two ones. And then, based on the star-type <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> circulator, four cases of improvement, in which the background rods around the center <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> are replaced respectively by the backward-triangle, forward-triangle, backward-semicircle, and forward-semicircle rods, are investigated to modulate the coupling between the center magneto-optical micro-cavity and the corresponding waveguides. The results show that, with proper parameters, all the four cases can greatly improve the output properties of the circulator, and different cases have its own advantages. The mechanism behind these improvements is also discussed. Finite-element method is used to calculate the characteristics of the circulator and Nelder-Mead optimization method is employed to obtain the optimized parameters. The ideas presented here are useful for designing broadband, low insertion loss, and high-isolation circulators which have potential application in integrated photonic crystal devices.

The microwave transmission properties of the ferrite-based metamaterials can be not only tuned by the applied magnetic field, but also adjusted by the 4 piMs of the <b>ferrite</b> <b>rods.</b> A good agreement between experimental and simulated results is demonstrated, which confirms that such a ferrite-based metamaterial possesses a tunable multi-band behavior.
