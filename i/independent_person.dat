Methods: The sample comprised 229 police officers who attended a mandatory firearms training course in Melbourne, Australia, in 2010. Results: Participants commonly reported utilizing <b>independent</b> support <b>persons</b> and displayed a fair understanding of their role. Overall, volunteers were engaged more frequently than family/friends; police considered the volunteers to be more impartial during interviews, whereas family/friends provided a greater level of emotional support to interviewees. Conclusions: <b>Independent</b> support <b>persons</b> need to demonstrate two quite different types of support to people with intellectual disability(ies) during police interviews; these require quite different skill sets and suggest the need for more tailored training and support for these volunteers. Implications for future research and policy are discussed...|$|R

If you are a philanthropist it is your duty to at once investigate the economic and political reasons for such a state of things, and alter them.

It is only fair under existing economic conditions that at marriage a husband should insure his life in his wife's interest, and I {{do not think it}} would be impossible to bring our legal marriage contract into accordance with modern ideas in that matter. Certainly it should be legally imperative that at the birth of each child a new policy upon its father's life, as the income-getter, should begin. The latter provision at least should be a normal condition of marriage and one that the wife should have power to enforce when payments fall away. With such safeguards and under such conditions marriage ceases to be a haphazard dependence for a woman, and she may live, teaching and rearing and free, almost as though the co-operative commonwealth had come.|$|E
