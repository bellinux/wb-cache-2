5|$|On 17August the Germans {{began to}} withdraw, and the 3rd Parachute Brigade started their attack at 03:00. By 18August the brigade <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> River Dives {{and reached the}} {{outskirts}} of Goustranville. Here they halted, and the 5th Parachute Brigade took over the attack, their first objective being the village of Putot en Auge.|$|E
5|$|At 06:15 the 181st Brigade {{was ordered}} {{to advance to the}} north. The 181st had one machine gun section {{attached}} to each battalion, and the 2/97th Deccan Infantry in reserve. (Prior to this order to advance, the machine gun sections had formed part of the artillery barrage.) By 08:30 the leading troops of the brigade column <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Nahr el Faliq and the causeway at Kh. ez Zebabde.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of hostilities in March 1799, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was with his troops in Bavarian territory, {{just north of the}} free and Imperial city of Augsburg. When news reached the Austrian camp that the French <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Rhine, Charles ordered the imperial army to advance west. Fürstenberg moved his troops toward Augsburg, crossing the Lech River.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July, the German {{forces had}} {{advanced}} {{within a few}} kilometers of Kiev below the Pripyat Marshes. The 1st Panzer Group then went south while the 17th Army struck east and trapped three Soviet armies near Uman. As the Germans eliminated the pocket, the tanks turned north and crossed the Dnieper. Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Group, diverted from Army Group Center, <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Desna River with 2nd Army on its right flank. The two panzer armies now trapped four Soviet armies and parts of two others.|$|E

When it attacked there on September 7 the 21st Infantry encountered virtually no opposition.|$|E

By 6 May many German Army units and individuals <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Elbe and surrendered to the US Ninth Army. Meanwhile, the XII Army's bridgehead, with its headquarters in the park of Schönhausen, came under heavy Soviet artillery bombardment and was compressed into an area eight by two kilometres (five by one and a quarter miles).|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Bill Woodfull led Australia back to England on a {{tour that}} had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket {{diplomacy}} of the previous bodyline series. Jardine had retired from International cricket in early 1934 after captaining a fraught tour of India and under England's new captain, Bob Wyatt, agreements {{were put in place}} so that bodyline would not be used. However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E

Froome and Rolland both had collected 31 points up to this point, but Froome claimed the polka dot jersey, because he <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> line as first on first category mountains more often than Rolland.|$|E
5|$|The Australians were {{crossing}} a creek {{that was in}} front of a steep hill. The Japanese commander waited until the Australians were almost at his position before opening fire with machine guns and mortars. The troops who <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> creek found hand grenades were being rolled down the hill at them; those behind it were pinned down by heavy and accurate fire. Arnold decided to pull back. That night, he formed a defensive position, and beat off a small Japanese attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{conference was}} cut short, however, when news reached Licinius that his rival Maximinus <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Bosporus and invaded European territory. Licinius {{departed}} and eventually defeated Maximinus, gaining {{control over the}} entire {{eastern half of the}} Roman Empire. Relations between the two remaining emperors deteriorated, as Constantine suffered an assassination attempt {{at the hands of a}} character that Licinius wanted elevated to the rank of Caesar; Licinius, for his part, had Constantine's statues in Emona destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> {{river to}} the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|At 21:50 the British {{artillery}} opened fire, and the Germans {{responded with}} their own artillery and mortars which forced most of the British to take cover, for the next fifteen minutes, until a lull in the German fire allowed them to continue. In the lead 'C' Company <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> start line at 22:00, however all its officers and the company sergeant major (CSM) became casualties and a senior non-commissioned officer took command of the company. They continued to advance through the artillery and mortar bombardment, guided towards their objective by tracer rounds from the Hussars tanks. Repeatedly hit by the artillery and tanks, Bréville was in flames {{by the time the}} company's fifteen survivors reached the village.|$|E
5|$|At the Milkhailovka bridgehead, {{just south}} of Belgorod, eight {{infantry}} battalions of the 6th Panzer Division crossed the river under heavy Soviet bombardment. Part of a company of Tigers from the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion was able to cross before the bridge was destroyed. The rest of the 6th Panzer Division was unable to cross further south due to a traffic jam at the crossing, and remained on the western {{bank of the river}} throughout the day. Those units of the division that <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> river attacked Stary Gorod, but were unable to break through due to poorly cleared minefields and strong resistance.|$|E

Nelson meanwhile <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean {{again in a}} fruitless attempt to locate the French and had returned to Naples to re-provision. He sailed again, intending to search the seas off Cyprus, but decided to pass Alexandria again for a final check. In doing so his force captured a French merchant ship, which provided the first news of the French fleet: they had passed south-east of Crete a month before, heading to Alexandria. Nelson hurried to the port but again found it empty of the French. Searching along the coast, he finally discovered the French fleet in Aboukir Bay on 1 August 1798.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse had {{notified}} {{his counterpart}} in Newport, the Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route {{in order to}} minimize the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, <b>had</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to mobilize assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E
5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80.

The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it down a steep embankment.
