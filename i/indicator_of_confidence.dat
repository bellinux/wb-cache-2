40|$|We propose two transductive bounds on {{the risk}} of {{majority}} votes that are estimated over partially labeled training sets. The first one involves the margin distribution of the classifier and a risk bound on its associate Gibbs classifier. The bound is tight when so is the Gibbs’s bound and when the errors of the majority vote classifier is concentrated on a zone of low margin. In semi-supervised learning, considering the margin as an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> constitutes the working hypothesis of algorithms which search the decision boundary on low density regions. Following this assumption, we propose to bound the error probability of the voted classifier on the examples for whose margins are above a fixed threshold. As an application, we propose a self-learning algorithm which iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to the set of unlabeled training examples that have their margin above a threshold obtained from this bound. Empirical results on different datasets show the effectiveness of our approach compared to the same algorithm and the TSVM in which the threshold is fixed manually. ...|$|E

Then the recent price evolution and its influence on the Italian Consumer Confidence dynamics are investigated.

A further tool for explaining recent CCI dynamics could also be represented by a micro-data analysis of opinions of population sub-groups, because some of these could have been more exposed than others to the crisis. Therefore the paper explores reactions of different consumers segments (e. g. by income, professional status, household composition) ...|$|E

For example, “A basketball player has made 15 shots in a row without missing in a game (or has missed 15 shots {{in a row in}} a game)”. The filler items involved a player’s performance with a mix of hits and misses (e.g., “A basketball player has made 10 shots and 10 misses in the past 20 shots in a game”).

40|$|For {{complex systems}} often the {{question}} arises how the system states or measurable values evolve in time, especially in the future. This applies not only to technical systems but also to economic or social systems. The knowledge of future values or even tendencies {{can be used in}} several ways. e. g., for planning, design or control. Traditionally, future system values or states are determined by prediction methods. Different approaches exist depending on the characteristics of the system that can be, e. g., deterministic or stochastic and the observable values which may be continuous, discrete, etc. Prediction is done by taking into account some knowledge about the past behavior of the system and knowledge or assumptions concerning the internal structure and relations of the system. Most real complex systems don't behave completely deterministic but have significant random or stochastic parts which may be arbitrarily correlated. Therefore, they have to be described by stochastic models that take into account this behavior. In case of stochastic system models stochastic prediction methods are used. The currently known prediction methods most often predict mean values. This means that they predict a value that corresponds to the expectation of all possible values that theoretically could occur at a particular instant. Certainly, various applications would benefit from even more information about the future behavior, e. g., the variance of the future values as an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> for the mean value. In this report a new prediction method is introduced that extends the prediction of future values towards distributions of them. This allows the calculation of various other statistical parameters like variance or quantiles. These parameters can be directly used, e. g., in control (Chapter 6), or they can help to estimate the achievable accuray of the prediction when only the mean value is used for further calculations.

To this aim we add two macroeconomic variables and two <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> to the 4 -variable financial VAR of Brunnermeier et al.
