The central question to be resolved in our quantum studies is whether the limitations encountered in the class of systems considered thus far are fundamental in nature, or whether they can be circumvented, in principle or in practice, by more general signal generation and measurement schemes than have been considered previously.

40|$|When gas atoms or {{molecules}} {{collide with}} clean and ordered surfaces, under many circumstances the energy-resolved scattering spectra exhibit two clearly distinct features due to <b>direct</b> <b>scattering</b> and to trapping in the physisorption well with subsequent desorption. James Clerk Maxwell {{is credited with}} being the first to describe this situation by invoking the simple assumption that when an impinging gas beam is scattered from a surface it {{can be divided into}} a part that exchanges no energy and specularly reflects and another part that equilibrates or accommodates completely and then desorbs with an equilibrium distribution. In this paper a scattering theory is developed, using an iterative algorithm and classical mechanics for the collision process, that describes both <b>direct</b> <b>scattering</b> and trapping-desorption of the incident beam. The initially trapped fraction of particles can be followed as they continue to make further interactions with the surface until they are all eventually promoted back into the positive energy continuum and leave the surface region. Consequently, this theory allows a rigorous test of the Maxwell assumption and determines the conditions under which it is valid. The theory also gives quantitative explanations of recent experimental measurements which exhibit both a <b>direct</b> <b>scattering</b> contribution and a trapping-desorption fraction in the energy-resolved spectra.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Three-body {{integral}} equations {{when applied}} to collisions of protons with hydrogen atoms yield the amplitudes for <b>direct</b> <b>scattering</b> and electron exchange which automatically satisfy two-body and (if solved exactly also) three-body unitarity. As a consequence, differential cross sections (DCS) for both reactions are calculated on equal footing, and the total exchange cross section (TCS) results from the corresponding DCS. This is to be contrasted with standard models used in atomic physics which either are of the (DistortedWave) Born type (to be applied at higher energies), or solve the Schrodinger equation by expanding the wave function in a basis (close-coupling method which has problems especially for rearrangement processes). Hence, at higher energies in general separate models have to be developed to describe the DCS for either <b>direct</b> <b>scattering</b> or electron exchange, and frequently also for the TCS.

40|$|International audienceThe {{paradigm}} of Compressive Sensing (CS) {{has emerged in}} the last few years as a flexible and powerful methodological strategy to address synthesis and analysis problems arising in wave <b>scattering</b> and <b>propagation</b> engineering. The success of CS techniques is motivated by several factors, including (i) their capability to address sampling/recovery problems overcoming the classical Nyquist/Shannon limits, (ii) their flexibility and ease of adaptation to several different scenarios, including array design, direction-of-arrival estimation, microwave and radar imaging, (iii) the availability of powerful, effective, and numerically efficient implementations of CS sampling and retrieval algorithms. Accordingly, and despite their relatively recent introduction, the research on the development, application, generalization, and customization of CS techniques has already become one of the most active areas within wave <b>scattering</b> and <b>propagation</b> engineering. Within this framework, this invited paper is aimed at illustrating the fundamental features of Compressive Sensing as well as at discussing its potential applicability in wave <b>scattering</b> and <b>propagation</b> problems also through a review of the recent advances in the state-of-the-art concerning CS.
