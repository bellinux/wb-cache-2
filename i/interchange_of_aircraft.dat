40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the challenge of}} building an automated decision support methodology to tackle the complex problem faced every day by runway controllers at London Heathrow Airport. Aircraft taxi from stands to holding areas {{at the end of}} the current take-off runway where they wait in queues for permission to take off. A runway controller attempts to find the best order for aircraft to take off. Sequence-dependent separation rules that depend upon aircraft size, departure route and speed group ensure that this is not a simple problem to solve. Take-off time slots on some aircraft and the need to avoid excessive delay for any aircraft make this an even more complicated problem. Making this decision at the holding area helps to avoid the problems of unpredictable push-back and taxi times, but introduces a number of complex spatial constraints that would not otherwise exist. The holding area allows some flexibility for <b>interchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> between queues, but this is limited by the physical layout of the current holding area. These physical constraints are not usually included in academic models of the departure problem However, any decision support system for the takeoff runway controller must include them. We show, in this paper, that a decision support system could help the controllers to significantly improve the departure sequence at busy times of the day, by considering the taxiing aircraft in addition to those already at the holding area. However, undertakin...|$|E
