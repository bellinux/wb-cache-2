From then to 1935 he published {{a number of papers}} on diffusion and adsorption in naturally occurring base-exchanging zeolites, and these studies continued during a year's visit to H.S. Taylor's laboratory in Princeton with support of a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship.

5000|$|The {{history of}} {{electrophoresis}} begins in earnest {{with the work}} of Arne Tiselius in the 1931, and new separation processes and chemical analysis techniques based on electrophoresis continue to be developed into the 21st century. Tiselius, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, developed the [...] "Tiselius apparatus" [...] for moving boundary electrophoresis, which was described in 1937 in the well-known paper [...] "A New Apparatus for <b>Electrophoretic</b> <b>Analysis</b> of Colloidal Mixtures". [...] The method spread slowly until the advent of effective zone electrophoresis methods in the 1940s and 1950s, which used filter paper or gels as supporting media. By the 1960s, increasingly sophisticated gel electrophoresis methods made it possible to separate biological molecules based on minute physical and chemical differences, helping to drive the rise of molecular biology. Gel electrophoresis and related techniques became the basis {{for a wide range of}} biochemical methods, such as protein fingerprinting, Southern blot and similar blotting procedures, DNA sequencing, and many more.|$|E
