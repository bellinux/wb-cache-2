50|$|<b>Heptyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (C9H18O2), {{also known}} as acetate C-7, is a colorless alcohol-soluble liquid that is the ester formed by the {{condensation}} of 1-heptanol and acetic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heptyl</b> <b>acetate</b> {{is used as}} a {{fruit essence}} {{flavoring}} in foods and as a scent in perfumes. It has a woody, fruity, rumlike odor and a spicy, floral taste with a soapy, fatty texture.|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} detection thresholds for nasal pungency (in anosmics), odor (in normosmics) and {{eye irritation}} employing a homologous series of acetates: methyl through octyl acetate, decyl and dodecyl acetate. All anosmics reliably detected the series up to <b>heptyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Only the anosmics without smell since birth (congenital) reliably detected octyl acetate, {{and only one}} congenital anosmic detected decyl and dodecyl acetate. Anosmics who lost smell from head trauma proved to be selectively less sensitive. As expected, odor thresholds lay well below pungency thresholds. Eye irritation thresholds for selected acetates came close to nasal pungency thresholds. All three types of thresholds decreased logarithmically with carbon chain length, as previously seen with homologous alcohols and as seen in narcotic and toxic phenomena. Results imply that nasal pungency for these stimuli rests upon a physical - rather than chemical - interaction with susceptible mucosal structures. When expressed as thermodynamic activity, nasal pungency thresholds remain remarkably constant within and across the homologous series of acetates and alcohols...|$|E
40|$|Threshold {{responses}} of odor, nasal pungency (irritation), and eye irritation were measured for single chemicals (1 -propanol, 1 -hexanol, ethyl acetate, <b>heptyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, toluene, ethyl benzene, and propyl benzene) and mixtures of them (two three-component mixtures, two six-component mixtures and one nine-component mixture). Nasal pungency {{was measured in}} subjects lacking a functional sense of smell (i. e., anosmics) to avoid interference from olfaction. Various degrees of stimulus agonism (additive effects) were observed {{for each of the}} three sensory channels when testing mixtures. As the number of components and the lipophilicity of such components in the mixtures increased, so did the degree of agonism. Synergistic stimulus agonism characterized the eye irritation response for the most complex (the nine-component) and the most lipophilic (one of the six-component) mixtures. Physicochemical properties play a large role in the determination of sensitivity to airborne chemicals, particularly to their ability to evoke irritation. Whereas this has revealed itself previously with respect to single chemicals, it seems to have relevance to mixtures as well...|$|E
40|$|Thresholds for {{detection}} of odor, nasal pungency (irritation), and eye irritation were measured for single {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) (1 -propanol, 1 -hexanol, ethyl acetate, <b>heptyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, toluene, ethyl benzene, and propyl benzene) and certain mixtures of them (two three-component mixtures, two six-component mixtures and one nine-component mixture). Nasal pungency was measured in persons lacking a functional sense of smell to avoid interference from olfaction. The results showed the existence of various degrees of stimulus agonism (additive effects) in the three sensory channels. Such agonism increased with {{the complexity of the}} mixtures and with the lipophilicity of their components. Eye irritation even showed synergistic stimulus agonism for the most lipophilic (one of the six-component) and the most complex (the nine-component) mixtures. The results indicate that complex chemical environments may enable chemosensory, and particularly irritative, detection when single VOCs lie far below their individual thresholds. Even the present rather rudimentary state of knowledge of how lipophilicity influences {{detection of}} single VOCs and how it and complexity (number of components) influence detection of mixtures would presumably allow refinement of a measure such as total mass (or concentration) of volatile organic compounds (TVOC) into a much more meaningful index that we might call the perceptually weighted level of VOCs, or PWVOC. Such an index, like the index dB(A) for sound, could make an otherwise strictly physical measurement at least somewhat predictive of human responses...|$|E
40|$|Volatile aroma-active esters are {{responsible}} for the fruity character of fermented alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. Esters are produced by fermenting yeast cells in an enzyme-catalyzed intracellular reaction. In order to investigate and compare the roles of the known Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol acetyltransferases, Atf 1 p, Atf 2 p and Lg-Atf 1 p, in volatile ester production, the respective genes were either deleted or overexpressed in a laboratory strain and a commercial brewing strain. Subsequently, the ester formation of the transformants was monitored by headspace gas chromatography and gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Analysis of the fermentation products confirmed that the expression levels of ATF 1 and ATF 2 greatly affect the production of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. GC-MS analysis revealed that Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p are also responsible for the formation of a broad range of less volatile esters, such as propyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, pentyl acetate, hexyl acetate, <b>heptyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> octyl acetate, and phenyl ethyl acetate. With respect to the esters analyzed in this study, Atf 2 p seemed to play only a minor role compared to Atf 1 p. The atf 1 ? atf 2 ? double deletion strain did not form any isoamyl acetate, showing that together, Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p {{are responsible}} for the total cellular isoamyl alcohol acetyltransferase activity. However, the double deletion strain still produced considerable amounts of certain other esters, such as ethyl acetate (50 % of the wild-type strain), propyl acetate (50 %), and isobutyl acetate (40 %), which provides evidence for the existence of additional, as-yet-unknown ester synthases in the yeast proteome. Interestingly, overexpression of different alleles of ATF 1 and ATF 2 led to different ester production rates, indicating that differences in the aroma profiles of yeast strains may be partially due to mutations in their ATF genes. 10 page(s...|$|E
