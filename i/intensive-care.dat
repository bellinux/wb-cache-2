5|$|In April 2010, {{there were}} 6,260 people {{employed}} in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Hospital is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing 2,610 people, followed by East Mississippi State Hospital with 1,500 and Anderson Hospital with 1,475. There are three hospitals in Meridian, {{as well as many}} other healthcare-related facilities. Jeff Anderson Regional Medical Center provides cardiovascular surgery, a Level II newborn <b>intensive-care</b> unit, and a health and fitness center. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, which offers long-term care for non-permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting. Riley Hospital has two centers for stroke treatment and rehabilitation services. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, the latter of which has been in operation since 1882.|$|E
5|$|Carmella begins {{an online}} {{business}} with Marco Silvani (Jesse Rosenfeld), and develops an attraction to him. She initially resists {{as she is}} {{still in love with}} Oliver, but learns to her disappointment that he does not reciprocate her feelings. Carmella gives birth prematurely by Caesarean section; the condition of her daughter, Chloe (Sarah May), who is placed in the neonatal <b>intensive-care</b> unit, quickly improves. Mother and daughter move in with Marco, prompting a jealous Oliver to file for sole custody of Chloe, though he later rescinds this decision. Marco proposes to Carmella and she accepts, however later that day he is severely injured in a bushfire. Carmella marries him from his hospital bed, and Marco dies shortly afterwards. Following his death, Carmella believes she is haunted by Marco's spirit. Oliver moves to New York, but she declines his invitation to accompany him. He later moves to Portugal, and in December 2008, Carmella and Chloe leave to be with him. They briefly return to Erinsborough when Oliver's mother Rebecca (Jane Hall) breaks up with her husband Paul (Stefan Dennis), to convince her to come and live with them.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2008, Barnes {{became the}} face of the Intensive Care Appeal, a major {{fund-raising}} event held annually in Australia and New Zealand for the Intensive Care Foundation. The goal of the Appeal is to create awareness and raise funds for critically ill patients in <b>intensive-care</b> units.|$|E
25|$|On December 9, 2009, Burns {{was hospitalized}} after {{suffering}} from a stroke, likely {{as a result of}} atrial fibrillation, at his Arlington, Virginia home. He was taken to Virginia Hospital Center before being transferred to the <b>intensive-care</b> unit of a Washington, D.C. hospital. He stayed at National Rehabilitation Hospital and then returned home to Montana.|$|E
25|$|While {{this model}} of infant care is {{substantially}} different from the typical Western neonatal <b>intensive-care</b> unit (NICU) procedures described here, the two are not mutually exclusive, and {{it is estimated that}} more than 200 neonatal intensive care units practice kangaroo care today. One recent survey found that 82 percent of neonatal intensive care units use kangaroo care in the United States today.|$|E
25|$|While in the <b>intensive-care</b> unit, on the {{afternoon}} of September 13, 1996, Shakur died from internal bleeding; doctors attempted to revive him but could not stop the hemorrhaging. His mother, Afeni, made the decision to tell the doctors to stop. He was pronounced dead at 4:03p.m. (PDT). The official causes of death were noted as respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest in connection with multiple gunshot wounds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intensive-care</b> {{patients}} {{at risk for}} pseudomonas aeruginosa: These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin. Another is an IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or tobramycin, plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) or a nonpseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Bishop Thomas Joseph Toolen, May was appointed the seventh Bishop of Mobile, Alabama, on September 29, 1969. His installation {{took place on the}} following December 10 at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. During his 10-year-long tenure in Mobile, he established eight parishes and two deaneries, dedicated twelve churches, founded two schools, and erected a convent. He also dedicated several other institutions, including parish centers, elderly homes, and a new wing and <b>intensive-care</b> unit at Providence Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Latex {{can trigger}} an IgE-mediated cutaneous, respiratory, and {{systemic}} reaction. The prevalence of latex allergy {{in the general}} population is believed to be less than one percent. In a hospital study, 1 in 800 surgical patients (0.125 percent) reported latex sensitivity, although the sensitivity among healthcare workers is higher, between seven and ten percent. Researchers attribute this higher level to the exposure of healthcare workers to areas with significant airborne latex allergens, such as operating rooms, <b>intensive-care</b> units, and dental suites. These latex-rich environments may sensitize healthcare workers who regularly inhale allergenic proteins.|$|E
25|$|After {{earning the}} right to {{practice}} medicine (German: Approbation), German physicians who want to become anaesthetists must undergo 5 years of training, consisting of anaesthesia, ECG and pulmonary function testing, critical care and pain medicine, and also palliative care medicine. The training includes rotations serving in the operation theatres to perform anaesthesia {{on a variety of}} patients being treated by various surgical sub-specialties (e.g. general surgery, neurosurgery, invasive urological and gynecological procedures), followed by a rotation through various <b>intensive-care</b> units. Many German anaesthetists choose to complete a curriculum in emergency medicine, which once completed, enables them to be referred to as , an emergency physician working pre-clinically with the emergency medical service. In pre-clinical settings the emergency physician is assisted by paramedics.|$|E
25|$|In early August 2010, a {{group of}} nine experts, {{including}} former coroners {{and a professor of}} <b>intensive-care</b> medicine, {{wrote a letter to the}} British newspaper The Times questioning Lord Hutton's verdict. On 14 August 2010, , a retired pathologist, amplified the criticism, saying that a coroner would probably have recorded an open verdict in the absence of absolute proof that suicide was intended. She cast further doubt on the circumstances surrounding the death of Kelly, and also criticised Hutton's handling of the inquiry. She joined other experts questioning the official finding that Kelly had bled to death and argued that it was more likely that he had suffered a heart attack due to the stress he had been placed under. This intervention came as Michael Howard, the former Conservative Party leader, became the most prominent politician to call for a full inquest into Kelly's death.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, he {{laid the}} {{cornerstone}} for a community hospital to be run according to the strictest standards of Halakha. He petitioned the authorities for a building permit, but was not granted one until the left-wing Minister of Health left office in 1962 and the Health Ministry was given to a religious party. Halberstam spent 15 years raising funds to build the hospital, which would come to be named Laniado Hospital, after the Laniado brothers, two bankers from Switzerland whose estate provided a $300,000 donation for the Rebbe. The hospital's first building, an outpatient clinic, opened in 1975. In the next few years, a maternity ward, emergency room, internal medicine department, a cardiology unit, and an <b>intensive-care</b> unit opened. The hospital continued to expand, and today encompasses two medical centers, a children’s hospital, a geriatric center and a nursing school, serving a regional population of over 450,000. The Rebbe continued to plan and supervise {{the expansion of the}} hospital until his death in 1994.|$|E

500|$|On June 16, 2004, {{following}} his freshman year, he was hospitalized in an <b>intensive-care</b> unit for smoke inhalation injuries when a house rented by nine Michigan Wolverine players caught fire. [...] Long, sleeping {{in his bedroom}} {{on the second floor}} of the house, awoke to the sound of fire alarms. He attempted to exit his room through the door, but was forced back by smoke. [...] Long then knocked out the screen of a window and jumped out of the building. Covered in soot, Long had escaped the fire, landing two stories below on a roommate's parked car. Later at the hospital, Long underwent procedures that required tubes be put down his throat to suction black phlegm from his lungs. The tubes also performed Long's breathing while he lay unconscious for the first few days. [...] He was released from the University of Michigan Medical Center and was able to spend Father's Day (June 20) back in Lapeer.|$|E
500|$|The band {{contacted}} local Toronto artist Oli Goldsmith {{who happened}} to be reading the same book, to create the artwork for the upcoming album. In total, he made around 200 paintings relating to the project, many of which were used for the album art, promotional singles and the band's website. Based on the success of that commission, the record label asked him to also create and direct music videos for the singles [...] "In Repair" [...] and [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)", which took his paintings and brought them to life with animation and stylized live motion. His artwork was described as [...] "Integrating photographs, logos, television images, signs, as well as a variety of written forms, such as epigrams and poetry, Goldsmith's art juxtaposes the unexpected, resulting in pieces that are bold, colourful, and energetic." [...] When the album insert is unfolded, it reveals a surrealistic panorama that appears to be set in a hospital. The official photo shoot for Spiritual Machines took place on October 7, 2000 on the sixth floor of St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto, formerly an <b>intensive-care</b> unit.|$|E
500|$|On 24 February 2000, Victoria Climbié {{was taken}} semi-conscious and {{suffering}} from hypothermia, multiple organ failure and malnutrition, {{to the local}} Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. With {{the advice of the}} pastor, a mini-cab was called to send Climbié to the hospital. The mini cab driver was horrified at Climbié's condition and sent her to the nearby Tottenham Ambulance Station instead. Climbié was rushed straight to the accident-and-emergency department at North Middlesex Hospital; she was then transferred to the <b>intensive-care</b> unit at St Mary's Hospital. The ambulance crew who drove her to St Mary's described how although Kouao had kept saying, [...] "my baby, my baby", her concern seemed [...] "not quite enough", and that Manning seemed [...] "almost as if he was not there". Climbié died the following day at 3:15pm local time. The pathologist who examined her body noted 128 separate injuries and scars on her body, and described it as the worst case of child abuse she had ever seen; Climbié had been burnt with cigarettes, tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours, and hit with bike chains, hammers and wires. During her life in Britain, Climbié was known to four local authorities (four social services departments and three housing departments), two child protection police teams, two hospitals, an NSPCC centre, and a few local churches. She was buried in Grand-Bassam near her home town.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Intensive-care</b> {{ventilators}} — These ventilators {{are larger}} and usually run on AC power (though virtually all contain a battery to facilitate intra-facility transport {{and as a}} back-up {{in the event of}} a power failure). [...] This style of ventilator often provides greater control of a wide variety of ventilation parameters (such as inspiratory rise time). [...] Many ICU ventilators also incorporate graphics to provide visual feedback of each breath.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to regular emergency and non-emergency services, there are Mobile Intensive Care Units MICU [...] stationed {{in most of}} the major cities. These units correspond to the Critical Care Transport function found in other places. [...] They are brought into action whenever a patient with a serious and complex medical condition, requiring advanced levels of support during transit needs to be transferred between hospitals. This service usually applies to <b>intensive-care</b> unit patients, hence the German name Intensivtransport.|$|E
2500|$|Pronovost {{grew up in}} Waterbury, Connecticut. [...] His {{parents were}} an {{elementary}} school teacher and a math professor. [...] He received his B.S. from Fairfield University, M.D. from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and Ph.D. from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In his Ph.D. thesis at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, he documented that in <b>intensive-care</b> units in Maryland, an intensive care specialist on the staff reduced death rates by a third.|$|E
2500|$|She died at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City, {{two weeks}} short of her 105th birthday. She {{had been moved}} a month earlier to an <b>intensive-care</b> unit and later to a room with hospice care. She had been living at Beth Israel under pseudonyms; the latest was Harriet Chase. The room was guarded and she was cared for by {{part-time}} private nurses. Her room {{on the third floor}} had a card with the fake room number [...] "1B" [...] with the name [...] "Chase" [...] taped over the actual room number. A criminal investigation into the handling of her money was ongoing {{at the time of her}} death.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was taken}} to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, where he was treated for severe {{injuries}} in the <b>intensive-care</b> unit. He was in serious but stable condition (updated to [...] "fair" [...] on April 23), and unable to speak because of the wound to his throat. According {{to one of the}} nurses, he had cried for two days straight after waking up. He responded to authorities in writing and by nodding his head, although he did manage to say the word [...] "no" [...] when asked if he could afford a lawyer. Court documents released in August 2013, show that Tsarnaev had a skull fracture and gunshot wounds prior to being taken into custody. According to a doctor that treated him, Tsarnaev had a skull-base fracture, with injuries to the middle ear, the skull base, the lateral portion of his C1 vertebra, with a significant soft tissue injury, as well as injury to the pharynx, the mouth, and a small vascular injury.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can be used}} as a {{short-term}} measure, for example during an operation or critical illness (often in the setting of an <b>intensive-care</b> unit). It may be used at home or in a nursing or rehabilitation institution if patients have chronic illnesses that require long-term ventilatory assistance. [...] Due to the anatomy of the human pharynx, larynx, and esophagus and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed, additional measures are often required to secure the airway during positive-pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach. The common method is by insertion of a tube into the trachea: intubation, which provides a clear route for the air. This can be either an endotracheal tube, inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose, or a tracheostomy inserted through an artificial opening in the neck. In other circumstances simple airway maneuvres, an oropharyngeal airway or laryngeal mask airway may be employed. If the patient is able to protect his/her own airway and non-invasive ventilation or negative-pressure ventilation is used then an airway adjunct may not be needed.|$|E
2500|$|Medical residencies {{traditionally}} require lengthy {{hours of}} their trainees. Early residents literally resided at the hospitals, often working in unpaid positions during their education. During this time, a resident might always be [...] "on call" [...] or share that duty {{with just one}} other practitioner. More recently, 36-hour shifts were separated by 12 hours of rest, during 100+ hour weeks. [...] The American public, and the medical education establishment, recognized that such long hours were counter-productive, since sleep deprivation increases rates of medical errors. [...] This was noted in a landmark study {{on the effects of}} sleep deprivation and error rate in an <b>Intensive-care</b> unit. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly (averaged over 4 weeks), overnight call frequency to no more than one overnight every third day, and 10 hours off between shifts. Still, a review committee may grant exceptions for up to 10%, or a maximum of 88 hours, to individual programs. Until early 2017, duty periods for postgraduate year 1 could not exceed 16 hours per day, while postgraduate year 2 residents and in those in subsequent years can have duty periods up to a maximum of 24 hours of continuous duty. After early 2017, all years of residents may work up to 24 hour shifts. While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for the purposes of accreditation, though lack of adherence to hour restrictions is not uncommon.|$|E
