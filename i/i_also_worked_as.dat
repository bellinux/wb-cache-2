40|$|Cosmic {{magnetism}} is {{a phenomenon}} observed across a huge range of spatial scales. Magnetic fields exists on planets, stars and nebulae up to galaxies and clusters of galaxies. As a rule of thumb, the larger the typical size of the object, the lower the magnitude of its magnetic field. Regardless of their magnitude, magnetic fields play a relevant role {{in all of these}} environments and contribute to a wide spectrum of phenomena. This thesis deals with the interplay between interstellar magnetic fields and turbulent warm phase of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). Observational investigations in the radio domain of MHD turbulence in the ISM are challenging and require high performance facilities. New generation aperture array radio telescopes such as LOFAR allow observational studies of the interstellar turbulence with unprecedented accuracy. In the framework of the scientific activity of this Ph. D. project, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> a commissioner of LOFAR, performing data reduction and software testing. In this thesis, I present four observational studies on the MHD turbulence in the warm ionized ISM regarding two complementary science cases: mapping of the magneto-ionic structures in the ISM (Chapter 2) and characterizing the magnetic turbulence of the diffuse warm ionized ISM (Chapters 3, 4 and 5). Note that the study described in Chapter 3 is {{based on the results of}} my commissioning activity. Promotor: H. J. A. Rottgering, Co-Promotor: M.

40|$|For {{almost five}} years, {{healthcare}} {{design and construction}} sector is in my focus. I started my experience in this field from design proposal of health-improving and rehabilitation center in Moscow which was my master thesis in Moscow Architectural Institute (MArchI) in 2012. After graduation <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> an architect in large architectural bureau which is specialized in design and construction of healthcare and resort facilities. Healthcare architectural typology {{is one of the}} most complicated ones because it deals with great number of technical and technological issues, which dictate the final spatial and design solutions in many ways. Moreover, technical regulations and demands in this type of buildings are one of the strictest ones based on the core functions and nature of the process. To find a rational balance between technology and architectural aesthetics in healthcare is a great challenge for architect. In 2013 I started my MSc Architecture program in Politecnico di Milano in order to extend my architectural vision and to get European experience and understanding of the profession of architect. Because of the fact that I already had experience in the healthcare sector at that time, I chose the topic of healthcare as my graduation subject in Milan. There is a special department in Politecnico di Milano dedicated to design problems of healthcare facilities. The head of the department, professor Stefano Capolongo, was my supervisor of the graduation project which was dedicated to modular and prefabricated solutions in healthcare design. The main focus of my thesis was to design spatial solutions for general hospital where all functions and departments can be arranged into modular and prefab scheme by using the same span of the structural grid. Questions of modularity, transportability of the modules to the construction site, universality of the layout which allows to put different functions within the same module were the main ones in my research. In order to test my hypothesis and findings I designed renovation project for the real general hospital in one of the Russian provincial cities. The idea behind this step was to test possibility to extend existing healthcare facilities in a modular and prefabricated way which allows to minimize interruptions in the daily activities of the hospital while being under renovation, reduces time schedule for the renovation project in construction phase and increases the quality of the complete work based on in-factory production and assembly process. The focus of my Milan project was mainly on spatial and technological aspects of modular healthcare design. Since I am particularly interested in medical design and construction sector, as I already mentioned, I decided to continue my research in this field while working on my graduation project in TU Delft on Management In the Built Environment Master program in order to understand the entire process of modular construction not only from architectural, but also from managerial, technological, logistic and financial points of view. The main question of this research is whether modular solutions in hospital construction more economically feasible than traditional on-site construction methods, considering the entire life cycle process of the hospital building? By answering this question, I will understand and evaluate financial, managerial and logistical aspects of hospital construction, which will give me the complete picture of effectiveness of modular construction in hospitals. I would like to say thank you to my mentors, Peter de Jong and Ruben Vrijhoef, who supported me along this year and organized a number of interviews with the set of experts who helped me to get the picture of processes in modular construction. Special appreciation to all experts and specialists, who kindly agreed to meet and answer to my questions. All their interviews can be found in appendixes of this report.

40|$|I was {{attracted}} by the interaction between dream and reality. Not long before I started my thesis, I read Freud’s book, The Interpretation of Dreams, and it quite interested me. In Freud’s theory, the complete personality is composed of id, ego and super-ego. The id is the set of coordinated instinctual trends; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego. The super-ego can stop one from doing certain things that one’s id may want to do. These three parts dominate a human’s mental life, including dreaming. Dreams have the power of censorship, which occurs when the super-ego tries to suppress the id. Freud thought {{the essence of the}} dream is the fulfillment of wishes; wishes that come from people’s instinctive desires without disguise. However, not all wishes are reasonable and achievable. To pass the censor and fulfill unreasonable wishes in a dream, a human’s brain has to put on a disguise. This is why most dreamlands look absurd, but with deep exploration, one will find out the hint of those covered wishes. The relationship between dream and reality {{is similar to that of}} a mirror and reflection. In my work, I wanted to create an environment that would depict the interaction between dreams and reality. I wished to give viewers the experience of feeling the abstract definition of “dreamland,” instead of a specific view of a particular dreamland. I chose painting and installation <b>work</b> <b>as</b> the format to build the “Dreamland” environment because visual plays a big part in dreams and painting is the best and most straightforward way to access the visual sense. Installation work has rich expressive capacity and can be suitable for representing abstract ideas. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> saw installation <b>work</b> <b>as</b> one of the current most popular art forms, so I wanted to try it in my final school project...|$|R
40|$|This study {{critically}} and reflexively {{explores the}} professional learning of five English language teacher educators (of Indonesian nationality) in an Indonesian context. The {{main focus of}} this qualitative study is an investigation into how the five teacher educators from a single private university in Indonesia understand their professional work and lives in dialogic (Bakhtin, 1981) relationship with various national policy documents and with international ELT professionalism discourses. I explore how the Indonesian teacher educators experience and understand their work and professionalism {{in the area of}} English Language Teaching (ELT), their commitment to their profession and the various factors that mediate these experiences and understandings. In this exploration, there is a particular focus on the nature of language, identity and culture in intercultural teacher education settings. I use a narrative-based inquiry framework (cf. Cole & Knowles, 2000; Doecke & Parr, 2009; Riessman, 2002) to generate critical accounts of these teacher educators describing, reflecting upon and conceptualizing their teacher ‘professionalism’ within the context of Indonesian society and culture. The data is drawn from extended narrative interviews with individual teacher educators, and the interview responses were approached as narrative accounts (Mishler, 1986). In processing the teacher educators’ narratives, I firstly constructed short biographies of their professional learning experiences. Subsequently, I analysed the different commonalities and the particularities of the teacher educators’ experiences, teaching beliefs, professional identities, the issues with which they were grappling {{in the course of their}} professional learning, and the place of imagination in the work of ELT teacher educators in Indonesia. Since <b>I</b> myself have <b>also</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> a teacher educator in Indonesia, I was able to build in an additional critical perspective by interweaving reflexive autobiographical observations vis-a-vis certain experiences and issues emerging from the study of the teacher educators. The study overall demonstrates the complex, nuanced and dynamic nature of professional learning and intercultural identity construction, involving multiple, sometimes competing discourses of professionalism in ELT. The teacher educators’ professional learning narratives provide an insight into their “struggle for voice” (Britzman, 2003) in their immediate teaching and learning context as well as internationally. I show how it is through this struggle that the teacher educators encounter and engage with these discourses and continuously negotiate their understandings of their professional work and lives. From the teacher educators’ critical discussion on ELT paradigms and practices in Indonesia, this study also emphasises the importance of revisiting, re-evaluating, and reimagining the teaching paradigm of ELT in Indonesia in engaging with today’s globalized world. I call for pedagogical and curriculum reform in ELT that takes into account Indonesian learners’ linguistic and cultural identity and that will enable them to use English as a language that mediates their identity <b>work</b> <b>as</b> national, international and intercultural selves...|$|R
