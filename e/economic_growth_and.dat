5|$|After World War II, the Philippines {{was for a}} time {{regarded}} as the second wealthiest in East Asia, next only to Japan. In the 1960s its economic performance started being overtaken. The economy stagnated under the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos as the regime spawned economic mismanagement and political volatility. The country suffered from slow <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> bouts of economic recession. Only in the 1990s with a program of economic liberalization did the economy begin to recover.|$|E

5|$|During his presidency, Endara {{abolished}} the Panamanian military {{and replaced it}} with a national police force. Endara's term saw steady <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> a return of democratic institutions, but also high unemployment rates.

5|$|The recent strong <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> lower {{unemployment}} in the Telford area {{has been attributed to}} the construction of the motorway: {{unemployment in}} the 1980s was over 20%, but by 2004 this figure had fallen to 3.3%. The motorway enabled the development of distribution centres in Telford, and industrial estates such as Hortonwood and Stafford Park have provided employment in the area.|$|E
5|$|After the WTO {{phased out}} {{quantitative}} quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Clothing(ATC). Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their industry would {{be threatened by}} global competition from China and India. The flood of similar articles from these two nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result {{in the loss of}} 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{changing}} security {{environment will}} lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force.

There is also a risk that climate change, weak <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends {{will put}} pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{both the}} {{technological}} gap between civilisations and the centuries-long colonial era, Portugal was a driving force {{in the development and}} shaping of all Portuguese Africa since the 15th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of FRELIMO forces and show to the Portuguese people and the world that the territory was totally under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of Portuguese Mozambique by creating new roads, railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and hospitals to stimulate an even higher level of <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> support from the populace.|$|E
5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs.

Projects {{spurred by the}} initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs {{have been added to}} the city.
