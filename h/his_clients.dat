5|$|Manhattan {{press agent}} Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) {{has been unable}} to gain {{mentions}} for <b>his</b> <b>clients</b> in J.J. Hunsecker's (Burt Lancaster) influential, nationally syndicated newspaper column of late because of Falco's failure to make good on a promise to break up the romance between Hunsecker's younger sister Susan (Susan Harrison) and musician Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), an up-and-coming jazz guitarist.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the sports}} agent for Tiger Woods, Steinberg is {{involved}} in many activities relating to <b>his</b> <b>client</b> including advising <b>his</b> <b>client</b> on managing <b>his</b> public image, his schedule and his finances. As his agent Steinberg had negotiated endorsement deals worth [...] "hundreds of millions of dollars". In November, 2009, when Woods was involved in an early morning car accident {{at his home in}} Florida, Steinberg was involved in managing the media access to <b>his</b> <b>client</b> during the ensuing media frenzy.|$|R
6000|$|So {{we turned}} up--through a world still singing that the Earth was flat--at the little clay-coloured market-town {{with the large}} Corn Exchange and the small Jubilee memorial. We had some {{difficulty}} in getting seats in the court. Woodhouse's imported London lawyer {{was a man of}} commanding personality, with a voice trained to convey blasting imputations by tone. When the case was called, he rose and stated <b>his</b> <b>client's</b> intention not to proceed with the charge. <b>His</b> <b>client,</b> he went on to say, had not entertained, and, of course, in the circumstances could not have entertained, any suggestion of accepting on behalf of public charities any moneys that might have been offered to him on the part of Sir Thomas's estate. At the same time, no one acknowledged more sincerely than <b>his</b> <b>client</b> the spirit in which those offers had been made by those entitled to make them. But, as a matter of fact--here he became the man of the world colloguing with his equals--certain--er--details had come to <b>his</b> <b>client's</b> knowledge since the lamentable outburst, which ... He shrugged his shoulders. Nothing was served by going into them, but he ventured to say that, had those painful circumstances only been known earlier, <b>his</b> <b>client</b> would--again 'of course'--never have dreamed--A gesture concluded the sentence, and the ensnared Bench looked at Sir Thomas with new and withdrawing eyes. Frankly, as they could see, it would be nothing less than cruelty to proceed further with this--er-unfortunate affair. He asked leave, therefore, to withdraw the charge in toto, {{and at the same time}} to express <b>his</b> <b>client's</b> deepest sympathy with all who had been in any way distressed, as <b>his</b> <b>client</b> had been, by the fact and the publicity of proceedings which he could, of course, again assure them that <b>his</b> <b>client</b> would never have dreamed of instituting if, as he hoped he had made plain, certain facts had been before <b>his</b> <b>client</b> at the time when.... But he had said enough. For his fee it seemed to me that he had.|$|R

5|$|On February 27, 1853, the twice-widower Crittenden {{married his}} third wife, Elizabeth Moss. Moss was twice-widowed, most {{recently}} to General William Henry Ashley. Moss was Crittenden's wife until his death. Crittenden served {{as attorney general}} until the expiration of Fillmore's term in 1853.

He made {{a substantial amount of}} money establishing mining claims for <b>his</b> <b>clients</b> in the former Mexican territory.|$|E
5|$|Similarities between House and {{the famous}} fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear in the pilot; Shore {{explained}} that he was always a fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of indifference to <b>his</b> <b>clients</b> unique. House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, especially in terms of chemistry.|$|E

Among other characters are his partner Maya Fey, her cousin Pearl, and the rival prosecutor Franziska von Karma.

5|$|Chatwin {{had hoped}} to read Classics at Merton College, Oxford, but the end of National Service in the United Kingdom meant there was more {{competition}} for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered—an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya. Instead, Chatwin's father asked one of <b>his</b> <b>clients</b> for a letter of introduction to the auction house Sotheby's. An interview was arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.|$|E
5|$|Clues from Mollaka {{point to}} corrupt Greek {{official}} Alex Dimitrios. Bond finds Dimitrios in the Bahamas and, after seducing his wife Solange, pursues him to Miami. Bond kills Dimitrios and follows his henchman to the airport. He thwarts {{the destruction of}} Skyfleet's airliner, costing Le Chiffre his investment. To recoup the money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government, which they will grant in exchange for information on <b>his</b> <b>clients.</b> On the train to Montenegro, Bond meets Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent there to protect the government's $10million buy-in.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a detention order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain <b>his</b> <b>clients.</b> Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power of arrest and detention into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.|$|E
50|$|In 1980-81, {{a number}} of {{children}} died at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Concerns were raised {{that they were being}} poisoned, leading to a provincial inquiry into the deaths. Thomson acted for one of the nurses who came under suspicion, vigorously defending her and chastising the commissioner, Justice Samuel Grange, for putting her under trial {{in the court of public}} opinion. He also engaged in public relations on behalf of <b>his</b> <b>client,</b> appearing on a CBC radio programme, Cross-Country Checkup, to explain <b>his</b> <b>client's</b> position. <b>His</b> <b>client</b> was not charged in the matter.|$|R
5000|$|He practiced {{mainly on}} the North-Eastern Circuit, where his skill in persuading juries of the justice of <b>his</b> <b>client's</b> cause became renowned: Healy quotes the remark: [...] "Once Andrews has stated <b>his</b> <b>client's</b> case to the jury, the only {{uncertain}} thing is how great the award of damages will be".|$|R
50|$|Poston and <b>his</b> <b>client</b> {{worked closely}} with the GBI and FBI and quickly {{provided}} them a suspect who later admitted planting the methamphetamine on <b>his</b> <b>client's</b> car. He was a tenant and handyman of Judge Cochran. Poston was joined in the effort by Chattanooga attorney Stuart James, who filed a civil suit on behalf of their client. After three years, and with an intervening second arrest of <b>his</b> <b>client,</b> all known conspirators were brought to justice in federal criminal proceedings. The civilian who planted the drugs and the two officers first on the scene who found the drugs pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for their roles in the set-up of Poston's client. Poston had publicly stated that <b>his</b> <b>client</b> was a methamphetamine addict, which made her the more vulnerable to the set-up, and that the second arrest - although ostensibly legitimate - was a desperate attempt to again discredit <b>his</b> <b>client,</b> this time just weeks before Cochran's trial. The subsequent arrest ultimately made <b>his</b> <b>client</b> a better witness for the government, having made her realize the issues that she had that made her vulnerable to the Judge. Former Chief Magistrate Bryant Cochran was tried in the same court in December, 2014 and found guilty of all charges. He was sentenced in 2015 to a five year sentence.|$|R
5|$|Despite not testing {{positive}} {{during the race}} or season, the Gewiss-Ballan team has since been speculated to have executed a systematic doping program that utilized EPO throughout the 1994 season. The team achieved several victories in stage races and one-day races during the year, including a sweep of the podium at La Flèche Wallonne weeks {{before the start of}} the Giro. Team doctor Michele Ferrari was banned for life from sports in 2012 by United States Anti-Doping Agency for distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to several of <b>his</b> <b>clients.</b>|$|E
5|$|Long {{decided in}} 1888 {{not to run}} for another term in Congress, {{and spent the next}} eight years in private practice. <b>His</b> <b>clients</b> were {{typically}} corporate interests, and he appeared on their behalf in court as well as in legislative committee hearings. He was sought after as a public speaker, something he engaged in for many years. He remained somewhat active in Republican Party circles, supporting Roger Wolcott's Young Men's Republican Club, which sought to bring new blood into the party. When offered the opportunity to challenge longtime Republican Senator George Frisbie Hoar, he refused. In 1889 he was appointed to the committee overseeing the enlargement of the Massachusetts State House, a post he held until 1897.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{was called}} to the Bar on 23 November 1730, taking a set of {{chambers}} at 5 King's Bench Walk. He was introduced to Alexander Pope around this time, and through his friendship met members of the aristocracy, some of whom later became <b>his</b> <b>clients,</b> including Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. Pope also taught him oratory, which helped him enormously in court. His first two cases were in the English Court of Sessions in 1733, where he was led by Charles Talbot and opposed by Philip Yorke. The support of Talbot and Yorke allowed him to gain a respectable practice in the Court of Chancery.|$|E

60|$|He {{looked hard}} at <b>his</b> <b>client,</b> expecting {{to receive a}} violent reply. <b>His</b> <b>client</b> agreeably {{disappointed}} him.

He got up quietly; he spoke with perfect outward composure of face and manner when he said his next words.|$|R

5|$|On October 1, 1938, Skelton {{replaced}} Red Foley as {{the host}} of Avalon Time on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name. She developed a system for working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on Avalon Time until late 1939. Skelton's work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest {{at one of his}} banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of <b>his</b> <b>clients.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pankhurst's shop never succeeded and he {{had trouble}} {{attracting}} business in London. With the family's finances in jeopardy, Richard travelled regularly to northwest England, where most of <b>his</b> <b>clients</b> were. In 1893 the Pankhursts closed the store and returned to Manchester. They stayed for several months in the seaside town of Southport, then moved briefly {{to the village of}} Disley and finally settled into a house in Manchester's Victoria Park. The girls were enrolled in Manchester Girls' High School, where they felt confined by the large student population and strictly regimented schedule.|$|E
5|$|Tamagnino's six Caesars were {{relegated to}} the less frequented areas of the {{building}} - at the back and the south and west. The sixth bust was of poorer quality {{than the rest of}} the cycle, and it is surmised that Tamagnino aimed to taunt <b>his</b> <b>clients</b> who for the second time in Brescia had undervalued his ability and underestimating his work. After these events, Tamagnino abandoned Brescia, probably never to return, leaving Cairano as the main sculptural worker in the city.|$|E
