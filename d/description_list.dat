50|$|The data {{structure}} of IPL is the list, but lists are more intricate structures than in many languages. A list {{consists of a}} singly linked sequence of symbols, {{as might be expected}} -- plus some <b>description</b> <b>lists,</b> which are subsidiary singly linked lists interpreted as alternating attribute names and values. IPL provides primitives to access and mutate attribute value by name. The <b>description</b> <b>lists</b> are given local names (of the form 9-1). So, a list called L1 holding the symbols S4 and S5, and described by associating value V1 to attribute A1 and V2 to A2, would be stored as follows. 0 indicates the end of a list; the cell names 100, 101, etc. are automatically generated internal symbols whose values are irrelevant. These cells can be scattered throughout memory; only L1, which uses a regional name that must be globally known, needs to reside in a specific place.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to terminology recognition whereby a sublanguage term (e. g. an aircraft engine component term extracted from a maintenance log) is matched to its corresponding term from a pre-defined list (such as a taxonomy representing the official break-down of the engine). Terminology recognition is addressed as a classification task whereby the extracted term is associated {{to one or more}} potential terms in the official <b>description</b> <b>list</b> via the application of string similarity metrics. The solution described in the paper uses dynamically computed similarity cut-off thresholds calculated on the basis of modeling a noise curve. Dissimilar string matches form a Gaussian distributed noise curve that can be identified and extracted leaving only mostly similar string matches. Dynamically calculated thresholds are preferable over fixed similarity thresholds as fixed thresholds are inherently imprecise, that is, there is no similarity boundary beyond which any two strings always describe the same concept. 1...|$|E

The project described the interrelationship between the social studies and art education. A review of related literature and research substantiated the need for emphasis on the humanities and creative pupil activities in social studies programs. The value of art activities to a social studies ???program was {{discussed in terms of}} (1) art expression as a means of meeting individual differences, (2) art activities as a strong motivational force for learning, (3) art activities as an invaluable aid to learning about other cultures and developing worldmindedness, and (4) art activities as an evaluation aid. Eight evaluative criteria for an art education program were derived from the art education goals of the California Art Education Framework and the goals presented by several art educators. These 8 criteria were then used to evaluate the original 14 pupil art activities included in the Man: A Course of Study program. Ten supplementary art activities were developed.

The method of research used in this research was empirical legal research, i. e. a research directly conducted based on the factors happened in field.

40|$|Digitization is {{a concept}} that has become popular in terms of {{collections}} of old heritage-related material such as books, photographs and paper documents. This work is a study of the Swedish composer Allan Pettersson (1911 – 1980) and his personal archive stored at Section for Manuscripts and Music at Uppsala University Library. My issues are What happens to the archive of the digitized? Will there be a "new" archive of the digitized? What guidelines are Uppsala University Library using for their digitizing and how do they look? What will be the result after digitization? What about copyright and the material? Allan Pettersson's personal papers consist a large collection of sketches of musical notes, newspaper clippings and concert programs. The material is at the time of writing, not digitized except the archive <b>description</b> <b>list.</b> The idea of this work is to show what can happen if a personal archive is digitized. As a theoretical model, Niels D. Lund's Technology Democracy Culture – the essential triangle has been used. Lund shows that there is a connection between cultural content, creative use and access to digital technology and how to make it available. The underlying purpose of the model was to use it to ensure the content to a wider audience based on key words as responsibility, control and representation. Based on this, I analyze how the impact of the digitization process of Allan Pettersson's personal papers. For examine it, the Arka-D project may be suitable as a choice for digitization. This project is a collaboration between Uppsala, Gothenburg and Lund University Libraries, and as a purpose to create a common platform for the digitization of such personal archives. Further aims of the platform is to make heritage-related material available and reach it out to a wider audience at Internet. The final results shows that it is technically possible to digitize it but it is not allowed without special permission. Allan Pettersson's personal archives are protected by copyrights of the law and will be free to publish earliest at 2051...|$|E
