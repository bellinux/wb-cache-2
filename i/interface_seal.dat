In this experimental evaluation, a candidate docking seal assembly called Engineering Development Unit (EDU 58) was characterized and evaluated against the Constellation Project leak rate requirement. The EDU 58 candidate seal assembly was manufactured from silicone elastomer S 0383 - 70 vacuum molded in a metal retainer ring. Four seal designs were considered with unique characteristic heights. The leak rate performance was characterized through a mass point leak rate method by monitoring gas properties within an internal control volume. The leakage performance of the seals were described herein at representative docking temperatures of - 50, + 23, and + 50 C for all four seal designs.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is {{developing}} a Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) for future exploration missions. The mechanism is a new state-of-the-art device for in-space assembly of structures and rendezvous of vehicles. At the interface between two pressurized modules, each with {{a version of the}} LIDS attached, a composite elastomer-metal seal assembly prevents the breathable air from escaping into the vacuum of space. Attached to the active LIDS, this seal mates against the passive LIDS during docking operation. The main <b>interface</b> <b>seal</b> assembly must exhibit low leak and outgas values, must be able to withstand various harsh space environments, must remain operational over a range of temperatures from - 50 C to 75 C, and perform after numerous docking cycles. This paper presents results from a comprehensive study of the mechanical performance of four candidate subscale seal assembly designs at - 50, 23, 50, and 75 C test temperatures. In particular, the force required to fully compress the seal during docking, and that which is required for separation during the undocking operation were measured. The height of subscale main <b>interface</b> <b>seal</b> bulbs, as well as the test temperature, were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the forces the main <b>interface</b> <b>seal</b> of the LIDS may experience during docking and undocking operations. The average force values required to fully compress each of the seal assemblies were shown to increase with test temperature by approximately 50 % from - 50 to 75 C. Also, the required compression forces were shown to increase as the height of the seal bulb was increased. The seal design with the tallest elastomer seal bulb, which was 31 % taller than that with the shortest bulb, required force values approximately 45 % higher than those for the shortest bulb, independent of the test temperature. The force required to separate the seal was shown to increase with decreasing temperature after 15 hours of simulated docking. No adhesion force was observed at 75 C, while magnitudes of up to 235 lbf were recorded at the refrigerated temperature. In addition, the adhesion force was observed to increase with bulb height. When compared with the LIDS program requirements, the measured compression force values were found to be below the maximum allowable load allotted to the main <b>interface</b> <b>seal.</b> However, the measured adhesion force values at the refrigerated test temperature were found to exceed the program limits...|$|E

Method: Twenty primary molars were selected and randomly {{divided into two}} groups (n= 10). In group C, the occlusal surfaces of teeth were cut with a carbide bur at high-speed until the area of dentin exposure. In group D, the same procedure was conducted, but the dentin was cut with a diamond bur. The surface of each tooth was divided into two halves; one half of the occlusal surface received application of two-step total-etch adhesive system (Single-Bond – 3 M), and the other half received application of one-step self-etching adhesive (One Up Bond F - Tokuyama). All teeth were restored with composite (Z- 250 - 3 M). The samples were thermocycled, embedded in acrylic resin, sectioned for achievement of the resin-dentin interface and the teeth were sputter- coated with gold and observed under SEM. Results: the two adhesive systems showed hybrid layer formation; the two-step adhesive system demonstrated better <b>interface</b> <b>sealing</b> than the self-etching; the dentin cut with carbide burs was not statistically different with regard to the adhesive system; and diamond bur with self-etching adhesive system showed the worst <b>interface</b> <b>sealing</b> with the highest gap values.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is {{currently}} {{developing a new}} universal docking mechanism for future space exploration missions called the Low Impact Docking System (LIDS). A candidate LIDS main <b>interface</b> <b>seal</b> design is a composite assembly of silicone elastomer seals vacuum molded into grooves in an electroless nickel plated aluminum retainer. The strength of the silicone-tometal bond is a critical consideration for the new system, especially due {{to the presence of}} small areas of disbond created during the molding process. In the work presented herein, seal-to-retainer bonds of subscale seal specimens with different sizes of intentional disbond were destructively tensile tested. Nominal specimens without intentional disbonds were also tested. Tension was applied either uniformly on the entire seal circumference or locally in one short circumferential length. Bond failure due to uniform tension produced a wide scatter of observable failure modes and measured load-displacement behaviors. Although the preferable failure mode for the seal-to-retainer bond is cohesive failure of the elastomer material, the dominant observed failure mode under the uniform loading condition was found to be the less desirable adhesive failure of the bond in question. The uniform tension case results did not show a correlation between disbond size and bond strength. Localized tension was found to produce failure either as immediate tearing of the elastomer material outside the bond region or as complete peel-out of the seal in one piece. The obtained results represent a valuable benchmark for comparison in the future between adhesion loads under various separation conditions and composite seal bond strength...|$|E
40|$|Helium leak {{tests were}} {{completed}} {{to characterize the}} leak rate of a 54 in. diameter composite space docking seal design {{in support of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration s (NASA's) Low Impact Docking System (LIDS). The evaluated seal design was a candidate for the main <b>interface</b> <b>seal</b> on the LIDS, which would be compressed between two vehicles, while docked, to prevent the escape of breathable air from the vehicles and into the vacuum of space. Leak tests completed at nominal temperatures of - 30, 20, and 50 C on untreated and atomic oxygen (AO) exposed test samples were examined to determine the influence of both test temperature and AO exposure on the performance of the composite seal assembly. Results obtained for untreated seal samples showed leak rates which increased with increased test temperature. This general trend was not observed in tests of the AO exposed specimens. Initial examination of collected test data suggested that AO exposure resulted in higher helium leak rates, however, further analysis showed that the differences observed in the 20 and 50 C tests between the untreated and AO exposed samples were within the experimental error of the test method. Lack of discernable trends in the test data prevented concrete conclusions about the effects of test temperature and AO exposure on helium leak rates of the candidate seal design from being drawn. To facilitate a comparison of the current test data with results from previous leak tests using air as the test fluid, helium leak rates were converted to air leak rates using standard conversion factors for viscous and molecular flow. Flow rates calculated using the viscous flow conversion factor were significantly higher than the experimental air leakage values, whereas values calculated using the molecular flow conversion factor were significantly lower than the experimentally obtained air leak rates. The difference in these sets of converted flow rates and their deviation from the experimentally obtained air leak rate data suggest that neither conversion factor can be used alone to accurately convert helium leak rates to equivalent air leak rates for the test seals evaluated in this study; other leak phenomena, including permeation, must also be considered...|$|E

This container is designed to operate passively with no motors and actuators. Using the sampler's featured drill tip for <b>interfacing,</b> transfer-ring and <b>sealing</b> samples, the container consumes no electrical power and therefore minimizes sample temperature change. The circular container houses a few isolated canisters, which will be sealed individually for samples acquired from different sites or depths.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{need for}} an alternative to donor corneal tissue has encouraged much interest in recent years. The development of a reconstructed human cornea is necessary {{in view of the}} world-wide shortage of donors, the increasing risk of transmissible diseases, the widespread use of corrective surgery, which renders corneas unsuitable for grafting, and the severe limitations of currently available synthetic polymer-based artificial corneas. The development of a reconstructed human cornea is vital and will represent a real breakthrough, allowing diseased or damaged corneas to be replaced by tissue-engineered corneal implants that resemble in all respects their natural counterparts. An artificial cornea whether it is a synthetic keratoprosthesis or bio-engineered must fulfill the key functions of the native cornea including transparency, strength, elasticity, biocompatibility, and non-immunogenic. A wide range of implants and biomedical devices have been developed in an attempt to correct corneal blindness. Limitation of existing biomaterials is evident when reviewing keratoprosthesis surgery complications, e. g., infection, intraocular inflammation, retro corneal membrane formation, insufficient <b>interface</b> <b>seal</b> thus epithelial cells down growth, and glaucoma, as well as issues involved with bio-engineered materials such as inadequate mechanical strength and elasticity for implantation, and rapid biodegradation. My main objective was to address these issues by reconstructing an implantable bio-engineered human cornea with proper bulk and surface properties. More specifically, one of the aims was to develop a well-defined slowly-degradable corneal material with sufficient mechanical elasticity and strength, high optical transparency, and good biocompatibility that allows regeneration of corneal epithelial, stromal, and nerve cells. Another aim was to engineer material's surfaces to inhibit endothelial cell attachment onto the posterior surface while enhancing epithelial cell attachment onto the anterior one using surface modification techniques such as radio frequency (RF) plasma. The originality of this study lies in the use of systematic multivariate experimental designs (MED) combined with a novel bio-inspired material development approach to construct hybrid polymer networks (HPN) for artificial cornea application. Material development was carried out by crosslinking of bio-functional natural polymers, e. g., collagen and chitosan with a hybrid amalgamation of synthetic bio-inert molecules, e. g., poly (ethylene glycol) dibutyraldehyde (PEG-DBA), 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). HPNs were designed and fabricated {{with the aid of a}} 23 full factorial experimental design (FED) merged with a response surface design (RSD). The combined FED/RSD approach allowed us to efficiently evaluate the key experimental factors (e. g., molar ratios of the components), their interactions and their impacts on key responses (mechanical, optical, and biological properties), and to screen and develop optimum material formulations. This strategy resulted in a synergistic effect on physical and biological properties of the materials. It became possible to simultaneously enhance mechanical strength, and elasticity while retaining biological characteristics and optical clarity of the matrices. The select HPN materials were implanted into pig corneas for 12 months and demonstrated successful in vivo regeneration of the host corneal epithelium, stroma, and nerves with seamless host-graft integration. In addition to studies focused on bulk design of corneal materials, design principles for the engineering of surfaces that direct epithelial and endothelial cell adhesion to the corneal implants were investigated and developed. The designs contributed to the development of epithelial cell-adhering and endothelial cell-resistance surfaces. Attempts were made to augment attachment of epithelial cells to the surfaces of corneal materials that were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA) and glutaraldehyde-polyethylene oxide dialdehyde (PEO-DA). Argon plasma treatment of corneal surfaces at a RF power of 100 Watts for 30 minutes enhanced the cell attachment, surface hydrophilicity, and roughness. Prevention of endothelial cell migration onto the posterior surface of HPN corneal implants was achieved using a NH 3 plasma-assisted surface modification technique. Briefly, hydrogels were subjected to ammonia plasma functionalization followed by grafting of alginate macromolecules to the target surface. Treated hydrogel surfaces showed observable decreases in endothelial cell attachment. The decrease in cell adhesion was dependant upon the concentration of alginate and plasma radio frequency (RF) power. High concentrations of alginate of 5 % (w/v) and high RF power of 100 W produced surfaces with minimal cell attachment. I demonstrated that alliance of MED with material and surface sciences played a significant role in development of novel materials that might lay a foundation for a new generation of implantable biomaterials that could be tailor-made into cornea or other tissue/organ transplants such as skin, crystalline lens, liver, and heart...|$|E

After hearing their report, Lunney and Bushuyev felt three problem areas needed further study. First, the requirement for a spring thruster designed to help separate the two spacecraft had caught their attention, since the failure of this thruster to compress properly could prevent completion of docking.

The amount of force required to fully compress the test article in the <b>sealing</b> <b>interface</b> and the force needed to separate the joint were also measured. The outgassing and resistance measurements were below the maximum allowable levels. The room temperature compression set and leak rates were fairly high when compared against other typical spacecraft seal materials, but were not excessive. The compression and adhesion forces were desirably low. Overall, the performance of the elastomer compound was sufficient to be considered for future spacecraft seal applications...|$|R
30|$|The thermal ALD-grown {{amorphous}} AlN {{passivation layer}} owns a satisfactory interface state and film quality. This passivation technique performs better in <b>sealing</b> <b>interface</b> traps {{and reducing the}} off-state leakage than the PECVD-deposited SiN. Low polarization is observed for the thermal ALD-grown amorphous AlN passivation layer. Amorphous AlN is also promising as gate dielectric for AlGaN/GaN HEMT because of its predictable lower leakage than the crystalline one.|$|R
5000|$|An {{end face}} {{mechanical}} seal uses both rigid and flexible elements that maintain contact at a <b>sealing</b> <b>interface</b> and slide on each other, allowing a rotating element {{to pass through}} a sealed case. The elements are both hydraulically and mechanically loaded with a spring or other device to maintain contact. For similar designs using flexible elements, see Radial shaft seal (a.k.a. [...] "lip seal") and o-rings.|$|R
2500|$|This {{operation}} is generally {{performed in the}} doctor's office under local anesthesia. It is another method of repairing a retinal detachment in which a gas bubble (SF6 or C3F8 gas) is injected into the eye after which laser or freezing treatment {{is applied to the}} retinal hole. [...] The patient's head is then positioned so that the bubble rests against the retinal hole. Patients may have to keep their heads tilted for several days to keep the gas bubble in contact with the retinal hole. The surface tension of the gas/water <b>interface</b> <b>seals</b> the hole in the retina, and allows the retinal pigment epithelium to pump the subretinal space dry and [...] "suck the retina back into place". This strict positioning requirement makes the treatment of the retinal holes and detachments that occurs in {{the lower part of the}} eyeball impractical. This procedure is usually combined with cryopexy or laser photocoagulation. Pneumatic retinopexy has significantly lower success rates compared to scleral buckle surgery and vitrectomy. Some initially successful cases will fail during the weeks and months after surgery. In some of the failed cases, an area of the retina which was healthy and attached prior to the initial pneumatic retinopexy repair procedure develops new tears and/or becomes detached. A recent Cochrane Review compared outcomes [...] from patients receiving retinal reattachment from pneumatic retinopexy versus scleral buckle. Though the quality of evidence from two randomized controlled trials was low, eyes having received the pneumatic retinopexy procedure were more likely to have a recurrence of retinal detachment by follow-up, and were 11% less likely to achieve retinal reattachment, compared to scleral buckle.|$|R
40|$|Background: Total {{replacement}} is {{the most}} common technique for defective amalgam restorations, and it represents a major part of restorative dental treatment. Repair is an alternative option for amalgam restorations with localized defects. Aims: This study compared microleakage of amalgam restorations repaired by bonded amalgam or composite resin. Materials and Methods: Thirty extracted human pre-molars were prepared and restored with class I amalgam. A simulated defect was prepared that included the cavosurface margin on restorations, and the pre-molars were assigned to two treatment groups (n= 15) : In group 1, premolars were treated by composite resin (34 % Tooth Conditioner Gel + Adper Single Bond 2 + Z 100) and in group 2, premolars were repaired by bonded amalgam (34 % Tooth Conditioner Gel + Prime and Bond 2. 1 + Permite C). The teeth were immersed in a 50 % silver nitrate solution, thermocycled, sectioned longitudinally and then observed by three examiners using a stereomicroscope. Microleakage was evaluated using a 0 - 4 scale for dye penetration, and data was analyzed by Kruskal Wallis and Dunn tests. Results: Neither of the two methods eliminated microleakage completely. Composite resin was significantly the most effective for repair/tooth <b>interface</b> <b>sealing</b> (score 0 = 80. 0 %; P= 0. 0317). For the repair/restoration interface, composite resin was also statistically more effective as a sealant (score 0 = 66 %; P= 0. 0005) when compared to the bonded amalgam technique (score 0 = 13 %; P= 0. 0005). Conclusions: The use of adhesive systems significantly affected the ability to seal the repair/ tooth interface. However, {{at the level of the}} repair/restoration interface, the bonded amalgam technique may increase microleakage...|$|R
