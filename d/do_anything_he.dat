Jack finds Tracy disobeying his order, but Tracy shouts that Jack is not his dad. Jack and Tracy meet with an NBC shrink, and Jack role-plays Tracy's father, Tracy, and Tracy's mom, among several other people from Tracy's childhood, {{conveying}} the message that even though Tracy's parents may have divorced, they still loved him. This comforts Tracy, and affirms that while he loves his family, they are crazy, {{and he needs to}} stay away from them. Tracy hugs Jack, and tells him that he is the only family he needs.|$|E
25|$|Savil, realizing Vanyel needs special assistance, {{takes him}} to the Tayledras, human beings who live in K'Treva, an {{environment}} immersed in magic. They {{teach him how to}} control his abilities, and convince him that being gay is not wrong or sinful. Vanyel {{does not want to be}} a Herald or a Mage, and suspects the people around him value his powers, not himself. He runs away, but as he thinks things over he realizes that Savil and the others have shown that they care about him. Just when he realizes that and moves to return he discovers a village being terrorized by a colddrake, a type of dragon. Before he can even think to <b>do</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>he</b> witnesses the dragon killing an elderly man. He pulls himself together and kills the dragon, but the unfortunate timing gives Vanyel the impression that he is a coward. The Tayledras later explain that he is not at all cowardly and that his reactions were normal.|$|E

I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Lane ran for Governor of California in 1902 on the Democratic and Non-Partisan tickets. [...] At a {{time when}} California was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, he lost by less than a percentage point to George Pardee. (Theodore Roosevelt won the state by 35points two years later.) [...] Between 8,000 and 10,000votes were disqualified on various technicalities, possibly costing him the election. [...] During the campaign, the influential San Francisco Examiner slanted its news coverage against him. [...] Examiner owner William Randolph Hearst later denied responsibility for this policy, and stated that if Lane ever needed anything, he should send Hearst a telegram. [...] Lane retorted that if Hearst received a telegram purportedly signed by Lane, asking him to <b>do</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>he</b> could be {{sure it was a}} forgery.|$|E

Rumpelstiltskin offers to help the Queen if, in turn, she makes him a wealthy and respected person {{in the new world}} and promises that she will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> asks so long as he says [...] "please." [...] The Queen agrees, reminding him that in the new world, they would have no recollection of their agreement. Rumpelstiltskin then tells the Queen that she must cut out the heart of the thing she loves the most and use it to complete the spell. The Queen protests that what she loved most died because of Snow White, but Rumpelstiltskin suggests that there is something else the Queen also loves. He also tells the Queen that he has informed Snow White and Prince Charming that their unborn daughter will be able to break the Queen's curse.|$|E
500|$|Valery Krylov, {{advisor to}} Anatoly Karpov and a {{specialist}} in the [...] "psycho-physiological rehabilitation of sportsmen", believed Fischer suffered from schizophrenia. Psychologist Joseph G Ponterotto, from second-hand sources, concludes that [...] "Bobby did not meet all the necessary criteria to reach diagnoses of schizophrenia or Asperger syndrome. The evidence is stronger for paranoid personality disorder." [...] Magnús Skúlason, a chess player and a psychiatrist and head doctor of Sogn Mental Asylum for the Criminally Insane, befriended Fischer {{toward the end of}} Fischer's life. From Endgame, Fischer's 2011 biography by Frank Brady: Skulason was not [...] "Bobby's psychiatrist", as has been implied in the general press, nor did he offer Bobby any analysis or psychotherapy. He was at Bobby's bedside as a friend, to try to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> could for him. Because of his training, however, he couldn't fail to take note of Bobby's mental condition. [...] "He definitely was not schizophrenic", Skulason said. [...] "He had problems, possibly certain childhood traumas that had affected him. He was misunderstood. Underneath I think he was a caring sensitive person." ...|$|E

[...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday morning, and I get a message from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, telling me that my bags have been packed and all of my stuff has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E

500|$|Although jams {{had always}} been an {{integral}} aspect of song creation for the Chili Peppers, Blood Sugar Sex Magik saw songs being created with more structure. One specific jam {{would lead to the}} breakout song on the album: Frusciante, Flea and Smith were all playing together—with Kiedis at another part of the room watching—when [...] "...Flea started playing this insane bass line, and Chad cracked up and played along... I always had fragments of song ideas or even specific isolated phrases in my mind. I (Kiedis) took the mic and belted out 'Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now." [...] The philosophy behind the lyrics originated from a conversation Kiedis had with Nina Hagen, regarding selflessness and how insignificant material possessions were in his life. It, thus, gave birth to the song [...] "Give It Away." [...] He'd also been reminiscing about late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, composing [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] in his tribute. Kiedis wrote [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] to be an over-zealous and overly exaggerated version of himself; a figure that could get any woman, and <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> pleased to them. [...] "The Power of Equality" [...] confronted topics concerning racial equality, prejudice and sexism. Kiedis wrote [...] "I Could Have Lied" [...] to document the brief relationship he had with Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Beckinsale {{starred in}} the legal thriller The Trials of Cate McCall {{opposite}} Nick Nolte and James Cromwell. The film received negative reviews and was released as a Lifetime movie. She next appeared in the little-seen psychological thriller Stonehearst Asylum, loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story. A lukewarm critical reception greeted the film upon its DVD release; Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said Beckinsale was [...] "emoting as if an Oscar nomination depended on it" [...] while Dennis Harvey of Variety found her performance [...] "overwrought." [...] Also in 2014, she provided the voice for Queen Ayrenn, a character in The Elder Scrolls Online video game. In 2015, she {{starred in the}} psychological thriller The Face of an Angel alongside Daniel Brühl. The film, directed by Michael Winterbottom, {{was inspired by the}} case of Meredith Kercher. Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club felt her [...] "charismatic" [...] performance was wasted. Also that year, she starred alongside Simon Pegg in the poorly received British comedy Absolutely Anything, as an author agency employee and the love interest of a man (Pegg) chosen by four aliens to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> wants. Tom Huddleston of Time Out said her character [...] "is never really developed—which is perhaps a blessing, because her cut-glass-posh performance is almost as grating as Pegg’s." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he came home, and told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E

500|$|In April2011, it was {{reported}} that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An EastEnders insider told the News of the World, [...] "Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [...] back and will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab." [...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, and the way you do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E
