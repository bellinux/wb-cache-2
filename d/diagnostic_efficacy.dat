Evaluation of whole brain florbetaben PET images using the clinically applicable visual assessment method demonstrated that florbetaben provides good <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficacy</b> in detecting/excluding cerebral neuritic β-amyloid plaques. Sensitivity and specificity {{of the whole}} brain assessment was 98 and 89%, respectively, against the histopathological standard of truth. Good agreement between blinded readers (kappa 0.90) was reported. Furthermore, high negative and positive predictive values were reported for florbetaben imaging to exclude or detect β-amyloid plaques (negative predictive value 96.0% and positive predictive value 93.9%, see [...] ). Intravenous injections of florbetaben are generally well tolerated in all subject groups. Analysis of 872 patients with 978 florbetaben administrations found no serious adverse reactions related to the tracer. All adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate in severity and temporary only. The most common reactions (incidence < 1%) were injection-site pain (3.9% of patients), injection-site erythema (1.7%) and injection-site irritation (1.2%). There was no overall difference in the tolerability of florbetaben between different age populations. Repeated annual florbetaben injections showed no differences in the tolerability profile. Risks and side effects are addressed in the patient information leaflet. You may also ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information.|$|E

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis:: Our {{purpose was}} to study the effect of {{previous}} radiotherapy (RT) on the efficacy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in diagnosing cervical nodal metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Study Design:: Case-control study. Methods:: The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficacy</b> of FNA {{in a group of}} patients with residual or recurrent cervical lymphadenopathy after previous RT for NPC was compared with a cohort of patients with primary NPC before RT during the same period. Results:: Between 2008 and 2010, 50 patients were included for each group in the study. The specificity (100 % vs. 88 %, P =. 12) and positive predictive value (100 % vs. 89 %, P =. 12) was comparable in the two groups. However, the sensitivity (82 % vs. 40 %, P =. 04), negative predictive value (NPV; 74 % vs. 36 %, P =. 03), and accuracy (88 % vs. 54 %, P =. 05) were significantly worse after previous RT. Previous RT was the only factor that was significantly associated with worse <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficacy</b> (P =. 001). When used together with plasma Epstein-Barr virus (pEBV) -DNA level and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (triple assessment), the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficacy</b> was significantly improved, especially regarding sensitivity (40 % vs. 98 %, P =. 01), NPV (36 % vs. 96 %, P =. 02), and accuracy (54 % vs. 97 %, P =. 03).

This study is aimed to prepare broadly reactive polyclonal antibodies targeting multiple antigen markers (multi-target antibodies) and evaluate their efficacies in TB diagnosis. Materials and Methods: A fusion gene consisting of 38 kD, ESAT 6, and CFP 10 was constructed and overexpressed. The fusion polyprotein was used as an immunogen to elicit production of multi-target antibodies. Their reactivities were tested. Then, the multi-target antibodies and three corresponding antibodies elicited by each single antigen (mono-target antibodies) were evaluated with sandwich ELISA for detecting M. tuberculosis antigens. Their <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficacies</b> for TB were also compared. Results: The polyprotein successfully elicited production of multi-target antibodies targeting 38 kD, ESAT 6, and CFP 10 as analyzed by Western blotting. When used as coating antibodies, the multi-target antibodies were more efficient in capturing the three antigens than the corresponding mono-target antibodies. By testing clinical serum, the multi-target antibodies demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity for clinical TB diagnosis than all three mono-target antibodies. Conclusion: The multi-target antibodies allowed detecting multiple antigens simultaneously and significantly enhanced TB detection compared to routine mono-target antibodies.

A total of 430 subjects were recruited from Southeast China, including healthy individuals, asbestos-exposed (AE) individuals, and patients with pleural plaques (PP), asbestosis, and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Plasma fibulin- 3 was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Linear regression analyses were applied to explore the influencing factors of fibulin- 3.
