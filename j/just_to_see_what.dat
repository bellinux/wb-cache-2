25|$|O’Neil's Question is very {{conflicted}} {{on how far}} to go in enforcing justice, often feeling {{tempted to}} kill. He resists this temptation during his time in Hub City, realizing {{that part of his}} desire to go so far is <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> it feels like to take a life. His relationship with his mentor, Aristotle Rodor, is one of many things that keep him from going over the edge and back towards the darkness he had shown in his youth on the streets of Hub City.|$|E
25|$|A modest ratings success, KITS {{fought off}} {{competition}} from the legendary AM CHR station, KFRC (which changed format to big bands in 1986), as well as KMEL-FM, which had switched from album-oriented rock to CHR in 1984. 105 KITS was, for a while, {{the darling of the}} Jet Set; daily visits were common from movie celebrities such as Bette Midler, Tom Cruise, Pat Morita, George Takei, Anthony Perkins and others. The celebs didn't usually make it on the air, but they toured the studios in San Francisco's Merchandise Mart <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the industry buzz was all about.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Empire Windrush, {{which was}} en route from Australia to England via the Atlantic, docked in Kingston, Jamaica, to pick {{servicemen}} who were on leave. The British Nationality Act 1948 had just been passed, giving the status of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC status) to all British subjects connected with the United Kingdom or a British colony. Prior to 1962, the UK had no immigration control for CUKCs, who could settle indefinitely in the UK without restrictions. The ship was far from full, and so an opportunistic advertisement {{was placed in a}} Jamaican newspaper offering cheap transport on the ship for anybody who wanted to come and work in the UK. Many former servicemen took this opportunity to return to Britain with the hopes of rejoining the RAF, while others decided to make the journey <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> England was like. The resulting group of 492 immigrants famously began a wave of migration from the Caribbean to the UK when the ship docked at the Port of Tilbury, near London, on 22 June 1948, and the name Windrush has as a result come to be used as shorthand for that migration, and by extension for the beginning of modern British multicultural society.|$|E

I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. It would be great to get back together <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> musical ideas we had, and what would happen." [...] The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that [...] "it would be like a bad remake of Night of the Living Dead" [...] and added, [...] "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996." ...|$|E

Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork stated that the album's combination of [...] "paisley, sun-heated, and layered" [...] music with Gruff Rhys's [...] "satirical and heartfelt lyrics" [...] makes it [...] "timeless" [...] and the band's best record. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters called the record [...] "near-perfect" [...] and wrote that [...] "we should be thankful there are bands out there willing to throw everything they've got into a record <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens". Uncut praised its [...] "accessible and adventurous" [...] nature, while The Independent opined that Rings Around the World [...] "represents a quantum jump beyond the Furries' previous work" [...] and described it as [...] "one of the year's most engrossing – and, crucially, most entertaining – albums". Mojo stated that Rings Around the World was the band's [...] "first truly flawless album" [...] and later named it the best album of 2001. Tiny Mix Tapes called Rings Around the World [...] "one of the, if not the, best releases of 2002", describing it as a [...] "mixture of sugar pop of yesteryear and modern Britpop" [...] resulting in a [...] "near perfect" [...] album. Rings Around the World was later nominated for 2001's Mercury Music Prize.|$|E

Marge initially rejects the offer, but eventually can no longer stand Homer's snoring. She chooses to spend the weekend so she can get the money for the surgery. They have a good time until Artie tricks Marge into making out with him against her will in a re-enactement of their prom during the 1970s made to mirror the one they attended in [...] "The Way We Was" [...] (with even its original attendants who were paid by Artie to show up disguised as they were at that time). Homer, having just anxiously arrived to check up on them, sees Artie kissing an unwilling Marge and, unaware of the true premises, is devastated, and leaves with Lenny away from Springfield. Lenny seems similarly dejected about his relationship with Carl; he and Homer get a job in an oil field in West Springfield, a likely death spot for the two of them. On the way there, they discuss the loves they left behind. All cacti resemble Marge to Homer, and Lenny mournfully points out the image of Carl that he carved on a mountain one blissful summer. Meanwhile, Marge leaves Artie furiously, only to discover what Homer had done when she gets home. She finds he is not there and that he had left a tape behind.|$|E

500|$|Sam & Max Hit the Road {{received}} a favorable reception from the gaming industry's press, holding {{a rating of}} 84% on the review aggregator site GameRankings. Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World in 1994 liked it [...] "measurably less" [...] than Day of the Tentacle. He compared the latter to a Looney Tunes cartoon and the former to an underground comic book, observing that Sam & Maxs style of humor [...] "can all be funny, but only to a point ... its main characters are basically jerks" [...] and the story was unimportant [...] "even to them". Ardai cited the completely optional and disconnected minigames as [...] "contribut to the feeling that Sam & Max is more a computerized busybox ... than a unified, focused piece of fiction". He liked the graphics and simplified SCUMM interface, but concluded that [...] "the whole is rather less {{than the sum of}} its parts ... Sam & Max affords a couple of hours of somewhat similar amusement" [...] to Tentacle. Edge noted that [...] "with most adventure games, its hard to feel anything for the character(s) you control", but stated that Sam & Max Hit the Road broke this mold by being [...] "genuinely funny" [...] and players would be [...] "experimenting more than... normally <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the madcap pair will get up to next." [...] The reviewer praised the game's graphics as [...] "beautifully detailed" [...] and the puzzles as [...] "intricate to solve", but noted that a number of the minigames were [...] "dismal". Joonas Linkola, writing for Adventure Gamers, echoed many of these comments, praising the cartoon-style graphics as [...] "appropriately cheesy" [...] and [...] "colorful". On the subject of the game's humor, Linkola noted that [...] "there are many visual jokes, but the backbone of the game is in its witty dialogue", and as such this gave the game a [...] "replayability value" [...] as players may pick up on jokes based on [...] "verbal acrobatics, on the use of polysyllabic words, old English and other such oddities" [...] that they missed the first time around. Linkola gave additional praise to the soundtrack and audio work, stating that the [...] "very fitting voices... adds to the comical duo's wisecracking attitude".|$|E

Many only intended to stay in Britain for a few years, and although a number returned to the Caribbean, the majority remained to settle permanently. The arrival of the passengers has become an important landmark in the history of modern Britain, and the image of West Indians filing off the ship's gangplank has come to symbolise the beginning of modern British multicultural society.|$|E
2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
