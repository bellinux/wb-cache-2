40|$|Annandale The {{provision}} of environmental impact assess-ment (EIA) guidance is generally {{claimed to be}} beneficial for improving practice through local capacity building. However, to date no studies have investigated their effectiveness. In Western Australia, EIA <b>guidance</b> <b>materials</b> are intended to allow for better environmental protection; in-creased certainty; enhanced consistency of ad-vice given to Government; proposals to be designed to meet environmental objectives from the outset; {{and to provide a}} clearer basis for Government decision-making. Twenty practicing environmental consultants were interviewed about the effectiveness of <b>guidance</b> <b>materials</b> at achieving these objectives. It was found that EIA guidance influenced the practice of consultants and was perceived as effecttive in enhancing the outcomes of the EIA process overall. However, a number of shortfalls were identified. Suggestions are made for increasing the utility of future <b>guidance</b> <b>materials</b> thereby enhance the effec-tiveness of EIA practice itself...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Division of Global HIV/AIDS at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{is working}} on a public health {{evaluation}} (PHE) in the eastern districts of Botswana. This PHE aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} Project AIM, a group-level intervention designed to reduce HIV risk behaviors in youth ages 11 to 14, when combined with the regular Botswana Skills for Life Curriculum, a standard HIV prevention education curriculum in Botswana schools. In order to evaluate Project AIM, a self-report survey and a biological testing for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) will be conducted. Methodology: Based on studies done on the psychosocial impact of HSV- 2 diagnosis on asymptomatic individuals in the USA, the literature recommends providing pre and post counseling and education to individuals testing for genital herpes to help cope and diminish the psychosocial impact of the diagnosis. In order to prepare Botswana’s clinics and schools participating in the PHE to provide the support for newly diagnosed adolescents with HSV- 2, <b>guidance</b> <b>materials</b> were developed for health care practitioners and school <b>guidance</b> teachers. <b>Materials</b> were created using Information Mapping technique to analyze, organize, and present the information, and the Microsoft Office Flesch Kinkade Grade Level (FK) tool to assess the readability levels of the <b>materials.</b> Results: <b>Guidance</b> <b>materials</b> were prepared using the 7 ± 2 theoretical limit of human short-term memory information mapping rule, and the FK grade levels of 6. 0 to 8. 0 recommended readability scores. <b>Guidance</b> <b>materials</b> included information regarding HSV- 2 symptoms, treatment, and prevention. They also included information on the PHE study, youth friendly health services, counseling and education, clinic referrals and contact information. Conclusions: The development of <b>guidance</b> <b>materials</b> for schools and clinic participants of the CDC PHE in Botswana will provide health practitioners and school guidance teachers with accurate HSV- 2 information to counsel and educate student participants in this research study. The <b>guidance</b> <b>materials</b> should help students cope with potential psychosocial disorders associated with pre and post diagnosis of HSV- 2...|$|R

40|$|Many taxpayers rely on <b>guidance</b> <b>materials</b> the IRS {{provides}} {{in order}} to comprehend the United States Tax Code and pay an accurate tax. However, many, if not all, of these taxpayers would likely be startled to learn that their reliance on these IRS <b>guidance</b> <b>materials</b> is perilous. That is, that reliance upon these <b>guidance</b> <b>materials</b> will not support a taxpayer’s tax treatment decisions if the IRS decides that the decisions were incorrect under substantive law. However, because the courts have not decisively concluded which financial consequences a taxpayer faces or escapes by relying on informal IRS guidance, “peril” remains undefined. Does the taxpayer face all three? Does she face the tax deficiency and the associated interest charges but escape the penalty? Does she face the deficiency but escape the penalty and interest? This Comment answers these questions by looking at how the IRS, the courts, and the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) currently define peril and then offers a proposed statutory amendment to redefine peril {{in a way that}} compromises governmental interests of justice and taxpayer concerns of fairness...|$|R

40|$|To reduce future damages on {{buildings}} and infrastructure, and prepare {{society for the}} coming climate challenges, in recent years numerous user guides have been developed. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide the first overview and analysis of, the characteristics of the existing <b>guidance</b> <b>material</b> for the climate adaptation of the built environment in Norway. 84 user guides and web portals are mapped and analysed, focusing on target groups and topics. The results are viewed in relation to qualitative interviews with experts responsible for promoting climate adaptation. A large share of the <b>guidance</b> <b>material</b> communicates climate adaptation at a general level rather than in-depth practical measures. The interviews confirm that there is an overwhelming amount of <b>guidance</b> <b>material,</b> and it is suggested that this may cause confusion and uncertainty among users. The study and its findings are placed within a context of the climate services literature, and ‘‘user guides” are understood as a type of ‘‘climate services product”. A main conclusion is that the abundance of user guides does not automatically lead to better climate adaptation. Too few user guides for climate adaptation sufficiently secure easily accessible information on practical measures. The guides are not broadly utilised, the language and length of the texts are sometimes problematic, and the target groups are often wide or not specified. The results presented may be used in order to develop improved user guides for climate adaptation in societies with similar climate and societal challenges to those in Norway...|$|E
