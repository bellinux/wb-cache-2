5000|$|The {{first major}} {{partnership}} event between Iowa and Kosovo involved the Iowan National Guard’s Regional Training Institute {{spending more than}} two weeks in Kosovo teaching the first Kosovo Security Force Senior Noncommissioned Officer Course. “This course was in development when the NCO leadership of Iowa visited Kosovo in September,” Army CSM Rachel Fails said. “So, it did a couple things for us besides give us, the state partner, information and knowledge of the KSF.

50|$|Iota Pegasi A is a yellowish-white star {{somewhat}} {{brighter than}} the sun. It and the dimmer Iota Pegasi B orbit {{each other with a}} period of about 10 days. In about <b>four</b> billion <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> component A will evolve off the main sequence into a giant. In the process it will overflow its Roche lobe and begin to transfer mass onto the secondary. This may cause the secondary to acquire enough mass to become the primary component. After both stars have passed through the giant star stage, the end result will be a pair of co-orbiting white dwarfs in about eight billion years.|$|R
5000|$|In billion-year timescales, it is {{predicted}} that plant, and therefore animal, life on land will die off altogether, since {{by that time}} {{most of the remaining}} carbon in the atmosphere will be sequestered underground, and natural releases of [...] by radioactivity-driven tectonic activity will have continued to slow down. The loss of plant life would also result in the eventual loss of oxygen. Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of [...] of a few parts per million and so the last life forms would probably disappear finally due to the rising temperatures and loss of the atmosphere when the sun becomes a red giant some <b>four</b> billion <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b>|$|R

60|$|The young lad, his heir, {{was with}} the prince; also, the lad's sister, a wee brown sprite, very pretty, very serious, very winning, delicately moulded, costumed like the daintiest butterfly, a dear little fairyland princess, gravely willing to be {{friendly}} with the strangers, but in the beginning preferring to hold her father's hand until she could take stock of them and determine how far {{they were to be}} trusted. She must have been eight years old; so in the natural (Indian) order of things she would be a bride in three or <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> and then this free contact with the sun and the air and the other belongings of out-door nature and comradeship with visiting male folk would end, and she would shut herself up in the zenana for life, like her mother, and by inherited habit of mind would be happy in that seclusion and not look upon it as an irksome restraint and a weary captivity.|$|E

500|$|In {{about one}} billion years, the solar {{luminosity}} will be 10% higher than at present. This {{will cause the}} atmosphere to become a [...] "moist greenhouse", resulting in a runaway evaporation of the oceans. As a likely consequence, plate tectonics will come to an end, and with them the entire carbon cycle. Following this event, in about 2−3 billion years, the planet's magnetic dynamo may cease, causing the magnetosphere to decay and leading to an accelerated loss of volatiles from the outer atmosphere. <b>Four</b> billion <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> {{the increase in the}} Earth's surface temperature will cause a runaway greenhouse effect, heating the surface enough to melt it. By that point, all life on the Earth will be extinct. The most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the Sun in about 7.5billion years, after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded beyond the planet's current orbit.|$|R
50|$|Describing {{the role}} of an artistic directer, she has said, “An artistic {{director}} basically does two things.
