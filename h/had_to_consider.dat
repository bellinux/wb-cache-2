5|$|On 22 June, Germany {{launched}} Operation Barbarossa {{the invasion}} of the Soviet Union; this attack all but removed the German threat to the United Kingdom. The British still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the threat of an invasion, due the possibility that the Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught, after which Germany could easily transfer troops back to the west. With the arrival of winter in late 1941, the threat of invasion subsided. This, coupled with the production of new equipment for the British army, allowed the War Office to begin steps to better balance the army, due to the large number of infantry units formed during the preceding year and a half; as part of this reform, the County Divisions were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Allan Paul Bakke (born 1940), a 35-year-old white male, {{applied to}} twelve medical schools in 1973. He {{had been a}} National Merit Scholar at Coral Gables Senior High School, in Florida. He was {{accepted}} as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota, deferring tuition costs by joining Naval ROTC. He graduated with a grade-point average (GPA) of 3.51. In order to fulfill his ROTC requirements, he joined the Marine Corps and served four years, including a seven-month {{tour of duty in}} Vietnam as a commanding officer of an anti-aircraft battery. In 1967, having achieved the rank of captain, he was granted an honorable discharge. Bakke then worked as an engineer at NASA. He stated that his interest in medicine started in Vietnam, and increased at NASA, as he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the problems of space flight and the human body there. But twelve medical schools rejected his application for admission.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, {{challenged}} {{the jurisdiction of the}} High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty or whether it was advisable. Thus, the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a statement of opinion.|$|E
5|$|On 21 September 2005 in the League Cup second round, Rehman scored {{his only}} goal for Fulham, opening a 5–4 extra-time win over Lincoln City at Craven Cottage by heading in Heiðar Helguson's cross. In January 2006 he signed for Championship club Norwich City on loan {{for the rest}} of the season as {{defensive}} cover for the club. He made five starts for them. Having made 30 appearances in all competitions for Fulham, 26 from the starting line-up and four as a substitute, Rehman <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> his options if he was to get regular football. Although he had two years remaining on his contract, he wanted to play regular first team football, and as a result, he decided to spend the next two seasons getting as much experience as possible.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June, Germany {{launched}} a massive attack upon the Soviet Union; this attack all but removed {{the threat of}} a German invasion of the United Kingdom. However, the British still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> {{the threat of a}} German invasion due the possibility that the Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught and the ease in which Germany could transfer troops back to the west. In late 1941, the arrival of autumn and winter weather meant that the threat of invasion subsided. This, coupled with the production of new equipment for the British army, allowed the War Office to begin steps to better balance the army due to the large number of infantry units formed during the preceding year and a half. As part of this reform, the County Divisions were disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Sonic Team decided {{early on}} in the {{development}} process {{to reduce the number of}} characters present in the game, as well as to make Sonic the only playable character; this decision was taken to get more quality out of fewer characters. While it felt that these ideas combined with traditional Sonic gameplay was a good beginning, it also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born, in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story. Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term Sonic fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.|$|E
5|$|Steins;Gate {{was created}} at the {{animation}} studio White Fox, and {{was produced by}} Mika Nomura and Yoshinao Doi, directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Satō, and written by Jukki Hanada, with Kyuuta Sakai serving as character designer and chief animation director. While Takeshi Abo, the composer for the Science Adventure games, only had a small role in the previous anime adaptation of the series, he was appointed to compose for the Steins;Gate anime together with his coworker Jun Murakami. Abo composed new music, and made use of the same atmosphere and musical worldview as when he composed for the Steins;Gate game, but also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> that the music had to be synchronized with the motions of the anime; {{this was a very}} different way of working than the one he uses when composing for games.|$|E
5|$|The Generalplan Ost ("General Plan for the East") {{called for}} deporting the {{population}} of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered. To determine who should be killed, Himmler created the Volksliste, a system of classification of people deemed to be of German blood. He ordered that those of Germanic descent who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away or be assigned to forced labour. The plan also included the kidnapping of children deemed to have Aryan-Nordic traits, who were presumed to be of German descent. The goal was to implement Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when the invasion failed Hitler <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> other options. One suggestion was a mass forced deportation of Jews to Poland, Palestine or Madagascar.|$|E

25|$|The Court <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> {{whether the}} 1919 California Red Flag Law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The California legislature repealed the law in 1933.|$|E
25|$|Exclusive {{occupation}} – Also {{a matter}} of fact, although legal title will often play a part. The courts have laid down that where there are competing occupations, the facts must be considered to establish where paramount control lies.

25|$|Vellama {{appealed the}} High Court's {{decision}} to the Court of Appeal. Before the High Court, Vellama's standing {{to bring the}} suit was not disputed. However, during the Court of Appeal hearing, the Attorney-General contended that she no longer possessed standing as the by-election in Hougang SMC had been held. Accordingly, the Court <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> whether standing {{should be regarded as}} having crystallized at the point the proceedings were initiated, or treated as an ongoing issue to be determined at every stage of the proceedings.|$|E

25|$|Women put women's {{suffrage}} on Iowa's agenda, {{particularly the}} Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In {{keeping with the}} general reform mood of the latter 1860s and 1870s, the issue first received serious consideration when both houses of the General Assembly passed a women's suffrage amendment in 1870. Two years later, however, when the legislature <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the amendment again {{before it could be}} submitted to the general electorate, interest had waned, opposition had developed, and the amendment was defeated. Finally, in 1920, Iowa got woman suffrage {{with the rest of the}} country.|$|E

25|$|Peter H. Russell, a {{professor}} emeritus {{of political science at}} the University of Toronto, suggested that if Harper had sought a dissolution, the governor general would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> carefully the reasonableness of the request. In Russell's view, the viceroy's primary concern is to protect parliamentary democracy and a dissolution of parliament would have necessitated an election only two months after the preceding one; repeated short term elections are not healthy for the system. In such a case, with a reasonably viable coalition available, Jean might then refuse Harper's advice to dissolve parliament (forcing him to resign under constitutional precedent), and invite Dion to form a government.|$|E
