40|$|AbstractTransglutaminase (TGase) from Streptomyces mobaraensis is an <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzyme</b> that cross-links {{proteins}} to {{high molecular}} weight aggregates. Screening for intrinsic substrates now revealed the dual Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor-like inhibitor Streptomyces subtilisin and transglutaminase activating metalloprotease (TAMEP) inhibitor (SSTI), equally directed against subtilisin and the TGase activating metalloprotease TAMEP, is both a glutamine and a lysine donor protein. Reactivity of glutamines is lost during culture, most likely by TGase mediated deamidation, and, accordingly, cross-linking only occurred if SSTI from early cultures was used. Interestingly, release of buried endo-glutamines by the lipoamino acid N-lauroylsarcosine could restore SSTI reactivity. Formation of lipoamino acids by Streptomycetes suggests such compounds could also modulate in vivo TGase mediated SSTI cross-linking...|$|E

The use of microorganisms (bioremediation) and plants (phytoremediation) to remediate polluted environments is a promising and growing area of environmental biotechnology.

This study {{presents the results of}} biochemical tests carried out in wash-water (biomass) of a Biodrof 1 -type biofilter. These tests deal with the measurement of hydrolase, dehydrogenase (DHA) and total polysaccharides (TP). The wash-water analyses showed ratios of 41 % total polysaccharides over VSS (w/w) during the cold period, corresponding to influent temperatures of 7. 5 – 13. 58 C. During the warmer period (15. 0 – 18. 08 C), this ratio is 26 %. Observations of the biomass show an abundance of fixed ciliated protozoans during the cold period, being replaced by a bacterial and fungal biofilm during the warmer period. Moreover, during the cold period, the biomass contains less <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzyme</b> like b-glucosidase type, but the ratio of active biomass measured using the dehydrogenase glucose (DHA) is the same for all temperature ranges measured here. This implies that weak hydrolytic activity, coupled with accumulation of a biofilm and inert particles of the influent encourages a rapid clogging of the biofilter. The loads in CODt and SS as well as the filtration rates have but little eect on the premature clogging of the biofilter under spring conditions. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Maximum OC was recorded in T 4 treatment (42.21 ± 0.55), whereas minimum OC was observed in T 3 (30.44 ± 0.13). As compared to the initial substrates (Table  4), the vermicomposted material showed loss of organic carbon as expected in a composting process (P < 0.01, for all the treatments). Through the muscular action of the earthworm gut, the ingested material gets fragmented and homogenized, and this increases the surface area for further microbial action, whereas the microorganisms within the earthworms' gut degrade the wastes and provide <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzymes</b> that are required for organic waste decomposition. Therefore, the combined action of earthworms and microorganisms causes organic carbon loss from the substrate through respiration (Edwards 1988). However, the difference in OC loss between the treatments {{was related to the}} different mixture of organic combinations in the vermireactors. The mineralization as observed in T 3 could be due to the suitable microbial condition in this treatment as compared to the other treatments.|$|R

For {{ecological}} characterisation of the experimental material, most of these species were {{tested for the ability}} to produce the <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzymes</b> cellulase, pectinase, proteinase and laccase. The mycorrhiza-formers were clearly inferior to the litter-decomposers in this respect, although some deviations were noted. Of the synthetic nitrogen sources investigated, ammonium and asparagine were most readily utilised by the fungi, followed by glycine, acetamide, nitrate and glucosamine in that order. Unusable sources were diethylamine, proline and pyridine. Nitrite had a toxic effect throughout. Litter decomposers tended to be non-nitrate users but could more easily utilise amide nitrogen than mycorrhiza-formers. The result from an experimental series having raw humus as the only nitrogen source indicated that the mycorrhiza-forming fungi, like most of the litter-decomposers, could utilise to a very limited extent or not at all the nitrogen bound in the humus.

These effects may be especially important when the herbivore is an introduced species.

Using time since fire as a co-variate and herbivore exclosures, paired with areas outside of the exclosures, we hypothesized that reductions in plant biomass due to herbivory would reduce organic inputs to soils and impact soil microbial activities and nutrient storage. We found three major patterns: (1) when elk were excluded, surface mineral soils had higher soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), microbial N pools, and increased <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity of a C-acquiring enzyme across a gradient of time since fire. (2) When introduced elk are present, the activity of some extracellular enzymes as well as NO 3 −availability are enhanced in the soil but the post-fire patterns described above with respect to nutrient accrual over time are delayed. (3) Herbivory by an introduced ungulate upsets the trajectory of ecosystem “recovery” after wildfire and delays soil C and N dynamics by an estimated 14. 5 – 21 years, respectively.

40|$|Salinization of soil is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} pressing environmental challenges to resolve for the next century. We here conduct a synoptic review of the available research on how salt affects decomposer microbial communities and carbon (C) cycling in soil. After summarizing known physiological responses of microorganisms to salinity, we provide a brief overview and qualification of a selection of widely applied methods to assess microorganisms in soil to date. The dominant approaches to characterise microbial responses to salt exposure have so far been microbial biomass and respiration measurements. We compile datasets from a selection of studies and find that (1) microbial biomass-carbon (C) per C held in soil organic matter shows no consistent pattern with long-term (field gradients) or short-term (laboratory additions) soil salinity level, and (2) respiration per soil organic C is substantially inhibited by higher salt concentrations in soil, and consistently so for both short-term and long-term salinity levels. Patterns that emerge from <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzyme</b> assessments are more difficult to generalize, and appear to vary with the enzyme studied, and its context. Growth based assessments of microbial responses to salinization are largely lacking. Relating the established responses of microbial respiration to that of growth could provide an estimate for how the microbial C-use efficiency would be affected by salt exposure. This would be a valuable predictor for changes in soil C sequestration. A few studies have investigated the connection between microbial tolerance to salt and the soil salinity levels, but so far results have not been conclusive. We predict that more systematic inquiries including comprehensive ranges of soil salinities will substantiate a connection between soil salinity and microbial tolerance to salt. This would confirm that salinity has a direct effect on the composition of microbial communities. While salt has been identified {{as one of the}} most powerful environmental factors to structure microbial communities in aquatic environments, no up-to-date sequence based assessments currently exist from soil. Filling this gap should be a research priority. Moreover, linking sequencing based assessments of microbial communities to their tolerance to salt would have the potential to yield biomarker sets of microbial sequences. This could provide predictive power for, e. g., the sensitivity of agricultural soils to salt exposure, and, as such, a useful tool for soil resource management. We conclude that salt exposure has a powerful influence on soil microbial communities and processes. In addition to being one of the most pressing agricultural problems to solve, this influence could also be used as an experimental probe to better understand how microorganisms control the biogeochemistry in soil.

The {{objective of this}} paper was to investigate the role of <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzymes</b> in cycling of nitrogen (N) in aquatic systems. It appears that N in estuaries, salt marshes, etc., does not stay long enough to be available for uptake, thus, creating N limited conditions. This study showed that indigenous extra-cellular nitrate reductase along with others involved in N transformations in the waters/sediments of estuarine systems can cause complete removal of NH 4 + and NO 3 – from the waters and available NH 4 + and NO 3 – from the sediments. These results indicate that due to high extra-cellular nitrate reductase and other enzymes associated with N transformations in sediments/waters, substantial amounts of NH 4 + and NO 3 – can be quickly lost from the systems as N 2 O and/or nitric oxide (NO), in turn, creating N limited conditions in estuarine systems. Such high activities of indigenous nitrate reductase and others are useful in removing readily bioavailable N from the systems, thereby avoidance of eutrophic conditions.

Here we report {{the effect of the}} over-expression of maize (Zea mays) chloroplast TGase in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Petit Havana) chloroplasts. The transglutaminase activity in over-expressers was increased 4 times in comparison to the wild-type tobacco plants, which in turn increased the thylakoid associated polyamines about 90 %. Functional comparison between Wt tobacco and tgz over-expressers is shown in terms of fast fluorescence induction kinetics, non-photochemical quenching of the singlet excited state of chlorophyll a and antenna heterogeneity of PSII. Both in vivo probing and electron microscopy studies verified thylakoid remodeling. PSII antenna heterogeneity in vivo changes in the over-expressers to a great extent, with an increase of the centers located in grana-appressed regions (PSIIα) at the expense of centers located mainly in stroma thylakoids (PSIIβ). A major increase in the granum size (i. e. increase of the number of stacked layers) with a concomitant decrease of stroma thylakoids is reported for the TGase over-expressers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Leaf litter inputs {{have been}} {{excluded}} from 1 of 2 Ist-order streams at Coweeta Hydro-logic Laboratory, North Carolina since August 1993 {{to examine the}} bottom-up effects of resource reduction on stream ecosystems. As {{part of the larger}} project, we studied the effect of litter exclusion on the extracellular enzyme activity and fungal biomass of wood biofilms in the presence and absence of leaf litter. Replicate strips of wood veneer were incubated in both streams for 28, 58, and 86 d. Ergosterol content (to estimate fungal biomass), the activity of 5 lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, acid phosphatase activity, breakdown rates, and % organic matter were determined when the veneer strips were collected. Hydrolytic enzyme activity and wood breakdown rates in the litter-excluded stream were significantly higher than in the reference stream. Enzyme activities of all hydrolytic enzymes were highly correlated with each other. Measurement of relative activities of selected <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzymes</b> comparing carbon and nutrient acquisition suggested nutrient limitation of hetero-trophic biofilms in the reference stream. Microbial activity of wood biofilms was significantly altered by the exclusion of leaf litter, and hydrolytic enzyme activity, as an indicator of carbon cycling, was higher on wood in streams without leaf litter. Key words: wood biofilm, extracellular enzyme activity, fungal biomass, ergosterol, decomposition, leaf litter, nutrient, nitrogen, phosphorus, stream. Wood has been considered an important structural component in streams (e. g., Harmon et al. 1986), but recent research has also dem-onstrated the importance of wood as a substrat...|$|R
40|$|Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1. 10. 3. 2) {{are blue}} multicopper oxidases, catalyzing the {{oxidation}} of {{an array of}} aromatic substrates concomitantly with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Most of the known laccases have fungal or plant origins, although few laccases have been also identified in bacteria and insects. Most of the fungal laccases reported thus far are <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzymes,</b> whereas only few enzymes from fruiting bodies have been described so far. Multiple isoforms of laccases are usually secreted by each fungus depending on species and environmental conditions. As a fact, a laccase gene family has been demonstrated in the white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus. This work allowed identification and characterization of the first laccase isoenzyme from the fruiting body of P. ostreatus. Discovery through mass spectrometry of LACC 12 proves {{the expression of a}} functional protein by the related deduced encoding transcript. The topology of phylogenetic tree of fungal laccases proves that LACC 12 falls in cluster with the members of P. ostreatus LACC 10 (=POXC) subfamily, although lacc 12 deduced intron-exon structure differs from that of the subfamily members and the related locus is located in a different chromosome. Results show that the evolutionary pattern of lacc 12 and that of the other laccase isozyme genes may have evolved independently, possibly through duplication-divergence events. The reported data add a new piece to the knowledge about P. ostreatus laccase multigene family and shed light on the role(s) played by individual laccase isoforms in P. ostreatus...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{work was}} {{conducted}} to study the ability of bacterial and fungal isolates from keratitis cases in Upper Egypt to produce enzymes, toxins, and to test the isolated fungal species sensitivity to some therapeutic agents. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifteen patients clinically diagnosed to have microbial keratitis were investigated. From these cases, 37 bacterial isolates and 25 fungal isolates were screened {{for their ability to}} produce <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzymes</b> in solid media. In addition, the ability of fungal isolates to produce mycotoxins and their sensitivity to 4 antifungal agents were tested. Results: Protease, lipase, hemolysins, urease, phosphatase, and catalase were detected respectively in 48. 65 %, 37. 84 %, 59. 46 %, 43. 24 %, 67. 57 %, and 100 % out of 37 bacterial isolates tested. Out of 25 fungal isolates tested during the present study, 80 % were positive for protease, 84 % for lipase and urease, 28 % for blood hemolysis, and 100 % for phosphatase and catalase enzymes. Thirteen fungal isolates were able to produce detectable amounts of 7 mycotoxins in culture medium (aflatoxins (B 1, B 2, G 1, and G 2), sterigmatocystin, fumagillin, diacetoxyscirpenol, zearalenone, T- 2 toxin, and trichodermin). Among the antifungal agents tested in this study, terbinafine showed the highest effect against most isolates in vitro. Conclusion: In conclusion, the ability of bacterial and fungal isolates to produce extracellular enzymes and toxins may be aid in the invasion and destruction of eye tissues, which, in turn, lead to vision loss...|$|R

Transglutaminases (TGases, EC 2. 3. 2. 13) are intra- and <b>extra-cellular</b> <b>enzymes</b> that {{catalyze}} {{post-translational modification}} of proteins by establishing -(-glutamyl) links and covalent conjugation of polyamines [1]. In chloroplast {{it is well}} established that TGases specifically polyaminylate light harvesting antenna proteins of Photosystem II (LHCII, CP 29, CP 26, CP 24) and therefore a role of this enzyme in photosynthesis has been hypothesized. However, the role of TGases in chloroplast is not yet fully understood. Here we report {{the effect of the}} over-expression of maize (Zea mays) chloroplast TGase (the first cloned plant TGase) [2, 3] in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) chloroplasts [4, 5]. The TGase activity in over-expressers was increased 4 times in comparison to the wild type tobacco plants, which in turn increased the polyamines associated to antenna proteins about 80 %. Functional comparison between Wt tobacco and tgz over-expressers in terms of fast fluorescence induction kinetics, non photochemical quenching of the singlet excited state of chlorophyll a, antenna heterogeneity of PSII and other related factors is shown. Both in vivo probing and electron microscopy studies verified thylakoid remodeling for the TGase over-expressers.

The bacterium {{was identified as a}} new strain of Bacillus pumilus BK 2 producing an extra-cellular endo-pectate lyase PL (EC 4. 2. 2. 2). PL was purified to homogeneity in three steps and has a molecular mass of 37. 3 ± 4. 8 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and an isoelectric point of pH 8. 5. Peptide mass mapping by nano-LC–MS of PL revealed 15 % homology with a pectate lyase from Bacillus sp. The pectate lyase exhibited optimum activity at pH 8. 5 and around 70 °C in Tris/HCl buffer. It showed a half-life at 30 °C of more than 75 h. Stability decreased with increasing temperature, extremely over 60 °C. The enzyme did not require Ca 2 + ions for activity, and was strongly inhibited by EDTA and Co 2 +. PL was active on polygalacturonic acid and esterified pectin, but the affinity showed a maximum for intermediate esterified pectins and decreased over a value of 50 % of esterification. The best substrate was 29. 5 % methylated pectin. PL cleaved polygalacturonic acid via a β-elimination mechanism as shown by NMR analysis. PL released unsaturated tetragalacturonic acid from citrus pectin and polygalacturonic acid, but did not show any side activities on other hemicelluloses. On polygalacturonic acid PL showed a Km of 0. 24 g l− 1 and a vmax of 0. 72 g l− 1 min− 1. The applicability of pectate lyase for the bioscouring process was tested on a cotton fabric. Removal of up to 80 % of pectin was proven by means of ruthenium red dyeing and HPAEC (65 %). Structural contact angle measurements clearly indicated the increased hydrophilicity of enzyme treated fabrics...|$|R

These enzymes account for 40 % of the total enzyme sales worldwide and this trend {{is expected to increase}} in the near future. This has led to increasing attention towards the exploitation of potent microbial strains for the production of alkaline proteases from an industrial point of view (Ellaiah et al. 2002). Although a wide range of microorganisms are known to produce proteases, {{a large proportion of the}} commercially available form of these enzymes is derived from Bacillus strains because of their ability to secrete large amounts of alkaline proteases having significant proteolytic activity and stability at considerably higher pH and temperatures (Jacobs 1995; Yang et al. 2000).|$|R
