When the deformations of an elastic continuum are expanded in terms of the free-free modes on an unconstrained system, the rigid body modes are found to be fixed in a reference frame called the Tisserand frame, with respect to which the relative momentum is zero. This result also guarantees the independence of small variations of frame motions and coordinates for all modes with nonzero natural frequencies, a condition which can greatly simplify the formulation of equations of motion.

40|$|In this study, a {{regional}} scale gravity data set has been inverted to infer the structure (topography) {{of the top}} of the basement underlying sub-horizontal strata. We apply our method to this real data set for further proof of concept, validation and benchmarking against results from an earlier forward modelling done elsewhere. Our aim is to carry out implicit structural inversion, i. e., to obtain a geologically reasonable model, without specifically solving for structure. The 2. 5 D volume of interest is parametrized with homogeneous horizontal prisms and a two-lithology medium is assumed. A possible regional linear trend and a general <b>floating</b> <b>reference</b> are also inverted for. Using a gridded parametrization, linear programming is used to minimize the L 1 -norm of the data misfit, relative to a <b>floating</b> <b>reference.</b> Given a known density contrast between the lithologies, an inversion using linear programming has the intrinsic advantage that a relatively sharp image of the sub-surface is retrieved instead of a smooth one. The model recovered is almost bi-modal and its general features seem to be robust with respect to several parametrization scenarios investigated. The <b>floating</b> <b>reference</b> and a linear trend in the data were also retrieved simultaneously. The inversion results, indicating two depressions in the basement, are robust and agree with those obtained earlier based upon detailed 2 D forward modelling using many narrow, near-vertical prisms. © 2010 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers...|$|E

In this paper, the non-linear elastic formulation, where the higher-order terms {{will be included in}} the strain energy expression to consider the bending-stretching coupling effect, is applied in the <b>floating</b> frame of <b>reference.</b> In this case, the complexity of the formulation diminishes the advantages of the <b>floating</b> frame of <b>reference</b> formulation because of the relatively high computational cost.

It is the key to measure the <b>floating</b> <b>reference</b> point (FRP) precisely for the application of FRT.  Monte Carlo (MC) simulation has been introduced to quantitatively investigate the effects of positioning errors and light source drifts on measuring FRP. In this article, thinning and calculating method (TCM) is proposed to quantify the positioning error. Meanwhile, the normalization process (NP) is developed to significantly reduce the error induced by light source drift. The results according to TCM show that 7 μm deviations in positioning can generate about 10. 63 % relative error in FRP. It is more noticeable that 1 % fluctuation in light source intensity may lead to 12. 21 % relative errors. Gratifyingly, the proposed NP model can effectively reduce the error caused by light source drift. Therefore, the measurement system for FRPs must meet that the positioning error is less than 7 μm, and the light source drift is kept within 1 %.

40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>reference</b> frames were {{investigated}} {{in order to}} allow first order vibration analysis in the presence of large system rotations. When the deformations of an elastic continuum are expanded in terms of the free-free modes of an unconstrained system, the rigid body modes are found to be fixed relative to the Tisserand frame, with respect to which the relative momentum is zero. The proof presented for this is based on the orthogonality condition for modes with distinct natural frequencies. This result also guarantees the independence of coordinates for all modes with nonzero natural frequencies.

Finite element equations of motion are derived for a completely flexible spacecraft with momentum exchange controllers, using a Modified Tisserand Frame.

Then, we propose two hierarchical multi-resolution EMD-based algorithms for robust registration of images in the presence of spatially varying noise. One algorithm (LR-EMD) is based on registering EMD feature-maps of both <b>floating</b> and <b>reference</b> images in various resolution levels.

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} a detailed comparison between two optimization methods {{that are used}} to perform the structural optimization of flexible components within a multibody system (MBS) simulation. The dynamic analysis of flexible MBS is based on a nonlinear finite element formulation. The first method is a weakly coupled method, which reformulates the dynamic response optimization problem in a two-level approach. First, a rigid or flexible MBS simulation is performed, and second, each component is optimized independently using a quasi-static approach in which a series of equivalent static load (ESL) cases obtained from the MBS simulation are applied to the respective components. The second method, the fully coupled method, performs the dynamic response optimization using the time response obtained directly from the flexible MBS simulation. Here, an original procedure is proposed to evaluate the ESL from a nonlinear finite element simulation, contrasting with the <b>floating</b> <b>reference</b> frame formulation exploited in the standard ESL method. Several numerical examples are provided to support our position. It is shown that the fully coupled method is more general and accommodates all types of constraints at the price of a more complex optimization process. Peer reviewe...|$|E

We sought to elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by using continuous echocardiographic imaging of the heart from a constant transesophageal location in 21 patients undergoing their first cardiac operation. Quantitative global and regional functional analyses were performed in each patient at baseline (stage 1), after median sternotomy (stage 2), after sternal retraction (stage 3), after pericardiotomy (stage 4), after completion of cardiopulmonary bypass (stage 5), and after chest closure (stage 6). During the first four surgical stages, mean left ventricular fractional shortening varied little among regions with a fixed reference system (maximum range, 31. 6 - 39. 2 %; p=NS) but changed dramatically after the discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass (stage 5). The apparent medial hypoki-nesis that was observed (4. 9 ± 4. 7 % [SD]) was accompanied by lateral hyperkinesis (65. 2 ± 4. 1 %, p<O. OOOl).

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{our group}} {{has worked on}} {{real-time}} methods for the dynamics of flexible and rigid multi-body systems. In order to develop such methods, attention must be paid, in an integrated way, to modeling issues, formulation of the equations of motion, nu-merical integration procedures, and implementation techniques. Achievement of real-time performance in flexible multi-body systems on conventional PC platforms is commonly more challenging than in the rigid case. It can be stated that most methods developed for rigid multi-body systems can be extended to consider flexible members. Consequently, conclusions and recommendations drawn when studying rigid mechanisms {{in order to achieve}} real-time performance can be extrapolated to the flexible case. However, some additional “degrees-of-freedom ” arise when simulating the motion of flexible multi-body systems, which must be managed by the analyst. They are the choice, for each of the flexible bodies, of the accuracy level to be applied for the description of the corresponding flexible component. This is some-thing affecting the modeling stage, and occurs no matter the selected modeling technique is.

The two leading approaches are usually based on the Newton-Euler (NE) formulation and Euler-Lagrange (EL) formulation. Both of them present advantages and drawbacks. The ideal approach for describing multi-body systems can be represented by a combination between the NE and EL formulations. This {{can be obtained by}} considering the NE formulation for assembling the equation of motion and then by defining the ODE governing equations {{with the use of a}} minimum set of variables.

Accurate modeling of the leaf springs is necessary in evaluating ride comfort, braking performance, vibration characteristics, and stability. In order to accurately model the deformations and vibrations of the leaf springs, nonlinear finite-element procedures, which account for the dynamic coupling between different modes of displacement, are employed. Two finite-element methods that {{take into account the}} effect of the distributed inertia and elasticity are discussed in this investigation to model the dynamics of leaf springs. The first is based on a <b>floating</b> frame of <b>reference</b> formulation, while the second is an absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The <b>floating</b> frame of <b>reference</b> formulation allows for using a reduced-order model by employing component mode synthesis techniques, while the absolute nodal coordinate formulation enables more detailed finite-element models for the large deformation of very flexible leaf springs.

Independent measurement of regional myocardial thickening was obtained using epicardial pulsed Doppler probes and served as a standard for comparison. Radial shortening fraction was derived from two-dimensional short-axis views along 12 equidistant radii. Six reference systems from the epicardial and endocardial centers of geometry (centroids) in a fixed or a floating position were explored. In the ischemic zone, percent thickening fraction averaged 22 ± 5 % at baseline, decreased to − 4 ± 4 % during occlusion and gradually returned to baseline values after reperfusion. Percent change in radial shortening correlated significant by with percent change in thickening fraction in the ischemic zone. The worst correlation was seen with the Heating endocardial centroid (τ = 0. 68), and the best was observed with the epicardial Heating reference (r = 0. 91). Moreover, the epicardial <b>floating</b> <b>reference</b> provided narrower 95 % confidence limits of radial shortening and less heterogeneity among radii than did fixed reference systems.

There {{is a need for}} small aerial robots to conduct a variety of civilian and military missions. Efforts to model the flight physics of these vehicles have been complicated by a number of factors, including nonlinear elastic effects, multi-body characteristics, unsteady aerodynamics, and the strong coupling between fluid and structural dynamics. Experimental verification is crucial in order to achieve accurate simulation capabilities. A multi-disciplinary approach to modeling requires the use of tools representing individual disciplines, which must be combined to form a comprehensive model. In the framework of this research a five body flexible vehicle dynamics model and a novel experimental verification methodology is presented. For the model development and verification of the modeling assumptions, a data set providing refined wing kinematics of a test ornithopter research platform in free flight was used. Wing kinematics for the verification was obtained using a Vicon motion capture system.

In the FFRF, the component mode synthesis method is utilized {{in order to reduce}} the number of unknowns in a complex model. Some of the drawbacks of this methodology are the large number of static modes in the case of complex coupling of bodies, e. g. in contact problems or in advanced joint models, and the large number of dynamic modes for the case of high frequency analysis, e. g. for the analysis of the acoustic behavior of a car body.

Wave energy is a renewable energy type that {{is becoming more and}} more important. Several systems have been invented, among them point absorber systems which are wave energy converters consisting of small (floating) bodies oscillating with one or more degrees of freedom. They can either operate with respect to a fixed reference, or with respect to a <b>floating</b> <b>reference.</b> The latter principle has been adopted in a novel way in the wave energy converter that is studied in the SEEWEC project, where multiple point absorbers are combined in a floating, moored platform [Seewec web site]. The performance of such a heaving point absorber in a floating platform is analysed in a linear way. The boundary element method (BEM) package Wamit [Wamit manual] is used to determine the hydrodynamic behaviour of both the platform and the oscillating point absorbers. The equation of motion of the point absorber is solved, taking into account the Response Amplitude Operators (RAO) of the platform, calculated by Wamit. Different buoy geometries are evaluated to obtain the ideal values of size, draft and shape with regard to power absorption for different sea states. The natural frequency of the point absorber is changed by adding supplementary mass in order to tune the point absorber to the wave climate (Vantorre, Banasiak et al.). In waves characterized by Hs = 1 - 2 m, which have a high occurrence frequency on the Belgian Continental Shelf, a point absorber with a diameter of 4 m can absorb about 20 to 30 kW. Two different restrictions are applied to the heave motion of the point absorber.

Short axis cross sectional images of the left ventricle at the levels of the mitral valve, papillary muscle, and apex were recorded by a phased array sector scanner in 30 patients with healed myocardial infarction and 15 normal controls. Endocardial and epicardial short axis images of the left ventricle were transferred from video tape to a minicomputer through the interface circuits, then digitised and processed automatically by a minicomputer. Automatic edge detection of the endocardial and epicardial wall was performed by applying sequential steps including smoothing, second derivative technique, dynamic thresholding, and approximation of boundaries by a spline curve. To quantify regional wall motion, the short axis cross sectional left ventricular wall of each level was divided into eight octants with eight axes at 45 degrees angles from the initial standard axis which was constructed from the geometric centre of the end diastolic left ventricular cavity to the posterior end of {{the right side of}} the interventricular septum. Segmental hemiaxis, segmental area, segmental wall thickness, and those changes during cardiac cycle were measured and calculated in each segment automatically by a computer. Regional contractility of the left ventricle was evaluated by percentage systolic changes of the segmental hemiaxis, area, and wall thickness. These values were significantly reduced in the infarcted left ventricular wall as defined by left ventriculography and electrocardiography. Moreover, percentage hemiaxis changes obtained by quantitative left ventriculography described by Herman and colleagues correlated well with those using our analytical method of cross sectional echocardiography in the corresponding segments. The geometric centre of the left ventricular cavity determined by the computer moved slightly towards the anterior wall during systole in normal subjects, possibly reflecting the anterior swinging motion of the heart. The geometric centre of the left ventricular cavity in myocardial infarction moved towards the infarcted wall, showing that the <b>floating</b> <b>reference</b> system was inferior to the fixed reference system for the quantification of abnormal wall motion in myocardial infarction.

It will lay out how the evolution of mild symptoms into hard realities -such as the exponential increase in droughts, hurricanes and other natural disasters-drove these polarized opinions to a unified global belief that radical measures in energy policy needed to be taken. The accounts will continue by describing how the global discussion then moved to the implementation of sustainable energy alternatives. And they might explain how this drove the competition between solar and wind energy industries, which in turn pushed the development of their technologies. Even though dynamic substructuring might not star in those passages, I believe it will contribute to the technological evolution needed to sustainably meet tomorrow’s energy demand. This includes the field of wind turbines. Dynamic substructuring is in essence a linear structural dynamic analysis methodology that models a structure by the assembly of a set of substructure models, hence segmenting the normal linear model. By the implementation of this approach, components can be validated individually and reduction techniques can be tailored to the characteristics of and interaction between the components. Moreover, processing costs can be reduced via parallel computing and the ability to interchange component models without having to re-build the entire dynamic structural model. However, when operational analyses such as time integration are required and the model or its components are expected to undergo large rotations or displacements, the dynamic substructuring methodology needs to be integrated into a formulation that includes rotational effects, such as the floating frame of reference formulation (FFR). This formulation places the linear structure model into a <b>floating</b> <b>reference</b> frame. The body’s deformations within this frame remain linear, but the frame’s kinematic description is highly non-linear. This often leads to major reductions in processing efficiency, diminishing the competitive advantage that dynamic substructuring offers in comparison to other formulations. In the case of the operational analyses of multi-megawatt wind turbines on the other hand, rotation forces on the important turbine sub-systems tend to be relatively low. Hence the engineer’s gut feel leads to the belief that the floating frame of reference formulation can be significantly simplified. By (partly) linearizing the terms in this formulation, processing costs might significantly reduce at the loss of only little accuracy in the analyses. This leads to the main research question of this thesis: To what extent can the rotational effects be simplified for various wind turbine operational analyses without significantly impacting their dynamic characteristics? In order to answer this question, a simple wind turbine dynamic model is constructed in the floating frame of reference formulation. The terms in this formulation are subsequently simplified by various approaches and evaluated in terms of accuracy and processing costs in three different time simulations. This findings of the analysis will indicate which simplification approach will provide accurate results at minimal processing cost. The results indicate that the processing cost of the 2. 3 megawatt turbine model can be reduced to less than one percent with respect to the reference model in steady operation, at negligible accuracy loss. In more transient cases, such as the simulation of startup or (emergency) shut down, the degree of simplification needs to be reduced to maintain the accuracy of the model. this leads to a smaller reduction in processing cost, now to twenty percent in of the original processing costs. The research demonstrates that the simplification of rotational effects in turbine models is feasible and has a significant effect on the processing times of the codes. The thesis hence recommends further development of the simplified FFR formulations. The formulations could be implemented into dynamic substructuring tools, allowing the analysis of operational dynamic interaction of a system’s subcomponents at competitive processing costs. Also, turbines of other sizes could be investigated, possibly leading to a presentation of the simplifications in non-dimensional form. In result, tailored simplifications of rotational effects can be applied to any wind turbine model. From the theoretical perspective the thesis recommends further research into simplifying the FFR formulations using other parametrization techniques, such as Euler parameters and Rodriguez parameters. These might pose new opportunities in terms of processing efficiency. The optimization of dynamic turbine modeling will contribute to speedier design iterations that result in more cost effective turbine designs. With a little bit of luck this industry might consequently turn wind into a leading global supplier of energy. And who knows, the odd history book might mention the contribution of dynamic substructuring to this process.

The requirements for high speed operation has made it necessary to use lightweight multi layered composite bodies in robotic systems and space structure applications. Dynamic modeling and analysis of such systems are particularly important since the effects of body flexibility to the performance {{are likely to be more}} pronounced. The eight-noded isoperimetric quadrilateral element with independent rotational and displacement degrees of freedom is extended to laminated composite elements. The element includes an arbitrary number of bonded layers, each of which may have a different thickness.
