40|$|A {{project to}} allow long term access and physics {{analysis}} of ZEUS data (ZEUSdata preservation) {{has been established}} in collaboration with the DESY-IT group. In the ZEUSapproach the analysis model is based on the Common Ntuple project, under development since 2006. The real data and all presently available Monte Carlo samples are being preserved in a atROOT ntuple format. There is ongoing work to provide the ability to simulate new, additionalMonte Carlo samples also in the future. The validation framework of such a scheme usingvirtualisation techniques is being explored. The goal is to validate the frozen ZEUS softwareagainst future changes in hardware and operating system. A cooperation between ZEUS, DESY-IT and the library was established for <b>document</b> <b>digitisation</b> and long-term preservation ofcollaboration web pages. Part of the ZEUS internal documentation has already been storedwithin the HEP documentation system INSPIRE. Existing digital documentation, needed toperform physics analysis also in the future, is being centralised and completed...|$|E
40|$|Due to storage {{conditions}} and material’s non-planar shape, geometric {{distortion of the}} 2 -D content is widely present in scanned document images. Effective geometric restoration of these distorted document images considerably increases character recognition rate in large-scale digitisation. For large-scale digitisation of historical books, geometric restoration solutions expect to be accurate, generic, robust, unsupervised and reversible. However, most methods in the literature concentrate on improving restoration accuracy for specific distortion effect, but not their applicability in large-scale digitisation. This paper proposes an effective mesh based geometric restoration system, (GRLSD), for large-scale distorted historical <b>document</b> <b>digitisation.</b> In this system, an automatic mesh generation based dewarping tool is proposed to geometrically model and correct arbitrary warping historical documents. An XML based mesh recorder is proposed to record the mesh of distortion information for reversible use. A graphic user interface toolkit is designed to visually display and manually manipulate the mesh for improving geometric restoration accuracy. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed automatic dewarping approach efficiently corrects arbitrarily warped historical documents, with an improved performance over several state-of-the-art geometric restoration methods. By using XML mesh recorder and GUI toolkit, the GRLSD system greatly aids users to flexibly monitor and correct ambiguous points of mesh for the prevention of damaging historical document images without distortions in large-scale digitalisation...|$|E

Much of this store of knowledge has limited accessibility, however, because its content is at best poorly <b>documented.</b> <b>Digitisation</b> provides a means of making historic footage more accessible by allowing moving imagery to be displayed via the Internet.

40|$|The present Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on the {{document}} flow system from conception or admission of documents to the company to their keeping. In particular, the present thesis indicates which documents are passing through the company, who of the employees is working with them, which of the documents are being transformed into a digital medium, which form of document continues to be used within the company (digital or paper format) and which are the benefits of <b>digitisation</b> of <b>documents</b> for the company's employees. In order to provide a comparison, this thesis will describe two companies of different sizes. The introduction explains the terms used in this thesis to which the people can, and often do, attribute other meaning. The following part describes the two observed companies and all the data concerning the documents being used by them which I have already mentioned in this chapter. The final part contains a comparison between the two companies, in particular as regards documents flow and assessment by employees of <b>documents</b> <b>digitisation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Moving image media record much of {{the history}} of the twentieth century, and as such form an {{important}} aspect of our cultural heritage. Although potentially of great importance to both the education and commercial sectors, much of this store of knowledge is not accessible, because its content is not <b>documented.</b> <b>Digitisation</b> is being considered as a means of making historic footage more accessible by allowing moving imagery to be displayed via the Internet. Further, digitisation of still and moving imagery opens the possibility of relieving the time-consuming and expensive process of descriptive cataloguing, by using automated indexing and retrieval techniques, based on the physical attributes present in the imagery, such as colour, texture, shapes, spatial and spatiotemporal distribution. These techniques, developed by the computer science community, are generically known as Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). But will this type of image retrieval answer moving image archive users' information requirements? A project is being undertaken which researches the information needs of users of such archives; one of the objectives of this project is determine whether CBIR techniques can be used to answer these requirements. An analysis of requests for moving image footage received by eleven representative film collections determined that nearly 70...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master’s {{thesis is}} to analyse the {{construction}} of European identity in three ofcontemporary EU initiated projects for the digitisation of collections from museums, archives, andlibraries. The source material consists of the web pages of the projects Minerva, MICHAEL, andEuropeana, {{as well as some}} other policy <b>documents</b> on <b>digitisation</b> and access from EU authorities. Theories on nationalism and construction of heritage are used as an overall context to the problem. After {{a brief description of the}} mentioned projects, the author undertakes an analysis of theways that the concept of ‘European heritage’ is depicted in the source material. The result is thefollowing: normally, the true European heritage is considered being united even though it isdiveded culturally, historically and linguistically. The real European spirit is seen as consisting intolerating and celebrating these internal differences. There is also a discourse on the idealEuropean citizen, who actively strives to enlargen her knowledge on (European) culture andhistory. However, there is also a narrower conception of European heritage, which can be discernedfrom some of the analysed sources. This latter definition of Europeanness, stresses Christianityand a tradition of civilisation, rationalism, and science. The ‘Other’, the non-Europeans, can thusbe interpreted as the negation of these ideals...|$|R
