Endolaryngeally, one discerns between (1) supraglottic, (2) glottis, and (3) subglottic tumors. For examination of endolaryngeal tumor position and extension, the larynx has to be opened through a median vertical dorsal incision.

Postcricoid cancers may extend into the adjacent cervical oesophagus. Piriform sinus cancers may extend cranially into the oropharynx or craniomedially into the supraglottic larynx, thereby crossing the aryepiglottic fold. Issues of special interest are perforation of laryngeal cartilages with extralaryngeal soft tissue spread, endolaryngeal extension of a hypopharyngeal tumor that may involve the tracheal margin and hypopharyngeal cancers growing submucosally into the caudal surgical margin through the postcricoid area.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of Raman spectroscopy applied to the classification of arterial tissue based on a simplified model using basal morphological and biochemical information extracted from the Raman spectra of arteries. The Raman spectrograph uses an 830 -nm diode laser, imaging spectrograph, and a CCD camera. A total of 111 Raman spectra from arterial fragments were used to develop the model, and those spectra were compared to the spectra of collagen, fat cells, smooth muscle cells, calcification, and cholesterol in a linear fit model. Non-atherosclerotic (NA), fatty and fibrous-fatty atherosclerotic plaques (A) and calcified (C) arteries exhibited different spectral signatures related to different morphological structures presented in each tissue type. Discriminant analysis based on Mahalanobis distance was employed to classify the tissue type with respect to the relative intensity of each compound. This model was subsequently tested prospectively in a set of 55 spectra. The simplified diagnostic model showed that cholesterol, collagen, and adipocytes were the tissue constituents that gave the best classification capability and that those changes were correlated to histopathology. The simplified model, using spectra obtained from a few tissue morphological and biochemical constituents, showed feasibility by using a small amount of variables, easily extracted from <b>gross</b> <b>samples.</b> PADCT/FINEPCNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development) [PQ 2 - 305610 / 2008 - 2...|$|R

30|$|However, the {{comparability}} of the country-specific sample {{designs and}} selection procedures in PIAAC is limited. First, there is variation in sampling designs and sampling frames across countries (Mohadjer et al. 2013). On the one hand, {{there is a}} distinction between countries using household samples (e.g., Canada, England, or the United States) and countries using registry-based samples (e.g., Austria, Spain, or Sweden). On the other hand, within the group of countries who use registry-based samples, the sampling frames are sometimes decentralized registers (e.g., in Germany) and sometimes centralized registers (e.g., in Sweden). Second, {{the differences in the}} sampling frame information across PIAAC countries have an impact on both the identification and the classification of migrants. Countries with household samples do not usually have information on migration background (such as citizenship and country of birth) in their <b>gross</b> <b>sample.</b> By contrast, registry countries have access to some migration-related data. However, this information is not harmonized across countries (e.g., country of birth in Sweden, citizenship in Austria and Germany). Beyond that, the coverage of the migrant subpopulation across countries is subject to other moderating factors, such as different fieldwork strategies. These measures include, for instance, the translation of invitation letters (e.g., Germany; Zabal et al. 2014, p. 70), the use of bilingual interviewers (e.g., United States; Hogan et al. 2016, p. 5 – 9) or translators to administer the questionnaire (e.g., Austria; Statistik Austria 2013, p. 31), the translation of questionnaires into the languages of selected migrant groups (e.g., Austria, United States), or even the exclusion of the migrant population altogether (e.g., Japan; OECD 2016, p. 52). Finally, the largest obstacle is the restricted access to the data required for nonresponse analyses, such as <b>gross</b> <b>sample</b> and outcome information (e.g., disposition codes). Thus, our analyses will focus on German PIAAC data only, as Germany is currently one of the EU countries most affected by the flow of refugees and is in need of more information in order to make decisions about future integration measures.|$|E

All four soils had a high clay content and low pH. All soils were effective in the removal of ammonia and ABS. One-hundred percent breakthrough for ammonia occurred after a throughput volume of 345 to 470 times the <b>gross</b> soil <b>sample</b> volume.

We find that more complex scoring rules are used more often when the authority is uncertain about costs and about delivered quality, in accordance with our hypotheses. However, authority effects are also found to directly and indirectly influence the choice of supplier-selection method, suggesting that tendering design is partially driven by local habits or institutional inertia...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{achieve a}} clinicopathologic {{classification}} of Spitz nevi by comparing their clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathologic features. Design: Eighty-three cases were independently reviewed by 3 histopathologists and preliminarily classified into classic or desmoplastic Spitz nevus (CDSN, n = 11), pigmented Spitz nevus (PSN, n = 14), Reed nevus (RN, n = 16), or atypical Spitz nevus (ASN, n = 14); the remaining 28 cases were then placed into an intermediate category (pigmented Spitz-Reed nevus, PSRN) because a unanimous diagnosis of either PSN or RN was not reached. Setting: University dermatology and pathology departments and general hospital pathology departments. Patients: A sample of subjects with excised melanocytic lesions. Main Outcome Measure: Frequency of dermoscopic patterns within the different histopathologic subtypes of Spitz nevi. Results: Overlapping clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathologic findings were observed among PSN, RN, and PSRN, thereby justifying their inclusion into the single PSRN diagnostic category. Asymmetry {{was the most}} frequent indicator of histopathologic ASN (79 %; n = 11); in only 4 cases did dermoscopic asymmetry show no histopathologic counterpart, and in those cases the discrepancy was probably {{the result of an}} artifact of the <b>gross</b> <b>sampling</b> technique carried out with no attention to the dermoscopic. features. Conclusions: Among Spitz nevi, histopathologic distinction between PSN and. RN is difficult, not reproducible, and may be clinically useless. A simple clinicopathologic classification of these neoplasms might therefore be structured as CDSN, PSRN, and ASN. Asymmetry should be assessed using both dermoscopic and histopathologic analysis, and reliability in histopathologic diagnosis may be enhanced by the simultaneous evaluation of the corresponding dermoscopic images...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to test feasibility and safety of the animal models for brain metastases and to use dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to enhance detection of brain metastases. With approval from the institutional animal ethics committee, 18 New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: Group A received an intra-carotid infusion (ICI) of mannitol followed by VX 2 cells; group B received successive ICI of mannitol and heparin followed by VX 2 cells; and group C received an ICI of normal saline. The survival rate and clinical symptoms were recorded after inoculation. After two weeks, conventional MRI and DCE-MRI were performed using 3. 0 Tesla scanner. The number of tumors and detection rate were analyzed. After MRI measurements, the tumors were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. No rabbits died during the procedure. The rabbits had common symptoms, including loss of appetite, lassitude and lethargy, etc. at 10. 8 ± 1. 8 days and 8. 4 ± 1. 5 days post-inoculation in group A and B, respectively. Each animal in groups A and B re-gained the lost weight within 14 days. Brain metastases could be detected by MRI at 14 days post-inoculation in both groups A and B, with metastases manifesting as nodules in the brain parenchyma and thickening in the meninges. DCE-MRI increased the total detection of tumors compared to non-contrast MRI (P< 0. 05).

After examining the overall outcomes (contact, able to be interviewed, cooperation, and participation), we will focus in the third part of our first research question on one specific outcome, namely contact (see the aforementioned findings by, e.g., Baykara-Krumme 2010; Feskens et al. 2006), and compare, in particular, the contact rates among migrants and non-migrants by age group and gender. As explained above, the only key indicator in the PIAAC <b>gross</b> <b>sample</b> {{that can be used}} to operationalize migration background is citizenship. Thus, for our analyses migrants are defined as non-German citizens and non-migrants as holders of German citizenship. Consequently, our second research question explores reasons for possible differences in the response rates. And finally, to increase participation of migrants in future surveys, it is important to know when the target sub-groups are reachable and whether they differ from non-migrants in this regard.

Two independent authors searched SCOPUS and PubMed until 31 August 2015 without language restrictions. The studies with available data about prognostic parameters in subjects with oesophageal cancer, comparing patients with the presence of ENE (ENE+) versus only intranodal extension (ENE-), were considered as eligible.

Fourteen studies were selected; they followed-up 1437 patients with oesophageal cancer for a median follow-up of 39. 4  months.

Among 859 hits, 13 studies were found eligible and were included in our meta-analysis. Compared with ENE-negative (ENE-) cases, the ENE-positive (ENE+) patients had significantly higher rates of all-cause mortality (6 studies: RR = 3. 18; 95 %CI: 2. 02 - 5. 00, p < 0. 0001, I(2) = 56 %), cancer-specific mortality (3 studies: RR = 2. 03; 95 %CI: 1. 12 - 3. 69, p = 0. 02, I(2) = 80 %), and recurrence (4 studies: RR = 2. 69, 95 %CI: 1. 61 - 3. 76, p < 0. 0001, I(2) = 57 %). Using HRs after adjusting for potential confounders, ENE + carried a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (6 studies: HR = 3. 08, 95 %CI: 1. 73 - 5. 48, p < 0. 0001, I(2) = 66 %), and recurrence (5 studies: HR = 3. 93, 95 %CI: 2. 33 - 6. 62, p < 0. 0001, I(2) = 28 %).

50|$|The first animal studied was {{an eight-year-old}} Holstein cow (R-29), her {{white blood cell}} count was {{elevated}} and her physical condition was steadily declining; after delivering a calf she weakened and became severely emaciated. She had to be euthanized and necropsy was performed. The diagnosis was lymphosarcoma, however, none of the tumors usually associated with the diseases were present in the postmortem <b>gross</b> examination. Tissue <b>samples</b> were sent to Dr. Van Der Maaten at the National Animal Disease Center; Dr. Van Der Maaten was able to isolate the BIV.|$|R
40|$|The project 'Further Training as a Part of Lifelong Learning' (Berufliche Weiterbildung als Bestandteil Lebenslangen Lernens - WeLL) {{focuses on}} {{participation}} in continuous training {{and its effects}} on the professional status as well as income development of employees. The main question of the study is what leads employees to participate. To investigate the employees' circumstances and motives as well as their work environments, establishments and their employees are interviewed. In this manner a linked employer-employee data set is established. It can be used to analyse, why - within the same internal environment - some employees participate in further training while others abstain. The linked employer-employee data set contains face-to-face interviews with employers about their further training investments (WeLL additional employer survey) and a panel survey of their employees (WeLL employee survey). The WeLL survey of employees has been carried out once a year since 2007 : The first wave (WeLL employee survey in 2007) was realised in winter 2007 / 2008, the second wave (WeLL employee survey in 2008) was conducted about a year later, in autumn / winter 2008. The method report deals with the <b>gross</b> <b>sample,</b> changes in the questionnaire from first to second wave, field work as well as the results of a selectivity analysis of the WeLL employee survey in 2008.

40|$|The {{household}} survey {{took place}} in December 2002 in over 27 000 representatively selected German private households within the GfK Mail Panel. The total number of respondents can be characterised as very good at 20 325 or 75 % of the <b>gross</b> <b>sample,</b> especially {{as some of the}} information required was relatively complex. This is especially true for the key questions on the amount of energy used and energy costs. The evaluation of the data resulted in an extrapolation of the energy consumption for the year 2002 on the one hand and, on the other, in analyses of energy related equipment and structural features as well as influencing variables on the energy consumption. A total energy consumption of 700 TWh resulted from this extrapolation for households in 2002 which can be split as follows: 18 % for electricity, 38 % for gas, 31 % for fuel oil, 5 % for district heating, 1 % for coal and 7 % for wood and other energy sources (Table 2 - 2). Compared with the consumption shown by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Energiebilanzen (2003), the extrapolations resulted in lower consumption figures in total and for all energy carriers with the exception of heating oil. However, the overall difference of almost 7 % should not be rated as very large in view of the uncertainties connected with the survey and the extrapolation itself. (orig.)

40|$|Innovation is {{regarded}} as a key driver of productivity and market growth and thus has a great potential for increasing wealth. Surveying innovation activities of firms is an important contribution {{to a better understanding of}} the process of innovation and how policy may intervene to maximise the social returns of private investment into innovation. Over the past three decades, research has developed a detailed methodology to collect and analyse innovation activities at the firm level. The Oslo Manual, published by OECD and Eurostat (2005) is one important outcome of these efforts. In 1993 both organisations have started a joint initiative, known as the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), to collect firm level data on innovation across countries in concord (with each other). The German contribution to this activity is the so-called Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP), an annual survey implemented with the first CIS wave in 1993. The MIP fully applies the methodological recommendations laid down in the Oslo Manual. It is designed as a panel survey, i. e. the same <b>gross</b> <b>sample</b> of firms is surveyed each year, with a biannual refreshment of the sample. The MIP is commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and conducted by the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research (ISI) and the Institute for Applied Social Science (infas). This publication reports main results of the MIP surveys conducted in the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. The surveys of the years 2013 and 2015 were the German contribution to the CIS for the reference years 2012 and 2014. The purpose of this report is to present descriptive results on various innovation indicators for the German enterprise sector...|$|E
40|$|Context The {{presence}} of a combined serous cystadenoma and pancreatic endocrine neoplasm is a distinct clinicopathological entity rather than the incidental concurrence of two separate entities. Case report We report {{the case of a}} 52 -year-old woman admitted to our hospital who had suffered from epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting for 4 months. Imaging techniques showed an irregular mass having a mixed solid and cystic consistency, arising from the body of the pancreas and involving the lesser sac. This mass went beyond the stomach and above the lesser curvature of the stomach. The diagnosis of combined microcystic adenoma and pancreatic endocrine neoplasm was made. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and is well two months after surgery. Conclusion This case emphasizes the importance of careful <b>gross</b> examination, <b>sampling</b> and reporting of pancreatic tumors. The coexistence of pancreatic endocrine neoplasms with potential malignant behavior may be overshadowed by obvious benign tumors such as a microcystic serous cystadenoma. The malignant potential and prognostic features of this neoplasm require long-term follow-up and additional data from subsequent reports of such cases...|$|R
30|$|Analysis of {{variance}} was conducted to determine the significant differences of data on the <b>gross</b> parameter of <b>sample</b> trees, length of wood fibers, distance of boundary between juvenile and mature wood from pith, mature wood proportion, anatomical characteristics of wood and wood density among provenances. The length of wood fiber was analyzed at several positions on radial direction of disks, namely position near pith (1  cm from pith), boundary between juvenile and mature wood area, and near bark (1  cm from bark). For the anatomical characteristics of wood and wood density, data analysis was conducted at the position near the pith, juvenile wood area, and mature wood area.|$|R
30|$|For loss {{aggregation}} across {{counties to}} the provincial level {{or group of}} counties, we assumed that the county gross loss follows a Beta distribution (frequently used in catastrophe risk modeling). Parameters of the distribution were determined from the county exposure, 4 and the loss {{mean and standard deviation}} of the county loss. The probability density function (pdf) of the county <b>gross</b> loss was <b>sampled</b> at a large number of predefined points. This discrete pdf was weighted by 1 / 1000 (for simulation length =  1000). Summation across all 1000  years of simulated rainfall of the weighted pdfs for a given county results in a discrete distribution of the county gross loss.|$|R
