50|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> has been debated {{since it was}} first introduced by the Grameen Bank in the 1970s.

According to JPAL, {{there is little evidence}} on the relative impacts of individual lending versus <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> on household consumption, income and enterprise creation.|$|E

50|$|The {{researcher}} {{claims that}} traditional ‘microfinance <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> methodology’ helps manage adverse selection risk by using social capital and risk understanding {{within a community}} to price risk. However, interest rate controls are most often found {{at the lower end}} of the market where financial institutions (usually MFIs) use the information asymmetry to justify high lending rates. In a non-competitive market (as is likely to exist in a remote African village), the lender likely holds the monopoly power to make excessive profit without competition evening them out.|$|E

50|$|AMK {{utilizes}} a solidarity <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> methodology {{to administer}} its group loans. This process begins with potential clients self-selecting themselves into solidarity {{groups of four}} to six members. These solidarity groups are then organized into Village Banks that consist of four to twelve groups (or twenty to sixty clients). Being part of a self-selected solidarity group signifies that three to five other villagers trust the loan applicant to let him/her join their group. All loans are guaranteed by the respective group members. Loans are appraised and approved by an AMK Client Officer and the Village Bank President prior to disbursement. Each group nominates a group leader {{who is in charge}} of ensuring member attendance at meetings, troubleshooting, and liaising with the VBP, CO, and other members. AMK also offers several individual loan options to its clients. Generally, these require physical collateral and at least one personal guarantor.|$|E
50|$|German {{journalist}} Kathrin Hartmann relates {{tales of}} women who she met in 2012 while visiting Kurigram District in Bangladesh trapped in debt. She was told by rural women of brutal methods to enforce debt repayments, including the forced sale of goats, cows, house utensils and land. She also describes intense peer pressure under <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> schemes. Heavily indebted men and women even sold their kidneys to organized groups {{in order to be}} able to repay loans, as discovered by the police in summer 2011. Hartmann writes, without quoting a source, that one third of microcredits are taken in order to pay for food or health care, especially during the times of the year called Monga when food and work opportunities are scarcest. Children drop out of school to earn money and families cut down on food expenses in order to repay loans. When natural disasters strike, such as Cyclone Sidr in 2007, weekly instalments to repay loans continue, although the ability of borrowers to earn income has been destroyed by the disasters.|$|E

Troppmann has to choose between the abject Dirty and her associations of sex, disease, excrement and decay, the politically engaged Lazare, and her ethical values of commitment, resistance and endurance, and Xénie, who has outlived her usefulness. While looking at Lazare beneath a tree, Troppmann realises that he respects her for her social conscience, but also sees her as a rat, and chooses Dirty instead, whilst sending Xénie off with a friend, who is subsequently killed in the street. He travels with Dirty to Treves, the home-town of Karl Marx, where the two copulate in the mud on a cliff overlooking a candle-lit graveyard. They see a Hitler Youth <b>group,</b> <b>lending</b> Dirty a vision of the war to come and their probable deaths. Troppmann leaves her to return to Paris.|$|E

5000|$|SKS Microfinance {{follows the}} Joint Liability Group (JLG) model. The {{methodology}} involves lending to individual women, using five- member {{groups as the}} ultimate guarantor for each member. Through <b>group</b> <b>lending,</b> situations of adverse selection and moral hazard due to asymmetric information are better managed. [...] "Social collateral" [...] replaces asset collateral (which is lacking in the poorer segments of society). Such a system works because India is still a highly community-centric society. The concept of honour and respect within society is deeply rooted in Indian culture and willful default invites condescending glances, humiliation and even ostracism. In Nov 2015,SKS Microfinance Ltd has cut interest rates by one percentage point to 19.75% on the loans it offers to low-income women borrowers, making it the sole Indian microlender to offer loans at a rate below 20%.The move came after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to double the borrower limit for microfinance loans for less than 24 months.Lower interest rates can attract more borrowers in an increasingly competitive market. Microfinance companies, which had started lending at around 28-34% in 2010, {{are now able to}} charge lower interest rates because of newer avenues to raise funds at lower cost and their ability to operate more efficiently than before.“SKS is the first company to charge sub-20% interest rates on the core income generating loans,” the company claimed in a statement on Friday. This is the fourth time SKS has reduced interest rates since October 2014.|$|E
40|$|Papers that compare <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> and {{individual}} lending {{in the presence}} of strategic default suggest that unless group members can impose costly social sanctions on one another, or unless the bank uses cross-reporting mechanisms <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> may do worse than individual lending. In this paper, we show that if, (1) the amount that a successful borrower owes for his defaulting partner is optimally determined, and (2) the penalty is allowed to vary across group members, then {{even in the absence of}} any social sanctions or cross-reporting, (1) expected borrower welfare is strictly higher with <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> when both <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> {{and individual}} lending are feasible and (2) <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> is feasible for a greater range of opportunity cost of capital.

In the static setting, the free-riding problem dominates the liquidity risk effect under a plausible condition, thus making <b>group</b> <b>lending</b> unattractive.
