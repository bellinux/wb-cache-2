5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used radioisotope in PET F-18, is not produced in any nuclear reactor, but rather in a circular accelerator called a cyclotron. The cyclotron is used to accelerate protons to bombard the stable heavy isotope of oxygen O-18. The O-18 constitutes about 0.20% of ordinary oxygen (mostly O-16), from which it is extracted. The F-18 is then typically used to make FDG (see this link for more <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> process).|$|E

25|$|Relatively common, {{the green}} lanternshark is caught {{infrequently}} as bycatch in deepwater fisheries, {{but has no}} commercial value because of its small size. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as of Least Concern, as at present it appears to face no substantial threats.

25|$|The pink {{sandstone}} {{sculptures of}} Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) {{to reach a}} very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art {{that the world is}} now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.
