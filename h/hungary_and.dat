5|$|Being {{the last}} male {{member of the}} House of Árpád, Andrew was elected king {{after the death of}} King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a {{coronation}} diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of <b>Hungary,</b> <b>and</b> an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from <b>Hungary</b> <b>and</b> forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of <b>Hungary</b> <b>and</b> her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.|$|E

5|$|Manuel Komnenos {{attempted}} {{to draw the}} Russian principalities into his net of diplomacy directed against <b>Hungary,</b> <b>and</b> {{to a lesser extent}} Norman Sicily. This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine camps. In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince Iziaslav II of Kiev was related to Géza II of <b>Hungary</b> <b>and</b> was hostile to Byzantium; Prince Yuri Dolgoruki of Suzdal was Manuel's ally (symmachos), and Vladimirko of Galicia is described as Manuel's vassal (hypospondos). Galicia was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of <b>Hungary</b> <b>and,</b> therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts. Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed; when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel's ally, took over Kiev and Yaroslav, the new ruler of Galicia, adopted a pro-Hungarian stance.|$|E
