This paper reviews different approaches of studying seepage water in caves, {{in order to understand the}} infiltration regimen in the non-saturated zone of karst areas. As an illustration, we describe a four-year study of the active carbonate-water system in the Cueva del Agua (Granada, southern Spain) that automatically logs the discharge from a stalactite. The results indicate that: (1) the drip water regime is not seasonal, but is linked instead to slow infiltration. Sudden changes in drip water regime occur due to infiltration along preferential flow paths and the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> of supersaturated water from reserves in the microfissure and pore system; (2) the drip rate is not linear over time. When dripping is constant, barometric oscillation of the air is the principal factor causing a chaotic a drip flow regime. Over a short period of two to three days, a mean variation in air pressure inside the cave of 10 (± 3. 7) mbar causes a mean oscillation in the drip rate of 0. 5 (± 0. 2) mm/h.

40|$|International audienceARGO hydrographic profiles, two hydrographic transects and {{satellite}} measurements of air-sea exchange parameters {{were used to}} characterize the properties and seasonal heat budget variations of the Surface Mixed Layer (SML) south of Africa. The analysis distinguishes the Subtropical domain (STZ) and the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ), Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and Antarctic Zone (AZ) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. While no Subantarctic Mode Water forms in that region, occurrences of deep SML (up to ∼ 450 m) are observed in the SAZ in anticyclones detached from the Agulhas Current retroflection or Agulhas Return Current. These are present latitudinally throughout the SAZ, but preferentially at longitudes 10 - 20 ° E where, according to previous results, the Subtropical Front is interrupted. Likely owing to this exchange window and to transfers at the Subantarctic Front also enhanced by the anticyclones, the SAZ shows {{a wide range of}} properties largely encroaching upon those of the neighbouring domains. Heat budget computations in each zone reveal significant meridional changes of regime.

40|$|We present {{detailed}} field {{observations of}} cooling fractures in a small-volume trachyandesitic lava, informally named the Slaga lava, {{on the south}} west flank of Öræfajökull volcano, south east Iceland. Columnar joints, pseudopillow fracture systems, and curved platy jointing occur in the lava, whose exposed section is approximately 600 m in length and generally 2 – 3 m in thickness. Columnar jointing may occur {{at the base of}} flow lobes, whereas pseudopillow fracture systems occur throughout the lava in an outer, glassy, fractured carapace, and curved platy fractures occur in the centres of larger flow lobes. Pseudopillow fracture systems, composed of a single master fracture and multiple subsidiary fractures formed normal to the master fracture, are of two types: G-type pseudopillow fracture systems have very narrow striae (chisel marks) on their master fractures, indicative of rapid cooling and brittle fracture; SR-type pseudopillow fracture systems display alternating smooth and rough master fracture surface textures, evidence of alternating brittle and ductile fracture propagation mechanisms. Subsidiary fractures in both types show curved striae on their fracture surfaces, which enable the determination of fracture propagation directions. Pseudopillow fracture systems are thought only to form in the presence of water, including water caused by the melting of ice and snow. The curved platy fractures display prominent river lines and may have resulted from cooling contraction, post-emplacement degassing, flow deflation or shearing in the flow against the outer solid crust of the flow during inflation. Due to recent advances in the understanding of the formation mechanisms of pseudopillow fractures systems they, and the other fractures present in the flow, can be used to reconstruct the cooling environment.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to assess the {{effectiveness}} of the cross-compliance standard Maintenance of farm channel networks and field convexity with respect to the environmental objective to maintain soil structure through appropriate measures indicated in Annex IV of REG. EC 1782 / 03. This GAEC standard concerns arable land and obliges the farmer to maintain the farm channel network and the convex shape of fields with a view to the management and preservation of temporary drainage ditches and permanent channels along the edges of the fields, in order to ensure their efficacy and function in draining away water. Experiments have confirmed that maintaining the farm channel networks and giving fields a convex shape has a positive effect in predisposing the soil to ideal conditions for the preservation of its structure. In particular, we have used the data of a newly conducted laboratory study on the effects of the duration of waterlogging on the stability of soil structure, as well as the results of several studies carried out in the past with the following goals: i) assessment of the effects of soil moisture various levels on the stability of the structure; ii) assessment of the effects of several wetting and drying cycles on aggregate stability; iii) determination of aggregate stability under the influence of freezing and thawing under different soil moisture conditions; iv) determination of aggregate stability with an increasing number of freeze/thaw cycles (0, 1, 3, 5, 11 cycles) at field capacity moisture. The tests during which the soil was subjected to freezing and thawing were carried out taking into account the fact that during winter waterlogged soil may freeze, leading to a structure breakdown, due to the expansion of water into the pores during the freezing phase. In general, the results showed that in soils that are sandy and rich in rock fragments, rapid moisture penetration leads to significant disaggregation phenomena compared with soils with higher silt and clay contents. The results also showed that the least extensive disaggregation of the structure occurred with three wetting/drying cycles. This behaviour was more obvious in soils with a greater silt and clay content compared with sandy loam soils. After the third wetting/drying cycle, disaggregation increased with the cycles number increasing. In particular for moisture contents of 50 %, this test confirms that maintaining the farm channels efficacy has a beneficial effect on soil structure, as good <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> which is ensured by well-functioning ditches, prevents waterlogging and fights the dispersion of clay and silt (when the soil is dry, these two components form a surface crust that disturbs the water and gas exchange as well as plant growth). Disaggregation due to freezing and thawing is linked very closely to the matrix potential (and hence to the moisture) of the aggregates before treatment. In general {{it can be said that}} a water content between saturation and field capacity predisposes the soils to a much higher level of disaggregation compared to soil that is air-dry or at the wilting point. The tests that examined the effect of an increasing number of freeze/thaw cycles showed a logarithmic degradation of structural stability in relation to the number of cycles. However, most of the disaggregation occurred after three freeze/thaw cycles. This experiment showed that only few freeze/thaw cycles are necessary to cause a significant structural degradation of soils with high water content and with a texture ranging from loamy to clayey. The results of the studies allow us to deduce that the Standard is efficient in contributing to the preservation of the soil structure. In fact, maintaining the water drainage network in efficient conditions and giving the fields a convex shape are elements that contribute to the removal of excess water, which results in a decrease of both of the possibility of the dispersal of silt+clay microaggregates and of the risk of structural damages due to freezing and thawing...|$|E
40|$|Riverine landscapes are complex. More {{than just}} a single channel, they {{comprise}} a shifting mosaic of hydrogeomorphic patches with varying physical and biological characteristics. These patches are connected by water during flows of varying magnitude and frequency, at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Combined, landscape complexity and hydrological connectivity create biological diversity that in turn maintains the productivity, ecological function, and resilience of these systems. This thesis investigates the ecological importance of spatial heterogeneity and temporal hydrological connectivity in a dryland floodplain river landscape. It focuses on anabranch channels, and uses major carbon sources in these and adjacent landscape patches as indicators of ecological pattern and process. A conceptual model was proposed, describing the potential effects upon the distribution and availability of major carbon sources of: a) a spatial mosaic of hydrogeomorphic patches in the landscape (e. g. anabranches, river channel, and wider floodplain); and b) four primary temporal phases of hydrological connection during flow pulses (disconnection, partial connection, complete connection, and draining). This was then tested by data collected over a three year period from a 16 km reach of the lower Macintyre River (NSW/QLD Australia). Results were examined at multiple spatial scales (patch scale - river channel vs. anabranches vs. floodplain; between individual anabranches; and within anabranches - entry, middle and exit sites). The data indicate that spatial heterogeneity in the lower Macintyre River landscape significantly influences ecological pattern. Carbon quantity was greater in anabranch channels compared to adjacent river channel patches, but not compared to the floodplain; while carbon quality was greater in anabranch channels compared to both adjacent river channel and floodplain patches. Stable isotope analysis indicated that carbon sources that were predominantly found in anabranch channels supported both anabranch and river organisms during a winter disconnection phase. Other carbon sources found in the main river channel and the wider floodplain appeared to play a comparatively minimal role in the food web. Different phases of hydrological connection between anabranch channels and the main river channel were associated with differences in the availability of carbon sources. In the river channel, <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from anabranches (the draining phase) was associated with relatively high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and low concentrations of phytoplankton. Conversely, the disconnection phase was associated with relatively low concentrations of DOC and high concentrations of phytoplankton in the river channel. In anabranch channels and their waterbodies, the disconnection and draining phases were associated with high concentrations of both DOC and phytoplankton. Concentrations of these carbon sources were lowest in anabranches during the partial and complete connection phases. Different hydrological connection phases were also associated with changes in trophic status in the aquatic components of the landscape. On the riverbanks, relatively low rates of benthic production and respiration during the complete connection phase were associated with heterotrophy. The remaining phases appeared to be autotrophic. Benthic production on riverbanks was greatest during the disconnection phase, and respiration was greatest during the partial connection phase. In the anabranch channels, rates of production and respiration were similar during the disconnection phase, and were associated with heterotrophy in the anabranch waterbodies. The remaining phases appeared to be autotrophic. Respiration was greatest in anabranches during the disconnection phase, and production was greatest during the draining phase. Both production and respiration were lowest during complete connection. These differences and changes varied according to the landscape patch examined. At a landscape scale, anabranch channels act as both sinks and suppliers of carbon. High rates of sediment deposition facilitate their role as sinks for sediment-associated carbon and other particulate, refractory carbon sources. Simultaneously, anabranch channels supply aquatic carbon sources from their waterbodies, as well as via processes such as inundation-stimulated release of DOC from surface sediments. Modelled data indicated that water resource development reduces the frequency and duration of connection between anabranch channels and the main river channel. This loss of landscape complexity via loss of connectivity with anabranches {{has the potential to}} reduce the total availability of carbon sources to the ecosystem, as demonstrated by a modelled 13 % reduction in potential dissolved organic carbon release from anabranch sediments. This thesis has demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity in riverine landscapes, by documenting its association with variability in the distribution and quality of primary energy sources for the ecosystem. It has shown that this variability is augmented by different phases of hydrological connectivity over time. Spatial heterogeneity and hydrological connectivity interact to increase the diversity and availability of ecological energy sources across the riverine landscape, at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This has positive implications for the resilience and sustainability of the system. Anabranch channels are particularly important facilitators of these effects in this dryland floodplain river system. Anabranch channels are 'intermediate' in terms of spatial placement, temporal hydrological connection, and availability of carbon sources; of high value in terms of high-quality carbon sources; and relatively easy to target for management because of their defined commence-to-flow levels. Further research should be directed toward evaluating other ecological roles of anabranch channels in dryland rivers, thereby providing a more complete understanding of the importance of connectivity between these features and other patches. This knowledge would assist management of floodplain river landscapes at larger regional scales, including amelioration of the effects of water resource development...|$|E
