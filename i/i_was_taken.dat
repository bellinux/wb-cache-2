5|$|The {{original}} coffin of Thutmose <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> {{over and}} re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. The mummy of Thutmose I {{was thought to}} be lost, but Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III, believed he had found his mummy in the otherwise unlabelled mummy #5283. This identification has been supported by subsequent examinations, revealing that the embalming techniques used came from the appropriate period of time, almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made {{during the course of the}} Eighteenth dynasty.|$|E

The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E

2500|$|Elsie {{grew up in}} Waiuku, a {{small town}} south of Auckland, where she {{developed}} a repugnance towards war at an early age. As a young girl, she witnessed the injuries of World War I veterans first hand — [...] "...when visiting Warkworth <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> {{to see a man}} whose face had been half shot away and who never went off his farm". Though she left Waiuku at a young age, she retained strong ties to the town into her old age, and often returned. Unusually for a Pākehā of her generation, she developed a close relationship with the local iwi in Waiuku, Ngāti Te Ata, and her later research proved vital to their Treaty of Waitangi claim.|$|E

The outbreak of World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> to be its confirmation. Sociologist James Beckford claimed that Russell's [...] "sometimes ingenious" [...] ex post facto rationalizations of events in 1914 contributed to the survival of the Bible Student movement. Under doctrinal changes introduced by his successor, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, it was later decided that the Millennium would come within the generation of those who saw the events of 1914. The years of 1799 and 1874, until then significant dates in Russell's millennial chronology, were also abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|Even though men {{surrounded}} Gandhi {{during her}} upbringing, {{she still had}} a female role model as a child. Several books on Gandhi mention her interest in Joan of Arc. In her own accounts through her letters she wrote to her friend Dorothy Norman, in 1952 she wrote: [...] "At about eight or nine <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> to France; Jeanne d'Arc became a great heroine of mine. She {{was one of the}} first people I read about with enthusiasm." [...] Another historian recounts Indira's comparison of herself to Joan of Arc: [...] "Indira developed a fascination for Joan of Arc, telling her aunt, 'Someday I am going to lead my people to freedom just as Joan of Arc did! Gandhi's linking of herself to Joan of Arc presents a nice model for historians to assess Gandhi. As one writer said: [...] "The Indian people were her children; members of her family were the only people capable of leading them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} adaptations, Flitwick is portrayed by Warwick Davis. Rowling said: [...] "I must admit, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> aback when I saw the film Flitwick, who {{looks very much}} like a goblin/elf (I’ve never {{actually}} asked the film-makers precisely what he is), because the Flitwick in my imagination simply looks like a very small old man." [...] However, Rowling mentions on her official website that Flitwick is human, with [...] "a dash of goblin ancestry." [...] His on-screen appearance changes noticeably in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, in which he takes on a more human and less elf-like look, with slicked-down dark hair and moustache. According to Davis, the moustachioed character was originally not supposed to be Flitwick; Flitwick was absent from the script for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but [...] "the producer" [...] (presumably David Heyman) added the new character (as the conductor of the school choir and orchestra, credited as [...] "Choir Master") so that Davis could still appear in the film. Goblet of Fire director Mike Newell preferred the new look, [...] "and from that moment, the character became known as 'Flitwick'." ...|$|E
