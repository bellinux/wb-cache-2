5000|$|The {{ancestor}} of the laguiole {{is most likely}} the Arabo-Hispanic clasp knife of Andalusian Spain, the navaja. The laguiole was first designed in 1829 by Jean-Pierre Calmels. The earliest forms of laguiole knife were straight-bladed and handled, the so-called laguiole droit; the classic navaja-like laguiole {{seems to have been}} developed around 1860. The Calmels laguiole droit had a 'half-lock' on the blade where a small projection {{on the end of the}} backspring (mouche) exerts pressure on a corresponding indent in the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> when the knife is open; this, and not the full locking system of the navaja, remained a fixed feature in subsequent laguiole knives. Seasonal migrations of shepherds and cattle herders between Catalan Spain and southern France in summer and winter introduced the navaja to France. [...] The Arabo-Hispanic design of the navaja was merged with that of local folding knives represented by older patterns such as the laguiole droit and Capuchadou; the result became the classic laguiole. In 1840, the first awl or trocar (a surgical instrument used to puncture body cavities and relieve the suffering of cattle and other animals with bloat) was added to the some laguiole knife patterns. In 1880, some models of the laguiole began featuring a corkscrew, in response to demands from the owners of bars in the Auvergne, and restaurants in Paris.|$|E
50|$|While {{living in}} upstate New York in 1954, Solheim took up golf {{at the age}} of 42 when his colleagues at G.E. invited him to make up a foursome. He quickly took to the game and found that his main problem was putting, so he {{designed}} himself a revolutionary putter. Instead of attaching the shaft at the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blade,</b> he attached it in the center. He applied scientific principles to golf club design, which had previously been based largely on trial and error, transferring much of the weight of the club head to the perimeter.|$|R

5000|$|In 1933, Willie Ogg - who at {{the time}} was serving as an {{advisory}} staff member for Wilson Staff - created a patented design for distributing weight away from the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> the club head, moving it towards the [...] "sweet spot" [...] <b>of</b> the <b>blade.</b> This design feature was used in the Wilson [...] "Ogg-mented" [...] irons, the forerunner of perimeter-weighted or cavity back irons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most visible}} {{difference}} {{in relation to}} hockey skates is that figure skates {{have a set of}} large, jagged teeth called toe picks (also called [...] "toe rakes") on the front <b>of</b> the <b>blade.</b> The toe picks are used primarily in jumping and should not be used for stroking or spins. Blades are mounted to the sole and <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> the boot with screws. In competition, skaters may have three minutes to make repairs to their skates. Blades are about 3/16 inch (4 mm) thick. When viewed from the side, the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> a figure skate is not flat, but curved slightly, forming an arc of a circle with a radius of 180-220 cm. This curvature {{is referred to as the}} rocker <b>of</b> the <b>blade.</b> The sweet spot <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> is below the ball of the foot. This spot is usually located near the stanchion <b>of</b> the <b>blade,</b> and is the part <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> where all spins are spun on. The blade is also hollow ground; a groove on the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> is on the side closest to the skater; the outside edge <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> is on the side farthest from the skater. In figure skating, it is always desirable to skate on only one edge <b>of</b> the <b>blade.</b> Skating on both at the same time (which is referred to as a flat) may result in lower skating skills scores. The apparently effortless power and glide across the ice exhibited by elite figure skaters fundamentally derives from efficient use of the edges to generate speed.|$|R

25|$|The {{most visible}} {{difference}} {{in relation to}} ice hockey skates is that figure skates {{have a set of}} large, jagged teeth called toe picks on the front part <b>of</b> the <b>blade.</b> The toe picks are used primarily in jumping and should not be used for stroking or spins. If used during a spin, the toe pick will cause the skater to lose momentum, or move away from the center <b>of</b> his/her spin. <b>Blades</b> are mounted to the sole and <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> the boot with screws. Typically, high-level figure skaters are professionally fitted for their boots and blades at a reputable skate shop. Professionals are also employed to sharpen blades to individual requirements.|$|R
40|$|Characteristics {{of fluid}} {{dynamics}} and noise of a multiblade radial fan have been experimentally investigated {{with respect to}} the effects of two parameters: inner diameter and the number <b>of</b> <b>blades.</b> The inner diameter D_i of 58 mm gave the highest fan efficiency and pressure coefficient. Up to the critical number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> B <b>of</b> 120, the greater the number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> used the higher the fan efficiency and pressure coefficient. The optimal number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> was found to be around 120 since the characteristics of fluid dynamics remain at a maximum even if a higher number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> is used. Blade passage frequency tone decreases as the number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> is increased. Sound pressure level and specific noise level are reduced as the number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> is increased up to the critical number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> but do not decrease further when a higher number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> are used...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} torque and mechanical power generation and its relation to the number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> at a given wind speed. The relationship of wind turbine rotational frequency, tip speed, minimum wind speed, mechanical power and torque related to the number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> are derived. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the wind energy extraction efficiency achieved for every increment <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> number. Effective factor is introduced to interpret the effectiveness of the wind turbine extracting wind energy below and above the minimum wind speed for a given number <b>of</b> <b>blades.</b> Improve factor is introduced to indicate the improvement achieved for every increment <b>of</b> <b>blades.</b> The evaluation was performance with wind turbine from 1 to 6 blades. The evaluation results shows that the higher the number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> the lower the minimum wind speed to achieve unity effective factor. High improve factors are achieved between 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 blades increment. It contributes to better understanding and determination for the choice of the number <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> for wind turbine design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fermentation {{system is}} widely used for food manufacturing, {{materials}} processing and chemical reaction etc. Different types <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> in the tank for fermentation cause distinct stress distribution on the surface between fluid and blade, and appear various flow fields in the tank. So, this paper is mainly focused on analyzing the stress field <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> under different scales <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> with fixing rotational speed. The {{results show that the}} ratio <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> length to width influences stress distribution on the blades. At the same time, the inclined angle <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> is also the key parameter for the consideration of design and appropriate design will decrease the maximum stress. The results provide an effective means of gaining insights into the stress distribution of fermentation system...|$|R
