40|$|A joint University of Illinois- NASA Glenn {{flight test}} {{program has been}} {{conducted}} {{as part of the}} Smart <b>Icing</b> <b>System</b> program (being developed by researchers at the University of Illinois and the Ohio State University). The objective of this test was to develop and evaluate the identification and characterization methods used in the smart <b>icing</b> <b>system</b> using flight data from clear air and in natural icing conditions. The first phase of the flight test was conducted in February and March 2001 using the NASA Twin Otter research aircraft to provide flight test data. A linear regression fit of the flight data to acquire stability and control derivatives showed many promising results. Significant changes in the aircraft trim values and stability and control derivates were observed due to ice accretion. The longitudinal derivatives were very sensitive to ice accretion and showed promise as a means to characterize the ice accretion effects. The effect of selectively deicing the aircraft component by component was also observed through the changes in the aircraft trim and stability and control derivatives. Atmospheric turbulence, as measured by aircraft zaccelerations, were seen to have a detrimental effect on the identification...|$|E

The June 9, 2009, Airframe Icing Workshop held at GRC provided an opportunity to examine the current NASA airframe icing research program and to dialogue on remaining and emerging airframe icing issues and research with the external community.

The <b>icing</b> <b>system</b> was prepared with two different concentrations of a commercial acid mixture-formula containing the three organic acids at 800 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg (C- 800 and C- 400 batches, respectively). Aerobic mesophiles, psychrotrophs, proteolytic bacteria, trimethylamine and pH were evaluated and the results compared with sensory analyses. Significantly (P < 0. 05) lower counts of mesophiles were found for hake and megrim in the C- 800 and C- 400 batches compared with the control batch. In the case of angler, significantly (P < 0. 05) lower counts of mesophiles, psychrotrophs and proteolytic microorganisms (P < 0. 05) were found for fish stored in the C- 800 icing conditions. Both C- 400 and C- 800 megrim batches exhibited significantly (P < 0. 05) lower pH values than the control batch, and this result was also observed in the C- 800 angler batch. Sensory analysis confirmed that the shelf lives of the three fish species in the C- 800 batch were extended. According to the parameters assessed, storage of hake, megrim and angler in the proposed ice system better protects their microbial and sensory qualities.

40|$|Artificial <b>ice</b> <b>systems</b> have unique {{physical}} properties promising for potential applications. One {{of the most}} challenging issues in this field is to find novel <b>ice</b> <b>systems</b> that allows a precise control over the geometries and many-body interactions. Superconducting vortex matter has been proposed as a very suitable candidate to study artificial ice, mainly due to availability of tunable vortex-vortex interactions and the possibility to fabricate a variety of nanoscale pinning potential geometries. So far, a detailed imaging of the local configurations in a vortex-based artificial <b>ice</b> <b>system</b> is still lacking. Here we present a direct visualization of the vortex ice state in a nanostructured superconductor.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center Propulsion Systems Lab (PSL) was {{recently}} upgraded to perform engine inlet ice crystal testing in an altitude environment. The system installed 10 spray bars in the inlet plenum for ice crystal generation using 222 spray nozzles. As an altitude test chamber, the PSL {{is capable of}} simulating icing events at altitude in a groundtest facility. The system was designed to operate at altitudes from 4, 000 to 40, 000 ft at Mach numbers up to 0. 8 M and inlet total temperatures from - 60 to + 15 degF. This paper and presentation {{will be part of}} a series of presentations on PSL Icing and will cover the development of the icing capability through design, developmental testing, installation, initial calibration, and validation engine testing. Information will be presented on the design criteria and process, spray bar developmental testing at Cox and Co., system capabilities, and initial calibration and engine validation test. The PSL <b>icing</b> <b>system</b> was designed to provide NASA and the icing community with a facility {{that could be used for}} research studies of engine icing by duplicating in-flight events in a controlled ground-test facility. With the system and the altitude chamber we can produce flight conditions and cloud environments to simulate those encountered in flight. The <b>icing</b> <b>system</b> can be controlled to set various cloud uniformities, droplet median volumetric diameter (MVD), and icing water content (IWC) through a wide variety of conditions.

40|$|Aircraft {{accidents}} in icing conditions are primarily {{the results of}} the degradation in performance and control due to the aerodynamic effects of the ice. However, despite recent advances in the ability to identify these changes, the icing sensors currently in use sense only ice thickness or accretion rate at the sensor location.

In this paper, a smart <b>icing</b> <b>system</b> is proposed based on the ability to sense the effect of ice on the aircraft performance, stability and control. This concept is proposed through the addition of an Ice Management System to the aircraft.

40|$|Ice {{accretion}} {{affects the}} performance and control of an aircraft and in extreme situations can lead to incidents and accidents. However, changes in performance and control are difficult to sense. As a result, the icing sensors currently in use sense primarily ice accretion, not {{the effect of the}} ice. No processed aircraft performance degradation information is available to the pilot. In this paper, the Smart <b>Icing</b> <b>System</b> research program is reviewed and progress towards its development reported. Such a system would sense ice accretion through traditional icing sensors and use modern system identification methods to estimate aircraft performance and control changes. This information would be used to automatically operate ice protection systems, provide aircraft envelope protection and, if icing was severe, adapt the flight controls. All of this would be properly communicated to and coordinated with the flight crew. In addition to describing the basic concept, this paper reviews the research conducted to date in three critical areas; aerodynamics and flight mechanics, aircraft control and identification, and human factors. In addition, the flight simulation development is reviewed, as well as the Twin Otter flight test program that is being conducted in cooperation with NASA Glenn Research Center...|$|E

40|$|This work focuses {{the sensory}} and {{physical}} properties of canned farmed coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch); {{the effect of}} flake ice and slurry ice as previous slaughter and chilling conditions was studied. Hydrolytic chemical changes related to sensory and physical properties were also evaluated in canned salmon. Thermal treatment led to a canned muscle showing higher firmness, lower cohesivity and colour changes (higher L* and b* values; lower a* values); filling oils showed higher turbidity scores and lower L*, a* and b* values than starting oil. Additionally, oxidised and putrid odour development in canned muscle and filling oil was low. However, previous icing condition and time (up to 9 days) provided no changes in canned muscle and filling oil, except for an increasing oxidised odour and turbidity in filling oil with chilling time. Meantime, free fatty acid formation and K value were markedly affected by previous <b>icing</b> <b>system</b> and time.

40|$|This study {{provides}} a first approach concerning a novel chilling strategy, which employs {{a mixture of}} different preservative organic acids (ascorbic, citric and lactic) in the icing medium. Thus, ice prepared from water including two different concentrations of a commercial acid mixture-formula (800 and 400 [*]ppm; C- 800 and C- 400 conditions, respectively) were applied as <b>icing</b> <b>system</b> to three important commercial fish lean species (hake, Merluccius merluccius; megrim, Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis; angler, Lophius piscatorius). Lipid oxidation (peroxide value; thiobarbituric acid index; fluorescent compound formation) and hydrolysis (free fatty acid formation) were evaluated throughout the chilling time (up to 12 – 15 days) and compared to results obtained in fish kept under traditional ice prepared only from water (C- 0 condition); a complementary sensory evaluation was carried out. As a result of employing the C- 800 icing condition, a partial inhibition of lipid oxidation and hydrolysis development was obtained that {{was accompanied by a}} shelf life enhancement in all cases. Further research taking into account the complementary action of the present organic acids is envisaged. According to the lipid damage analysis, lipid hydrolysis was a more relevant event than lipid oxidation in all fish species tested.
