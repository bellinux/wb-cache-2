5|$|Doggett and Scully are soon {{introduced}} to a strike-force that will be going into the subway to investigate. The group includes Steven Melnick, a structural engineer, and Dr. Hellura Lyle, CDC employee specializing in pathogens. Scully, however, decides the plan will work better if Doggett acts as <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> ears while she analyzes the situation from up in the Transit Control Center. Using cameras and microphones, she will watch and hear what is happening. After the plans are made, Doggett leads the team into the dark tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> folds {{her hands in}} a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E

She says that she feels as if her life is {{flashing}} before <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> then realises what is happening. Christine sits {{in a car wreck}} as emergency services attempt to free her. On the front seat & window screen, there are broken eggs from a shopping bag and the Stranger is explaining to the police that he stepped into the road causing the crash, and, though he could free Jack he could not reach Christine. At the dinner table, Jack enters dressed as a Nativity angel. Marion says it is time for Christine to move on. Christine says a final goodbye.|$|E
5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)—an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

25|$|The next {{fountain}} is the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (German:Justice fountain) on Gerechtigkeitsgasse. Built in 1543 by Hans Gieng, {{the fountain}} is {{topped with a}} representation of Justice. She stands with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> ears bound, a sword of truth {{one hand and the}} scales in the other. On the pillar below her feet are four figures; the Pope, a Sultan, the Kaiser or Emperor and the Schultheiß or Lord Mayor. This represents the power of Justice over the rulers and political systems of the day; Theocracy, Monarchy, Autocracy and the Republic.|$|E
25|$|Outside, the Girl appears and has {{sex with}} him {{by the light of}} the burning castle, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> face seeming to change as she writhes on top of Corso. She tells him that Balkan failed because the ninth {{engraving}} he had used was a forgery. On her suggestion before she disappears, Corso returns to the Ceniza brothers' now vacant shop. By chance, he finds there the authentic ninth engraving. On it, there is a likeness of the Girl. With the last engraving in hand, Corso returns to the castle. He completes the ritual and crosses through the Ninth Gate into the light.|$|E
25|$|The {{witnesses}} {{described the}} Blessed Virgin Mary as being clothed in white robes {{with a brilliant}} crown on her head. Over the forehead where the crown fitted the brow, she wore a beautiful full-bloom golden rose. She was in an attitude of prayer with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> hands raised towards Heaven. St. Joseph stood on Our Lady's right. He was turned towards her in an attitude of respect. His robes were also white. St. John was on Our Lady's left. He was dressed in white vestments and resembled a bishop, with a small mitre. He appeared to be preaching and he held an open book in his left hand.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore {{appears in}} {{an episode of}} Icons of Teen from the YouTube channel, Shut Up Cartoons voiced by Justin Roiland. As a teenager, Dumbledore liked to do magic and make robotic copies of himself. One day, he went scuba diving to earn his scuba diving badge for scouts. Dumbledore gets scared and stays on the boat while his crush Charlene and the scoutmaster go diving. They run into a giant sea monster and Charlene closes <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> says Dumbledore, a trick he taught her. Dumbledore {{receives}} her distress signal and dives in after them. He meets a talking dolphin who agrees to help Dumbledore if he can eat him in the end. Dumbledore suggests he eat the scoutmaster and the dolphin takes him to his friends. Dumbledore makes a robotic copy and sends it into the creature's stomach, distracting the creature long enough for Dumbledore, Charlene and the scoutmaster to escape. Charlene thanks Dumbledore for saving them. Dumbledore makes a sexual comment but plays it off like she said it. Charlene asks where the scoutmaster is; Dumbledore says he's gone somewhere, when really the dolphin ate him. Dumbledore then decides to build a robot copy of the scoutmaster to prevent anyone from finding {{out what happened to}} him.|$|E
25|$|After she {{remarried}} in America, Suyuan {{has high}} hopes for her new daughter June, but June constantly fails to meet her expectations out {{of a lack of}} interest. She performs badly during a piano recital at age nine (Melanie Chang), and when Suyuan pushes her to continue training to be a concert pianist, June refuses, saying that she wishes herself dead like Suyuan's other daughters, an action that offends Suyuan. When June grows into adulthood, at a dinner party a year before Suyuan's passing, Waverly, June's long-time rival whom she is freelancing for, turns down her business ideas, and Suyuan remarks that Waverly and June are not alike and that style is something one's born with and cannot be taught implying Waverly has style. June feels humiliated, believing her mother had betrayed her for being a failure in <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> Lindo shows sympathy for June. The following day, June berates Suyuan for her remarks and admits she could never live up to her high expectations. June laments that Suyuan has always been disappointed with June because June dropped out of college, is not married, and has an unsuccessful career. However, Suyuan gives her a jade necklace and assures June that she is the one who has the unteachable style and that while Waverly was the best in competitions, June always had the best heart which made her mother prouder than she would have been otherwise.|$|E

25|$|Ahalyoddharaṇam (Sanskrit: अहल्योद्धरणम्). Janaka fixes {{the day of}} Sītā's Svayaṃvara after {{counseling}} {{with his}} ministers and priests. Meanwhile, in Ayodhyā, Daśaratha starts thinking about Rāma's marriage. The sage Viśvāmitra is interrupted {{again and again in}} his sacrifice by the female demon Tāṭakā. Viśvāmitra arrives in Daśaratha's court and asks for Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa for protecting his sacrifice from demons. Daśaratha is reluctant and desolate at the thought of Rāma leaving him, but Vasiṣṭha convinces him to relent. Viśvāmitra takes Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to his forest where Rāma kills Tāṭakā when she attacks the three by raining trees and rocks at them. Viśvāmitra grants the two Vidyās names Balā and Atibalā to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, which will enable them to survive without drinking, eating or sleeping. Viśvāmitra also surrenders all his divine weapons to Rāma. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa protect the sacrifice of Viśvāmitra for six days and six nights. On the seventh day, the demon brothers Mārīca and Subāhu attack the sacrifice with a large army. Rāma uses the Mānavāstra to throw the elder brother Mārīca across the ocean, while he burns Subāhu to death by the Āgneyāstra. In the meantime Lakṣmaṇa kills the entire army of demons. Viśvāmitra is freed from the fear of demons and decides to take Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Mithilā for the Svayaṃvara of Sītā. On the way, Rāma sights Ahalyā, who has been cursed by her husband Gautama for her adulterous transgression, {{in the form of a}} rock. Viśvāmitra narrates the history of Ahalyā to Rāma. Rāma touches Ahalyā by his foot and Ahalyā is freed of her curse and sin. Ahalyā praises Rāma with tears in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> departs to the abode of Gautama.|$|E
500|$|Garza's {{body was}} located in a canal on April 21, in an area several {{miles away from the}} other evidence. From the postmortem examination, medical {{examiners}} could tell that Garza had died of suffocation. She was raped while unconscious and beaten. There was bruising over both of <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> to the right side of her face. Any physical evidence that might have identified an attacker, such as hair, blood or semen, appeared to have been washed away during the time the body spent in the canal.|$|E
500|$|Ellen became {{something}} of a tourist attraction for Turville. She was visited by journalists, medical professionals, religious personnel and the [...] "plain curious" [...] from across the country, many of whom donated money to Ellen's family {{to be allowed to}} see her. Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the [...] "supply" [...] began to run out. A Bucks Free Press journalist recounted his visit: Her breathing was regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and legs like those of a dead child, almost ice cold... the aspect of her features was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances... <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> cheeks were sunken, and the appearance was that of death... but although there was no colour on her cheeks, the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.|$|E
6000|$|She applied <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> saw {{the usual}} {{circle of light}} {{patterned}} all over with a cellular tissue of some indescribable sort. [...] "What {{do you think that}} is?" [...] said Fitzpiers.|$|R

500|$|Her eyes gaze {{downward}} in humility, {{in contrast}} to her relatively extravagant clothes. The piety of her expression is achieved through motifs common to van der Weyden's work. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> nose are elongated and her lower lip made fuller {{by the use of}} tone and pronounced finish. Some vertical lines around these features are emphasised, while her pupils are enlarged and her eyebrows slightly raised. In addition the contours of her face are highlighted {{in a manner that is}} slightly unnatural and abstract, and outside the usual spatial constraints of 15th-century human representation. This methodology was described by art historian Erwin Panofsky: [...] "Rogier concentrated on certain salient features—salient both from a physiognomical and psychological point of view—which he expressed primarily by lines." [...] Her high forehead and full mouth have been seen as suggestive of a nature at once intellectual, ascetic, and passionate, symbolic of [...] "an unresolved conflict in her personality". Panofsky refers to a [...] "smouldering excitability".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Kelley {{listening}} to [...] "Just the Way You Are" [...] on her Walkman as Mars walks in. Mars stops the tape player, removes the cassette tape and begins singing his song. As the instrumental {{portion of the}} song begins, Mars pulls the media out of the cassette tape and arranges the media into letters forming his name followed by the song title. As the song continues, he forms {{a picture of a}} drum, again on the table, using the tape media. Additional images of similar construction follow throughout the video including a portrait of Mars as well as one of Kelley blinking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> smiling as Mars continues singing. Most of the images shown are animated, including a bell which Mars rings with his fingers in synchronization with the chimes {{near the end of the}} song. Lastly, Mars finishes the song while singing and playing an upright piano while Kelley watches and smiles. The video was inspired by the artwork of Erika Iris Simmons.|$|E
500|$|Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times {{said that}} [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{was one of}} those [...] "moments on Animal that are nearly as {{experimental}} as an Animal Collective record, but instead of some wistful, Brian Wilson-loving artiste at the song's center, there's this girl, rolling <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> snapping her gum." [...] Melanie Bertoldi from Billboard magazine also thought that the verse by 3OH!3 [...] "severely slow down the momentum and never quite gel with Kesha's catty, aggressive delivery," [...] but praised the song for its [...] "danceability". Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH said that while [...] "3OH!3 makes a lame attempt to assert the case for male equality , Kesha comes off as so infectiously dominating, it's hard to take [...] seriously." [...] Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy gave the song two out of five stars, stating that it was not as catchy as her debut, slamming the lyrics for being [...] "thick" [...] and adding that she failed to deliver on many lines, calling them [...] "faux-outrageous, faux-feminist trash". [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix criticized the song, calling 3OH!3 [...] "slumming" [...] and [...] "wretched." ...|$|E
