5|$|The Alsos Mission now {{attempted}} {{to recover the}} shipment that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> France. Documentation was discovered that said {{that part of it}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Pash's command reached Toulouse on 1 October and inspected a French Army arsenal. They used a Geiger counter to find barrels containing 31 tons of the uranium from Belgium. Conrad persuaded Major General Frank S. Ross to release the U.S. 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. The barrels were collected and transported to Marseille, where they were loaded on a ship bound for the United States. During the loading process a barrel fell into the water and had to be retrieved by a Navy diver. In Marseilles, the Alsos Mission detachment also met up with the detachment that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Italy, which now rejoined them. The remaining 49 tons of the original shipment to France were never found.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} consideration for Napoleon {{was that a}} French victory might cause French speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, {{and most of the}} British veterans of the Peninsular War <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> North America to fight in the War of 1812.|$|E

5|$|Niobium was {{identified}} by English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801. He {{found a new}} element in a mineral sample that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> England from Connecticut, United States in 1734 by John Winthrop F.R.S.

Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king {{to come to the}} Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was a sacrifice that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.|$|E

5|$|Despite Germany's reorganization, their {{manpower}} {{was still}} incomparable {{to that of}} the Western Allies. While Germany's Army Group B was able to increase their armored strength from 100 to 239 vehicles, these were opposed by 2,300 Allied tanks. Field Marshal Model reported that only 6,500 replacements <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> cover the 75,000 casualties suffered during the month of September. General Eisenhower commanded three army groups, totaling eight field armies with 55 divisions; these provided a two-to-one advantage in artillery guns and a twenty-to-one advantage in tanks, and could count on almost 14,000 combat aircraft, as compared to the Luftwaffe's 573.|$|E
