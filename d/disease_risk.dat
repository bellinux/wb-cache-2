40|$|We build {{a stylized}} model to gain {{insights}} into the application of conservation payments to protect endangered species {{in the face of}} wildlife-livestock <b>disease</b> <b>risks</b> and habitat fragmentation. Greater connectivity of habitat creates an endogenous trade-off. More connectedness ups the chance that populations of endangered species will grow more rapidly; however, greater connectivity also increases the likelihood that diseases will spread more quickly. We analyze subsidies for both habitat connectedness and livestock vaccination. We find the cost-effective policy is to initially subsidize habitat connectivity rather than vaccinations; this increases habitat contiguousness, which eventually also increases <b>disease</b> <b>risks.</b> Once habitat is sufficiently connected, <b>disease</b> <b>risks</b> increase to such a degree to make a vaccination subsidy worthwhile. Highly connected habitat requires nearly all the government budget be devoted to vaccination subsidies. The result of the conservation payments is significantly increased species abundance, {{for a wide range of}} initial levels of habitat connectedness. Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|Disease models usually assume {{disease to}} act {{independently}} of other mortality- and morbidity-causing factors. Alternatively, disease may {{function as a}} competing risk factor, for example, killing already moribund hosts. Using tuberculosis (TB) in African buffalo as a model system, we explore consequences of competing or independent disease effects for host population dynamics. We include scenarios with density-dependent and density-independent effects of environmental variation, exemplified by variable food availability (driven by rainfall) and catastrophic droughts, respectively. Independent disease effects reduce population size linearly with prevalence, irrespective {{of the nature of}} environmental variation. Competing <b>disease</b> <b>risks</b> alter population size only if density-independent variation is present; then, disease reduces population size nonlinearly. Field data indicate that the net effect of TB on buffalo likely falls between the extremes of total independence and competition with other risk factors: TB increases mortality and decreases fecundity in some prime- aged buffalo, suggesting independent <b>disease</b> <b>risks</b> in these individuals, while similar disease effects in senescent buffalo may act as competing risks. Moreover, increased survival and fecundity of TB-negative buffalo may compensate for some disease-related losses. Model assumptions on independent or competing <b>disease</b> <b>risks</b> and environmental variability should be considered explicitly when assessing disease effects on wildlife populations...|$|R
