40|$|Abstract: Earthing is an {{important}} aspect of every substation construction. <b>Earth</b> <b>Mat</b> is preferable to large substations because of space saving on the ground level due to substantial reduction of earth pits which leads to ease of coordination. <b>Earth</b> <b>Mat</b> minimizes the danger of high step or touch voltages in critical operating areas or places that are frequently used by people. Thus properly designed earthing system capable of dissipating large currents safely to earth is required, regardless of the fault type. This paper presents the design of earthing systems for the 132 / 33 Kv substation in Rivers state of Nigeria and the review of substation practices with special reference to safety and development criteria for safe design. A real time case study has been considered and the design was done using ETAP (Electrical Transients Analyzer Program). Simulation using ETAP eradicates the error that is inherent in manual operational method that is mostly used in various substations...|$|E
40|$|An antenna {{has been}} {{developed}} with a signal-to-noise performance that is better {{than that of a}} typical Rhombic antenna during local thunder storms. Although the design is of general application to the reception, in high-noise areas, of long distance transmissions, this work deals in particular with the London-Salisbury circuit, at September noon, 1956, on 21. 47 Mc/s. A basis of theoretical comparison between the performances of different antennas has been proposed. It relies on the technique of replacing a thunder storm by an "equivalent radio transmitter" set up on the frequency to which the receiver is tuned and for which the antenna is designed. A V. H. F. scale model has been used to produce an optimum design for the proposed antenna which is an end-fire array of parasitic elements. The polar diagrams and signal-to-noise performance of the proposed design are derived for several different types of <b>earth</b> <b>mat.</b> The method used for these derivations is substantiated by correlation with practical sampling measurements. A specification for the final configuration is given and its applicability is indicated by applying the design to the problem of improving the expected performance on the London-Salisbury transmissions from September to December, 1960...|$|E
40|$|Close-spaced {{resistivity}} measurements along ten traverse lines crossing the resistivity {{boundary of the}} Ohaaki Geothermal Field, New Zealand, were first measured in 1975 and remeasured in 1992. The 1992 resistivity profiles were similar in shape to the original ones. On both occasions very sharp resistivity boundaries were delineated along the southern and southwestern edges of the field where apparent resistivity rises sharply over a horizontal distance {{of a few hundred}} metres from 2 - 5 ohm m {{on the inside of the}} field to 20 - 50 ohm m on the outside. On two of the southern lines the resistivity boundary appears to have moved outwards by about 100 m, which may be caused by southward movement of reinjected waste water from nearby drillholes. On the other southern lines the outward movement appears to be less than about 25 m, which is the limit of resolution of the survey. Over the 17 year interval apparent resistivity values have dropped slightly at most measurement sites. The decrease is more pronounced on the inside of the field boundary where apparent resistivities have declined by up to about 40 percent. Some of this decrease is attributed to reinjection of conductive waste water near the field boundary causing a drop in ground resistivity. Part of this change may be due to calibration errors and measurement difficulties, including the disturbing effects of the new drillholes, steam pipes and an <b>earthing</b> <b>mat</b> that have been installed since 1975...|$|R

5000|$|An {{antistatic}} {{floor mat}} or ground mat {{is one of}} a number of antistatic devices designed to help eliminate static electricity. It does this by having a controlled low resistance: a metal mat would keep parts grounded but would short out exposed parts; an insulating mat would provide no ground reference and so would not provide grounding. Typical resistance is on the order of 105 to 108 ohms between points on the mat and to ground. [...] The mat would need to be grounded (earthed). This is usually accomplished by plugging into the grounded line in an electrical outlet. It's important to discharge at a slow rate, therefore a resistor should be used in <b>earthing</b> the <b>mat.</b> The resistor, as well as allowing high-voltage charges to leak through to earth, also prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Some ground mats allow you to connect an antistatic wrist strap to them. Versions are designed for placement on both the floor and desk.|$|R
40|$|The {{earthing}} {{of electric}} installations {{plays an important}} part as regards the behaviour of the network and personal safety when there are disturbances. Presently all earthing designs are performed by contractors and submitted to Ceylon Electricity Board for approval. But {{due to lack of}} information at the tender stage majority of the contractors are unable to bid the earthing design part accurately resulting deviations to the contract during the implementation stage. To minimize this problem Transmission Design Branch and the Transmission Maintenance Branch of the Ceylon Electricity Board jointly decided to do the Earthing Design and submitted with the tender for bidding. After the initial soil resistivity measurements, {{it was found that the}} resistivity values were very high compared to other Grid Substation locations. Therefore it was decided to do an earthing design for Horana Grid Substation to identify the suitabil ity of proposed land and identify the land to be developed to construct an additional <b>earthing</b> <b>mat</b> to transfer the earth fault current. Without a properly designed grounding system large potential differences can exist between different points within the substation itself. Under normal circumstances, the current flow through the grounding grid from line - to - ground faults that constitutes the main threat to personnel. The earthing design for Horana Grid Substation has the following objectives. 1. Ensure such a degree of human safety that a person working or walking in the vicinity of grounded facilities, is not exposed to the danger of a critical electric shock. The touch and step voltages produced in a fault condition have to be at safe levels. A safe value is one that will not produce enough current within a body to case ventricular fibrillation. 2. Provide means to carry and dissipate electric currents into earth under normal and faulty conditions without exceeding any operating and equipment limits or adversely affecting continuity of service. 3. Provide grounding for lightning impulses and the surges occurring from the switching of substation equipment, which reduces damage to equipment. 4. Provide a low resistance to protective relays to see and clear ground faults, which improves protective equipment performance, particularly at minimum faults. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReindeer and caribou are {{keystone}} {{species in the}} circumpolar region, and rely on lichens as their main winter forage to survive {{in some of the}} most extreme environments on <b>Earth.</b> Lichen <b>mats,</b> however, can be heavily overgrazed at high deer densities, triggering area abandonment or population declines. Although the species' management and conservation require precise information on the quality of winter grazing areas, no reliable and cost-efficient methods are available to date to measure lichen volume across wide and remote areas. We developed a new Lichen Volume Estimator, LVE, using remote sensing and field measurements. We used a Landsat TM land cover mask to separate lichen heath communities from other vegetation types and, therein, we predicted lichen volume from a two dimensional Gaussian regression model using two indexes: the Normalized Difference Lichen Index, NDLI (Band 5 −Band 4 /Band 5 +Band 4), and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index, NDMI (Band 4 −Band 5 /Band 4 +Band 5). The model was parameterized using 202 ground measurements equally distributed across a gradient ranging from 0 to 80 lichen dm 3 /m 2 (R 2 = 0. 74 between predicted and observed ground measurements), and was validated with a ten-fold cross validation procedure (R 2 = 0. 67), which also showed a high parameter stability. The LVE can be a valuable tool to predict the quality of winter pastures for reindeer and caribou and, thus, help to improve the species' management and conservation...|$|R

40|$|Microbial communication, {{particularly}} that of quorum sensing, {{plays an important}} role in regulating gene expression in a range of organisms. Although this phenomenon has been well studied in relation to, for example, virulence gene regulation, the focus of this article is to review our understanding of the role of microbial communication in extreme environments. Cell signaling regulates many important microbial processes and may play a pivotal role in driving microbial functional diversity and ultimately ecosystem function in extreme environments. Several recent studies have characterized cell signaling in modern analogs to early <b>Earth</b> communities (microbial <b>mats),</b> and characterization of cell signaling systems in these communities may provide unique insights in understanding the microbial interactions involved in function and survival in extreme environments. Cell signaling is a fundamental process that may have co-evolved with communities and environmental conditions on the early Earth. Without cell signaling, evolutionary pressures may have even resulted in the extinction rather than evolution of certain microbial groups. One of the biggest challenges in extremophile biology is understanding how and why some microbial functional groups are located where logically they would not be expected to survive, and tightly regulated communication may be key. Finally, quorum sensing has been recently identified for the first time in archaea, and thus communication at multiple levels (potentially even inter-domain) may be fundamental in extreme environments...|$|R
40|$|Filamentous {{forms of}} cyanobacteria, the {{earliest}} known oxygenic photosynthesising organisms, are the primary structuring agents in modern-day benthic microbial mat consortia. Under conditions of low sedimentation rates and slow water flow, gliding and colliding of the filaments create peaked and ridged structures with regular centimeter-scale spacing. Petroff et al. (2010) suggest that this spacing is set to minimise competition between individual structures. In support of this hypothesis they show that the spacing between structures corresponds to diffusive distances generated by a rhythmically fluctuating metabolism with a period of approximately 20 hours — the periodicity of photosynthesis. Fossil stromatolites show similar structures and spacing, which supports the still-contentious view that they are evidence of early photosynthetic communities and provides constraints {{on the origin of}} phototrophic communities in the early evolution of life on <b>earth.</b> Ridge-peak microbial <b>mats</b> of the type and spacing considered by Petroff are common in ice-covered Antarctic lakes. Such lakes provide a useful test of the diffusive mechanism of pinnacle spacing, since the weak diurnal variability in irradiance reaching the mats could be hypothesised as insufficient to generate diurnal metabolic periodicities. Centimetre-scale structures cannot relate to diffusive distances if metabolic cycles do not generate a marked diel pattern in resource availability in the water between structures, and the universal applicability of the Petroff model would be undermined. To test this model, we simultaneously measured, for the first time, a 30 -hour time-series of in situ vertical oxygen concentration gradients in a pinnacle mat and incident irradiance. We found that the oxygen concentration gradient and irradiance were significantly linearly correlated despite a diurnal irradiance change of only 1. 8 μmol quanta m- 2 s- 1. This result supports the model by Petroff et al. and confirms our own previous conclusions regarding the mats photosynthetic competence...|$|R
