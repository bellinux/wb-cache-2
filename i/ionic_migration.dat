Theseus, Menestheus, Demophoon, Oxyntes, Aphidas, Thymætes, Melanthus, and Codrus; these Kings, at 19 years a-piece one with another, might take up about 152 years, and end about 44 years before the Olympiads: then Reigned twelve Archons for life, which at 14 or 15 years a-piece, the State being unstable, might take up about 174 years, and end An. 2, Olymp. 33: then reigned seven decennial Archons, which are usually reckoned at seventy years; but some of them dying in their Regency, they might not take up above forty years, and so end about An. 2, Olymp. 43, about which time began the Second Messenian war: these decennial Archons were followed by the annual Archons, amongst whom were the Legislators Draco and Solon. Soon after the death of Codrus, his second Son Neleus, not bearing the Reign of his lame brother Medon at Athens, retired into Asia, and was followed by his younger brothers Androcles and Cyaretus, and many others: these had the name of Ionians, from Ion the son of Xuthus, who commanded the army of the Athenians at the death of Erechtheus, and gave the name of Ionia to the country which they invaded: and about 20 or 25 years after the death of Codrus, these new Colonies, being now Lords of Ionia, set up over themselves a common Council called Panionium, and composed of Counsellors sent from twelve of their cities, Miletus, Myus, Priene, Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedus, Teos, Clazomenæ, Phocæa, Samos, Chios, and Erythræa: and this was the <b>Ionic</b> <b>Migration.</b>|$|E

50|$|When {{current is}} applied, by the direct power source, to the electrodes, migrations occur beneath the soil surface. Although {{there are many}} types of migrations that occur {{in tandem with the}} current there are two driving migrations within electrokinetics; <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> and electrophoresis. When the {{electrolytic}} solution is injected within the soil part of the ionic solution forms a diffuse double layer with soils and contaminants. This diffused double layer will aid in the ionic drift that will occur as the current passes though the soil and surrounding liquid, this process is called electroosmosis. The thickness of the diffused double layer is a function of ionic composition of bulk solution and the average charge density of hydration products. As the electrolyte concentration increases the diffuse double layer thickness decreases.Electrophoresis is the mass flux of charged particles under an electric field. Both processes work at the same time but in a counter current manner. The charged particles driven by electrophoresis flow from the cathode to the anode while electrolytic solution flows from the anode to the cathode. Of the two main processes electrophoresis (or electromigration) is more dominant than electroosmosis. Electrophoresis servies as the driving factor that induces the flow of electroosmosis in the opposite direction. Electromigration also serves as the major component for ionic contaminant removal. For electromigration to occur absorbed material must be dissolved to an ionic form whether they are metals, organic or inorganic particles. Electroosmotic flow between the electrodes promotes the development of a low-pH environment in the soil. This low pH environment inhibits metallic contaminants from being sorbed onto soil particle surfaces which aids in the formation of compounds making electrokinetics possible. By this thought it is possible to acidify the soil and induce the release of absorbed heavy metals.|$|E

In this work, we provide direct evidence of electric field-induced <b>ionic</b> defect <b>migration</b> and we isolate their effect on the long-term performance of state-of-the-art devices.

Though these losses are not negligible, we prove that the initial efficiency is fully recovered when leaving the device in the dark for a comparable amount of time. We verified this behaviour over several cycles resembling day/night phases, thus probing the stability of PSCs under native working conditions. This unusual behaviour reveals, that research and industrial standards currently in use to assess the performance and the stability of solar cells need to be adjusted for PSCs.

40|$|Abstract—The anodic potentiodynamic {{formation}} of an AgBr film on an Ag rotating disc electrode was studied in aqueous bromide solutions. As the electron transfer step (1) is intrinsically fast, Ag + Br ^AgBr + c", (1) and as the film remains porous throughout its growth, the rate of film growth is limited by physical parameters such as <b>ionic</b> diffusion and <b>migration</b> in the solution. The anodic E/I curves for AgBr film formation were calculated quantitatively by computer {{on the basis of}} the following model of film growth. Film formation occurs initially by the nucleation of islands of film to a critical thickness, and then these islands spread laterally until only small pores remain between them. As these pores become small, the resistance of the solution within them becomes rate limiting (at the anodic current peak). After the peak, the concentration of bromide ions at the pore base falls to zero and current is then controlled by the diffusion of bromide ions into the lengthening pores of the film. This lateral spreading mechanism and the subsequent retention of the porous film morphology has been substantiated by comprehensive Scanning Electron Microscope investigations...|$|R

However, key points such as crystal growth mechanisms, current−voltage hysteresis, and instability remain still unexplained or misunderstood. Among several possibilities, <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> in PSCs has been suggested to explain the hysteresis effect. However, direct experimental evidence of <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> under operation or measurement conditions of PSCs is still missing. This work shows directly the <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> of halogen components (I − and Cl −) of a CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 −x Cl x perovskite film under an applied bias using glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GD-OES). Furthermore, no migration of lead and nitrogen ions is observed on a polarization time scale less than 2 min. The ratio of fixed to mobile iodide ions is deduced from {{the evolution of the}} GD-OES profile lines {{as a function of the}} applied bias. The average length of iodide and chloride ion migration is deduced from the experimental results. H ybrid organic−inorganic perovskite materials (HOIPs) have recently emerged as an exciting topic of research in chemistry and materials science for their attractive optical−electrical properties. HOIPs have found potential applications in optoelectronics such as photovoltaics, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and lasers. 1 − 3 It has been discovered that these materials are able to exhibit remarkable performance in terms of photocurrent generation. 4 Key features of these hybrid perovskites include direct bandgap, large exciton diffusion length, and strong optical absorption. 5 − 7 However, despite their processing advantages (low-cost solution process) and outstanding solar to electrical energy conversion properties approaching the performance of standard inorganic materials such as silicon, HOIP materials suffer from several drawbacks. The stability of HOIP materials under operational conditions (bias, light, environment, [...] .) is one of the biggest challenges to be addressed before commercializa-tion. 8 HOIPs are mixed ionic−electronic conductors where ions as well as electron/hole carriers can migrate in the material under electric fields. 9 It has been suggested that <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> in HOIPs could impact optoelectronic performance and affect device operation and long-term stability. The J−V hysteresis behavior in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was first reported by Snaith et al. 10 and Unger et al. 11 in mesoporous structured perovskites and by Xiao et al. 12 for planar heterojunction structures. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origins of the J−V hysteresis such as filaments, giant dielectric constant, unbalance between hole and electron mobility, trapping or ferroelectricity effects, and <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> effects. 13 − 19 The general formula for HOIPs materials is ABX 3, where A is an organic cation, B is a divalent metal, and X is a halide anion.

The {{western part of the}} North Caspian Sea is investigated in 2002 – 2009. Complex of sampling, transportation, storage and handling of samples was carried out in accordance with the regulations and methods of measurement. Results. The main share of elements in sea water was transferred as a part of suspended particles. Most often <b>ionic</b> forms of <b>migration</b> of metals dominated over weighed in the central part of a shallow zone of pre-mouth of Volga River. The greatest number of cases of excess was recorded by metals of maximum-permissible concentration in {{the central part of the}} studied water area with depths from 5 m to 10 m. It is established that the index of impurity of waters of the changed in the range from 0, 2 (waters alone) to 3, 4 (the polluted waters). The surface water of the water area is located in the western part of the studied area. The greatest coefficients of ground accumulation (CGA) are characteristic for iron and the manganese, the least for Zincum. The western part of the studied water area belongs to areas with the greatest values of CGA of metals in the north part of the Caspian Sea: zone near Island Chechen and the region of Volga-Caspian Channel.

40|$|The {{field of}} mobile devices, remote {{wireless}} sensors, implantable medical devices, smart cards and energy harvesters is rapidly evolving. A bottleneck {{in the development}} of these microsystems is the energy storage component required for extended autonomous operation. Miniaturization of conventional batteries which use particles and a liquid electrolyte is strongly limited by membranes and packaging. The thin-film micro-battery,as an all solid-state device, is therefore considered for miniaturization of the energy storage component in these devices. Due to these emerging technologies the world-wide market for all-solid-state thin-film lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is expected to grow from € 50 millionin 2012 to € 4. 5 billion by 2019. The current planar (2 D) thin-film battery device has very limited storage capacity. As a result, a large areal footprint is required to provide the energy needed for the intended application. Surface structuring is proposed to increase the battery capacity for same footprint. These so-called 3 D thin-film batteries are much more than just a vehicle to increase capacity. It allows the electrode film thickness to bescaled down so that the battery charging kinetics can be increased drastically. In this project proposal the effects of electrode scaling will be investigated. The electrodes themselves and in combination with solid-electrolyte layers will be studied. The finding will be used to proposeand test optimum 3 D thin-film micro-battery designs. The main goalsof the project are threefold and form the content of the three work packages: (1) acquire a fundamental understanding of scaling of film thickness on the performance of thin-film electrodes (both lithium ion storage capacity and charging kinetics); (2) understand the impact of solid electrolyte on thin-film electrode performance with attention onelectronic structure of the interface and electric field over the thin-film stack; (3) apply the gathered know-how to formulate and assess material systems and optimal dimensions for the fabrication of high performance 3 D micro-batteries. In a first phase, TiO 2 is chosen as a model electrode as it can be made uniformly in ultrathin form by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and thus ideal to study film scaling. By varying the film thickness, the electrical resistance and Li-ion diffusion length can be varied and its effect on Li-ion storage capacity and kinetics can be investigated. It can be doped to study the effects of electronic conductivity and <b>ionic</b> drift (transport <b>migration</b> term) in the electric field over the film. It can be made in amorphous or crystalline (anatase and rutile) form allowing the investigation of crystal structure and associated phase formations on storage capacity and kinetics. Furthermore, the TiO 2 remains stable during measurements as it does not dissolve and the minimal volume expansion (maximum ~ 4 %) ensures the integrity of the thin films. Next, the effect of inorganic solid electrolytes layers (e. g. Li 3 PO 4) with varying thicknesses coated on TiO 2 anodes will be investigated. Effects of interest are changein storage kinetics, charge/discharge reversibility (decomposition of electrolyte and cycling behavior) and the change in ionic drift due to the redistribution of the electric field over the thin-film stack. The individual films and stacks will be characterized electrochemically with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiostatic intermittent titration technique. The protocols and techniques will be employed for testing other potential thin film electrodes where the performance can be comparedwith proper TiO 2 polymorph and conductivity. Physical characterization of selected films and film stacks will be done, amongst others,by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The best performing materials for integration in thin-film and 3 D micro-batteries will be selected. Finally, from the newly gained understanding, optimum material combinations and stack dimensions will be proposed. This will give direction to the design and fabrication of 3 D architectures for maximized storage capacity and power for 3 D thin-film battery devices. The fabrication of a functional film stack on etched Si pillars will be explored using conformal layers available in the team and with our university collaborators. The research will be performed in the Nano Applications Materials Engineering (NAME) group of imec, under guidance of Prof. Vereecken. The group is developing techniques for conformal deposition of electrodes and solid electrolytes on complex structures and is also exploring new electrode and solid-electrolyte materials.

40|$|Alkali-silica {{reaction}} (ASR) {{is one of}} {{the major}} deterioration mechanisms that affect numerous concrete structures worldwide. During the reaction, hydroxyl and alkali (sodium and potassium) ions react with certain siliceous compounds in the aggregate, forming a hygroscopic gel. The gel absorbs water from the cement paste and swells, possibly leading to deleterious expansion and cracking of the structure. Once ASR is detected in existing structures, there are no treatments to stop it and prolong their service life. Lithium is known to alter the reaction, as it binds to the alkali-silica gel and the latter is no longer expansive. Indeed, the use of lithium-based admixtures has been acknowledged as a preventive measure for over 50 years.

40|$|A small-cluster {{approximation}} {{has been}} used to calculate the activation barriers for the d. c. conductivity in ionic glasses. The main emphasis of this approach is on the importance of the hitherto ignored polarization energy contribution to the total activation energy. For the first time it has been demonstrated that the d. c. conductivity activation energy can be calculated by considering <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> to a neighbouring vacancy in a smali cluster of ions consisting of face-sharing anion polyhedra. The activation energies from the model calculations have been compared with the experimental values in the case of highly modified lithium thioborate glasses...|$|E
40|$|The as-grown {{aged and}} {{thermally}} annealed at 720 K and 820 K PbTiO 3 crystals were prepared. The ɛ′(T,f) and σAC(T,f) were measured at radio frequencies. Samples heated at 720 K shown resistive switching to metallic-type σAC(T). The resistivity switching {{was confirmed by}} RDC(T) measurement. The samples annealed at 820 K were rejuvenated, exhibited Curie-Weiss dependence above TC = 750 K and semiconductor conductivity. Annealing induced changes in shape of the Pb 4 f, Ti 2 p, O 1 s, and VB XPS lines. We propose a model related to <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> toward FE domain walls and to vortices which provide conducting channels...|$|E
40|$|The {{localized}} {{dielectric breakdown}} {{had been considered}} as the driving force for growth of plasma electrolytic oxide (PEO) coatings for several decades. However, the TEM study here reveals the dielectric breakdown behavior has little contribution for coating thickening. The presented evidences show the nature of PEO coating growth in all three consecutive stages I-III is <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> behavior inside the amorphous alumina layer (AAL) at the coating/matrix interface. The evolution of morphological characterizations in the PEO process is attributed to the interfacial reactions of AAL/alkaline (stage I), AAL/discharge-on-surface (stage II) and AAL/discharge-in-pore (stage III).

40|$|Carbonate {{aggregates}} {{will react}} with alkalies from the cement paste in concretes under certain conditions. Several types of reaction are possible, and one involving dolomitic aggregates which contain intergranular clays {{can lead to}} disruptive x-pansion in the concrete. This reaction of dolomite with cement alkalies is essentially one of dedolomitization, a com-plex reaction rim containing three recognizable zones de-velops at the interface between the cement paste and aggre-gate. The details of the reaction processes and of <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> with time have been followed using electron probe microanalysis. The effect {{of the presence of}} additional al-kalies and of sodium chloride on the reaction processes and speed are also discussed on the basis of microanalytical data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{thermoelectric}} power study of pure bismuth oxide (BiO 3), and preliminary measurements for two novel materials {{which have been}} reported as good oxygen ion conductors, namely bismuth vanadium oxide (Bi 4 V 2 O 11) and copper-doped bismuth vanadium oxide (Bi 2 V 0. 925 Cu 0. 075 O. 3875). The measurements for delta-Bi 2 O 3 allowed a reliable estimate {{to be made of}} the heat of transport for oxygen ions which provide evidence for a complex mechanism of <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> in this system. For the other two materials the work suggests that reducing the oxygen partial pressure modifies the defect and/or electronic structures and merits further investigation...|$|E
30|$|Te (y[*]=[*] 0.04) {{substrates}} from a Te-rich solution at 450  °C by liquid-phase epitaxy. The {{samples were}} irradiated by B+ and Ag+ ions {{on the side}} of the MCT epilayer (d[*]=[*] 17  μm) on “Vezuviy” implanter. The implantation energy and dose were 100  keV and Q[*]=[*] 3 [*]×[*] 1013  cm− 2, respectively. Post-implantation thermal treatments were carried out under an Ar atmosphere at 75  °C for 5  h [22]. The temperature conditions and the technique of heat treatment of the samples allowed us to avoid the oxidation of the distorted layer (“to observe” a surface charge) and to activate <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> in the layer. All processed surfaces were examined after ion bombardment using atomic force (Digital Instruments NanoScope IIIa operating in the tapping mode) and a scanning electron microscope (MIRA 3 TESCAN).|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} {{process of}} anodic film on aluminium {{was investigated in}} the bath containing adipic acid and sulfuric acid (ASA bath) by using dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS). An interface reaction and <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> mechanism of anodic oxidation process in the ASA bath was established to interpreting the DEIS data. The impedance was decrease {{with the addition of}} adipic acid added in the anodizing bath, because of the adsorption of adipic anions on the surface of oxide film. An electrical equivalent circuit (EEC) model was established to analyse the relationship of the EEC model elements with the applied potential. The results indicated that the addition of adipic acid into the anodizing bath was beneficial to the grown of oxide film on aluminium, like faster in grown rate and thicker in thickness...|$|E
30|$|Once in the alveoli, {{the water}} is absorbed from the alveoli toward the {{interstitium}} by active transepithelial <b>ionic</b> <b>migration,</b> which creates an osmotic gradient leading to water reabsorption toward the interstitium [20]. This water then goes into the interstitial edema drainage circuit. Thus, alveolar edema resorption is not performed by communicating vessels with pulmonary circulation. During ARDS, active transport of ions and fluid by the epithelium is altered due to rupture of the alveolocapillary barrier and epithelial cell dysfunction. Water reabsorption requires that the fluid leak first be reduced not only by reduction of endothelial permeability but also possibly by modifications in epithelial cell form, making the epithelium more solidly impermeable. Alveolar fluid clearance is altered in most patients with ARDS, so maintenance of normal clearance or its increase {{is reported to be}} associated with better outcome [21].|$|E
30|$|The model {{combines}} the seemingly incompatible advantages {{of both the}} white-box models (capturing key physics) and the black-box models (amenable to control design). The proposed modeling approach provides {{an interpretation of the}} sophisticated physical processes involved in IPMC actuation from a systems perspective. The model development starts from the governing PDE [35, 36] that describes the charge redistribution dynamics under external electrical field, electrostatic interactions, ionic diffusion, and <b>ionic</b> <b>migration</b> along the thickness direction. The model incorporates the effect of distributed surface resistance, which is known to influence the actuation behavior of IPMCs [37]. Moreover, by converting the original PDE into the Laplace domain, an exact solution is obtained, leading to a compact, analytical model in the form of infinite-dimensional transfer function. The model can be further reduced to low-order models, which again carry physical interpretations and are geometrically scalable.|$|E
