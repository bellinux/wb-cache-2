40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} mesh {{generation}} {{is very important}} for the computational simulation of the <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> pump. According to the special characteristics of the <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> pump, there exist a great amount of poor-quality elements, most of which are so called Sliver elements, generated by the tetrahedral mesh generation algorithms of Advancing Front Technique (AFT) and Delaunay Triangulation. By studying the type, distribution and reason of the badly shaped elements, a method to eliminate these Sliver elements was proposed. Then this method was combined with advanced optimization-based smoothing, Laplacian smoothing and swapping optimization to optimize the tetrahedral mesh. The computer language C++ is applied to develop the algorithms. Computational experiments of a <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> pump shown that the worst elements can be removed and the whole quality can be improved noticeably. After comparing the result of numerical simulation with that of the experiment, it is believed that the tetrahedral mesh optimization algorithm can satisfy the computational simulation of the <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> pump...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{authors have}} {{proposed}} that wormhole routing in 2 D meshes be made fully adaptive by doubling the number of channels {{in one of the}} two dimensions. We examine this proposition both using a new model for designing adaptive routing algorithms and using simulations. The model involves analyzing the directions in which packets can turn in a network and the cycles that the turns can form. Breaking all of the cycles by prohibiting a minimum number of turns produces routing algorithms that are deadlock free and maximally adaptive. Applying the model to 2 D meshes shows that <b>doubling</b> the <b>channels</b> in one dimension is required for fully adaptive routing; <b>doubling</b> the <b>channels</b> in only one direction or two orthogonal directions is not sufficient. Applying the model to 2 D meshes with <b>double</b> <b>channels</b> in one dimension also produces a new, fully adaptive routing algorithm. This algorithm is more adaptive than the previous fully adaptive routing algorithm. Simulations of the fully adaptive routing [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) is a gas-phase {{thin film}} deposition technology {{characterized by the}} alternate exposure of chemical species with self-limiting surface reactions, providing extremely high uniformity, as well as thickness and composition control for the deposition of various oxides, nitrides, and sulfides [8 – 11]. Especially, ALD can produce high quality films at a relatively low temperature, making it compatible with both glass and plastic transparent substrates [12]. Furthermore, oxide thin films processed by ALD are compatible not only with planar device architecture, but also with emerging 3 D device architectures because ALD is capable of depositing conformal and uniform thin films {{on a wide range}} of substrates and geometries [13]. The material development for active layers grown by ALD is a key issue for the fabrication of TFTs based on all ALD processes. Recently, Wang YH et al. reported the effects of post-annealing on the performance of ALD ZnO/Al 2 O 3 thin-film transistors [14]. Kwon S et al. reported that the processing temperatures have a huge impact on the characteristics of ALD ZnO thin film transistors [15]. Ahn CH et al. reported Al doped ZnO channel layers TFTs with improved electrical stability fabricated by atomic layer deposition at a relatively low temperature [7]. As advanced architecture for high performance TFTs, <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> devices have been widely investigated [16]. In particular, <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> structure is a simple and an effective method for optimizing the carrier concentrations and channel resistivity, leading to higher on-state current and mobility [17].

Kim SI et al. reported high performance ITO/GIZO double active layer TFTs formed by a radio frequency magnetron sputtering [19]. While <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> TFTs fabricated by sputtering were reported previously, the applications of the double-channel devices deposited by ALD have rarely been studied to date.|$|R
