5|$|Hurricane Patricia set {{multiple}} {{records for}} maximum strength, rate of intensification, {{and rate of}} weakening throughout its relatively short existence. With maximum sustained winds of 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Patricia is the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the Western Hemisphere. In terms of central pressure, {{it is also the}} second-most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide, <b>just</b> <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). Patricia's one-minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone, surpassing Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. The magnitude of Patricia's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed. In a 24-hour period, 06:00–06:00UTC October22–23, its maximum sustained winds increased from 85mph (140km/h) to 205mph (335km/h), a record increase of 120mph (195km/h). During the same period, Patricia's central pressure fell by 95mbar (hPa; 2.81inHg). Despite record over-water weakening prior to striking Mexico, Patricia became the most intense Pacific hurricane to make landfall, with a pressure of 932mbar (hPa; 27.52inHg).|$|E

5|$|With maximum {{sustained}} {{winds of}} 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Hurricane Patricia is the second-most intense tropical cyclone ever observed, <b>just</b> <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> Typhoon Tip in 1979 {{which had a}} minimum pressure of 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). It is also the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.

In the Eastern Pacific basin, north of the equator and east of the International Dateline, the previous basin record-holder was Hurricane Linda in 1997 with winds of 185mph (295km/h) and a pressure of 902mbar (hPa; 26.64inHg).

5|$|After {{maintaining}} Category5 {{status for}} about 12hours, Ivan began a steady weakening trend {{due to an}}other eyewall replacement cycle until reaching winds of 140mph (225km/h) on September 10. Early next day, the hurricane reorganized as it reached winds <b>just</b> <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> Category5 status. However, weakening occurred again due to an eyewall replacement cycle, and at 0330UTC on September 11 Ivan passed 23miles (37km) south of Portland Point, Jamaica, its closest approach, with winds of 150mph (240km/h). The hurricane was previously forecast to make landfall on the island, though the weakening and a turn to the west kept the strongest winds offshore; however, sustained winds of Category4 status were reported. While passing {{to the south of}} the island, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, with several stations reporting over 2feet (60cm) of precipitation. Ivan's last-minute turn to the west was due to a mid-level high pressure system over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. A slight weakening trend continued after passing the island, due to its northern outflow being disrupted by an upper-level low over the Bahamas. As it tracked further away from Jamaica, Ivan again rapidly intensified to Category5 status, and early on September 12 it reached its peak intensity of 165mph (265km/h) with a pressure of 910mbar (26.87inHg).|$|E
5|$|Airfields, harbors and {{shipping}} {{were also the}} targets on October 12, this time in northern Formosa. These {{would be the first}} strikes Fighting 18 executed in the face of both significant anti-aircraft fire and airborne interception by enemy planes. The first fighter sweep of the day launched into overcast skies at 06:17 and headed for Shinchiku Airfield with VF-18 flying low cover. Unfortunately, the Japanese were alerted to the formation's presence ahead of time, and the morning's protective cloud cover dissipated above Shinchiku. Flak of all calibers was intense as a result. Harris and the other Intrepid fighters led the way in, pushing over in glide bombing attacks on hangars around the strip. After the bombs dropped, the fighters headed north for their next target, Matsuyama Airfield. On the way to Matsuyama the cloud cover thickened once more. <b>Just</b> <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> Taien Airfield, VF-18 pilots spotted six Japanese bombers working their way down through a layer of clouds, seemingly on a landing approach.

5|$|The 1950s saw {{the rise}} of yet more dynasties and power programs. Oklahoma, under coach Bud Wilkinson, won three {{national}} titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten Big Eight Conference championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. Woody Hayes led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three Big Ten titles—more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw {{a revival of the}} running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged <b>just</b> <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. Paul Hornung, Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.|$|E
5|$|The ITCZ became {{active in}} late March, {{spawning}} several areas of convection across the Indian Ocean {{and into the}} adjacent Australian basin. The westernmost system had a circulation as of March31 about 600km (370mi) west-southwest of Diego Garcia. Despite favorable conditions, the system failed to organize at first, although it became Tropical Disturbance 9 on April2 after the structure improved. Drifting to the southwest and later to the south, the associated convection waxed and waned, finally organizing more on April4; on that day, the disturbance quickly intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Evariste. A day prior, the JTWC had initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S. A trough to the south weakened the ridge, turning the storm to the southwest. A small eye formed on April5, but later dissipated after an increase in thunderstorm activity. On that day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 110km/h (70mph), <b>just</b> <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> tropical cyclone status, while the JTWC estimated 1minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). On April6, increased wind shear from the approaching trough began weakening Evariste and turned it to the south. That day, it passed about 135km (85mph) east of St. Brandon, and on April7, Evariste bypassed Rodrigues about 200km (125mi) to the southwest. The convection gradually deteriorated and left the circulation exposed. Late on April7, the storm suddenly turned southwestward toward a developing low east of Madagascar, although the southwest motion resumed soon after. On April8, Evariste dissipated, dissipating ahead of the nearby trough.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few hours}} of developing, the {{depression}} quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Manuel. By early on September14, an eye feature developed as rainbands increased. However, Manuel was embedded within a broad weather system that extended from the eastern Pacific across Mexico, which included Hurricane Ingrid in the Bay of Campeche on the Gulf of Mexico coast. The broad system, including Manuel, moved generally northward. By early on September15, Manuel had developed a central dense overcast, with a 17mi (28km) wide eye in the center. Based on the structure and satellite-intensity estimates, the NHC estimated Manuel attained secondary peak winds of , <b>just</b> <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> hurricane status. The agency noted the potential for further strengthening into a hurricane, citing the warm waters, moist environment, and low shear. A break in the subtropical ridge to the north allowed the storm to initially continue generally to the north-northeast, but after attaining its secondary peak, Manuel turned back to the northwest while accelerating. On September15, Manuel made landfall near Aquila in Michoacán as a high-end tropical storm, though operationally, it was believed to have moved ashore near Manzanillo in Colima. Early on September16, the storm weakened into a tropical depression after the circulation became disrupted, although it continued dropping heavy rainfall. Later that day, the surface center dissipated over western Mexico.|$|E
