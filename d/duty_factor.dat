40|$|Abstract: Models for {{exposure}} assessment of high frequency electromagnetic fields from mobile phone base stations need the technical {{data of the}} base stations as input. One of these parameters, the Equivalent Radiated Power (ERP), is a time-varying quantity, depending on communication traffic. In order to determine temporal averages of the exposure, corresponding averages of the ERP have to be available. These can be determined as <b>duty</b> <b>factors,</b> the ratios of the time-averaged power to the maximum output power according to the transmitter setting. We determine <b>duty</b> <b>factors</b> for UMTS from the data of 37 base stations in the Swisscom network.

Demand and <b>duty</b> <b>factors</b> were measured for selected equipment [air compressors, electric furnaces, injection-molding machines, a welder, a granulator (plastics grinder), a sheet metal press and brake, a lathe, a process chiller, and cooling tower pumps and fans] in two industrial plants. Demand factors for heavily loaded air compressors were found to be near 100 %, for lightly loaded centrifugal equipment (lathe, sheet metal shear and brake, and granulator) near 10 %, and for injection-molding machines near 50 %. The measured demand factors differ from those often estimated during energy surveys. <b>Duty</b> <b>factors</b> for some equipment were found to exceed 100 %, showing that some loads were on for longer periods than that indicated by plant personnel. Comparing a detailed summary of equipment rated loads to annual utility bills, when measurements are not available, can prevent over-estimation of the demand and <b>duty</b> <b>factors</b> for a plant. Raw unadjusted estimates of demand factors of 60 % or higher are often made, yet comparisons of rated loads to utility bills show that some equipment demand factors may be 50 % or less. This project tested a simple beacon alerting system, which used a blue strobe light to alert plant personnel when a preset demand limit had been reached.

5000|$|The Fermi {{satellite}} has now observed both {{long and}} short gamma ray bursts that emit multi-GeV gamma rays. No high energy cut off is observed {{in any of these}} GRBs, and the highest energy gamma ray observed in the three brightest bursts were emitted (i.e. corrected for the observed redshift) at energies of 70, 60, 94, and 61 GeV in GRBs 080916C, 090510, 090902B, and 090926 respectively. The highest energy gamma-rays require a bulk Lorentz factor of the outflow of nearly 1000 in order to have the rest-frame energies and photon densities be low enough to avoid attenuation by pair production interactions.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the adaptability of a biped robot controlled by nonlinear oscillators with phase resetting based on central pattern generators, {{we examined the}} walking behavior of a biped robot on a splitbelt treadmill that has two parallel belts controlled independently. In an experiment, we demonstrated the dynamic interactions among the robot mechanical system, the oscillator control system, and the environment. The robot produced stable walking on the splitbelt treadmill at various belt speeds without changing the control strategy and parameters, despite a large discrepancy between the belt speeds. This is due to modulation of the locomotor rhythm and its phase through the phase resetting mechanism, which induces the relative phase between leg movements to shift from antiphase, and causes the <b>duty</b> <b>factors</b> to be autonomously modulated depending on the speed discrepancy between the belts. Such shifts of the relative phase and modulations of the <b>duty</b> <b>factors</b> are observed during human splitbelt treadmill walking.

40|$|Introduction: In {{this paper}} a {{simulation}} model for predicting the temperature during {{the application of}} focused ultrasound (FUS) for stroke treatment using pulsed ultrasound is presented. Materials and methods: A single element spherically focused transducer of 5 cm diameter, focusing at 10 cm and operating at either 0. 5 MHz or 1 MHz was considered. The power field was estimated using the Khokhlov-Zabolot-skaya-Kuznetzov (KZK) model. The temperature was estimated using the bioheat equation. The goal was to extract the acoustic parameters (frequency, power, and <b>duty</b> <b>factor)</b> that maintain a temperature increase of less than 1 oC during {{the application of a}} pulse ultrasound protocol. Results: It was found that the temperature change increases linearly with <b>duty</b> <b>factor.</b> The higher the power, the lower the <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> needed to keep the temperature change to the safe limit of 1 oC. The higher the frequency the lower the <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> needed to keep the temperature change to the safe limit of 1 oC. Finally, the shallow the target, the lower the <b>duty</b> <b>factor</b> needed to keep the temper-ature change to the safe limit of 1 oC. The simulation model was tested in brain tissue during the application of pulse ultrasound and the measured temperature was in close agreement with the simulated tem-perature. Conclusions: This simulation model is con-sidered to be very useful tool for providing acoustic parameters (frequency, power, and <b>duty</b> <b>factor)</b> dur-ing the application of pulsed ultrasound at various depths in tissue so that a safe temperature is main-tained during the treatment. This model will be tested eventually during stroke clinical trials...|$|E

40|$|Although much {{is known}} about the {{terrestrial}} locomotion of great apes, their arboreal locomotion has been studied less extensively. This study investigates arboreal locomotion in bonobos (Pan paniscus), focusing on the gait characteristics and spatio-temporal variables associated with locomotion on a pole. These features are compared across different substrate inclinations (0 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, and 90 °), and horizontal quadrupedal walking is compared between an arboreal and a terrestrial substrate. Our results show greater variation in footfall patterns with increasing incline, resulting in more lateral gait sequences. During climbing on arboreal inclines, smaller steps and strides but higher stride frequencies and <b>duty</b> <b>factors</b> are found compared to horizontal arboreal walking. This may facilitate better balance control and dynamic stability on the arboreal substrate. We found no gradual change in spatio-temporal variables with increasing incline; instead, the results for all inclines were clustered together. Bonobos take larger strides at lower stride frequencies and lower <b>duty</b> <b>factors</b> on a horizontal arboreal substrate than on a flat terrestrial substrate. We suggest that these changes are the result of the better grip of the grasping feet on an arboreal substrate. Speed modulation of the spatio-temporal variables is similar across substrate inclinations and between substrate types, suggesting a comparable underlying motor control. Finally, we contrast these variables of arboreal inclined climbing with those of terrestrial bipedal locomotion, and briefly discuss the results with respect to the origin of habitual bipedalism. Am.
