5|$|The {{history of}} {{organometallic}} chemistry includes the 19th-century discoveries of Zeise's salt and nickel tetracarbonyl. These compounds posed {{a challenge to}} chemists as the compounds did not fit with <b>existing</b> <b>chemical</b> bonding models. A further challenge arose {{with the discovery of}} ferrocene, the iron analogue of rhodocene and the first of the class of compounds now known as metallocenes. Ferrocene was found to be unusually chemically stable, as were analogous chemical structures including rhodocenium, the unipositive cation of rhodocene and its cobalt and iridium counterparts. The study of organometallic species including these ultimately {{led to the development of}} new bonding models that explained their formation and stability. Work on sandwich compounds, including the rhodocenium-rhodocene system, earned Geoffrey Wilkinson and Ernst Otto Fischer the 1973 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.|$|E

5000|$|Currently <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals</b> on {{the market}} {{are listed in the}} TSCA Inventory. Though tasked with {{protecting}} the public from dangerous and potentially carcinogenic substances, some 62,000 chemicals were never tested by the EPA because they were [...] "grandfathered in and statutorily not considered an [...] "unreasonable risk." [...] Without testing, TSCA grandfathered the use of these chemicals into TSCA's list of [...] "existing" [...] (as opposed to [...] "new") <b>chemicals.</b> For <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals,</b> manufacturers need to generate and report data on risk, manufacturing and processing, adverse health effects, published and unpublished health and safety studies, and [...] "substantial risks." [...] to the EPA Also, manufacturers need to report their chemicals’ significant new use rules (SNURs), but this triggers a further Pre-Manufacturing Notice (PMN) process of <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The PMN screening system gives the EPA little support for gathering information about <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals,</b> which constitute the vast amount of chemicals in commerce. Yet, under section 4, the EPA has the authority to require manufacturers to test <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals,</b> but in each case the EPA must make several formal findings, the first of which is subject to judicial review under the [...] "substantial evidence" [...] standard. In particular, the requirement that the EPA determine that the chemical [...] "may present an unreasonable risk" [...] creates a regulatory Catch-22 as such a determination requires much of the very data that the EPA cannot access or cause to be generated without first making the determination.|$|R

50|$|Throughout history, {{chemical}} weapons {{have been used}} as strategic weaponry to devastate the enemy in times of war. After the mass destruction created by WWI and WWII, {{chemical weapons}} have been considered to be inhumane by most nations, and governments and organizations have undertaken to locate and destroy <b>existing</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons. However, not all nations have been willing to cooperate with disclosing or demilitarizing their inventory of chemical weapons. Since the start of the worldwide efforts to destroy all <b>existing</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons, some nations and terrorist organizations have used and threatened the use of chemical weapons to leverage their position in conflict. Notable examples include the use of such weapons by Iraq’s Saddam Hussein on the Kurdish village Halabja in 1988 and their employment against civilian passengers of the Tokyo subway by Aum Shinrikyo in 1995. The efforts made by the United States and other chemical weapon destruction agencies intend to prevent such use, but this is a difficult and ongoing effort. Aside from the difficulties of cooperation and locating chemical weapons, the methods to destroy the weapons and to do this safely are also a challenge.|$|E
