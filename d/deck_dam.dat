40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to identify the causes of longitudinal cracking in newly placed concrete deck segments adjacent to bridge <b>deck</b> expansion <b>dam</b> rehabilitations within District 3 - 0 of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). This objective was accomplished through three tasks. (1) A literature review of the potential causes of early-age cracking in restrained concrete elements, including bridge <b>deck</b> <b>dams</b> and concrete repair sections, was conducted. This task also included a survey of bridge engineers in other PennDOT districts and several other state DOTs and municipalities with regard to concrete bridge deck rehabilitation operations and occurrence of concrete early-age cracking. (2) A review of current PennDOT specifications related to bridge dec...|$|R
5|$|Longtime Quarter Horse breeder and racehorse owner Walter Merrick of Sayre, Oklahoma, bred Easy Jet {{from two}} future AQHA Hall of Fame members, Jet Deck and Thoroughbred mare Lena's Bar in 1967. His dam, or mother, Lena's Bar, had {{produced}} {{a small number}} of other offspring, but Easy Jet was her last; she died shortly after he was weaned, or removed from his mother's milk. Both of his parents were descended from Three Bars, who was the sire of Lena's Bar and the grandsire of Jet <b>Deck's</b> <b>dam.</b> Easy Jet is one of only two horses in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame to have both parents in the Hall of Fame; his two grandsires, Moon Deck and Three Bars, are also in the Hall of Fame.|$|R
40|$|Cracking {{of newly}} placed binary Portland cement-slag {{concrete}} adjacent to bridge <b>deck</b> expansion <b>dam</b> replacements {{has been observed}} on several newly rehabilitated sections of bridge decks. This paper investigates the causes of cracking by assessing the concrete mixtures specified for bridge deck rehabilitation projects, as well as reviewing the structural design of decks and the construction and curing methods implemented by the contractors. The work consists of (1) a comprehensive literature review {{of the causes of}} cracking on bridge decks, (2) a review of previous bridge deck rehabilitation projects that experienced early-age cracking along with construction observations of active deck rehabilitation projects, and (3) an experimental evaluation of the two most commonly used bridge deck concrete mixtures. Based on the literature review, the causes of concrete bridge deck cracking can be classified into three categories: concrete material properties, construction practices, and structural design factors. The most likely causes of the observed early-age cracking were found to be inadequate curing and failure to properly eliminate the risk of plastic shrinkage cracking. These results underscore the significance of proper moist curing methods for concrete bridge decks, including repair sections. This document also provides a blueprint for future researchers to investigate early-age cracking of concrete structures...|$|R
50|$|Engineering hazards {{occur when}} {{structures}} used by people fail or {{the materials used}} in their construction prove to be hazardous. This history of construction has many examples of hazards associated with structures including bridge failures such as the Tay Bridge disaster caused by under-design, the Silver Bridge collapse caused by corrosion attack or the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge caused by aerodynamic flutter of the <b>deck.</b> Failure of <b>dams</b> was not infrequent during the Victorian era, such as the Dale Dyke dam failure in Sheffield, England in 1864, causing the Great Sheffield Flood, which killed at least 240 people. In 1889, {{the failure of the}} South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River near Johnstown, Pennsylvania, produced the Johnstown Flood, which killed over 2,200. Other failures include balcony collapses, aerial walkway collapses such as the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse in Kansas City in 1981, and building collapses such as that of the World Trade Center in New York City in 2001 during the September 11 attacks.|$|R
