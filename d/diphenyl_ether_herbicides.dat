40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of the p-nitrodiphenyl <b>ether</b> <b>herbicides</b> has remained ambiguous because of conflicting reports in the literature. The <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> <b>herbicide</b> oxyfluorfen causes a light induced consumption of oxygen which resembles the electron acceptor reaction of paraquat. However, this reaction is not linked to the transport of electrons through photosystem I. This conclusion {{is based on the}} observation that the rate of oxygen consumption, in the presence of oxyfluorfen, does not demonstrate a first order rate dependence on light intensity. Using the bleaching of N,N-dimethyl p-nitrosoaniline as a specific detector of singlet oxygen, we demonstrate that oxyfluorfen is a potent generator of this toxic radical. The production of singlet oxygen occurs in the presence of inhibitors of photosynthetic electron transport (oxyfluorfen at 10 − 4 molar and paraquat) and also under temperature conditions (3 °C) which prevent electron transport. This light induced reaction results in oxygen consumption and is the primary cause of lethality for oxyfluorfen. The production of singlet oxygen occurs rapidly and at low herbicide concentrations (10 − 9 molar). The reaction occurs without photosynthetic electron transport but does require an intact thylakoid membrane...|$|R

Possible effects of acifluorfen-methyl on these enzymes were investigated in isolated corn (maize, Zea mays) etioplasts, potato (Solanum tuberosum) and mouse mitochondria, and yeast mitochondrial membranes. Acifluorfen-methyl was strongly inhibitory to protoporphyrinogen oxidase activities whatever their origins [concn. causing 50 % inhibition (IC 50) = 4 nM for the corn etioplast enzyme]. By contrast, it was roughly 100, 000 times less active on (Mg or Fe) -chelatase activities (IC 50 = 80 - 100 microM).

40|$|Photosynthesis is not {{required}} for the toxicity of <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> <b>herbicides,</b> nor are chloroplast thylakoids the primary site of diphenyl ether herbicide activity. Isolated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplast fragments produced malonyl dialdehyde, indicating lipid peroxidation, when paraquat (1, 1 ′-dimethyl- 4, 4 ′-bipyridinium ion) or diuron [3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea] {{were added to the}} medium, but no malonyl dialdehyde was produced when chloroplast fragments were treated with the methyl ester of acifluorfen (methyl 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 2 -nitrobenzoic acid), oxyfluorfen [2 -chloro- 1 -(3 -ethoxy- 4 -nitrophenoxy) - 4 -(trifluoromethyl) benzene], or MC 15608 (methyl 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 2 -chlorobenzoate). In most cases the toxicity of acifluorfen-methyl, oxyfluorfen, or MC 15608 to the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas eugametos (Moewus) did not decrease after simultaneous treatment with diuron. However, diuron significantly reduced cell death after paraquat treatment at all but the highest paraquat concentration tested (0. 1 millimolar). These data indicate electron transport of photosynthesis is not serving the same function for <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> <b>herbicides</b> as for paraquat. Additional evidence for differential action of paraquat was obtained from the superoxide scavenger copper penicillamine (copper complex of 2 -amino- 3 -mercapto- 3 -methylbutanoic acid).

A decrease in δ 15 N values was observed in the nymphs collected in mixture-treated ponds, which was presumably due to an increase in the abundance of rotifers and Chironominae larvae in these ponds.

40|$|Activated oxygen or oxygen free {{radicals}} have {{been implicated in}} a number of physiological disorders in plants including freezing injury. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into O 2 and H 2 O 2 and thereby reduces the titer of activated oxygen molecules in the cell. To further examine the relationship between oxidative and freezing stresses, the expression of SOD was modified in transgenic alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). The Mn-SOD cDNA from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia {{under the control of the}} cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter was introduced into alfalfa using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Two plasmid vectors, pMitSOD and pChlSOD, contained a chimeric Mn-SOD construct with a transit peptide for targeting to the mitochondria or one for targeting to the chloroplast, respectively. The putatively transgenic plants were selected for resistance to kanamycin and screened for neomycin phosphotransferase activity and the presence of an additional Mn-SOD isozyme. Detailed analysis of a set of four selected transformants indicated that some had enhanced SOD activity, increased tolerance to the <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> <b>herbicide,</b> acifluorfen, and increased regrowth after freezing stress. The F 1 progeny of one line, RA 3 -ChlSOD- 30, were analyzed by SOD isozyme activity, by polymerase chain reaction for the Mn-SOD gene, and by polymerase chain reaction for the neo gene. RA 3 -ChlSOD- 30 had three sites of insertion of pChlSOD, but only one gave a functional Mn-SOD isozyme; the other two were apparently partial insertions. The progeny with a functional Mn-SOD transgene had more rapid regrowth following freezing stress than those progeny lacking the functional Mn-SOD transgene, suggesting that Mn-SOD serves a protective role by minimizing oxygen free radical production after freezing stress...|$|R
40|$|Ecotoxicological {{effects of}} the <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> <b>herbicide</b> fomesafen, applied alone or in {{combination}} with the adjuvant Agral 90 ® (mixture of polyethoxylated derivatives of nonylphenol), were assessed on planktonic communities in 18 -m 3 outdoor mesocosms during a nine-month study. Four mesocosms were treated with fomesafen only (nominal concentration: 40 μg/L), four were treated with the mixture fomesafen–Agral 90 (nominal concentration: 40 μg/L and 90 μg/L, respectively), and four were kept as the controls. Five treatments were performed every three weeks from April 18, 2000. Mean (± standard error [SE]) values of fomesafen concentration in water of 62. 5 (± 5. 3) and 19. 4 (± 7. 6) μg/L were measured {{at the end of the}} treatment period in fomesafen- and mixture-treated mesocosms, respectively. Fomesafen, either alone or in mixture with Agral 90, had a significant positive effect on the abundance and biovolume of Cyanobacteria, Cryptophyceae, Dinophyceae, and Bacillariophyceae. Chlorophyceae were inhibited by the herbicide and laboratory toxicity tests confirmed that green algae were more sensitive toward fomesafen than other algal classes. A positive effect of treatments on phytoplankton taxonomic diversity also was observed, indicating that, like natural disturbances of intermediate strength, xenobiotics sometimes may enhance the diversity of algal communities. Fomesafen alone did not have any clear effect on zooplankton. Abundance of calanoid copepods was reduced significantly in the mixture-treated ponds, suggesting either a direct effect of the adjuvant and/or an enhancement of herbicide toxicity by Agral 90. The abundance of other zooplanktonic herbivorous groups increased due to a reduced competition for food for herbivorous species and a higher availability of preys for predators. No algal bloom was observed in the treated ponds, presumably because of grazing pressure and the low availability of nutrients...|$|R

The test compounds were classified into nine groups: organochlorines, diphenyl ethers, organophosphorus pesticides, pyrethroids, carbamates, acid amides, triazines, ureas, and others. These pesticides were tested at concentrations < 10 - 5 M. Of the 200 pesticides tested, 47 and 33 showed hER- and hERbeta-mediated estrogenic activities, respectively. Among them, 29 pesticides had both hERalpha and hERbeta agonistic activities, {{and the effects of}} the organochlorine insecticides beta-benzene hexachloride (BHC) and delta-BHC and the carbamate insecticide methiocarb were predominantly hERbeta rather than hERalpha agonistic. Weak antagonistic effects toward hERalpha and hERbeta were shown in five and two pesticides, respectively. On the other hand, none of tested pesticides showed hAR-mediated androgenic activity, but 66 of 200 pesticides exhibited inhibitory activity against the transcriptional activity induced by 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone.

It also inhibited the increase in cell density of the alga in light-grown cultures with an I 50 (concentration required to decrease cell density increase to 50 % of the noninhibited control value) of 0. 16 μm. The relative ability of four peroxidizing <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> <b>herbicides</b> to cause tetrapyrrole accumulation in C. reinhardtii correlated qualitatively with their ability to inhibit the increase in cell density in light-grown cultures. The purified S(−) enantiomer of the optically active phthalide DPE 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 3 -methylphthalide (DPEIII), which has greater herbicidal activity than the R(+) isomer, induces a 4 - to 5 -fold greater tetrapyrrole accumulation than the R(+) isomer.

The specific activity (expressed as nanomoles of protoporphyrin formed per hour per milligram protein) in the mitochondrial fraction was 8 and in the plasma membrane enriched fraction was 4 to 6. The plasma membrane enriched fraction exhibited minimal cytochrome oxidase activity and no carotenoid content, indicating little contamination with mitochondrial or plastid membranes. Etioplasts from etiolated barley leaves exhibited a protoporphyrinogen oxidase specific activity of 7 to 12. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity in the barley root mitochondrial fraction and etioplast extracts was more than 90 % inhibited by assay {{in the presence of}} the diphenyl ether herbicide acifluorfen methyl, but the activity in the plasma membrane enriched fraction exhibited much less inhibition by this herbicide (12 to 38 % inhibition) under the same assay conditions. Acifluorfen-methyl inhibition of the organellar (mitochondrial or plastid) enzyme was maximal upon preincubation of the enzyme with 4 mm dithiothreitol, although a lesser degree of inhibition was noted if the organellar enzyme was preincubated in the presence of other reductants such as glutathione or ascorbate. Acifluorfen-methyl caused only 20 % inhibition if the enzyme was preincubated in buffer without reductants. Incubation of barley etioplast extracts with the earlier tetrapyrrole precursor coproporphyrinogen and acifluorfen-methyl resulted in the accumulation of protoporphyrinogen, which could be converted to protoporphyrin even {{in the presence of the}} herbicide by the addition of the plasma membrane enriched fraction from barley roots. These findings have implications for the toxicity of <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> <b>herbicides,</b> whose light induced tissue damage is apparently caused by accumulation of the photoreactive porphyrin intermediate, protoporphyrin, when the organellar protoporphyrinogen oxidase enzyme is inhibited by herbicides.

Light- and O 2 -dependent lipid peroxidation and Chl bleaching are also induced by 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 3 -methoxyphthalide (DPEII), a <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> whose redox properties preclude reduction by photosystem I. However, these effects of DPEII are also inhibited by DCMU. Under conditions of high aeration, DCMU does not protect Scenedesmus cells from Chl bleaching induced by DPEI, but does protect against paraquat. DPEI, but not paraquat, induces tetrapyrrole formation in treated cells in the dark. This is also observed in a mutant lacking photosystem I but is suppressed under conditions {{likely to lead to}} O 2 limitation. Our results indicate that, in contrast to paraquat, the role of photosynthetic electron transport in <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> toxicity in Scenedesmus is not to reduce the herbicide to a radical species which initiates lipid peroxidation. Its role is probably to maintain a sufficiently high O 2 concentration, through water-splitting, in the algal suspension...|$|R
