25|$|Improved cargo {{security}} {{is also an}} important benefit of containerization.

But since Atlantic rests inside Canadian waters, the government of Ontario moved to prevent the removal of artifacts from Atlantic, taking the issue to Ontario divisional court.

To protect the wreck, an <b>electronic</b> <b>monitoring</b> system was installed that will alert the Ontario Provincial Police if a vessel stays for too long above the wreck.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, among {{hypertensive}} patients, a brief adherence self-report questionnaire (ASRQ), using <b>electronic</b> <b>monitors</b> (medical event monitoring system, MEMS) as {{the gold}} standard comparator. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A total of 239 patients with hypertension in five general practices in Bristol, UK completed the ASRQ before {{and at the end}} of the 4 -week study period. Patients were asked to choose one of six descriptions (from level 1 =perfect adherence to level 6 =nonadherence) to express their medication taking. The main outcome measure was "timing adherence" (correct interdose intervals) as measured through <b>electronic</b> <b>monitors.</b> RESULTS: Most patients (89 %) stated perfect or nearly perfect adherence, and data from the <b>electronic</b> <b>monitors</b> showed a mean timing adherence of 88. 3 % (n= 216). Using the cutoff of those who reported ASRQ levels 1 and 2 (all tablets taken but not always at the same time of day), a high percentage of those with comparatively high adherence according to MEMS were correctly identified (specificity, 90 - 93 %; negative predictive value, 66 - 96 %). However, sensitivity (detection of true nonadherers) and positive predictive value were poor to moderate (14 - 42 % and 22 - 66 %, respectively). CONCLUSION: The questionnaire could be a useful aid to facilitate the difficult differentiation between nonadherence and nonresponse to prescribed antihypertensive medication...|$|R

25|$|Computers {{have been}} playing an {{increasing}} role in PA for some time (Sulsky & Keown, 1998). There are two main aspects to this. The first is {{in relation to the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>monitoring</b> of performance, which affords the ability to record a huge amount of data on multiple dimensions of work performance (Stanton, 2000). Not only does it facilitate a more continuous and detailed collection of performance data in some jobs, e.g. call centres, but it has the capacity to do so in a non-obvious, covert manner. The second aspect is in mediating the feedback process, by recording and aggregating performance ratings and written observations and making the information available on-line; many software packages are available for this. The use of IT in these ways undoubtedly helps in making the appraisal process more manageable, especially where multiple rating sources are involved, but it also raises many questions about appraisees' reactions and possible effects on PA outcomes. Mostly, the evidence so far is positive.|$|E

After allegations of Tweed's infidelity they broke up, later reconciling. Tweed lived with Goody and her children in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, until his imprisonment for a December 2006 assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a 16-year-old boy. He served four months of an eighteen-month sentence before his release on 27 January 2009 with <b>electronic</b> <b>monitoring</b> and a curfew.

We used 262 <b>electronic</b> <b>monitors</b> to measure adherence with all antiretrovirals in 85 HIV-infected current and former drug users, and found that active cocaine use, female gender, not receiving Social Security benefits, not being married, screening positive for depression, and the tendency to use alcohol or drugs to cope with stress were all significantly associated with poor adherence. The strongest predictor of poor adherence and, in turn, failure to maintain viral suppression, was active cocaine use. Overall adherence among active cocaine users was 27 %, compared to 68 % among subjects who reported no cocaine use during the 6 -month study period. Consequently, 13 % of active cocaine users maintained viral suppression, compared to 46 % of nonusers.
