5|$|The {{settlers}} took shelter {{inside the}} fort {{while the men}} and boys took up their positions at the portholes inside the fort. A vicious firefight erupted, involving around 150 of Black Hawk's British Band. The battle raged {{for about an hour}} with heavy gunfire from both sides. At the battle's onset many of the settlement's women had been <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> and around the cabins, but several married woman, including Elizabeth Armstrong, rallied the women and older children to provide support to the soldiers. She assigned the unmarried young women, boys, and girls as young as eight years old to such tasks as cutting and rolling gunpowder cartridges and molding rifleballs. The married women reloaded the weapons while the soldiers tried to maintain an increased rate of fire.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} {{the debut of}} the TerrorDome and {{involved}} Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. Before the match, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the winner would take Kurt Angle's place in the main event, {{in addition to being}} the TNA X Division Championship number one contender. In this match, the ring was surrounded by a giant red steel barred cage with a domed roof. The wrestlers were to compete as they climbed up the side to a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling; the first to escape the cage would win. While Devine was attempting to escape, Kaz intervened and caused Devine to fall from the ceiling into a group of wrestlers <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> the center of the ring. Kaz then climbed out of the hole to win the contest at ten minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E

25|$|For {{days the}} {{survivors}} <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> a few two-story buildings surrounded by water, {{with little or}} no supplies, power, running water or communications. There was no search and rescue or military presence. Eventually, they evacuated themselves by using their own fishing boats. They headed for higher ground which meant St. Claude Avenue (closer to the Mississippi River) in Arabi and the Kaiser Aluminum plant in Chalmette.|$|E
25|$|Ant {{saw little}} action during the {{remainder}} of the Phoney War, but adopted Bozděch as his master, sleeping at the foot of his bed in barracks. With the end of the Phoney War on 10 May 1940, the airfield at Saint-Dizier was bombed by a wing of German Dornier Do 17s, while Bozděch and Ant were <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> a bunker. The attack destroyed all but fourteen of the planes at the base, and following this the local forces began their retreat. After moving to their third base, Bozděch took the decision to take Ant with him in the Potez 630 for the dog's first combat mission. Ant barely stirred, even when Bozděch was firing the guns at German fighters. The duo were reunited with a recovered Duval, who became Bozděch's pilot once again, while Ant continued to fly with them.|$|E

25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> the corner {{to the point of}} starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|E
25|$|Many {{survivors}} found {{a temporary}} haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> the station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. Sitting quietly in Captain Smith's office, she would suddenly mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, {{the thought that}} {{she had lost her}} purse and was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and she would ask them about H. S. Murdoch, the actor who had been on stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for outerwear. No one had seen him; she would beseech the person to go look for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.|$|E
25|$|Possibly {{because of}} Thornton's delay in {{crossing}} {{the river and}} the withering artillery fire that might hit them from across the river, the 93rd Highlanders were ordered to leave Keane's assault column advancing along the river and move across the open field to join the main force on the right of the field. Keane fell wounded as he crossed the field with the 93rd. Rennie's men managed to attack and overrun an American advance redoubt next to the river, but without reinforcements they could neither hold the position nor successfully storm the main American line behind it. Within a few minutes, the American 7th Infantry arrived, moved forward, and fired upon the British in the captured redoubt: within half an hour, Rennie and nearly all of his men were dead. In the main attack on the right, the British infantrymen either flung themselves to the ground, <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> the canal, or were mowed down by a combination of musket fire and grapeshot from the Americans. A handful {{made it to the top}} of the parapet on the right but were either killed or captured. The 95th Rifles had advanced in open skirmish order ahead of the main assault force and were concealed in the ditch below the parapet, unable to advance further without support.|$|E

25|$|To explain {{himself to}} the people, John ordered that posters be put up along the streets stating that his {{departure}} was unavoidable despite all efforts made to assure the integrity and peace of the kingdom. The posters recommended that everyone remain calm, orderly and not resist the invaders, so that blood not be shed in vain. Because of the rush to depart, the Prince Regent John, Queen Maria, Prince Pedro, Prince of Beira (later Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro IV of Portugal), and the Infante Miguel (later Miguel I of Portugal) were all in a single ship. This was an imprudent decision given the dangers of a transatlantic voyage in that era, since it placed at risk the succession of the crown in case of shipwreck. Carlota Joaquina and the infantas were on two other ships. The {{number of people who}} embarked with John remains a matter of controversy; in the 19th century there was talk of up to 30 thousand emigrants; more recent estimates vary between five hundred and fifteen thousand, the latter being close to the maximum capacity of the squadron of fifteen ships, including their crews. Still, the ships were overcrowded. According to Pedreira e Costa, taking into account all of the variables, the most likely numbers fall between four and seven thousand passengers plus the crews. Many families were separated, and even high officials failed to secure a place on the ships and were left behind. The voyage was not a tranquil one. Several ships were in precarious condition, and overcrowding created humiliating conditions for the nobility, the majority of whom had to sleep <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> the open in the poops. Hygienic conditions were bad, including an epidemic of head lice. Many had failed to bring changes of clothing. Several people fell ill. Supplies were scarce, causing rationing. Furthermore, the flotilla spent ten days nearly becalmed in the equatorial zone under a scorching heat that caused moods to turn quite sour. The flotilla also faced two storms and was eventually dispersed near Madeira. In the middle of the voyage, Prince John changed his plans and decided to head for Salvador, Bahia, probably for political reasons. He wanted to please the inhabitants of the colony's first capital, which had given many signs of discontent with the loss of its old status. The ships carrying his wife and the infantas held to the original destination of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

500|$|FIG {{became the}} first {{publicly}} performing women-only improvising group, and they challenged the established improvising community with performances that were theatrical, with politics and farce supplementing their music. They staged parodies around {{the role of women}} in society and incorporated domestic [...] "found objects" [...] in their performances, including [...] "vacuum cleaners, brooms, dustpans, pots and pans, and egg slicers". Their performances often had some of the women cleaning the stage, while the others <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> a group to [...] "explore the sonic possibilities of household items." [...] They also broke down the barriers that traditionally existed between the performer and the audience by engaging in [...] "antiphonal exchange" [...] with them, and promoting the notion that [...] "anyone can do it". FIG redefined free improvisation by introducing [...] "social virtuosity", the ability to communicate with the other musicians and the audience.|$|E
500|$|Merrick {{arrived at}} Liverpool Street Station on 24 June 1886, safely {{back in his}} own country, but with nowhere to go. He was not {{eligible}} to enter a workhouse in London {{for more than one}} night and would be accepted only by Leicester Union, where he was a permanent resident. Leicester was [...] away. He approached strangers for help, but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant. He drew a crowd of curious onlookers until a policeman helped him into an empty waiting room, where he <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> a corner, exhausted. Unable to make himself understood, his only identifying possession was Frederick Treves's card. The police contacted Treves, who went to the station. Recognising Merrick, Treves took him in a hansom cab to the London Hospital. Merrick was admitted for bronchitis, washed, fed and put to bed in a small isolation room in the hospital's attic.|$|E
500|$|According to Clark, {{the lyrics}} were {{primarily}} his creation, {{with a minor}} contribution being David Crosby's line, [...] "Rain grey town, known for its sound", a reference to London as home to the British Invasion, which was then dominating the U.S. music charts. [...] Other lyrics in the song that explicitly refer to the Byrds' stay in England include the couplet: [...] "Nowhere is there warmth to be found/Among those afraid of losing their ground", which is {{a reference to the}} hostile reaction of the UK music press and to the English group the Birds serving the band with a copyright infringement writ, due to the similarities in name. [...] In addition, [...] "Round the squares, <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> storms/Some laughing, some just shapeless forms" [...] describes fans waiting for the band outside hotels, while the line [...] "Sidewalk scenes and black limousines" [...] refers to the excited crowds that jostled the band as they exited their chauffeur-driven cars.|$|E

500|$|The {{battle at}} Ostrach had been difficult, as Jourdan pointed out, {{due largely to}} the dense fog and terrible weather that {{hampered}} his observation of his enemy's movements, yet the same fog that blinded him to the Austrian movements {{did not seem to}} hamper Charles. [...] The fog and rainy weather did play a role, however. On a local level, in the damp night of the 20th, which was Gründonnerstag, (German: Green Thursday, or Maundy Thursday), the Danube overflowed, backing up into the Ostrach, and causing it to burst its own banks. The flood trapped 300civilians between the two armies intent on destruction; suspecting what was to come, Ostrachers <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> their cellars, and hoped for the best and gasping for breath as the battle thundered overhead. Amazingly, none were killed, although they spent Easter Sunday caring for the wounded, and helping to bury the 4,000or so soldiers who died in the battle.|$|E
500|$|The DLM {{actively}} {{participated in}} the 2005 Independence Intifada(Cedar Revolution), a so-called colour revolution in which hundreds of thousands rallied against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon and its supporters in the Lebanese government. As the only leftist, nonsectarian element in the demonstrations, the DLM proved important for the opposition's public relations. Following the resignation of pro-Syrian Prime Minister Omar Karami {{in a wave of}} demonstrations, DLM leader Elias Atallah is quoted as saying, [...] "Today the government fell. Tomorrow, it's the one <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> Anjar," [...] in reference to the Syrian chief of intelligence based in that city. The New York Times credited Samir Kassir, a founder of the movement, with orchestrating the protests. On 14 March 2005, Atallah addressed the demonstrators, articulating the need for a free, sovereign, and united Lebanon. The DLM called on the protesters to press on to Baabda Palace, residence of the president, hoping to use the momentum to compel Emile Lahoud to resign. However, resistance by Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir prevented this, resulting in a temporary fallout between the DLM and opposition.|$|E
500|$|There was a {{widespread}} expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband; one family friend stated, as William McKinley lay dying, {{that they should}} be prepared for a double funeral. This did not occur; the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train. Leech noted [...] "the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> a compartment of the funeral train, praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love". She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton, although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street. She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life, setting up a shrine in her house, and often visiting the receiving vault, until her death at age 59 on May 26, 1907. She died only months before the completion of the large marble monument to her husband in Canton, which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30, 1907. William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters, atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton.|$|E
