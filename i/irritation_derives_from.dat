30|$|The high {{incidence}} of tendon ruptures after locked plating reported in the literature, even after palmar osteosynthesis due to oversized screws, was not confirmed in our study. This is in accordance with other studies [16]. In most cases of volar plating, tendon <b>irritations</b> seem to <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> technical errors and oversized screws [17]. The problem of oversized screws may <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> the traditional idea that bicortical screw purchase is needed for plate fixation; {{this is not the}} case for internal fixators such as locking plates. As a recent biomechanical study showed, a screw length of 75  % of the anteroposterior cortical distance can result in sufficient buttressing of the joint surface [18]. Nevertheless, if dorsal key fragments need to be fixed, meticulous fluoroscopical control using dynamic and dorsal tangential views can avoid screw oversizing [19, 20]. Tenosynovitis of the flexor was not observed in the present study; however, this could be attributed to the the smaller plate profile and its shape variety (L-, T-plates) with implant placement proximal to the watershed-line [21 – 23].|$|R

The {{objective}} {{of this study are}} to describe the formation of derivational noun found in short story of Boscombe Valley Mystery and to identify the morphological conditioned environment which happen in the derivational noun short story of Boscome Valley Mystery. This research is a descriptive qualitative research. The data are in the form of English words which contain derivational noun from English short story in “Boscombe Valley Mystery”. Technique of collecting data is documentation. The data are analyzed by reading the English short story in “Boscombe Valley Mystery”, classifying the word or sentence to the English words which contain English derivational noun, and identifying the derivational noun process that occurs on English words.
