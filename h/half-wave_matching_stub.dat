40|$|Abstract—A single-feed {{circular}} {{microstrip antenna}} with reconfigurable polarization capability is proposed. This antenna has a simple structure, {{which consists of}} a radiating circular patch, five switches (PIN diode), three <b>matching</b> <b>stubs,</b> and a 50 microstrip feed line. It can be switched between 4 different states: two states (low-frequency and high-frequency) for linear polarization (LP), one state for left hand circular polarization (LHCP) and one for right hand circular polarization (RHCP) by {{controlling the bias voltage}} of two PIN diodes. At the same time, three switchable <b>matching</b> <b>stubs</b> are used for matching every polarization state. Simulation results and experimental results show that the proposed antenna demonstrates a low cross polarization level, good impedance bandwidth, and a very good axial ratio in the circularly polarized states.

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{demonstrates}} {{a method for}} suppressing the side lobe of a tapered short leaky wave antenna (LWA). The pro-posed LWA contains a tapered microstrip radiator with a shorting pin and two rectangular slots. This design of the two slots and the shorting pin can interfere with the current distribution of tapered LWAs to suppress the radiation of the side lobe. A <b>matching</b> <b>stub</b> is added along the feeding line to achieve impedance matching. Ac-cording to the measured results, the proposed design improves the side lobe level (SLL) from 0 dB for the tapered short LWA (about at 4. 5 GHz) to 6. 13 dB for the proposed LWA at 6. 4 GHz.

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{a detailed}} study comprising the simulation, design, construction, and experimental validation of two prototypes of looped-tube travelling wave thermoacoustic electricity generators. The prototypes used air at atmospheric pressure as working gas, an audio loudspeaker as linear alternator, {{while most of}} acoustic resonator parts were made of PVC components. The hot heat exchangers were externally heated. The first prototype was a small size, single-stage generator powered by combustion from a propane gas burner. The feedback pipe includes a branched alternator and an acoustic impedance <b>matching</b> <b>stub.</b> The effect of the heat input on the generator performance has been investigated. 13 W of electrical power, extracted by 12 Ω electric load, was achieved at flue gas temperature of 627. 4 °C and regenerator temperature difference of 430 K. The second prototype was a larger sized (resonator inner diameter is 128 mm) two-stage generator. Here, the heat source was an electric air heat “gun” than provides air stream at 650 °C. Firstly, the single-stage engine was examined at frequencies of 48. 82, 64. 45 and 70. 31 Hz. The experiments show that the streaming can reduce acoustic power from 110. 63 to 63. 4 W at 70. 31 Hz. Furthermore, the acoustic power increases from 111. 45 to 153 W when the frequency is increased from 48. 82 to 64. 45 Hz. Subsequently, a linear alternator {{was attached to the}} engine to convert the produced acoustic power into electricity. At a load of 9 Ω the single-stage generator achieved 8. 52 W of electricity and 1. 47 % efficiency. The generator was further improved by incorporating an identical second stage. The effects of <b>matching</b> <b>stub</b> length, variable load and heat input were investigated. The two-stage prototype generated 14. 18 W of electrical power to a load of 9 Ω with a thermal-to-electrical efficiency of 2. 1 %.

50|$|Stubs {{can be used}} {{to match}} a load {{impedance}} to the transmission line characteristic impedance. The stub is positioned a distance from the load. This distance is chosen so that at that point the resistive part of the load impedance is made equal to the resistive part of the characteristic impedance by impedance transformer action of the length of the main line. The length of the stub is chosen so that it exactly cancels the reactive part of the presented impedance. That is, the stub is made capacitive or inductive according to whether the main line is presenting an inductive or capacitive impedance respectively. This {{is not the same as}} the actual impedance of the load since the reactive part of the load impedance will be subject to impedance transformer action as well as the resistive part. <b>Matching</b> <b>stubs</b> can be made adjustable so that matching can be corrected on test.|$|R
50|$|A {{simple method}} of {{impedance}} <b>matching</b> is <b>stub</b> <b>matching</b> {{with a single}} stub. However, a single stub will only produce a perfect match at one particular frequency. This technique is therefore only suitable for narrow band applications. To widen the bandwidth multiple stubs may be used, and the structure then takes on {{the form of a}} stub filter. The design proceeds {{as if it were a}} filter except that a different parameter is optimised. In a frequency filter typically the parameter optimised is stopband rejection, passband attenuation, steepness of transition, or some compromise between these. In a matching network the parameter optimised is the impedance match. The function of the device does not require a restriction of bandwidth, but the designer is nevertheless forced to choose a bandwidth because of the structure of the device.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{elevated}} coplanar waveguide structure is described which uses airbridge technology to suspend CPW traces above a ground plane resting on a high permittivity substrate. The transmission line is effectively shielded from the substrate and is equivalent to conductor backed CPW with an extremely thin, air substrate. It is, therefore, insensitive to parasitic substrate effects such as surface waves {{and the effect of}} dielectric loss tangent. In comparison with other forms of CPW with typical lateral dimensions, the structure exhibits no high frequency roll-off at frequencies of around 240 GHz and above. Measured results show 2. 5 dB/mm insertion loss at 320 GHz for a 51 Ω line. In order to demonstrate the performance of the new line at mm-wave frequencies, several passive components have been fabricated, measured and their performance compared with CPW counterparts. The experimental results, which are in close agreement with simulation results, for short and open circuited <b>matching</b> <b>stubs,</b> and band-pass and band-stop filters, clearly show improvements in terms of loss and in the characteristics of the frequency response. Also, in order to make some qualitative assessment of the variation in performance with elevation, results for elevations of 6 μm and 13 μm are compared.

The HEMT device employs two fingers each 15 micrometers wide. The HEMT wafers are grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and make use of a pseudomorphic In 0. 75 Ga 0. 25 As channel, a silicon delta-doping layer as the electron supply, an In 0. 52 Al 0. 48 As buffer layer, and an InP substrate. The three-stage design uses coplanar waveguide topology with a very narrow ground-to-ground spacing of 14 micrometers. Quarter-wave matching transmission lines, on-chip metal-insulator-metal shunt capacitors, series thin-film resistors, and <b>matching</b> <b>stubs</b> {{were used in the}} design. Series resistors in the shunt branch arm provide the basic circuit stabilization. The S-MMIC amplifier was measured for S-parameters and found to be centered at 320 GHz with 13 - 15 -dB gain from 300 - 345 GHz. This chip was developed as part of the DARPA Submillimeter Wave Imaging Focal Plane Technology (SWIFT) program (see figure). Submillimeter-wave amplifiers could enable more sensitive receivers for earth science, planetary remote sensing, and astrophysics telescopes, particularly in radio astronomy, both from the ground and in space. A small atmospheric window at 340 GHz exists and could enable ground-based observations. However, the submillimeter-wave regime (above 300 GHz) is best used for space telescopes as Earth s atmosphere attenuates most of the signal through water and oxygen absorption.
