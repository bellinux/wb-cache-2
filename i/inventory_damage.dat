In {{order to}} characterise the {{influence}} of the heavy rains on the observed landslides during the 1996 – 1997 hydrological cycle, rainfall records for the last 100 years are analysed from 104 stations in eastern Andalusia. Regarding the amounts of rain recorded between October 1996 and March 1997 in the 104 stations studied, 31 presented new all-time records; 15 presented values that were 80 – 100 % of the pre- 1995 record; 49 stations, 80 – 50 %; and 9 stations, < 50 %. A map has been devised of the susceptibility of the materials through which the south-eastern Andalusian road network crosses, together with an <b>inventory</b> of the <b>damage</b> caused by instability phenomena on banks and cuttings of the road network during the winter of 1996 – 1997. The relationships between the rainfall during the study period, the damage caused to the road network and the susceptibility of the materials affected are analysed. The results indicate that there is a clear correspondence between the rainfall recorded and the susceptibility of the materials with the <b>inventoried</b> <b>damage.</b> It is concluded that the widespread serious damage caused in early 1997 to the roads and surrounding areas in the Alpujarra region and the coast of the Province of Granada was mainly caused by the extraordinarily heavy rains. However, considerably less damage was observed where the susceptibility of the terrain is low, thus highlighting the extreme usefulness of terrain-susceptibility maps for risk prevention and territorial planning...|$|R

40|$|I {{employ a}} {{typology}} of disaster impacts that distinguishes between {{direct and indirect}} damages. Direct damages are the damage to fixed assets and capital (including <b>inventories),</b> <b>damages</b> to raw materials and extractable natural resources, and of course mortality and morbidity that are {{a direct consequence of}} the natural phenomenon. Indirect damages refer to the economic activity, in particular the production of goods and services, that will not take place following the disaster and because of it. These indirect damages may be caused by the direct damages to physical infrastructure or harm to labor, or because reconstruction pulls resources away from the usual production practices. These indirect damages also include the additional costs that are incurred because of the need to use alternative and potentially inferior means of production and/or distribution for the provision of normal goods and services (Pelling et al., 2002). These costs can be accounted for in the aggregate by examining the overall performance of the economy, as measured through the most relevant macroeconomic variables, in particular GDP, the fiscal accounts, consumption, investment, and, especially important for the comparatively globalized countries of the Pacific Rim, the balance of trade and the balance of payments. These costs can also be further divided, following the standard distinction in macroeconomics, between the short run (up to several years) and the long run (typically considered to be at least five years, but sometimes also measured in decades). I use these distinctions in the discussion that follows...|$|R
40|$|Under global change, {{increasing}} stresses on forests require {{strategies for}} monitoring and mitigation of damages caused by pests and diseases. While {{the threats to}} forests increase, so do the possibilities to set up efficient monitoring programmes and detect forest damage by utilising new technologies. This thesis focuses on strategies for forest <b>damage</b> <b>inventories</b> where different auxiliary data are combined to improve information for pest mitigation programmes. First, the efficiency of National Forest Inventories (NFIs; or similar inventories) for detecting and estimating state and change of forest damage across large regions was evaluated. NFIs were found efficient for assessing widely distributed damage, but unable to detect clustered and local outbreaks with adequate precision. Second, targeted forest <b>damage</b> <b>inventories</b> directed to areas with potential or suspected damage were investigated. It was found that two-phase sampling for stratification taking the first phase information from existing NFIs was an efficient strategy. Remotely-sensed auxiliary information and post-stratification was shown to further improve the precision. Third, {{the use of a}} new sampling design was evaluated: the local pivotal method (LPM), which spreads the sample in the multi-dimensional space of available auxiliary data. The LPM was found to be more efficient than simple random sampling in all scenarios and, depending on the allocation of the sample and the properties of the auxiliary data, it sometimes outperformed two-phase sampling for stratification. Thus, the LPM may be a valuable tool for practical forest <b>damage</b> <b>inventories.</b> Fourth, the cost-plus-loss method was applied to evaluate inventory strategies in a pest mitigation context. If inventory costs are large, it is especially important to quantify the inventory efforts necessary to evaluate the need for mitigation. The optimal sampling effort necessary for deciding whether or not a defoliator outbreak should be treated was quantified. Double sampling was found to be a cost-effective sampling strategy, i. e. the size of the second phase sample was determined based on the estimates from a small first phase sample. As an overall conclusion, the thesis points out the importance of making use of existing information in setting up effective <b>inventories</b> of forest <b>damage</b> and of using appropriate sampling strategies for making use of the information in the best possible way...|$|R

Since the measurement of the hydrogenic retention by post mortem tile analysis becomes more and more difficult in future devices due to active water cooling and tile activation, Laser Induced Desorption Spectroscopy (LIDS) is under development in TEXTOR to provide a tool to measure the tritium inventory in situ without tile removal. The method is based on rapid spot laser heating and consecutive detection of thermally released hydrogen by spectroscopic detection of Balmer line emission. This contribution presents a short overview of the LIDS setup, the laser heating process, the optical detection and data evaluation as well as the application of laser desorption to map the hydrogen content on a TEXTOR ALT limiter tile with erosion dominated areas and deposition dominated areas with thick a-C:H layers in a laboratory setup, demonstrating the ability to create a 2 D mapping of the hydrogenic <b>inventory</b> without <b>damaging</b> the substrate.
