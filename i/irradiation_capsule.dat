The analysis of this compact was focused on characterizing the extent of fission product release from the particles and examining particles to determine {{the condition of the}} kernels and coating layers. The work included deconsolidation of the compact and leach-burn-leach analysis, visual inspection and gamma counting of individual particles, measurement of fuel burnup by several methods, metallurgical preparation of selected particles, and examination of particle cross-sections with optical microscopy. A single particle with a defective SiC layer was identified during deconsolidation-leach-burn-leach analysis, which is in agreement with previous measurements showing elevated cesium in the Capsule 6 graphite fuel holder associated with this fuel compact. The fraction of the compact europium inventory released from the particles and retained in the matrix was relatively high (approximately 6 E- 3), indicating release from intact particle coatings. The Ag- 110 m inventory in individual particles exhibited a very broad distribution, with some particles retaining = 80 % of the predicted inventory and others retaining less than 25 %. The average degree of Ag- 110 m retention in 60 gamma counted particles was approximately 50 %. This elevated silver release is in agreement with analysis of silver on the Capsule 6 components, which indicated an average release of 38 % of the Capsule 6 inventory from the fuel compacts. In spite of the relatively high degree of silver release from the particles, virtually none of the Ag- 110 m released was found in the compact matrix, and presumably migrated out of the compact and was deposited on the <b>irradiation</b> <b>capsule</b> components.

40|$|Optical fibre sensors (OFS) {{are worthy}} of {{interest}} for measurements in nuclear reactor thanks to their unique features, particularly compact size and remote multi-point sensing for some of them. But besides non negligible constraints associated with the high temperature environment of the experiments of interest, {{it is well known}} that the performances of OFS can be severely affected by high level of radiations. The Radiation Induced Attenuation (RIA) in the fibre is probably most known effect, which can be to some extent circumvented by using rad hard fibres to limit the dynamic loss. However, when the fast neutron fluence reaches 1018 to 1019 n/cm 2, the density and index variations associated to structural changes may deteriorate drastically the performances of OFS even if they are based on rad hard fibres, by causing direct errors in the measurements of temperature and/or strain changes. The aim of the present study is to access the effect of nuclear radiations on the Fabry Perot (FP) and of Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors through the comparison of measurements made on these OFS - or part of them - before and after irradiation [1]. In the context of development of OFS for high irradiation environment and especially for Material Testing Reactors (MTRs), Sake 2 experiment consists in an irradiation campaign at high level of gamma and neutron fluxes conducted on samples of fibre optics – bare or functionalised with FBG. The irradiation was performed at two levels of fast neutron fluence: 1 and 3. 1019 n/cm 2 (E> 1 MeV), at 250 °± 25 °C, in the SCK•CEN BR 2 reactor (Mol Belgium). An <b>irradiation</b> <b>capsule</b> was designed to allow irradiation at the specified temperature without active control. The neutron fluence was measured with activation dosimeters and the results were compared with MCPN computations. Investigation of bare samples gives information on the density changes, while for the FBGs both density and refractive index perturbation are involved. Some results for bare fibres were reported recently. In this paper, we will focus on the measurements made on FBGs that have been manufactured by different laboratories on SMF 28 fibers: CEA, University of St-Etienne and University of Mons. Tested gratings have been written using various conditions (type of fibre, of laser, writing wavelength, power density, post writing thermal annealing,…), leading to various behaviours after Sake 2 irradiation. Bragg wavelength and reflectivity have been measured before and after irradiation thanks to a special mounting at the same temperature. It appears that a change in the shape after irradiation of the Bragg peak disturb the retrieval of the Bragg wavelength. The measurements show that for nearly all gratings the Bragg peak remains visible after the irradiation, and that Radiation Induced Bragg Wavelength Shifts (RI-BWSs) vary from few pm (equivalent to an error of less than 1 °C for a temperature sensor) to nearly 1 nm (equivalent to 100 °C) depending of the FBG types. High RI-BWSs could indeed be expected when considering the huge refractive index variation and compaction of the bare fibre samples that have been measured by other techniques. Post writing thermal annealing is confirmed as a key parameter in order to obtain a more radiation tolerant FBG. Our results show that specific annealing regimes allow making FGBs suitable to perform temperature measurements in a MTR experiment...|$|E
40|$|The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Graphite R&D {{program is}} {{currently}} measuring irradiated material property changes in several grades of nuclear graphite for predicting {{their behavior and}} operating performance within the core of new Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) designs. The Advanced Graphite Creep (AGC) experiment consisting of six <b>irradiation</b> <b>capsules</b> will generate this irradiated graphite performance data for NGNP reactor operating conditions. All six AGC capsules in the experiment will be irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), disassembled in the Hot Fuel Examination Facility (HFEF), and examined at the INL Research Center (IRC) or Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). This {{is the first in}} a series of status reports on the progress of the AGC experiment. As the first capsule, AGC 1 was irradiated from September 2009 to January 2011 to a maximum dose level of 6 - 7 dpa. The capsule was removed from ATR and transferred to the HFEF in April 2011 where the capsule was disassembled and test specimens extracted from the capsules. The first irradiated samples from AGC 1 were shipped to the IRC in July 2011 and initial post irradiation examination (PIE) activities were begun on the first 37 samples received. PIE activities continue for the remainder of the AGC 1 specimen as they are received at the IRC...|$|R

40|$|In this {{irradiation}} experiment, (Th,Pu) O 2 pellets were fabricated from powders, prepared using a sol gel method, to give {{a product}} exhibiting an atomically homogeneous distribution of the elements. The fuel pellets, of conventional pressurised water reactor (PWR) dimensions, were encapsulated in zircaloy cladding, before being shipped to KWO Obrigheim for <b>irradiation.</b> The <b>capsule</b> was loaded in a guide tube of a conventional uranium MOX assembly, where it was irradiated for four reactor cycles, reaching a burnup of 37. 7 GWd/tonne. Intermediate inspections of the rodlet were made between each reactor cycle, and on completion of irradiation. Thereafter, the rod was returned to the ITU hot cells for post irradiation examination. Initial results have shown that an excellent behaviour of the fuel was obtained. JRC. DG. E. 4 -Nuclear fuel...|$|R

In preparation for performing the nuclear design analysis activities required by the advanced fuel studies task, a complete 3 -D nuclear design analysis is first being performed of the GT-MHR reference design. This will serve as the baseline for studies of the advanced fuel nuclear design performance...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) and the ATR Critical (ATRC) {{facilities}} lack real-time {{methods for}} detecting thermal neutron flux and fission reaction rates for <b>irradiation</b> <b>capsules.</b> Direct {{measurements of the}} actual power deposited into a test are now possible without resorting to complicated correction factors. In addition, {{it is possible to}} directly measure minor actinide fission reaction rates and to provide time-dependent monitoring of the fission reaction rate or fast/thermal flux during transient testing. A joint Idaho State University /Idaho National Laboratory ATR National Scientific User Facility (ATR NSUF) project was recently initiated to evaluate new real-time state-of-the-art in-pile flux detection sensors. Initially, the project is comparing the accuracy, response time, and long duration performance of French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) -developed miniature fission chambers, specialized self-powered neutron detectors (SPNDs) by the Argentinean National Energy Commission (CNEA), specially developed commercial SPNDs, and back-to-back fission (BTB) chambers developed by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). As discussed in this paper, specialized fixturing and software was developed by INL to facilitate these joint ISU/INL evaluations. Calculations were performed by ISU to assess the performance of and reduce uncertainties in flux detection sensors and compare data obtained from these sensors with existing integral methods employed at the ATRC. Ultimately, project results will be used to select the detector that can provide the best online regional ATRC power measurement. It is anticipated that project results may offer the potential to increase the ATRC’s current power limit and its ability to perform low-level irradiation experiments. In addition, results from this effort will provide insights about the viability of using these detectors in the ATR. Hence, this effort complements current activities to improve ATR software tools, computational protocols and in-core instrumentation under the ATR Modeling, Simulation and V&V Upgrade initiative, as well as the work to replace nuclear instrumentation under the ATR Life Extension Project (LEP) and provide support to the ATR NSUF...|$|R
