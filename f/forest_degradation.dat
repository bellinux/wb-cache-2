Repeated seedling-based studies on Shorea spp., Alstonia scholaris, Acacia crassicarpa, and Agathis lorantifolia have revealed that many bacteria were able to promote plant growth at early stage in the nursery. Various plant responses towards inoculations suggested that although forest soils maintain highly diverse and potent bacteria, {{it is necessary to}} select appropriate approaches to obtain optimum benefi ts from these plant-bacteria interactions.

25|$|In December 2007, after {{a two-year}} debate on a {{proposal}} from Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, state parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) agreed to explore ways of reducing emissions from deforestation and to enhance forest carbon stocks in developing nations. The underlying idea is that developing nations should be financially compensated if they succeed in reducing their levels of deforestation (through valuing the carbon that is stored in forests); a concept termed 'avoided deforestation (AD) or, REDD if broadened to include reducing <b>forest</b> <b>degradation</b> (see Reducing emissions from deforestation and <b>forest</b> <b>degradation).</b> Under the free market model advocated by the countries who have formed the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, developing nations with rainforests would sell carbon sink credits under a free market system to Kyoto Protocol Annex I states who have exceeded their emissions allowance. Brazil (the state with the largest area of tropical rainforest) however, opposes including avoided deforestation in a carbon trading mechanism and instead favors creation of a multilateral development assistance fund created from donations by developed states. For REDD to be successful science and regulatory infrastructure related to forests will need to increase so nations may inventory all their forest carbon, show that they can control land use {{at the local level}} and prove that their emissions are declining.|$|E
25|$|Land use, land-use {{change and}} {{forestry}} (LULUCF) projects focus on natural carbon sinks such as forests and soil. Deforestation, particularly in Brazil, Indonesia {{and parts of}} Africa, account for about 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation can be avoided either by paying directly for forest preservation, or by using offset funds to provide substitutes for forest-based products. There is a class of mechanisms referred to as REDD schemes (Reducing emissions from deforestation and <b>forest</b> <b>degradation),</b> which may {{be included in a}} post-Kyoto agreement. REDD credits provide carbon offsets for the protection of forests, and provide a possible mechanism to allow funding from developed nations to assist in the protection of native forests in developing nations.|$|E

25|$|Classic {{studies in}} kelp forest ecology have largely focused on trophic {{interactions}} (the relationships between organisms and their food webs), particularly the understanding and top-down trophic processes. Bottom-up processes are generally {{driven by the}} abiotic conditions required for primary producers to grow, such as availability of light and nutrients, and the subsequent transfer of energy to consumers at higher trophic levels. For example, the occurrence of kelp is frequently correlated with oceanographic upwelling zones, which provide unusually high concentrations of nutrients to the local environment. This allows kelp to grow and subsequently support herbivores, which in turn support consumers at higher trophic levels. By contrast, in top-down processes, predators limit the biomass of species at lower trophic levels through consumption. In the absence of predation, these lower-level species flourish because resources that support their energetic requirements are not limiting. In a well-studied example from Alaskan kelp forests, sea otters (Enhydra lutris) control populations of herbivorous sea urchins through predation. When sea otters are removed from the ecosystem (for example, by human exploitation), urchin populations are released from predatory control and grow dramatically. This leads to increased herbivore pressure on local kelp stands. Deterioration of the kelp itself results {{in the loss of}} physical ecosystem structure and subsequently, the loss of other species associated with this habitat. In Alaskan kelp forest ecosystems, sea otters are the keystone species that mediates this trophic cascade. In Southern California, kelp forests persist without sea otters and the control of herbivorous urchins is instead mediated by a suite of predators including lobsters and large fishes, such as the California sheephead. The effect of removing one predatory species in this system differs from Alaska because redundancy exists in the trophic levels and other predatory species can continue to regulate urchins. However, the removal of multiple predators can effectively release urchins from predator pressure and allow the system to follow trajectories towards kelp <b>forest</b> <b>degradation.</b> Similar examples exist in Nova Scotia, South Africa, Australia and Chile. The relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up control in kelp forest ecosystems and the strengths of trophic interactions continue to be the subject of considerable scientific investigation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify {{relationships}} between socio-economic activities and <b>forest</b> ecology <b>degradations</b> in Kampar Peninsula, Riau Province, Indonesia.

30|$|It {{is evident}} that <b>forest</b> {{resources}} <b>degradation</b> {{has taken place in}} FGR at a very high rate between 1985 and 2015. Relatively, the percentage change of various forest cover types is higher during 2005 to 2015 than during 1985 to 1998 and 1998 to 2005. However, open woodland and dense woodland recorded the highest annual rate of change of 3 and 5 % during 1985 to 2015, respectively. The gross loss was highest for moderate woodland followed by dense woodland, while the gross gain was highest for open woodland followed by very open woodland during the period under study. The prominent transitions of forest cover type during period under study are dense woodland to moderate woodland, moderate woodland to open woodland, and very open woodland to dense woodland. These forest cover transitions are largely attributed to intensification of anthropogenic activities in and around the forest. The key hotspots of <b>forest</b> resource <b>degradation</b> in the study area coincided with the areas where excessive fuelwood collection, timber logging, and poor grazing management were reported in the forest reserve (northern tip, central, and eastern parts). Overall, these findings suggest that FGR is currently faced with <b>forest</b> resource <b>degradation,</b> a problem attributed to excessive fuelwood collection, poor grazing management, expansion of crop cultivation, forest fire, harvesting of medicinal herbs, and illegal hunting of game animals. It is therefore clear that the spatial distributions and changes in forests cover types could offer interesting insights into more local-scale processes and activities that are detrimental to the ecosystem service provisioning of the FGR.|$|R

2500|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the United Nations {{mechanism}} for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and <b>Forest</b> <b>Degradation</b> (REDD) may increase pressure to convert or modify other ecosystems, especially savannahs and wetlands, for food or biofuel, even though those ecosystems also have high carbon sequestration potential. Globally, for example, peatlands cover only 3% of the land surface but store twice {{the amount of carbon}} as all the world's forests, whilst mangrove forests and saltmarshes are examples of relatively low-biomass ecosystems with high levels of productivity and carbon sequestration. Other researchers have argued that REDD is a critical component of an effective global biosequestration strategy that could provide significant benefits, such as the conservation of biodiversity, particularly if it moves away from focusing on protecting forests that are most cost-effective for reducing carbon emissions (such as those in Brazil where agricultural opportunity costs are relatively low, unlike Asia, which has sizeable revenues from oil palm, rubber, rice, and maize). They argue REDD could be varied to allow funding of programs to slow peat degradation in Indonesia and target protection of biodiversity in [...] "hot spot"—areas with high species richness and relatively little remaining forest. Some purchasers, they maintain, of REDD carbon credits, such as multinational corporations or nations, might pay a premium to save imperiled eco-systems or areas with high-profile species.|$|E
