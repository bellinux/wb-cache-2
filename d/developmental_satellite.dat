40|$|Small {{satellites}} {{have the}} potential to allow rapid and affordable access to space; especially for small satellites or payloads that are used to test or validate new concepts or technologies. But limited launch manifest opportunities can hinder the exploitation of the qualities that make small satellites attractive. This paper outlines the work done to collect information on historical and <b>developmental</b> small <b>satellite</b> missions. Trends from the data and the implication on future small satellite missions are described. These trends and common characteristics are then tied to the limited manifesting opportunities offered to small satellites. Finally, development of future launch capability and how that could impact the small satellite market is addressed. Possessing knowledge gained from a thorough benchmarking effort of the small satellite industry can help improve the ability of gaining manifesting opportunities, thereby increasing access to space...|$|R

50|$|Milstar Block I spacecraft, or Milstar <b>Developmental</b> Flight <b>Satellite</b> (DFS)-1 and -2, were {{designed}} with a Low Data Rate (LDR) payload in the +X {{wing of the}} satellite that broadcast in the Super High Frequency (SHF) and Extremely High Frequency (EHF) ranges, and also a classified communication payload in the -X wing. The DFS-1 satellite was launched on 7 February 1994 aboard the first Titan IV(401)A rocket, but with the classified -X wing payload deactivated. It {{was followed by the}} DFS-2 spacecraft on 7 November 1995. DFS-2 was similar to DFS-1, but the classified payload was replaced by ballast {{in the form of a}} precision machined aluminum block to maintain the weight and balance characteristics of the satellite. Both Block I satellites (USA-99 and USA-115) are still operational as of August 2016, over 20 years since they were launched.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Skeletal muscle {{development}} in avian and mammalian embryos {{depends on the}} proliferation, differentiation, and fusion of embryonic myoblasts. During the late fetal period and following birth or hatching, myogenic satellite cells are responsible for this <b>developmental</b> function. <b>Satellite</b> cells, which are found adjacent to existing skeletal muscle fibers fuse with these fibers and their nuclei direct the synthesis of new protein and function in the maturation of muscle. These events are controlled by specific growth factors that are produced locally by satellite cells and other cells in the muscle. Progress {{in our understanding of}} the early events in myogenesis has been made possible by the development of satellite cell cultures and media formulations that allow the assessment of the role of growth factors in skeletal muscle growth and development. Because of the key role that satellite cells play in skeletal muscle growth, development, and regeneration, many scientists in both the agricultural and medical communities have focused their research on understanding the physiology of this cell. From an agricultural perspective, {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms regulating satellite cell activity may lead to procedures to increase the deposition and efficiency of lean muscle (meat) accretion and, perhaps, improve the nutrient composition of meat products...|$|R
40|$|A 12 -ft counterbalanced Slave Manipulator Arm (SMA) was {{designed}} and fabricated {{to be used for}} resolving the questions of operational applications, capabilities, and limitations for such remote manned systems as the Payload Deployment and Retrieval Mechanism (PDRM) for the shuttle, the Free-Flying Teleoperator System, the Advanced Space Tug, and Planetary Rovers. As a developmental tool for the shuttle manipulator system (or PDRM), the SMA represents an approximate one-quarter scale working model for simulating and demonstrating payload handling, docking assistance, and satellite servicing. For the Free-Flying Teleoperator System and the Advanced Tug, the SMA provides a near full-scale <b>developmental</b> tool for <b>satellite</b> servicing, docking, and deployment/retrieval procedures, techniques, and support equipment requirements. For the Planetary Rovers, it provides an oversize developmental tool for sample handling and soil mechanics investigations. The design of the SMA was based on concepts developed for a 40 -ft NASA technology arm to be used for zero-g shuttle manipulator simulations...|$|R
40|$|The Flight Dynamics Analysis Branch (FDAB) of NASNGSFC is {{tasked with}} {{determining}} the orbital lifetime of several <b>developmental</b> and operational <b>satellites,</b> {{which include the}} Hubble Space Telescope. A DOS based program developed by the FDAB many years ago, called PC Lifetime, is used to determine a satellite s lifetime and could soon be {{in need of a}} replacement. STK s Lifetime Object Tool is a possible candidate. Due to the reduced support of the PC Lifetime program, and the growing incompatibility of older programs with new operating systems, a comparative analysis was done to determine if STWLifetime could meet the stringent requirements that were laid before it. The use of highly accurate numerical propagators such as STK s High Precision Orbit Propagator (OP) and the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) provided a basis on which to compare STWLifetime s results. Several test cases were run, but the main four test cases would determine whether or not STWLifetime could be PC- Lifetime s replacement. These four cases include a geotransfer orbit, two circular LEOS, and a Poiar LEO. Following rigorous testmg procedures, a conclusion will be determined. STK {{has proved to be a}} versatile program on many satellite missions and the FDAB has high hopes that it can pass FDAB s requirements for orbital lifetime prediction...|$|R
40|$|Testes of {{jellyfish}} Phialidium gregarium {{were fixed}} in 2 per cent OsO 4 in Veronal-acetate buffer at pH 7. 4. Thin sections {{showed that in}} young spermatids the spindle fibers of the last maturation division are attached to satellites of the filament-forming centriole. In more mature spermatids this attachment is not observed. During the <b>developmental</b> phase, nine <b>satellites</b> can be observed emanating from the interspaces between the nine tubular triplets of this centriole. A circular region {{on each of the}} enlarged distal ends of the satellites attaches them to the cell membrane. The satellites apparently provide a firm anchor for the axial filament. Each of the epithelial cells covering the testis produces a single long flagellum. On the filament-forming centriole often a satellite can be observed to which tubules are attached. These tubules are 180 A in diameter and probably represent remnants of spindle fibers. It is suggested that the distal centriole has the ability to form several satellites or appendages at appropriate times during the cell cycle. These satellites are distinct from the daughter centrioles in that they are supportive structures: in certain phases of cell life, spindle fibers may attach to them, while in other instances the distal centriole and th...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{cells are}} the {{resident}} stem cells found in adult skeletal muscle. These tissue-specific stem cells {{play a critical}} role in postnatal growth and the remarkable regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle. The <b>developmental</b> potential of <b>satellite</b> cells was investigated utilizing Cre/loxP lineage tracing technology. Mice with Cre recombinase knocked into the MyoD locus (MyoDiCre) and a Cre-dependent reporter allele were generated to permanently label satellite cells. We found that MyoDiCre-labeled satellite cells did not spontaneously adopt an adipogenic fate in culture, even when exposed to potent adipogenesis-inducing reagents. The function of the myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD and Myf- 5 in satellite cell commitment to myogenesis was examined using the permanent lineage tracing system. MyoD and Myf- 5 -mutant mice were generated that also carried the MyoDiCre and Cre-dependent reporter alleles. Tibialis anterior muscles from MyoD and Myf- 5 -mutant mice were freeze injured and allowed 4 weeks to regenerate at which time the contribution of MyoDiCre-labeled satellite cells to non-myogenic tissues was analyzed. Contribution of labeled satellite cells to non-myogenic tissues in mice lacking MyoD and Myf- 5 was not observed and indicates that neither MyoD nor Myf- 5 alone control adult satellite cell specification and commitment to myogenesis. We also explored the ability of MyoDiCre-labeled satellite cells to contribute to non-myogenic lineages in a novel mouse muscular dystrophy model (rmd). Homozygous rmd mice exhibit a severe and rapidly progressive rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy phenotype where extensive fibrosis is observed. We found that MyoDiCre -labeled satellite cells were not the source of the fibrosis in rmd/rmd mice. Overall, this work demonstrates that adult skeletal muscle satellite cells are committed to the myogenic pathway and do not readily adopt non-myogenic lineages. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of a two-way asynchronous (i. e. independently firing) interplanetary laser transponder pair, capable of decimeter ranging and subnanosecond time transfer from Earth to a spacecraft anywhere within the inner Solar System, is discussed. In the Introduction, we briefly discuss the current state-of-the-art in Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) which use single-ended range measurements to a passive optical reflector, and {{the limitations of}} this approach in ranging beyond the Moon to the planets. In Section 2 of this paper, we describe two types of transponders (echo and asynchronous), introduce the transponder link equation {{and the concept of}} "balanced" transponders, describe how range and time can be transferred between terminals, and preview the potential advantages of photon counting asynchronous transponders for interplanetary applications. In Section 3, we discuss and provide mathematical models for the various sources of noise in an interplanetary transponder link including planetary albedo, solar or lunar illumination of the local atmosphere, and laser backscatter off the local atmosphere. In Section 4, we introduce the key engineering elements of an interplanetary laser transponder and develop an operational scenario for the acquisition and tracking of the opposite terminal. In Section 5, we use the theoretical models of th~ previous sections to perform an Earth-Mars link analysis over a full synodic period of 780 days under the simplifying assumption of coaxial, coplanar, circular orbits. We demonstrate that, using slightly modified versions of existing space and ground based laser systems, an Earth-Mars transponder link is not only feasible but quite robust. We also demonstrate through analysis the advantages and {{feasibility of}} compact, low output power (< 300 mW photon-counting transponders using NASA's <b>developmental</b> SLR 2000 <b>satellite</b> laser ranging system as the Earth terminal. Section 6 provides a summary of the results and some concluding remarks regarding future applications...|$|R
