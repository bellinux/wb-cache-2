The Intermediates were beaten by Kilkenny in June. In the Leinster Senior Hurling Semi-final on June 20, 1999, Offaly saw off Wexford by 3-17 to 0-15. Joe, Billy and Johnny Dooley pitched in for a combined 1-13, and Kevin Kinahan also played a stormer. In the Leinster Final on July 11, however, the reigning Leinster Champions, now coached by Brian Cody felled the reigning All Ireland Champions (Kilkenny 5-14, Offaly 1-16). Kilkenny's goals were scored by DJ Carey (2), Henry Shefflin, Charlie Carter and Brian McEvoy. With their pride severely stung, the Faithful County regrouped admirably. Antrim hit them with everything in the All Ireland Quarter-Final, but Offaly still won by 4-22 to 0-12. The All Ireland Semi-final on August 8, 1999 was only the second-ever meeting between Cork and Offaly in the Senior Hurling Championship, and Joe Dooley was the only player to span the fifteen years since the Centenary Final. Notwithstanding the wet and greasy conditions, the game became an instant classic of wet-day hurling, and the caliber of both sides' display was absolutely top-drawer. The Rebels shaded it by 0-19 to 0-16. Cork and Offaly each scored 0-12 from play, so the match turned on the frees awarded by the referee, Dickie Murphy. Another crucial factor was the maturity shown by Jimmy Barry-Murphy's gifted young team when Offaly's grip seemed to be tightening.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, construction and early {{performance of a}} retaining structure close to a subway tunnel in Barcelona. The excavation, about 16 m deep, {{was carried out in}} 2001 during {{the construction of a new}} hospital, and involved a rectangular area with the longer side (170 m) almost parallel to the tunnel. The design had to fulfil two requirements: first, the influence of the excavation on the existing tunnel had to be minimised; and, second, the new hospital had to be isolated from vibrations from the subway owing to the high sensitivity of the medical instruments. In order to achieve this, the retaining wall was designed to be independent of the main building, and movements during the excavation stages had to be controlled. In addition, the use of subhorizontal anchors was not allowed by the metro administration, and therefore the wall comprised a line of T-shaped panels linked to shorter <b>intermediate</b> <b>panels</b> excavated using a hydromill. The stability of the wall and bending resistance were provided by the buttressing effect of the forward-facing T and the compression in the panels and anchoring force provided by post-tensioning anchors drilled into the underlying bedrock through ducts installed in the rear section of the T panels. The wall was designed using a beam–spring model with ground parameters derived from in situ tests, and the interaction between the excavation and the tunnel was modelled using a plane-strain finite element analysis imposing the wall displacements on the section. Monitoring of the wall and the tunnel confirmed that the influence of the work on the neighbouring tunnel was negligible. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

60|$|There are two saints, {{male and}} female, at its angles, each {{in a little}} niche; a Christ, enthroned in the centre, the Doge and Dogaressa {{kneeling}} at his feet; in the two <b>intermediate</b> <b>panels,</b> on one side the Epiphany, on the other the Death of the Virgin; the whole supported, as well as crowned, by an elaborate leaf-plinth. The figures under the niches are rudely cut, and of little interest. Not so the central group. Instead of a niche, the Christ is seated under a square tent, or tabernacle, formed by curtains running on rods; the idea, of course, as usual, borrowed from the Pisan one, but here ingeniously applied. The curtains are opened in front, showing those {{at the back of}} the tent, behind the seated figure; the perspective of the two retiring sides being very tolerably suggested. Two angels, of half the size of the seated figure, thrust back the near curtains, and look up reverently to the Christ; while again, at their feet, about one third of their size, and half-sheltered, as it seems, by their garments, are the two kneeling figures of the Doge and Dogaressa, though so small and carefully cut, full of life. The Christ raising one hand as to bless, and holding a book upright and open on the knees, does not look either towards them or to the angels, but forward; and there is a very noticeable effort to represent Divine abstraction in the countenance: the idea of the three magnitudes of spiritual being,--the God, the Angel, and the Man,--is also to be observed, aided as it is by the complete subjection of the angelic power to the Divine; for the angels are in attitudes of the most lowly watchfulness of the face of Christ, and appear unconscious of the presence of the human beings who are nestled in the folds of their garments.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{determinants}} of vertical intra-industry trade (VIIT) in the automobile components industry between Portugal and the European Union 27 (EU- 27) and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) during the period 1995 - 2006. Design/methodology/approach – The paper formulates some theoretical hypotheses that may explain the fragmentation of the production in the automobile industry. These hypotheses are tested using a dynamic panel data analysis. The estimates are more reliable because the instruments used control for the potential endogeneity of the explanatory variables. Findings – The results indicate that VIIT is a positive function {{of the difference in}} per-capita GDP between Portugal and its trading partners, confirming the Linder hypothesis. Moreover, there is statistical evidence that geographical distance influences negatively this type of VIIT between Portugal and the EU- 27 only. The results do not confirm the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between differences in endowments and VIIT in the automobile components sector. Originality/value – This paper confirms some relevant theoretical hypotheses on the causes of the fragmentation/outsourcing. The good results obtained with the Arellano and Bond GMM system estimator suggest that the building of dynamic theoretical models will be of interest to academic researchers in fragmentation theory.

40|$|Quantifying {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of taxa is an important prerequisite {{for the preservation of}} biodiversity, and can provide a baseline against which to measure the impacts of climate change. Here we analyse patterns of marine mammal species richness based on predictions of global distributional ranges for 115 species, including all extant pinnipeds and cetaceans. We used an environmental suitability model specifically designed to address the paucity of distributional data for many marine mammal species. We generated richness patterns by overlaying predicted distributions for all species; these were then validated against sightings data from dedicated long-term surveys in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, the Northeast Atlantic and the Southern Ocean. Model outputs correlated well with empirically observed patterns of biodiversity in all three survey regions. Marine mammal richness was predicted to be highest in temperate waters of both hemispheres with distinct hotspots around New Zealand, Japan, Baja California, the Galapagos Islands, the Southeast Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. We then applied our model to explore potential changes in biodiversity under future perturbations of environmental conditions. Forward projections of biodiversity using an <b>intermediate</b> Intergovernmental <b>Panel</b> for Climate Change (IPCC) temperature scenario predicted that projected ocean warming and changes in sea ice cover until 2050 may have moderate effects on the spatial patterns of marine mammal richness. Increases in cetacean richness were predicted above 40 ° latitude in both hemispheres, while decreases in both pinniped and cetacean richness were expected at lower latitudes. Our results show how species distribution models can be applied to explore broad patterns of marine biodiversity worldwide for taxa for which limited distributional data are available...|$|R

3000|$|Using {{different}} sets of potentials, {{it is also possible}} to position the minima either directly above an electrode (top panel), or in an <b>intermediate</b> position (central <b>panel).</b> In fact, by applying the appropriate potentials, the minima can be positioned at any z-position within the 240 -µm period, while their y-position remains constant. Further, the periodic arrangement of the electrodes allows for a continuous movement of the electric field minima outside the 240 –µm period, that is over the macroscopic distance of the whole device at a constant height of about 25 µm. For a given trap strength, there is a bijective relationship between the set of the applied potentials and the position of the microtraps array, so that the applied potentials must be periodic functions when the field minima travel across multiple periods. For the electrodes configuration chosen by Meek et al., the applied potentials that generate the smoothly moving traps are six approximately harmonic functions. Three of the potentials can always be positive, the other three always negative, and within each polarity set the potentials need to be phase shifted by 2 π/ 3. Since two microtraps are formed per period, {{as can be seen in}} Fig. 1, the effective periodicity is of 120 µm. Thus, the microtraps move at 300 m/s when the sinusoidal modulation of the potential has a frequency of 2.5 MHz. The trap depth obtained with sinusoidal modulations of 200 -V amplitude peak-to-peak is of the order of 5 kV/cm. For CO molecules in the upper Λ-doublet component of the a [...]...|$|R
40|$|Sandwich Plate System (SPS) is a {{sandwich}} construction consisting of steel face sheets and polyurethane core. The main objective for the steel faces is to resist bending and in-plane loads, while the compliant core transfers shear between the faces. One important benefit with sandwich panels is {{the elimination of}} the need for <b>intermediate</b> stiffeners. SPS <b>panels</b> are today used in stadium and arena terraces, bridges, ships and as structural flooring. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) is currently developing rules and guidelines for design and installation of SPS in ship newbuildings. To do this it is important to study how the SPS panels behave under a variety of loads such as lateral pressure load, in-plane shear load and in-plane uni-axial compression load. Combinations of these loads are important to study to establish strength criterias for SPS panels. Studying these load combinations is the objective for the current study as a collaboration between the University of Oslo (UiO) and Det Norske Veritas (DNV). In the current study the ultimate capacity of SPS panels under lateral pressure load and in-plane shear load has been studied both separately and in combination. In-plane uni-axial compression load is also included in three-way interactions. Both simply supported and clamped boundary conditions are studied to see the effect of these. Theories that can model the separate load cases are described and compared {{to each other and to}} the finite element results.
