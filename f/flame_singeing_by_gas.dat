It opened its snake-jaws to such an abominable width, that Pegasus might almost, I was going to say, have flown right down its throat, wings outspread, rider and all! At their approach it shot out a tremendous blast of its fiery breath, and enveloped Bellerophon and his steed in a perfect atmosphere of <b>flame,</b> <b>singeing</b> the wings of Pegasus, scorching off one whole side of the young man's golden ringlets, and making them both far hotter than was comfortable, from head to foot.|$|R

50|$|The name Preserje occurs {{multiple}} times in Slovenian toponymy; unlike {{other examples of}} the name (e.g., Preserje, Preserje pri Komnu, etc.), which are feminine plural nouns, this Preserje is a neuter singular. The origin of the name is uncertain.

5000|$|Mercerising {{results in}} the {{swelling}} of the cell wall of the cotton fibre. This causes {{an increase in the}} surface area and reflectance, and gives the fibre a softer feel.

This is known as [...] "gassing the thread" [...] because of the gas burner that is typically used.|$|R
60|$|And {{what he saw}} was not nice. Smoke's face, {{wherever}} the skin showed, was black and purple and scabbed from repeated frost-bite.

60|$|Of the franc tireurs eight were killed, {{fourteen}} wounded. Of the Uhlans forty-seven were killed, and nineteen wounded {{remained on}} the ground.

40|$|Twenty-one market-age swine {{slaughtered}} in the University of Kentucky abattoir were inoculated with fecal slurry containing two {{strains of}} nalidixic acid resistant Salmonella typhimurium on the ham, belly, and jowl regions {{on each side}} of the carcass. Trial 1 revealed that a 10 s hot water spray was just as effective as the 20 s spray in removing S. typhimurium, as there was no distinguishable difference in population. The shorter <b>flame</b> <b>singe</b> (10 s) was as effective as the 20 s application and the two chlorine solutions (100, 200 ppm) had similar results. The 2 % lactic acid spray reduced S. typhimurium populations significantly more than the 1 % treatment. Trial 2 compared the four most efficient levels of each intervention method. Efficacy of the intervention methods was observed in the following order: Hot water (10 s) > Chlorine (50 ppm) = Lactic acid (2 %) > Flame (10 s). The effect of carcass area was significant following the post treatment hot water rinse. The jowl area was least accessible by the high pressure water spray. However after the treatment applications, hot water rinse, and 24 h chill (2 ºC) there was no significant difference between treated and untreated carcasses or between carcass areas...|$|R
