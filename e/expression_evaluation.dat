The main {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the speaker's <b>expression</b> of <b>evaluation</b> in the discussion session of two specialised conference paper presentations in Linguistics and Chemistry from a multimodal approach. I set out to investigate evaluation in spoken academic discourse beyond the traditional linguistic approach to foreground the role of kinesics and paralanguage that co-occur with the linguistic <b>expression</b> of <b>evaluation.</b> To meet the objective of the thesis, the theoretical framework was embedded in techniques of genre analysis (Bhatia 1993, Swales 1990) and discourse analysis, including the theoretical orientations of systemic functional linguistics (Halliday 1978, 1985 a), conversation analysis (Schegloff & Sack 1973), pragmatics (Brown & Levinson 1978, 1987), and multimodal discourse analysis (Kress & van Leeuwen 2001).

Arithmetic P systems are one-membrane systems and several of them can make up an expression P system, where arithmetic operations can be performed in parallel and the computing results can be transmitted {{under the control of}} the transmission rules. Then a computing architecture can be built and based on it different expression P systems can be constructed by designing different parallel strategies...|$|R

This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of an XML storage manager for fast and interactive XPath <b>expressions</b> <b>evaluation.</b> This storage manager has two main parts: the XML data storage structure and the index over this data. The system is designed {{in such a way}} that it minimizes the number of page reads for retrieving any XPath expression results while avoiding the shortcomings of previous work on storing XML data where the index must adapt to the most frequent queries. Hence, the main advantage of our index is that it can handle any new XPath expression without any need for adaptation. We show comparable performance of our design by presenting path evaluation results of our index against those of the currently most known index on documents of different sizes. ...|$|R

40|$|Existing profile-guided partial {{redundancy}} elimination (PRE) methods use speculation {{to enable}} the removal of partial redundancies along more frequently executed paths {{at the expense of}} introducing additional <b>expression</b> <b>evaluations</b> along less frequently executed paths. While being capable of minimizing the number of <b>expression</b> <b>evaluations</b> in some cases, they are, in general, not computationally optimal in achieving this objective. In addition, the experimental results for their effectiveness are mostly missing. This work addresses the following three problems: (1) Is the computational optimality of speculative PRE solvable in polynomial time? (2) Is edge profiling — less costly than path profiling — sufficient to guarantee the computational optimality? (3) Is the optimal algorithm (if one exists) lightweight enough to be used efficiently in a dynamic compiler? In this paper, we provide positive answers to the first two problems and promising results to the third. We present an algorithm that analyzes edge insertion points based on an edge profile. Our algorithm guarantees optimally that the total number of computations for an expression in the transformed code is always minimized with respect to the edge profile given. This implies that edge profiling, which is less costly than path profiling, is sufficient to guarantee this optimality. The key in the development of our algorithm lies in the removal of some non-essential edges (and consequently, all resulting non-essential nodes) from a flow graph so that the problem of finding an optimal code motion is reduced to one of finding a minimal cut in the reduced (flow) graph thus obtained. We have implemented our algorithm in Intel’s Open Runtime Platform (ORP). Our preliminary results over a number of Java benchmarks show that our algorithm is lightweight and can be potentially a practical component in a dynamic compiler. As a result, our algorithm can also be profitably employed in a profileguided static compiler, in which compilation cost can often be sacrificed for code efficiency...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo studies {{investigated}} {{the reactions of}} minority group members to messages about identity expression by ingroup and outgroup sources. Our main hypothesis was that compared to ingroup sources, outgroup sources arouse more anger when they argue for identity suppression. In the first study homosexuals evaluated an outgroup source arguing for identity suppression more negatively than an ingroup source, felt more threatened by this source and as a result, experienced stronger feelings of anger towards this source. The second study among members of a language-based minority replicated and extended these findings. Furthermore we showed that the anger that is experienced towards an outgroup source causes a willingness to change the opinion of this source. When ingroup or outgroup sources supported identity <b>expression,</b> <b>evaluations</b> and experience of anger {{did not differ in}} both studies.
