Farmers receiving the SFP have the flexibility to produce any commodity on their land except fruit, vegetables and table potatoes. In addition, they are obliged to keep their land in good agricultural and <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> (cross-compliance). Farmers have to respect environmental, food safety, phytosanitary and animal welfare standards. This is a penalty measure, if farmers do not respect these standards, their payment will be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Many modern {{scientists}} have also critiqued classical environmental determinism as unscientific. Carl Sauer criticized the premature generalizations resulting from bias in environmentalism in 1924. He argued that to define geography as {{the study of}} environmental influences is to assume in advance that such influences do operate, and that science cannot be based upon or committed to preconceptions. Furthermore, since evolutionary change manifests over very long time periods, some argue {{that the ability to}} adequately correlate human behaviour with any specific <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> is speculative at best and impossible at worst.|$|E

The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes. Minority neighborhoods have been continuously noted to have more fast food chains and fewer grocery stores than predominantly white neighborhoods. These food deserts affect a family’s ability to {{have easy access to}} nutritious food for their children. This lack of nutritious food extends beyond the household into the schools that have a variety of vending machines and deliver over processed foods.

The New York Times, Vice Media's tech-news site Motherboard, public radio station WNYC, real estate news site 6sqft, and environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) connected Trump's declared policies to the risk of returning to a more polluted environment, with each publication evoking the 1966 smog as an example of the potential dangers of defunding and deregulation. David Hawkins, an attorney for NRDC, recalled, [...] "I was a student at Columbia Law School during the 1966 episode.

Investigators {{considered}} the Situational Awareness {{and the process of}} the decision making to fly direct to Barru. It was revealed that one of the crew had done the same step before, and during the previous flight, no incident occurred. This might have caused one of the crew to trust the one that had done it before in the past to cut the route and make a direct flight to Barru. During its flight to point Barru, neither the pilot or the co-pilot discussed on the <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> ahead. The absence of discussion in regard to the conditions ahead, meant that the pilots had not properly considered the operational implications of flying the direct route, leading to a loss of situational awareness.|$|E

However, waste package (WP) and engineered barrier system (EBS) design concepts, including materials testing and selection, design criteria development, waste-form characterization, and performance assessments all require a specific and detailed understanding of the <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> that will interact with the WP/EBS. <b>Environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> assessments {{from a series of}} laboratory and modeling studies have been conducted which provide the current understanding of the near-field <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> at YM that not only exist now but will exist in the future.

40|$|Maximum {{power point}} {{tracking}} (MPPT) {{is an important}} consideration in photovoltaic (PV) systems. These systems exhibit variable nonlinear current–voltage (I–V) and power–voltage (P–V) characteristics which vary with <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> The optimum operation of a PV system occurs when the system operates at the unique maximum power point (MPP) for the given <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> Key <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> include the irradiance on the cell, temperature of the cell and any shading phenomenon. Shading can occur due to objects, dust or dirt and module mismatch arising from damage or manufacturing tolerances. These shading effects introduce further nonlinearity into the I–V and P–V characteristics of the system. An extensive variety of MPPT techniques has been proposed which vary from simple estimation techniques to advanced tracking techniques. In this chapter, the criteria for assessing the performance of MPPT methods are defined followed by a complete description and discussion of both techniques designed for uniform <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> and those designed for nonuniform <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

40|$|In an age {{of climate}} change, {{researchers}} need to form a deepened understanding of the determinants of environmental concern, particularly in countries of emerging economies. This paper provides a region-specific investigation {{of the impact of}} socio-economic status (SES) and objective <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> on <b>environmental</b> concern in urban Brazil. We make use of data collected from personal interviews of individuals living in the metropolitan areas of Baixada Santista and Campinas, in the larger São Paulo area. Results from multilevel regression models indicate that wealthier households are more environmentally concerned, as suggested by affluence and post-materialist hypotheses. However, we also observe that increasing environmental concern correlates with a decline in objective <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> Interactions between objective <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> and SES reveal some intriguing relationships: Among poorer individuals, a decline in <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> increases <b>environmental</b> concern as suggested by the objective problems hypothesis, while for the wealthy, a decline in <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> is associated with lower levels of environmental concern...|$|R

This {{is due to}} their broad metabolic versatility, enormous diversity, and ability to grow under extreme <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> Several studies revealed that growth conditions of methanogens are compatible with <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> on extraterrestrial bodies throughout the Solar System. Hence, life in the Solar System might {{not be limited to}} the classical habitable zone. In this contribution we assess the main ecophysiological characteristics of methanogens and compare these to the <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> of putative habitats in the Solar System, in particular Mars and icy moons. Eventually, we give an outlook on the feasibility and the necessity of future astrobiological studies concerning methanogens...|$|R
