40|$|Evidence is accumulating that {{suggests}} that semantic networks are abnormal in schizophrenia. To investigate this further, we examined priming in 42 schizophrenics and 28 normal controls on a lexical decision task involving three different prime-target conditions all at 700 ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) : directly semantically related, indirectly semantically related, and unrelated; and three types of emotional pairings: positive, negative, and neutral. Two schizophrenic groups were compared: nondeluded (no current delusions) and deluded. Schizophrenic patients did not demonstrate significant <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> overall, whereas controls did. However, when material was examined according to emotional pairing, the controls and deluded subjects demonstrated significant priming to neutral word pairs. Neither schizophrenic group showed <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> with positive and negative word pairings, the deluded subjects showing inhibition of priming with negative stimuli. Controls failed to show <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> with negative stimuli. Indirect priming was obtained in all groups. The absence of <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> and indirect priming with negative material in deluded subjects was particularly striking. The results point to quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in semantic networks in schizophrenia.

40|$|Semantic memory {{deficits in}} {{schizophrenia}} (SZ) are profound, {{yet there is}} no research comparing implicit and explicit semantic processing in the same participant sample. In the current study, both implicit and explicit priming are investigated using direct (LION-TIGER) and indirect (LION-STRIPES; where tiger is not displayed) stimuli comparing SZ to healthy controls. Based on a substantive review (Rossell and Stefanovic, 2007) and meta-analysis (Pomarol-Clotet et al., 2008) it was predicted that SZ would be associated with increased indirect priming implicitly. Further, it was predicted that SZ would be associated with abnormal indirect priming explicitly replicating the work of (Assaf et al., 2006). No specific hypotheses were made for implicit <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> due to the heterogeneity of the literature. It was hypothesised that explicit <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> would be intact based on the structured nature of this task. The pattern of results suggests (1) intact reaction time (RT) and error performance implicitly in the face of abnormal <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> and (2) impaired RT and error performance explicitly. This pattern confirms general findings regarding implicit/explicit memory impairments in SZ whilst highlighting the unique pattern of performance specific tosemantic priming.

40|$|Introduction: Schizotypy is {{a useful}} {{schizophrenia}} analogue that controls for confounding factors such as medication and general intellectual decline. In the current study this analogue approach {{was used to examine}} implicit/explicit and direct/indirect semantic memory function. This is the first study to examine both implicit and explicit semantic access in the same schizotypy sample. Methods: Participants completed four semantic tasks: (1) implicit indirect priming, (2) implicit <b>direct</b> <b>priming,</b> (3) explicit object (indirect) task, and (4) explicit association (direct) task. The schizophrenia literature suggests that semantic impairments are associated with thought disorder. As such, participants were divided into low (n= 18) and high (n= 18) schizotypy groups based on their responses to a thought disorder subscale of the Oxford Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-Life) scale. Results: In terms of implicit performance, the high schizotypy group demonstrated increased <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> but nonsignificant indirect priming. The low schizotypy group demonstrated no significant difference in direct and indirect priming. Performance on the explicit tasks was equivalent between the two groups for direct stimuli. On the indirect explicit task, high schizotypy was associated with an increase in errors. Conclusions: Increased <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> in high schizotypy is equivalent to that seen in schizophrenia, which has been interpreted as increased spreading of activation. Abnormal performance using the indirect stimuli was found across implicit and explicit versions. The relevance of these findings to schizophrenia are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} introduction of transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1 into TAP-negative CMT. 64, a {{major histocompatibility complex}} class I (MHC-I) down-regulated mouse lung carcinoma cell line, enhanced T-cell immunity against TAP-deficient tumour cells. Here, we have addressed two questions: (1) whether such immunity can be further augmented by co-expression of TAP 1 with B 7. 1 or H- 2 Kb genes, and (2) which T-cell priming mechanism (tumour <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> or dendritic cell cross-priming) plays the major role in inducing an immune response against TAP-deficient tumours. We introduced the B 7. 1 or H- 2 Kb gene into TAP 1 -expressing CMT. 64 cells and determined which gene co-expressed with TAP 1 was able to provide greater protective immunity against TAP-deficient tumour cells. Our results show that immunization of mice with B 7. 1 and TAP 1 co-expressing but not H- 2 Kb and TAP 1 co-expressing CMT. 64 cells dramatically augments T-cell-mediated immunity, as shown {{by an increase in}} survival of mice inoculated with live CMT. 64 cells. In addition, our results suggest that induction of T-cell-mediated immunity against TAP-deficient tumour cells could be mainly through tumour <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> rather than dendritic cell cross-priming as they show that T cells generated by tumour cell-lysate-loaded dendritic cells recognized TAP-deficient tumour cells much less than TAP-proficient tumour cells. These data suggest that <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> by TAP 1 and B 7. 1 co-expressing tumour cells is potentially a major mechanism to facilitate immune responses against TAP-deficient tumour cells...|$|E
40|$|Against {{a subset}} of human cancers, {{vigorous}} tumor-specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses can develop either spontaneously or upon allogeneic transplantation. However, the parameters that determine the induction of such pronounced anti-tumor immunity remain ill defined. To dissect the conditions required for the induction of high magnitude T cell responses, we have developed a murine model system in which tumor-specific T cell responses can be monitored directly ex vivo by MHC tetramer technology. In this model, tumor challenge of naive mice with Ag-bearing tumor cells results in a massive Ag-specific T cell response, followed by CD 8 (+) T cell-dependent tumor rejection. We have subsequently used this model to assess the contribution of <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> and cross-priming in the induction of tumor immunity in a well-defined system. Our results indicate that <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> of T cells and Ag cross-priming are redundant mechanisms for the induction of tumor-specific T cell immunity.

40|$|Direct {{sequencing}} of cosmid DNAs using {{a library of}} oligonucleotide primers of length 8, 9, or 10 is proposed. The statistics of priming indicate that a primer library sufficient for determining the sequence of the entire human genome (100, 000 cosmids) would be small enough to be assembled and managed. Such a library would greatly reduce the cost and effort of high-volume sequencing: primers would be instantly available; the sequence of each cosmid DNA could be determined from a single DNA preparation without the necessity for mapping or subcloning; and, because each primer would be used repeatedly, the cost of primers would become a negligible fraction of other costs. A combination of random and <b>directed</b> <b>priming</b> could determine the sequence of a cosmid DNA in 1. 2 - 1. 5 times the minimum number of sequencing reactions required, and completely <b>directed</b> <b>priming</b> {{would be even more}} efficient. The success of this strategy requires that a considerable fraction of octamers, nonamers, or decamers be able to prime selectively in double-stranded DNAs 45, 000 base pairs (bp) long; initial results indicate that this {{is likely to be the}} case.

40|$|CTL are {{induced by}} two pathways, i. e. <b>direct</b> <b>priming,</b> where tumor cells present tumor antigens to naïve {{specific}} CTL, and cross-priming, where professional APC cross-present captured tumor antigens to CTL. Here, we examined <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> versus cross-priming after immunizing (H- 2 (b) x H- 2 (d)) F 1 mice with either H- 2 (b) or H- 2 (d) positive tumor cells transfected with the GP or nucleoprotein (NP) of {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus}} (LCMV). Cross-priming was observed for the immunodominant epitopes LCMV-gp 33 and -np 118, although direct induction resulted in higher CTL frequencies. In contrast, CTL specific for the subdominant epitopes LCMV-gp 283 or -np 396 were induced only if epitopes were presented directly on MHC class I molecules of the immunizing cell. The broader repertoire and the higher CTL frequencies induced after vaccination with haplotype-matched tumor cells resulted in more efficient anti-tumor and antiviral protection. Firstly, our results indicate that certain virus and tumor antigens may not be detected by CD 8 (+) T cells because of impaired cross-priming. Secondly, efficient cross-priming contributes to the immunodominant nature of a tumor-specific CTL epitope.

40|$|Tumors {{engineered}} {{to express the}} costimulatory molecule B 7 - 1 can elicit CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) -dependent antitumor responses in immunocompetent mice. It has been postulated that this result reflects <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> of CTL by the modified tumor in vivo. Previous studies of the immune response to a B 7 - 1 - murine colon carcinoma expressing influenza nucleoprotein (NP) as a model tumor antigen have demonstrated the crucial role of bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the priming of NP-specific CTL in vivo. In this system, no evidence of direct CTL priming by tumor was detected. We have performed a similar analysis {{to determine if a}} B 7 - 1 transfectant of this tumor results in the <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> of CTL, and to compare this response to that primed by host APCs. When H- 2 b [...] ~H- 2 bxd bone marrow chimeras were immunized with a single injection of CT 26 /NP/B 7 - 1 (H- 2 d), NP-specific CTL were detected that were restricted to the bone marrow haplotype (H- 2 b), but not to the tumor haplotype. In contrast, CTL recognizing the NP antigenic epitope {{in the context of the}} tumor's major histocompatibility complex were detectable only after multiple immunizations. These results suggest that whereas B 7 - 1 + tumor vaccines result in some degree of direct presentation to CD 8 + T cells, the dominant mechanism of CTL priming is through the uptak...|$|E

40|$|Aberrant {{semantic}} processing {{has been}} linked to the aetiology of formal thought disorder (TD) symptoms in schizophrenia. Two prominent theories, overactivation and disorganized structure of semantic memory, were examined in relation to TD using both implicit (priming) and explicit (fluency) semantic tasks. This study aimed to examine if both theories operated independently or in tandem; and if this differed at the implicit and explicit levels. Greater direct and indirect priming, fluency productivity and category errors were expected for the overactivation theory. Reduced <b>direct</b> <b>priming,</b> fluency productivity and increased category errors would be characteristic of disorganized storage. 57 schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder patients and 48 controls completed a clinical assessment and the semantic tasks. Results showed significantly reduced <b>direct</b> <b>priming</b> in patients compared to controls (p<. 05), while the greater indirect priming was not significant. There was no association between TD and degree of priming. Patients were less likely to recognize a non-word in a task with more related pairs (p<. 05), degrading with severity of positive TD (r=. 30, p<. 001). Although patients produced more category inappropriate words (p<. 005), TD overall did not influence fluency error rates, although negative TD was associated with reduced category and letter productivity (p<. 001). Misattribution, but not semantic overactivation, at the implicit level appears related to TD. At the explicit level, negative TD appears more associated with slower processing than inaccuracy. Overall, the findings support semantic disorganization as a more trait-type impairment contributing to TD symptoms, with overactivation perhaps more characteristic of the acute TD state. Executive dysfunction may combine with semantic dysfunction in the presentation of TD symptomatology...|$|E
