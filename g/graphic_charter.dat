50|$|The University's logo is a stylised {{representation}} of the Pyrénées or the Pic du Midi d'Ossau, the blue triangle being the Atlantic ocean. The colors used (yellow, green blue) {{are those of the}} university's <b>graphic</b> <b>charter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>graphic</b> <b>charter</b> is a {{document}} containing the rules regarding the graphic {{identity of a}} project, company or organisation. It represents a broadening of the entity's visual identity beyond printed matter and signage to encompass media platforms and audio signatures.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the [...] "NRF" [...] logo originally designed by Jean Schlumberger, the <b>graphic</b> <b>charter</b> of this collection - a black border surrounding two red edges - is inspired by the éditions de , with its first title, L'Otage by Paul Claudel, published 26 May 1911. For a time, the first printer of this collection was Verbeke, director of [...] "The St. Catherine Press Ltd", based in Bruges. The generic formats evolved very little over the years, which is a unique case {{in the history of}} French contemporary publishing, although the cream color changed to bright yellow filmed in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Nieuwenhuis {{collaborated with}} both G.W. Dijsselhof and C.A. Lion Cachet on <b>graphic</b> designs. The <b>charters</b> which they {{completed}} in 1892 for the Society for the Promotion of Medicine are {{considered as one}} of the first manifestations of Nieuwe Kunst. He also worked for Philips from 1916-1918. The book Naamloze Vennootschap Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken 1891-1916 was compiled by Jan Feith for the Eindhoven firm, and Nieuwenhuis was responsible for the decoration of the band, the vignettes and decorative edges of the album.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} most {{automobile}} advertising contained illustrations, not photographs. Many of the illustrators {{who worked for}} the advertising agencies servicing the automobile industry were unhappy with their pay and working conditions. Many were members of the Society of Illustrators, but they were told that the Society did not do advocacy work. So those artists banded together to form the Guild as a union of artists. On November 2, 1967, the <b>Graphic</b> Artists Guild <b>charter,</b> based on the Screen Actors Guild constitution, was signed in Detroit, Michigan, by 113 artists. After the Detroit chapter, and the first national office (eventually located in New York City), were founded, artists organized chapters in Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; and San Francisco, California.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, Web 3 D is {{reaching}} a new milestone {{thanks to the}} convergence of various technologies including new Web standards (such as HTML 5 and WebGL), new device controllers to ease 3 D navigation and interaction (Natal Project®, Wiimote®, [...] .) and home 3 D displays. Despite these new factors, the lack of efficient and high level authoring tools to ease the creation and reduce the production cost of Web 3 D interfaces is still a strong impediment to the large scale use of Web 3 D contents. In this article, we present a framework based on current websites design pipeline that is distinguished by content management, <b>graphic</b> <b>charter</b> design and interface design. Moreover, our solution must reach a sufficient level of flexibility in terms of extensibility, of modularity, of genericity of input and output file formats, {{as well as of}} range of interfaces potentially feasible by designers. Thus we propose a software environment allowing metaphor-based information presentation, taking into consideration both the data structure (how the user explores and discovers data) and the visual aspect of the computed environment (the geometry and data representation). These metaphors may be used to visualize large volumes of information coming from databases or classic/semantic search results. The created environments may be highly varying, from 3 D interfaces to 3 D worlds inside which the user can navigate with an avatar and interact with other users. Various examples are given to illustrate the flexibility of the technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis was to lead two {{projects}} concerning live {{high voltage}} working. It has been proposed by RTE (Réseau de Transport d’Électricité, the French Transmission System Operator). Live high voltage working permits to carry out maintenance works without line or substation bay outage. Because it avoids losses in other lines or costs due to energy not supplied, live working is often worthwhile. In engineering units however, young engineers do not have much knowledge about live working and they ask therefore systematically for an outage {{when they have a}} work. To advertise live working, communication tools such as a guide have been elaborated during the thesis. Safety is the principal concern while carrying out live working. Particularly the working distances have to be respected at each moment. Hence work preparations are highly important. In order to visualise the working, drawings are done using a Computer Aided Design software called AutoCAD. Lots of actions have been done in order to make this very complete software easier for operatives who are not designers. They include the library updates, the writing of a <b>graphic</b> <b>charter,</b> the programming of a new library layout, the training specifications and lots of communication. The two projects have common points. At first they did not have precise specifications. As a consequence the chosen solutions are not the good or the bad ones. From an economical point of view, the two projects do not require a huge investment compared to what they could yield. From a technical point of view, both projects are feasible. Finally these projects will be developed in the coming year...|$|E
40|$|Our {{software}} platform {{is composed of}} several tools implemented {{as a set of}} Eclipse plugins using the Eclipse RCP standard "extension point" mechanism. This is the lightweight software integration model we decided to use during the conception of the OPSWP (see deliverable D 2. 2 for details), whose graphical consistency is guaranteed a minima thanks to the basic UI mechanisms (SWT widgets, workspace, etc.) of the Eclipse RCP. Each one of the integrated software tools is part of the model-driven workflow used by our platform to implement its features; however, these tools are not basically conceived to work together, thus undermining the coherency and usability of the OPSWP. Since the usability of our future {{software platform}} is a major concern for us, we are putting much effort into the harmonization of the various software elements to offer the best possible user experience to the system architects who will be our main users. The purpose of this document is to describe how we intend to provide good ergonomics to the OPSWP: we will especially explain the choices we made about the GUI conception. Ergonomics are only a question of usability, which depends on the good organization of GUI, on good use of visual components, forms, and so on. Ergonomics don't define neither the <b>graphic</b> <b>charter</b> nor the visual identity of our software: these "artistic" considerations are part of the project's task 6 (dissemination). The present study is divided into several consecutive parts: we first begin by analyzing user profiles and their related tasks, then we review the technical and architectural constraints that are imposed to us. From all of these, we eventually build a style guide, that defines the usability requirements that shall be followed as guidelines to implement the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of the OPSWP software elements with the expected consistency. This document - not planned at the beginning - is part of task 2 of the OP project. This task is under the responsibility of the INRIA NGE team, and its main goal is the specification, conception and implementation of the OPSWP...|$|E
