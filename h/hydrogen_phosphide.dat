Molecular oxygen was shown to be an extremely effective synergist with phosphine as, under hyperoxic conditions, 100 % mortality was observed in wild-type nematodes exposed to 0. 1 mg/l phosphine, a nonlethal concentration in air. All three mutants were resistant to the synergistic effects of oxygen in proportion to their resistance to phosphine with one mutant, pre- 33, showing complete resistance to this synergism.

40|$|Transition metal phosphides remain {{relatively}} unexplored as water-gas shift catalysts; {{however the}} little {{that has been}} done has produced promising results in terms of performance due to the presence of oxygen rich phases. They can be produced through a number of approaches, the most common being reduction of the phosphate precursor using <b>hydrogen.</b> Bimetallic <b>phosphides</b> have also generated interest recently, e. g. with the addition of cerium there are improvements to the phosphides' activity and with the addition of palladium a decrease in reduction temperature is evident in the precursor material. Nickel phosphide and a range of bimetallic derivatives on a silica support were investigated for their activity in both high and low temperature water-gas shift reactions. All of the catalysts were tested using a continuous flow, fixed bed reactor. Characterization of the catalysts was carried out using XRD, EXAFS, XPS, FTIR, SEM and TEM. The comparison of supported nickel phosphide and an iron based industrial catalyst shows supported nickel phosphide to have good mass normalized activity in comparison to the industrial counterpart under high temperature water-gas shift conditions. The results complement previous studies with regards to potential of nickel phosphide as a water-gas shift catalyst. In view of the results obtained so far for other transition metal phosphides, Ni 2 P appears to be superior for the water-gas shift reaction. One of the most promising aspects of using nickel phosphide in the water-gas shift reaction is its potential resistance to sulfur. Catalyst poisoning caused by impurities such as sulfur are known to deactivate current commercial catalysts for both high and low temperature shift conditions, therefore a catalyst which is resistant to sulfur is an attractive prospect. The sulfur resistant properties of the nickel phosphide catalysts were highlighted by testing them under high temperature water-gas shift conditions in the presence of sulfur. Whilst the catalysts deactivated under the conditions, they showed some residual catalytic activity still remained after sulfur was removed from the feed. Compared with the industrial catalyst, nickel phosphide displayed greater resistance to deactivation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of phosphorus (added as phosphates) on the sulfiding rate of carbon-supported Co–Mo catalysts is studied {{by means of}} temperature-programmed sulfiding. Significant progress is made in understanding the {{influence of}} phosphates on the structure and thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity (atmospheric pressure) of carbon-supported Co–Mo catalysts. The model compound Co 3 (PO 4) 2 · 8 H 2 O is sulfided to minor extent below 800 K. Between 800 and 1000 K, instead of further sulfiding, this compound is reduced to a mixture of CoP and Co 2 P. Phosphates have a large influence on the structure and sulfiding rate of carbon-supported oxidic cobalt and Co–Mo catalysts. Addition of phosphates to these catalysts results {{in the formation of}} 2 ̆ 2 Co–PO 42 ̆ 2 species which are, compared with other cobalt species, relatively difficult to sulfide. Between 650 and 800 K cobaltphosphate species are not sulfided but reduced to cobaltphosphides while disperse sulfided cobalt species react with P 2 O 5 and <b>hydrogen</b> to <b>phosphides,</b> water and <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide. These cobalt sulfide species are formed upon sulfiding of CoO, Co 3 O 4, cobalt nitrates or cobalt species surrounded by a small number of phosphates. The sulfiding of the Mo/C catalyst is hardly influenced by the presence of phosphates. The poisoning of the low-pressure thiophene HDS activity of carbon-supported cobalt and Co–Mo catalysts by phosphorus can be explained by either the formation of 2 ̆ 2 Co–PO 42 ̆ 2 species or CoP and Co 2 P. Which of these explanations is valid depends on the reaction time and conditions. After short reaction times at 673 K, the major part of the cobalt species is present as 2 ̆ 2 Co–PO 42 ̆ 2, whereas the amount present as phosphides increases with reaction time. The Mo/C catalysts are most likely poisoned by phosphorus due to chemisorption of elemental phosphorus (P or P 4) on sulfur anion vacancies present on the edges of the MoS 2 slabs...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the preparation of metal and semiconductor nanostructures in solution, specifically bismuth and indium metal nanoparticles, gallium nitride nanoparticles, indium phosphide nanowires and zinc phosphide nanoparticles. There were two aims: firstly to study if gallium nitride nanoparticles with improved crystallinity and size distribution could be synthesized and secondly to find and develop new methods to prepare crystalline indium phosphide nanowires and zinc phosphide nanoparticles using precursors that are safe and cheap. The crystallinity, structures, morphologies and chemical compositions of the nanostructures synthesized in this thesis were studied primarily by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). For the synthesis of gallium nitride, two approaches were taken. The first revolves around the direct metathesis reaction between gallium trichloride and lithium nitride under ambient pressure. A range of solvents with different polarities has been tested and only in highly polar solvents crystalline nanostructures were produced. These crystalline nanostructures however are not of gallium nitride. The second approach involves thermally decomposing an organometallic precursor. Organometallic compounds [Ga 2 (NMe 2) 6] (compound 1) and [(Me 3 C) 2 Ga(u-NHNHCMe 3) ] (compound 2) were chosen from the literature as precursors. Compound 1 was synthesized in a very small yield together with by-products. Thermal decomposition of the mixture produced no nanoparticles. A compound (compound S 2) which is structurally similar to compound 2 was successfully synthesized and was subjected to thermal decomposition in ammonia to produce crystalline monodispersed nanoparticles. However, these nanoparticles could not be confidently identified as gallium nitride. The outcome from the reaction of lithium borohydride and indium trichloride was found to be strongly solvent dependent. In toluene a white precipitate was obtained. Both in isobutylamine and N,N-diethylaniline indium metal nanoparticles were produced as black solutions. Only in isobutylamine, small monodispersed indium nanoparticles can be produced. The isobutylamine method was extended to prepare bismuth metal nanoparticles. However, the bismuth nanoparticles prepared were moderately polydispersed in size. Two new methods were developed to prepare indium phosphide nanowires from red phosphorus and phosphorus pentabromide via Solution-Liquid-Solid growth. Borohydride reagents are required in both methods to produce chemically active intermediates which further react to form indium phosphide nanowires in the presence of pre-synthesized indium metal or bismuth nanoparticles. The diameter of indium phosphide nanowires prepared from red phosphorus depends strongly on the reaction sequences. If indium metal nanoparticles are formed prior to the addition of red phosphorus, large nanowires (> 300 nm) are produced. Reversing the sequences, small nanowires (50 - 100 nm) are produced. Red phosphorus residue remains in the products regardless of the reaction sequences and is difficult to remove completely by chemical means. The reaction which employs phosphorus pentabromide as precursor proceeds via intermediates of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphide</b> and indium metal to form indium phosphide. The reaction temperature dictates the crystallinity of the product and needs to be > 170 oC to produce crystalline indium phosphide. The way <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphide</b> is introduced to the reaction and {{the presence or absence of}} pre-synthesized metal seeds together control the morphology of indium phosphide synthesized. The best set of conditions established in this thesis allows the preparation of indium phosphide in ~ 100 % nanowire morphology. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphide</b> method was adapted to produce zinc phosphide nanoparticles. The choice of the reaction solvent was found to be most critical. Amorphous particles were produced in trioctylphosphine at as high as 330 oC whereas in oleylamine and N,Ndiethylaniline crystalline zinc phosphide (a-Zn 3 P 2) nanoparticles were produced at ~ 200 oC. An overall conclusion is given in the last chapter comparing the methods developed in this thesis with literature methods paying particular foci on the level of hazard and the costs of the chemical reagents involved...|$|E

Research from the late 1980 s revealed low frequencies of resistance to various residual grain protectant insecticides and to phosphine in grain insect species collected in Oklahoma. The present work, which used the same previously established discriminating dose bioassays for phosphine toxicity as in the earlier study, evaluated adults of nine different populations of red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and five populations of lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) collected from different geographic locations in Oklahoma. One additional population for each species was a laboratory susceptible strain. Discriminating dose assays determined eight out of the nine T. castaneum populations, and all five populations of R. dominica, contained phosphine-resistant individuals, and highest resistance frequencies were 94 and 98 %, respectively. DoseÐresponse bioassays and logit analyses determined that LC 99 values were 3 ppm for susceptible and 377 ppm for resistant T. castaneum, and 2 ppm for susceptible and 3, 430 ppm for resistant R. dominica.

40|$|The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), is {{a common}} stored-product pest found worldwide. Phosphine, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphide</b> (PH 3), is the most {{commonly}} used fumigant for stored grains, for which genetically based resistance has been recorded for several pest species. This study assessed phosphine resistance in 25 T. castaneum populations from across the United States and Canada using a discriminating dose bioassay. Dose-mortality assays were conducted with adults from seven of these populations to categorize weak and strong resistance phenotypes. Phosphine resistance was detected in 12 out of the 25 populations, and the frequency of resistance within populations varied from 2 % in Victoria, TX, to 100 % in Red Level, AL. Two resistant populations from Kansas that had been sampled three years earlier were found to have similar resistance frequencies in the current study. None of the four Canadian populations had any detectable resistance among the insects tested. Resistance ratio calculations from LC 50 value in resistant populations relative to the LC 50 for the laboratory susceptible strain allowed resistance phenotypes to be assigned as either weak resistance, at 5 - to 26 -fold resistance relative to susceptible, or strong resistance at 95 - to 127 -fold relative to susceptible. This study suggests that proper resistance assessment techniques can help to determine occurrence of phosphine resistance in populations of T. castaneum and can further characterize the strength of resistance present. These data can be used to support resistance management programs that consider either cessation or modification of phosphine fumigation to control T. castaneum...|$|E

40|$|Phosphine, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphide</b> (PH 3), gas is a {{fumigant}} {{that is used}} worldwide {{to protect}} stored grain from infestation by insect pests. Despite {{a long history of}} phosphine use, little is known about either the mode of action of this compound or the mechanisms whereby insect pests have become resistant. To better understand phosphine toxicity and resistance mechanisms, a genetically well-characterised model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, was used in my PhD project. Three previously created phosphine resistant C. elegans mutants (pre- 1, pre- 7 and pre- 33) developed from the wild type N 2 strain were used in this study, though analysis of pre- 33 was the primary focus. The three mutants were determined to be 2, 5 and 9 times more resistant toward phosphine than was the parental N 2 strain by comparison of LC 50 values. Molecular oxygen was shown to be an extremely effective synergist with phosphine as, under hyperoxic conditions, 100 % mortality was observed in wild-type nematodes exposed to 0. 1 mg/l phosphine, a non-lethal concentration in air. All three mutants were resistant to the synergistic effects of oxygen in proportion to their resistance to phosphine with one mutant, pre- 33, showing complete resistance to this synergism. I take the proportionality of cross-resistance between phosphine and the synergistic effect of oxygen to imply that all three mutants circumvent a mechanism of phosphine toxicity that is directly coupled to oxygen metabolism. Compared with the wild-type strain, each of the three mutants has an extended average life expectancy of 12. 5 to 25. 3 %. This is consistent with the proposed involvement of oxidative stress in both phosphine toxicity and ageing. Indeed, a correlation between phosphine resistance and resistance to other stressors (e. g. heavy metal, heat and UV) was also detected. On the other hand, no significant difference in methyl viologen sensitivity was found between pre- 33 and N 2 strains, suggesting that pre- 33 mutant does not seem to provide resistance to phosphine via protection against oxidative damage. Additionally, to test for possible involvement of the DAF- 2 /DAF- 16 signalling pathway in the phosphine response, the levels of phosphine sensitivity of mutants in this pathway were tested. Phosphine resistance levels were increased in daf- 2 and age- 1 mutants but decreased in daf- 16 nematodes, which mirrors the longevity phenotypes of these mutants, suggesting some congruence in glucose signalling between the phosphine resistance and longevity traits. In contrast, no congruence is observed between phosphine resistance and oxidative metabolism as the clk-mutation, which disrupts oxidative metabolism does not cause phosphine resistance and neither do the phosphine resistant mutants cause the severe developmental delay of the clk- 1 mutation. The phosphine induced time-dependent mortality was assessed in both N 2 and pre- 33 nematodes at two fixed phosphine concentrations (0. 3 and 3. 0 mg/l), allowing the determination of minimum exposure periods required for any mortality as well as the exposure time required to achieve 50 % mortality. As a result, it was determined that 15 hours of exposure was needed for significant mortality in N 2 and pre- 33 strain when exposed to 0. 3 and 3. 0 mg/l of phosphine, respectively; whereas this period is 5 hours for N 2 when treated with 3. 0 mg/l phosphine. The fact that the LT 50 value for N 2 at 0. 3 mg/l phosphine is indistinguishable from that of pre- 33 at 3. 0 mg/l (24. 6 and 24. 5 respectively) suggests that 0. 3 and 3. 0 mg/l of phosphine have the same toxic effects on N 2 and pre- 33 nematodes respectively. This result is consistent with the finding that pre- 33 is ~ 9 fold more resistant to phosphine than is the N 2 strain. Moreover, the LT 50 was determined to be 8. 4 hours for N 2 when treated with 3. 0 mg/l of phosphine, which is only three times faster than pre- 33 when exposed to the same level of phosphine. In contrast to the differential toxicity of phosphine between the N 2 and pre- 33 lines, the delay in reaching reproductive maturity caused by phosphine exposure is indistinguishable between WT and pre- 33 nematodes. This indicates that the phosphine induced delay in maturation is independent of the toxic effects of phosphine. Since the inhibition of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been proposed as a mechanism of phosphine toxicity, the phosphine effects on cellular ATP metabolism, presented as ATP+ADP content and ATP/ADP ratio, were also assessed. Phosphine exposure (0. 3 mg/l, 25 hours) led to a significant decrease in ATP+ADP levels as well as the ATP/ADP ratio in N 2 nematodes. Similar results were also detected in pre- 33 nematodes when exposed to 3. 0 mg/l phosphine for 25 hours. These observations indicate that phosphine can interrupt cellular ATP metabolism, which is associated with phosphine induced mortality. Additionally, the fact that mutant pre- 33 can maintain its ATP levels under phosphine exposure at 0. 3 mg/l suggests it has a greater ability to maintain mitochondrial function than does the N 2 strain. To better understand the mechanism of phosphine toxicity in the wild type N 2 strain, gene expression profiling by DNA microarray analysis was employed. A significant overlap between phosphine and DAF- 16 regulated genes was detected, supporting the previous finding that the DAF- 2 /DAF- 16 pathway can contribute to phosphine resistance. Phosphine exposure also strongly induced xenobiotic detoxification and stress responses, indicating nematodes are able to sense phosphine induced toxic effects and protect themselves by switching on native detoxification mechanisms. Furthermore, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were also up-regulated by phosphine, possibly due to an increase in energy demand caused by increased xenobiotic detoxification activities. Consistent with the previous findings that phosphine delays median reproductive age and reduces fertility, expressions {{of a large number of}} genes involved in growth, embryonic development and reproduction were suppressed by phosphine. Moreover, the microarray results of seven genes whose expression levels were significantly altered by phosphine were validated using RT-PCR, confirming the robustness of the microarray results. The most direct way to determine the phosphine resistance mechanism in mutant pre- 33 is to identify and characterise the mutation itself. Using a classic F 1 test, the resistance mutation in pre- 33 was determined to be incompletely recessive. Additionally, using three mapping strategies, the resistance mutation was mapped to Chromosome IV between 12, 591, 683 and 12, 879, 637 bp with 45 genes located in this small region. In an attempt to identify the resistance gene, the effect of suppressing each of 28 of the 45 genes in the interval was determined using a commercially available gene suppression library. It was observed that only knockdown of gene vha- 7 resulted in a slight decrease in phosphine sensitivity (84. 6 %) compared to N 2 (97. 6 %). However, this result does not clearly implicate vha- 7 as the resistance gene in pre- 33. The microarray results indicated that linoleate and arachidonate signalling pathways might be activated by phosphine. This was observed as induction of a phospholipase A 2 gene that regulates the release of arachidonic acid from the C- 2 position of membrane phospholipids, as well as several CYP genes predicted to catalyse the oxidation of linoleate and arachidonate. Therefore, phosphine effects on the linoleate and arachidonate dependent signalling pathways were assessed. It was found that, in the presence of phosphine, the pre- 33 mutant has a greater ability to transform linoleate and arachidonate epoxides to diols than does N 2. This activity may help pre- 33 to better maintain mitochondrial function and, therefore, ATP metabolism than N 2 during phosphine exposure. The microarray results also showed that phosphine exposure caused up-regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, indicating phosphine regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. As expected, a preliminary metabonomic analysis by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) into the effect of phosphine exposure on metabolism in N 2 nematodes revealed significant alteration of the metabonomic profile...|$|E
