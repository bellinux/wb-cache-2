5|$|In the 1950s, Saigon {{designers}} {{tightened the}} fit of the ao dai to create the version commonly seen today. Trần Kim of Thiết Lập Tailors and Dũng of Dũng Tailors created a dress with raglan sleeves and a <b>diagonal</b> <b>seam</b> that runs from the collar to the underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The ao dai was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A brightly colored áo dài hippy was introduced in 1968. The áo dài mini, a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels that reached only to the knee.|$|E
50|$|A {{raglan sleeve}} {{is a type}} of sleeve whose {{distinguishing}} characteristic is to extend in one piece fully to the collar, leaving a <b>diagonal</b> <b>seam</b> from underarm to collarbone giving the garment a relatively undefined look.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} types of copper domes, spires, and vaults, both with simple {{geometries}} or complex curved surfaces and multi-faceted designs. Examples include circular domes with <b>diagonal</b> flat <b>seam</b> systems, circular domes with standing seam systems, circular domes with flat seam systems, conical spires, flat seam roofing on octagonal spires, standing seam barrel vaults, and flat seam barrel vaults. Information about steps for dome panel layouts and specifications for copper constructions is available.|$|R
500|$|Lurie Garden is {{bisected}} by {{a diagonal}} boardwalk, {{which represents the}} natural Lake Michigan seawall that still bisects Grant Park. The boardwalk divides the garden into two plates, one of which contains muted colors, the other bright colors, while paralleling {{the line of the}} old Illinois Central Railroad retaining wall. [...] The dark plate represents the early landscape history of the site, while the light plate represents the landscape of the future. [...] The <b>diagonal</b> plate-dividing <b>seam</b> boardwalk serves as a demarcation between two eras of Chicago's landscape development. [...] It also serves as a reminder of the time when Chicago placed boards over the marshland for pedestrians.|$|R
50|$|A town-weight silk top hat is made {{by first}} {{blocking}} two pieces of gossamer (or goss for short), which is made of a sheet of cheesecloth that has been coated with a shellac and ammonia solution and left to cure for 5 months on a wooden frame, on a wooden top hat block (which is made of several interconnecting pieces like a puzzle so the block can {{be removed from the}} shell, as the opening is narrower than tip of the crown) to form the shell. After the shell has rested for a week in the block, the block is removed and the brim (made of several layers of goss to give it strength) is attached to the crown. The shell is coated with a layer of shellac varnish and also left for a further week. The silk plush is then cut to the correct pattern. The top and side pieces are sewn together; the side piece having an open <b>diagonal</b> <b>seam.</b> It is then eased over the shell carefully and then ironed (the heat of the iron melting the shellac for the plush to stick to it). The upper brim is also covered with a piece of silk plush or with silk petersham (a ribbed silk). The underbrim is covered with merino cloth. After the hat has fully rested, the brim is curled and bound with silk grosgrain ribbon, and a hat band (either silk grosgrain with or without a bow, or a black wool mourning band without a bow) is installed. Finally, the lining and the leather sweatband are carefully hand-stitched in.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{cerebellar}} ataxia show increased upper body movements, which {{have an impact}} on balance and walking. AIM: In this study, we investigated the effect of using dynamic movement orthoses (DMO), designed as elastic suits, on trunk motion and gait parameters. DESIGN: A longitudinal uncontrolled study. SETTING: Rehabilitative outpatient unit. POPULATION: Eleven patients (seven men, four women; mean age of 49. 9 ± 9. 5) with degenerative {{cerebellar ataxia}} were enrolled in this study. METHODS: Linear overground gait of patients was recorded by means of an optoelectronic gait analysis system before DMO use (DMO-) and during DMO use (DMO+). Time-distance parameters, lower limb joint kinematics, body sway, trunk oscillations, and gait variability (coefficient of variation, CV) were recorded. Patient satisfaction with DMO device was measured using Quebec user evaluation of satisfaction with assistive technology. RESULTS: When using the DMO, patients showed a significant decrease in stance phase duration, double support phase duration, swing phase CV, pelvic range of movements (ROMs), body sway, and trunk ROMs. A significant increase was observed in the swing phase duration and knee joint ROMs. Out of 11 patients, 10 were either quite satisfied (8 points) or very satisfied (2 points) with the assistive device. CONCLUSIONS: The DMO reduce the upper body motion and in improve balance- related gait parameters. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: We propose use of DMO as an assistive/rehabilitative device in the neurorehabilitation of cerebellar ataxia to improve the trunk control and gait stability. DMO may be considered a prototype that can be modified in terms of material characteristics, textile layers, elastic components, and <b>diagonal</b> and lateral <b>seams...</b>|$|R
