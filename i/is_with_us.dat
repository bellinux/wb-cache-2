5|$|Route 37 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Hillandale Road (SR 847), a local frontage road {{along the east}} side of I-81, and Tasker Road (SR 642), which leads southeast to US 522 near Armel. It immediately crosses I-81 at exit 310, a diamond interchange with two traffic signals on SR 37, and then becomes a freeway, soon junctioning US 11 (Valley Pike) with a partial cloverleaf. The next interchange is a diamond at Cedar Creek Grade (SR 622), and SR 37 reaches its approximate midpoint at US 50 (Northwestern Pike), another diamond. A trumpet interchange completed in 2001 connects to the Winchester Medical Center, and the final diamond <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 522 (Frederick Pike) at the northwestern corner. SR 37 ends at a partial Y interchange with US 11 (Martinsburg Pike), at which SR 37 traffic can only access US 11 north and only traffic from US 11 south can access SR 37, although a northbound exit to Cives Lane was added in about 2000 to allow SR 37 traffic to access US 11 south. About 1/2 mile (1km) of US 11 is a divided highway, connecting SR 37 with I-81 at exit 317.|$|E
25|$|State {{symbols of}} Russia include the Byzantine double-headed eagle, {{combined}} with St. George of Moscow in the Russian coat of arms. The Russian flag {{dates from the}} late Tsardom of Russia period and has been widely used {{since the time of}} the Russian Empire. The Russian anthem shares its music with the Soviet Anthem, though not the lyrics. The imperial motto God <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and the Soviet motto Proletarians of all countries, unite! are now obsolete and no new motto has replaced them. The hammer and sickle and the full Soviet coat of arms are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. The Soviet Red Stars are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The Red Banner continues to be honored, especially the Banner of Victory of 1945.|$|E

The Russian flag appeared in the late Tsardom of Russia period and became widely used during the era of the Russian Empire.

25|$|The {{school had}} three badges during its history. The {{first was the}} Bath Technical College badge which was a simple design - BTC in thin red letters within a shield {{outlined}} with a thin red line- and this lasted until the Bath Technical School was renamed in 1949. The second badge lasted until early 1954 and is recorded on the school photograph of March 1950 and the school website. The third badge, which lasted until 1970, was designed in early 1954 by Mr Ken Box, Head of Art and included the motto, 'NISI DOMINUS FRUSTRA'. The literal translation is 'UNLESS THE LORD IN VAIN'. This is not much help. The motto is based on Psalm 127 and the more usual translation is 'EXCEPT THE LORD APPROVE WE LABOUR IN VAIN' while another translation might be 'UNLESS THE LORD <b>IS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>US</b> OUR EFFORTS ARE IN VAIN'.The badge has the Book of Knowledge open to show the motto, over the City wall with the Avon beneath. The open pages are white with yellow ends, the City wall is yellow, the river Avon white and the background a shade of blue.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{probable}} that many Englishmen who read the Empire League's manifesto at the regarded it as unduly alarmist, but subsequent events proved the soundness of the views it expressed. From 1881 onwards, two great rival ideas came into being, each strongly opposed to the other. One was that of Imperialism â€” full civil rights for every [...] "civilized" [...] man, whatever his race might be, under the supremacy and protection of Britain. The other was nominally republican, but in fact exclusively oligarchic and Dutch. The policy of the extremists of this last party was summed up in the appeal, which President Kruger made to the Free State in February 1881, when he bade them: [...] "Come and help us. God <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> It is his will to unite us as a people ... to make a united South Africa free from British authority." ...|$|E

We are men, and not mere animals, because a special form of it <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> always; we are nobler and baser men, as it <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> more or less; but it is never given to us in any degree which can make us more than men.|$|E
