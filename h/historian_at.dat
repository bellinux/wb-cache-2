25|$|Rudolph Binion, a <b>historian</b> <b>at</b> Brandeis University, {{considers}} the supposed hysteria diagnosis as a fallacy; in his 1976 book Hitler among the Germans, however, {{he picked up}} the secret service's suspicions and expanded them. Binion assumed that Weiss had met Forster in person and received from him a copy of the medical record on which his novel then was based. Following the novel, Binion then assumes that Forster subjected the blind, fanatical Hitler to a hypnotic suggestion treatment, and later, after being suspended from the civil service and in fear of persecution by the Gestapo, took his own life. The only evidence for these assumptions is construed from Forster’s legacy, while there isn’t even proof of what sort of contact Forster had with Hitler.|$|E

25|$|James S. Donnelly, Jr., a <b>historian</b> <b>at</b> the University of Wisconsin–Madison, {{wrote in}} his book, Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland:I would draw the {{following}} broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances (evictions) contributed {{in a major way}} to enshrining the idea of English state-sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one should say in the Irish mind, for this was a notion that appealed to many educated and discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority...And it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during {{and as a result of}} the clearances had the look of genocide to a great many Irish.|$|E

25|$|Donald Niewyk and Frances Nicosia {{write that}} the death toll was at least 130,000 out of the nearly one million Romani who resided in Nazi-controlled Europe. Michael Berenbaum writes that serious {{scholarly}} estimates lie between 90,000 and 220,000. A study by Sybil Milton, senior <b>historian</b> <b>at</b> the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, calculated a death toll of at least 220,000 and possibly closer to 500,000, but this study explicitly excluded the Independent State of Croatia where the genocide of Romanies was intense. Martin Gilbert estimates {{a total of more}} than 220,000 deaths out of the 700,000 Romani who lived in Europe. Ian Hancock, Director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, has argued in favor of a much higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000 deaths, claiming that the Romani death toll proportionally equaled or exceeded that of Jewish victims.|$|E
25|$|On 4 October 1939 in Berlin, Adolf Hitler {{issued the}} order {{to blow up the}} Royal Castle. On 10 October 1939, special German units, under the {{supervision}} of history and art experts (Dr. Dagobert Frey, an art <b>historian</b> <b>at</b> the University of Wrocław; Gustaw Barth, the director of museums in Wrocław, and Dr. Joseph Mühlmann, an art historian from Vienna) started to demount floor, marbles, sculptures and stone elements such as fireplaces or moulds. The artefacts were taken to Germany or stored in Kraków's warehouses. Many of them were also seized by various Nazi dignitaries who resided in Warsaw. The Castle was totally emptied. Disobeying German orders, despite the danger of being shot, Polish museum staff and experts in art restoration managed to save many of the works of art from the castle, as well as fragments of the stucco-work, the parquet floors, the wood panelling, and more which were later used in the reconstruction. The great service done to Poland by Professor Stanisław Lorentz, in leading this campaign to save the castle's treasures, is well known. Wehrmacht sappers then bored tens of thousands of holes for dynamite charges in the stripped walls.|$|E
