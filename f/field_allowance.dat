With advisory and partnership from Columbia University, the Ifakara Health Institute and the Tanzanian Training Centre for International Health (TTCIH) developed and implemented the Connect Project as a randomized cluster experimental {{trial of the}} childhood survival impact of recruiting, training, and deploying of a new cadre of paid community health workers (CHW), named "Wawazesha wa afya ya Jamii" (WAJA). This paper presents an estimation {{of the cost of}} training and deploying WAJA in three rural districts of Tanzania. Costing data were collected by tracking project activity expenditure records and conducting in-depth interviews of TTCIH staff who have led the training and deployment of WAJA, as well as their counterparts at Public Clinical Training Centres who have responsibility for scaling up the WAJA training program. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Register number (ISRCTN 96819844). The Connect training cost was US$ 2, 489. 3 per WAJA, of which 40. 1 % was for meals, 20. 2 % for accommodation 10. 2 % for tuition fees and the remaining 29. 5 % for other costs including instruction and training facilities and <b>field</b> <b>allowance.</b> A comparable training program estimated unit cost for scaling-up this training via regional/district clinical training centres would be US$ 833. 5 per WAJA. Of this unit cost, 50. 3 % would involve the cost of meals, 27. 4 % training fees, 13. 7 % for field allowances, 9 % for accommodation and medical insurance. The annual running cost of WAJA in a village will cost US$ 1. 16 per capita.

40|$|From {{several years}} of Atmosphere Explorer data, it is shown that {{large-scale}} plasma density depletions (horizontal scale greater than 1000 km) in the nocturnal F region occur mainly {{during the first half}} of the night. The geomagnetic latitude of these depletions depends on season: at solstice periods the occurrence is mainly in the summer hemisphere and at equinoxes mainly on the geomagnetic equator. Large-scale depletions occur most often at longitudes characterized by a large magnetic declination. The large-scale plasma depletions are interpreted to be a consequence of imposed upward drift which raises the F region above the satellite trajectory. This interpretation is tested by calculating the vertical ion drift velocity imposed by zonal and meridional winds and electrostatic <b>fields,</b> with <b>allowance</b> for the effects of diffusion. The calculations reveal a correspondence between the locations of maxima in the calculated vertical ion drift velocity and the large-scale plasma depletions...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with school inspection in Tanzania. The main aim was to explore {{the extent to which}} school inspection has an impact upon teaching and learning in Tanzanian primary schools and to give some insights into how it might be organised to influence teachers’ work performance. The theoretical framework was grounded on the Scientific Management, Human Relations and Critical theories with the argument that though teachers have to follow pre-determined objectives in a refined curriculum, they possess potential independent thinking that can shape their teaching and learning for pupils’ academic excellence hence, a sense of emancipation and ownership of the process. The study was essentially qualitative with some aspects of a quantitative approach and it employed 59 participants. These were 50 teachers, 8 school inspectors and 1 district education officer. Empirical data were collected through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussion and from documentary evidence. The findings indicated that school inspection plays a potential role towards improving teaching and learning. Teachers perceived the advice and feedback given through inspection reports and recommendations useful for making improvements in their work performance. However, the study found that inspections reports and recommendations were not acted upon by the respective authorities to bring about effective impact on teaching and learning. It was also found that, to a greater extent school inspectors had succeeded in establishing positive relations with teachers. The majority of teachers stated that school inspectors used friendly language when discussing with them. The study further revealed that, school inspectors judged the performance of the schools based on schemes of work, lesson plans and pupils’ exercise books, whereas classroom observations were not effectively carried out. It was also found that school inspectors’ working conditions were poor. For example, they did not have a means of transport nor <b>field</b> <b>allowances</b> to facilitate their visits in schools. From the above findings, the study recommends the government to commit its resources towards school inspectorate department for effective monitoring of the quality education provided. Classroom observations should be a central focus of the school inspectors for their impact on teaching/learning to be realised. Moreover, for improvements in teaching and learning to be achieved the director and the DEO should make use of the inspection findings and recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Frequency light shifts {{resulting}} from the localization effects and effects of the quantization of translational atomic motion in an optical lattice is studied for a forbidden optical transition J= 0 →J= 0. In the Lamb-Dicke regime this shift {{is proportional to the}} square root from the lattice <b>field</b> intensity. With <b>allowance</b> made for magneto-dipole and quadrupole transitions, the shift does not vanish at the magic wavelength, at which the linear in intensity shift is absent. Preliminary estimates show that this shift can have a principal significance for the lattice-based atomic clocks with accuracy of order of 10 ^- 16 - 10 ^- 18. Apart from this, we find that the numerical value of the magic frequency depends on the concrete configuration of the lattice field and it can vary within the limits 1 - 100 MHz (depending on element) as one passes from one field configuration to another. Thus, theoretical and experimental investigations of contributions originated from magneto-dipole and quadrupole transitions are of principal self-dependent interest.

Reflectivity measurements at a wavelength of 819 nm reveal a high (72 Â°) pseudo-Brewster angle and non-zero p-reflectivity whilst electrical measurements using a four-point probe return a conductivity of 1 Ã 9 ̆ 7 10 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 25 S cmâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21. Unexpectedly the disks also exhibit magneto-optic (MO) activity which it appears must arise from a weak magnetic component intrinsic to the samples. In both the longitudinal and transverse Kerr configurations large fractional changes in reflectivity (Î 9 ̆ 4 I/I â 8 ̆ 98 ̆ 8 2. 5 Ã 9 ̆ 7 10 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 22) are observed across a wide range of angles of incidence for wavelengths between 400 nm and 1064 nm on application and reversal of a magnetic field. Anomalously for these configurations all the MO effects observed are quadratic in the applied field and no first-order effects linear in applied field are observed for any state of incident polarisation. Examined using conventional magnetometry, disk samples return saturation magnetization values of 4. 13 Ã 9 ̆ 7 10 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 23 emu gâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21 on a vibrating sample magnetometer and smaller samples similarly processed and prepared for examination by Squid magnetometer confirmatory values of 4. 9 Ã 9 ̆ 7 10 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 23 emu gâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21. Magnetization curves from both instruments have a similar form, saturating at about 1. 14 kOe, and are also in close correspondence with curves derived by plotting the magneto-optic signal as a function of <b>field</b> after <b>allowance</b> for the quadratic nature of the observed MO response. Similarly, both the magnetic and magneto-optic behaviour of all samples is isotropic in plane. Taken together, all experimental observations on this fully organic polymer appear, surprisingly, to be commensurate with the development at room temperature of some form of magnetic state throughout very limited regions of the material. A very tentative model able to reconcile the magnetic and MO observations on the supposition that the magnetic state may be of a reduced dimensional nature is presented. We are very aware that the appearance of an intrinsic room temperature magnetism in the material studied is highly unlikely and that this interpretation of the results presented is strongly dependent on using MO evidence to support chemical analysis, which included multi-elements scans on an ICP and ESR, in precluding contamination...|$|R
40|$|Det har i de senere år skjedd store forandringer på folketrygdens område. Det har blitt lagt mer og mer vekt på viktigheten av å kunne være i aktivitet hvis det ikke er medisinske hindringer for dette. I endringene som er foretatt, er det fokus på den enkeltes muligheter til å være i arbeid mer enn på eventuelle begrensninger. Dette kommer fram gjennom endringer på sykefraværsområdet med innføring av aktivitetsplikt for den sykmeldte og gjennom ny sykefraværsmodell med fokus på oppfølging, involvering av arbeidsgiver, behandler og NAV. Arbeidsplassen er hovedarena for sykefraværsoppfølging, og arbeidsgiver og arbeidstaker er hovedaktører. Dette er en videreføring av føringene i Intensjonsavtalen om et inkluderende arbeidsliv. Også på området for rehabiliteringspenger, yrkesrettet attføring og uføreytelser legges det vekt på at den enkelte skal forsøke seg i arbeid hvis det medisinsk sett er mulig. I 2010 skjer det en større endring ved at rehabiliteringspenger, yrkesrettet attføring og tidsbegrenset uførestønad fjernes og erstattes med arbeidsavklaringspenger, en ytelse hvor det også legges vekt på aktivitet. Samtidig innføres arbeidsevnevurdering med full tyngde som arbeidsmetode internt i NAV. På yrkesskadeområdet har det skjedd få endringer, men organiseringen av yrkesskadeordningen i Norge er under utredning. Samhandling med og kompetansetilbud til sykmeldere er gjennomført i de siste årene. Det er også utviklet statistikk over sykmeldinger skrevet ut av fastleger, et verktøy som kan benyttes i dialog med den enkelte fastlege. Fortsatt er mange sykmeldt eller på varige ytelser. Årsakene til dette er sammensatte. Det er behov for videre forskning på folketrygdens områder.   Damberg G. "From {{inactivity}} to action" - {{a review}} of development {{and changes in the}} national insurance scheme in recent years. Nor J Epidemiol 2009; 19 (2) : 139 - 146.   E NGLISH SUMMARY Recent years have seen major changes within the national insurance scheme. The importance of individual activity has been more and more emphasized in cases where there are no medical obstacles. The changes that have been made focus on the individual's opportunity to work actively rather than possible limitations. This manifests itself through changes in the field of sickness absence with the introduction of compulsory activity for the persons on sick leave, as well as a new sickness absence model focussing on follow-up, involvement of employers, the medical practitioner and The National Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). The work-place is the most suitable arena for follow-up of sickness absence, and employer and employee are the most important participants. This is a continuation of the Letter of intent on a more inclusive working life (IW). Also within the <b>fields</b> of rehabilitation <b>allowance,</b> vocational rehabilitation and disability benefits emphasis is placed on the individual's willingness to try working if medically feasible. The year 2010 will see extensive modifications of rehabilitation allowance, vocational training and time limited disability benefit, which all will be replaced by "work ability assessment benefit" (AAP), a benefit which also emphasizes activity. At the same time a special assessment of work ability will be introduced as a working method internally in NAV. In the field of occupational injury there are few changes, but the organisation of the occupational injury scheme is under revision. Cooperation with medical practitioners and offers of training has been intensified during the past few years. NAV has also developed statistics over sick leave issued by general practitioners. This tool will be used in dialogue with the general practitioner. Still, many persons are on sick leave and long term benefits. The reasons for this are complex. Further research is needed within the field of national insurance. </p...|$|R
