5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates {{for each of the}} 435 House Districts. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that their constituents were in favor of women attaining the vote. Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year. On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage. After attending the NWP convention in Chicago in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado. By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.|$|E

Many businesses have no free parking available, or do for only limited amounts of time. Even suburban plazas and big box stores often have parking security to ensure both patron safety and designated use of parking. In many suburban residential areas, {{people do not have}} their own private garages as properties are small due to high land values. A parking pass even for residents of a high rise residential building often costs an additional fee over the rent or association dues.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} of near-exclusivity by CBS, the network {{provided}} to its local affiliates three types of feeds from each venue: constant feed, swing feed, and flex feed. Constant feeds remained primarily on a given game, and were used primarily by stations with a clear local interest in a particular game. Despite its name, a constant feed occasionally veered away to other games for brief updates (as is typical in most American sports coverage), but coverage generally remained with the initial game. A swing feed tended to stay on games believed to be of natural interest to the locality, such as teams from local conferences, but may leave that game to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> games that during their progress become close matches. On a flex feed, coverage bounced around from one venue to another, depending on action at the various games in progress. If one game was a blowout, coverage could switch to a more competitive game. A flex feed was provided {{when there were no}} games with a significant natural local interest for the stations carrying them, which allowed the flex game to be the best game in progress. Station feeds were planned in advance and stations had the option of requesting either constant or flex feed for various games.|$|E

500|$|Several other {{connections}} play {{important roles}} in hippocampal function. [...] Beyond the output to the EC, additional output pathways <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex. [...] A major output goes via the fornix to the lateral septal area and to the mammillary body of the hypothalamus (which the fornix interconnects with the hippocampus). The hippocampus receives modulatory input from the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine systems, and from the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus to field CA1. [...] A very important projection comes from the medial septal nucleus, which sends cholinergic, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) stimulating fibers [...] (GABAergic fibers) to {{all parts of the}} hippocampus. [...] The inputs from the medial septal nucleus {{play a key role in}} controlling the physiological state of the hippocampus; [...] destruction of this nucleus abolishes the hippocampal theta rhythm and severely impairs certain types of memory.|$|E
