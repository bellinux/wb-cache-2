500|$|Asked {{to choose}} {{the best player in}} history, Henderson declined, saying, [...] "There are <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> done {{different}} things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything." [...] Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, [...] "I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered." [...] Of his various records and achievements, he values his career runs scored mark the most: [...] "You have to score to win." ...|$|E
500|$|Kinsler, {{who already}} had 30 stolen bases, hit his 30th home run on September 25, {{becoming}} the only major leaguer to join the 30–30 club in 2009, and the 34th major leaguer ever. He became only the second player in Rangers' history to have a 30–30 season (joining Alfonso Soriano, who did it in 2005), and joined Soriano (who also had 30–30 seasons in 2002 and 2003 for the Yankees) and Brandon Phillips (2007) as the only 30–30 second basemen in Major League history. [...] "It's an incredible accomplishment", said Michael Young. [...] "I've played with <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had some incredible seasons here, but 30–30 is something special. He deserves a lot of credit. He battled all season long. That's what separates the great players from the good ones." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the court}} issued its decision, some {{commentators}} praised the Court's ruling for [...] "further individual liberty by striking down a government’s unjustified censorship of protected speech". David A. Cortman, counsel for Good News Community Church, said the Court's ruling was an [...] "important victory {{for all the}} little <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> ever found their speech silenced by the strong arm of government". Likewise, Nina Totenberg reported that one consequence of the Court's decision is that [...] "the government has much less power to regulate how other people speak." [...] However, other commentators criticized the majority opinion's methodology; Hadley Arkes, for example, wrote that the Court's decision [...] "revealed the unlovely spectacle of the conservatives talking themselves ever deeper into a genuine moral relativism in the regulation of speech". Some analysts also claimed the majority's opinion left open unanswered questions within the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. Lyle Denniston, for example, suggested that after the Court issued its decisions in Reed and Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, [...] "the meaning of the First Amendment, in general, became somewhat more confusing". Eugene Volokh also suggested the Court's opinion {{is likely to be}} litigated again in lower courts.|$|E

500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E

O'Brien spoke with three people who worked with Trump for years and who believed his net worth to be between $150 million and $250 million. O'Brien said he was told by Trump, [...] "You {{can go ahead and}} speak to <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> 400-pound wives at home who are jealous of me, but the guys who really know me know I'm a great builder." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} at Edgbaston is {{reputed to be}} the most hostile in England for visiting teams. Former England captain Alec Stewart recalled [...] "On a world level I would put it up there with Eden Gardens in Calcutta, which holds about 100,000. It inspires a team. It's like having another man in your side." [...] and the former England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones describes how [...] "The crowd here makes such a big noise when you are doing well ... it's a unique environment." [...] After winning the 2015 Ashes Test Match with Australia at Edgbaston, England captain Alastair Cook commented [...] "The Edgbaston crowd was up there with the loudest I can remember. With some of the chants, even <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> played a fair bit of cricket were looking at each other and realising how special it was. Edgbaston has been a fantastic venue for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} was made to not use the Cox/Davies script, which gave Gilliam only ten days to write another. Gilliam has stated in an interview [...] "When we were writing the script, we really tried not to invent anything. We sort of cannibalized the book." [...] The director enlisted the help of Tony Grisoni and they wrote the script at Gilliam's home in May 1997. Grisoni remembers, [...] "I'd sit at the keyboard, and we'd talk and talk and I'd keep typing." [...] One of the most important scenes from the book that Gilliam wanted to put in the film was the confrontation between Duke and Dr. Gonzo and the waitress of the North Star Coffee Lounge. The director said, [...] "This is two <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> gone beyond the pale, this is unforgivable – that scene, it's ugly.

2500|$|Vergne {{believed}} he could have challenged Buemi for the race victory. He revealed he worked hard to conserve {{a large amount of}} electrical energy, waiting for his chance to attack Buemi: [...] "The car was so much better, I was faster than him in the second stint considering how little energy I was consuming and unfortunately a failure broke all those chances. A lot of hard work disappeared in an instant." [...] Frijns said he was delighted to finish in a points-scoring position but felt the event was [...] "one of the more bizarre races of my career" [...] and believed luck was beside him. He stated {{it had been a long}} period of time since he had scored points and his sixth-place finish was [...] "significant" [...] for himself and his team. Dillmann said his maiden race was [...] "really good fun" [...] following his battle with di Grassi and Piquet, but that he had to learn everything when the day started though he stressed it passed without any major problems: [...] "I built up step by step.
