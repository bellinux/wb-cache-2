25|$|The Canadian Constitution {{does not}} clearly specify {{the level of}} <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> {{responsibility}} for environmental protection in Canada. As such, pollution law in British Columbia is divided among local, regional, provincial, federal and international jurisdictions, {{each with its own}} focus and, at times, overlapping concerns. Legislation may be enacted at any of these levels.|$|E
25|$|Liberals {{were the}} primary advocates of both Social Security and Medicare, which are often {{targeted}} as significant expansions of <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> overwhelming satisfaction among beneficiaries.

25|$|For Congolese, mining is {{the easiest}} source of income, because the work is consistent, albeit for only 1 dollar per day. It is laborious, as miners walk for days in the forest to the ore, scratch it with hand tools and pan it. About 90% of young men in Congo do this. Research {{revealed}} that many Congolese leave farming because they need money quickly and cannot wait for crops to grow. Farming also presents obstacles. For example, a lack of roads makes it extremely difficult to transport produce to markets, and the harvest can be taken by militias or the Congolese army. Once their food is taken away or {{they can no longer}} grow food, people resort to mining to sustain themselves. Organized mines are usually run by corrupt groups like militias. Congolese have few tools to mine coltan, and no safety procedures or experience in mining. There is no government aid or intervention in many unethical and abusive circumstances. Miners consider coltan mining a way to provide for themselves in the face of widespread war and conflict and a <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> no concern for their welfare.|$|E

500|$|... "Popular government" [...] was {{referred}} to by John Stuart Mill as [...] "where the supreme controlling power ... is vested in the entire aggregate of the community", while Edmund Burke argued that it has the desirable consequence of establishing a <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> a unified public interest, with its citizens absent of personal prejudices except for that of the public good. The right to vote then provides the means for individuals to voice their support of or opposition to government. Their aggregated choices enable {{the will of the}} people to control the extent of power and perpetuity of governments, thus protecting society's rights and interests.|$|E
500|$|After {{the fleet}} arrived in July 1776, Admiral Howe made several {{attempts}} to open communications with Continental Army General George Washington. [...] Two attempts to deliver letters to Washington were rebuffed because Howe refused to recognize Washington's title. [...] Washington did however agree {{to meet in}} person with one of Howe's adjutants, Colonel James Patterson. [...] In the meeting on July 20, Washington learned that the Howes' diplomatic powers were essentially limited to the granting of pardons, to which he responded that the Americans had not committed any faults and thus did not need pardons. [...] Lord Howe then {{sent a letter to}} Benjamin Franklin detailing a proposal for a truce and offers of pardons. [...] After Franklin read the letter in Congress on July 30, he wrote back to the admiral that [...] "Directing pardons to be offered to the colonies, who are the very parties injured, [...] can have no other effect than that of increasing our resentments. [...] It is impossible we should think of submission to a <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> with the most wanton barbarity and cruelty burnt our defenseless town, [...] excited the savages to massacre our peaceful farmers, and our slaves to murder their masters, and is even now bringing foreign mercenaries to deluge our settlements with blood." [...] He also pointed out to the admiral that [...] "you once gave me expectations that reconciliation might take place." [...] Howe was apparently somewhat taken aback by Franklin's forceful response.|$|E

The business and enterprise secretary, John Hutton, responded in a Radio 4 interview [...] "It is not the <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> got a closed view on these issues, I think it is organisations like Greenpeace that have got a closed mind. There is only one outcome that Greenpeace and other organisations want from this consultation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term {{is used by}} the Canadian <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> a set {{system for}} {{measuring}} nordicity. This system is used for determining a number of regulations in fields such as environmental protection, infrastructure, and many others. Northern Canada, apropos, is normally divided into three areas. [...] The Middle North covering the northern parts of most provinces, as well as parts of the territories is largely populated by those of European descent and has significant resource extraction if a low population. [...] The Far North covers {{the northern part of the}} continent and the southern Arctic Archipelago. [...] The Extreme North covers the northernmost islands and is largely uninhabitable. [...] Other countries have their own systems of measuring nordicity.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional: {{the slowest}} to form, this {{reflects}} a principally indigenous insurgency, initially with limited goals. It is more secure than others, as {{it tends to}} grow from people with social, cultural or family ties. The insurgents resent a <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> failed to recognize [...] tribal, racial, religious or linguistic groups [...] "who perceive {{that the government has}} denied their rights and interests and work to establish or restore them. They seldom seek to overthrow the government or control the whole society; however, they frequently attempt to withdraw from government control through autonomy or semiautonomy." [...] The Mujahideen in Afghanistan and the Kurdish revolt in Iraq illustrate the traditional pattern of insurgency. al-Qaeda generally operates in this mode, but if they become strong enough in a given area, they may change to the mass-oriented form.|$|E

2500|$|Others disagree, {{saying that}} the {{inequality}} issue is a political distraction from what they consider real problems like chronic unemployment and sluggish growth. George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen has called inequality a [...] "red herring", saying that factors driving its increase within a nation can simultaneously be driving its reduction globally, and arguing that redistributive policies intended to reduce inequality can {{do more harm than}} good regarding the real problem of stagnant wages. Robert Lucas Jr. has argued that the salient problem American living standards face is a <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> grown too much, and that recent policy shifts in the direction of European style taxation, welfare spending, and regulation may be indefinitely putting the US on a significantly lower, European level income trajectory. Some researchers have disputed the accuracy of the underlying data regarding claims about inequality trends, and economists Michael Bordo and Christopher M. Meissner have argued that inequality cannot be blamed for the 2008 financial crisis.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 April 2014, in {{the wake}} of the 2014 Crimean crisis, Zeman called for strong action to be taken, {{possibly}} including sending NATO forces into Ukraine, if Russia tried to annex the eastern part of the country. Speaking on a radio show he said that, [...] "The moment Russia decides to widen its territorial expansion to the eastern part of Ukraine, that is where the fun ends. There I would plead not only for the strictest EU sanctions, but even for military readiness of the North Atlantic Alliance, like for example NATO forces entering Ukrainian territory." [...] The Czech Republic has been a NATO member since 1999, when Zeman was prime minister. In the Czech constitutional system it is the <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> the main responsibility for foreign policy, although the President is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The ČSSD government of Bohuslav Sobotka resisted strong EU sanctions against Russia after its annexation of Crimea, because of the negative economic impact of such a step on the country.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971 Parliament reconvened, {{and a new}} {{government}} coalition, the National Front (Barisan Nasional), was formed in 1973 to replace the Alliance party. The coalition consisted of UMNO, the MCA, the MIC, Gerakan, PPP, and regional parties in Sabah and Sarawak. The PAS also joined the Front but was expelled in 1977. The DAP was left outside as the only significant opposition party. Abdul Razak held office {{until his death in}} 1976. He was succeeded by Datuk Hussein Onn, the son of UMNO’s founder Onn Jaafar, and then by Tun Mahathir Mohamad, who had been Education Minister since 1981, and who held power for 22 years. During these years policies were put in place which led to the rapid transformation of Malaysia’s economy and society, such as the controversial New Economic Policy, which was intended to increase proportionally the share of the economic [...] "pie" [...] of the bumiputras as compared to other ethnic groups—was launched by Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak.
