6000|$|... "Yes, I {{will help}} you. I'll {{help you to}} {{understand}} just {{where you are and}} how you got there. I'd like you to <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> die." ...|$|E
6000|$|John Short will {{ring the}} curtain down. [...] And ring the prompter's bell; [...] We hope you <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> go [...] That we all wish you well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] the Colonel answered. [...] "I {{only wish}} that I had <b>known</b> <b>before.</b> <b>You</b> {{will have no}} {{objection}} to my coming, I suppose?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... now I do {{not know}} what virtue is; perhaps <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> {{contacted}} me, but now you are certainly like one who does not know. (trans. G. M. A. Grube) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You speak," [...] he remarked, [...] "as {{though you}} resented these things. Yet <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> married me that I had ambitions, that I did not propose to lead an idle life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One thing I want to <b>know,</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> tell me {{anything}} else," [...] Amelius resumed. [...] "Is my written description of Jervy plain enough to help you to find him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course! I didn't {{recognise}} him in tweeds. Whatever is {{he doing}} down here? But I <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can tell me," [...] she continued quickly. [...] "He has taken Broomleys, hasn't he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Could {{you give}} me those few minutes?" [...] Julian asked. [...] "I have {{something}} on my side {{to say to you}} which I think you ought to <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> see any one--Horace himself included." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] replied Lord Glenvarloch; [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> went {{to sleep}} how little I could assist you in your difficulties, and you seemed disposed, notwithstanding, to put some {{confidence}} in me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied her companion, [...] "they {{have not}} killed me, nor will they kill <b>you,</b> though God <b>knows</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> have lived long in this horrible place you will beg them to kill you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Please you, {{my little}} ruler,' said a single soldier, {{addressing}} Alroy; 'pardon my bluntness, but I <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> were a Caliph.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she retorted. [...] "I dare say, my good man, you are sorry {{enough for}} me now, but you might have thought of all that, you <b>know,</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> played me that dirty trick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Go--I forgive you. But <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> go, {{that the}} {{celestial}} milk which fell from Here's bosom, bleaching the plant which it touched to everlasting whiteness, was not more taintless than {{the soul of}} Theon's daughter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} more, Lucilla," [...] he said, [...] "which you ought to <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> decide. I have seen your father. He desires {{me to tell you}} that he is {{strongly}} opposed to the experiment which you are determined to try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I did {{not know}} you, my lord," [...] he said. [...] "Who could have <b>known</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Before</b> <b>you</b> were a poor Burmese peasant, now you are an English lord." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Spike's lair, {{he tells}} Buffy {{that he loves}} her. Drusilla begins to laugh and then says [...] "I <b>knew.</b> I <b>knew</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> did that you loved the Slayer." [...] Which was shown in the episode [...] "Fool for Love" [...] as Spike recounts how he killed the two slayers to Buffy.|$|R

[...] Now, the direct {{coverage}} starts before the race has started and the legend that surrounded riders, created in people's imagination, no longer exists. When everything is too realistic, you lose the legend."â€“ Marc Sergeant ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} {{know all the}} {{complications}} yet," [...] confessed the girl. [...] "I've run away from school and--and {{there are other things}} you must <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> decide. Mr. Conant wasn't at all enthusiastic over my coming here, I assure you, so I must tell you frankly the whole story of my adventures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah'd thank you, Mist' Wrenn, if {{you could}} {{conveniently}} let me <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> go running off and leaving me with empty rooms, with the landlord after the rent, and me turning away people that 'd pay more for the room, because Ah {{wanted to keep it}} for you. And people always coming to see you and making me answer the door and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Come to me, children. Do not be afraid. [...] I {{want to know}} if {{you believe}} in Heaven, [...] God or the soul--no, do not tell me yet; [...] You need not be afraid I shall be angry, [...] Say what you please--so that it is your thought-- [...] I wanted you to <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> spoke, [...] That I shall not be angry.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{should have}} slain you easily," [...] said Ghek. [...] "So great and highly {{developed}} {{is the power}} of reason among us that they should have <b>known</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> struck just where, logically, you must seek to strike, and so they {{should have been able to}} parry your every thrust and easily find an opening to your heart." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Shucks, Johnny Chuck! You are slow! Why, it was {{all over}} Green Meadows last night how Reddy Fox had been shot by Farmer Brown's boy!" [...] jeered Peter Rabbit. [...] "That's no news. And here you've waked me up to tell me {{something}} I <b>knew</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> went to bed last night! Serves Reddy Fox right. Hope he'll be lame for a week," [...] added Peter Rabbit.|$|R
6000|$|... 7. It is {{the modern}} fashion to despise Vasari. He is indeed despicable, whether as {{historian}} or critic,--not least in his admiration of Michael Angelo; nevertheless, he records the traditions and opinions of his day; and these you must accurately <b>know,</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can wisely correct. I will take leave, therefore, to begin to-day with a sentence from Vasari, {{which many of}} you have often heard quoted, but of which, perhaps, few have enough observed the value.|$|E
6000|$|... "She promised {{she would}} come and she will keep her word," [...] he went on. [...] "I was {{with her when she}} died. I held her in my arms. She said to me, 'Herbert, I promise that I will be true to you forever, through as many years of lonely heaven as I must <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> come. And when your time is at hand I will come to make your deathbed easy as you have made mine. I will come, Herbert.' She solemnly promised, Jeanette. We made a death-tryst of it. And I know she will come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, if I were to {{say that}} I accused you, perhaps you would {{misunderstand}} me. I hope--I thoroughly expect, that before I leave you, I {{may be able to}} say that I do not accuse you. If you will only listen to me patiently for a few minutes, Margaret--which I couldn't get you to do, you <b>know,</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> went away from the Cedars in that very extraordinary manner--I think I can explain to you something which--" [...] Here Lady Ball became embarrassed, and paused; but Margaret gave her no assistance, and therefore she began a new sentence. [...] "In point of fact, I want you to listen to what I say, and then, I think--I do think--you will do as we would have you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Dorothy, with a gasp; [...] "I didn't {{know the}} Rainbow had children. But I might have <b>known</b> it, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> spoke. You couldn't really be {{anything}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Highmore's vacuity {{exceeded}} my own. [...] "Too 'flippant'? He {{has made}} it too oracular. Mr. Bousefield says he has killed it." [...] Then perceiving my stupefaction: [...] "Don't you know what has happened?" [...] she pursued; [...] "isn't it because in his trouble, poor love, he has sent for you that you've come? You've heard nothing at all? Then you had better <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> see them. Get in here with me--I'll take you a turn and tell you." [...] We were close to the Park, the Regent's, and when with extreme alacrity I had placed myself beside her and the carriage had begun to enter it she went on: [...] "It was what I feared, you know. It reeked with culture. He keyed it up too high." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{will have}} {{read in the}} papers that the Thames in London is most horrible. I have to cross Waterloo or London Bridge {{to get to the}} {{railroad}} when I come down here, and I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature. Nobody knows what is to be done; at least everybody knows a plan, and everybody else knows it won't do; in the meantime cartloads of chloride of lime are shot into the filthy stream, and do something I hope. You will <b>know,</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> get this, that the American telegraph line has parted again, at which most men are sorry, but very few surprised. This is all the news, except that there is an Italian Opera at Drury Lane, price eighteenpence to the pit, where Viardot, by far the greatest artist of them all, sings, and which is full when the dear opera can't let a box; and except that the weather has been exceptionally hot, but is now quite cool. On the top of this hill it has been cold, actually cold at night, {{for more than a week}} past.|$|E
6000|$|In {{respect to}} Dobus, {{he is an}} old Peninsular man, as you are made to <b>know</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> have been very long in his company; and, like most army surgeons, {{is a great deal}} more {{military}} in his looks and conversation, than the combatant part of the forces. He has adopted the sham-Duke-of-Wellington air, which is by no means uncommon in veterans; and, though one of the easiest and softest fellows in existence, speaks slowly and briefly, and raps out an oath or two occasionally, as it is said a certain great captain does. Besides the above, we sat down to table with Captain Goff, late of the ---- Highlanders; the Reverend Lemuel Whey, who preaches at St. Germains; little Cutler, and the Frenchman, who always WILL be at English parties on the Continent, and who, after making some frightful efforts to speak English, subsides and is heard no more. Young married ladies and heads of families generally have him for the purpose of waltzing, and in return he informs his friends of the club or the cafe that he has made the conquest of a charmante Anglaise. Listen to me, all family men who read this! and never LET AN UNMARRIED FRENCHMAN INTO YOUR DOORS. This lecture alone is worth the price of the book. It is not that they do any harm in one case out of a thousand, Heaven forbid! but they mean harm. They look on our Susannas with unholy dishonest eyes. Hearken to two of the grinning rogues chattering together as they clink over the asphalte of the Boulevard with lacquered boots, and plastered hair, and waxed moustaches, and turned-down shirt-collars, and stays and goggling eyes, and hear how they talk of a good simple giddy vain dull Baker Street creature, and canvass her points, and show her letters, and insinuate--never mind, but I tell you my soul grows angry when I think of the same; and I can't hear of an Englishwoman marrying a Frenchman without feeling a sort of shame and pity for her.

6000|$|Atherton {{smiled at}} the hopeless practicality, and shook his head; {{but he did not}} oppose her directly. [...] "Mrs. Hubbard," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "you have done well in coming to me, but let me {{convince}} you that this is a matter which can't be kept. It must be <b>known.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>you</b> can begin to help yourself, you must let others help you. Either you must go home to your father and let your husband find you there--" ...|$|R
