50|$|Motor-generator sets {{have been}} {{replaced}} by semiconductor devices for some purposes. In the past, a popular use for MG sets were in elevators. Since accurate speed control of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>machine</b> was required, the impracticality of varying the frequency to a high power AC motor meant that the use of an MG set with a DC hoist motor was a near industry-standard solution. Modern AC variable-frequency drives and compatible motors have increasingly supplanted traditional MG-driven elevator installations, since AC drives are typically more efficient by 50% or more than DC-powered machinery.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to a popularly held belief, cranes on medieval {{building}} {{sites were}} neither {{placed on the}} extremely lightweight scaffolding used at the time nor on the thin walls of the Gothic churches which were incapable of supporting the weight of both <b>hoisting</b> <b>machine</b> and load. Rather, cranes {{were placed in the}} initial stages of construction on the ground, often within the building. When a new floor was completed, and massive tie beams of the roof connected the walls, the crane was dismantled and reassembled on the roof beams from where it was moved from bay to bay during construction of the vaults. Thus, the crane 'grew' and 'wandered' with the building with the result that today all extant construction cranes in England are found in church towers above the vaulting and below the roof, where they remained after building construction for bringing material for repairs aloft.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, Antti Herlin, the {{great-grandson}} of the company's founder, {{was appointed}} KONE CEO and deputy {{chairman of the}} board of the company that he had now inherited. The company introduced new technology such as the KONE EcoDisc <b>hoisting</b> <b>machine</b> and the KONE MonoSpace elevator technology concept in 1996. KONE was one of the first to introduce machine-room-less (MRL) construction in elevators. KONE's MRL designs significantly reduced the size of elevator machinery and its lift mechanism by using permanent-magnet electric motors (PMM). The use of these mechanisms enabled all of the elevator's equipment and its inner workings to be confined to the space above the elevator shaft, known as the hoistway overhead, instead of needing an entire room dedicated to machinery. At the beginning of the 21st Century, due to the apparent benefits of KONE's pioneering elevator systems, rival companies began competitively marketing machine-room-less elevators of their own.|$|E

Brunelleschi's {{success can be}} attributed, in no small degree, to his {{technical}} and mathematical genius. Brunelleschi used more than four million bricks {{in the construction of}} the octagonal dome. Notably, Brunelleschi left behind no building plans or diagrams detailing the dome's structure; scholars surmise that he constructed the dome as though it were hemispherical, which would have allowed the dome to support itself. He invented a new <b>hoisting</b> <b>machine</b> for raising the masonry needed for the dome, a task no doubt inspired by republication of Vitruvius' De Architectura, which describes Roman machines used in the 1st century AD to build large structures such as the Pantheon and the Baths of Diocletian, structures still standing which he would have seen for himself. He also issued one of the first patents for the hoist in an attempt to prevent the theft of his ideas.

Focusing on the deflection accordance to the ANSI Standard; calculation regarding the allowable maximum deflection must not be exceeded. To analyze, manual calculations, solid modeling and computer simulations were involved using state-of-the-art CAE software. Several linear static FEA analyses were done to get accurate results. The results show that the deflection is still in the acceptable range. However, some manufacturers find that the allowable maximum deflection is too excessive.

50|$|Although the Ore Mountains had {{a nearly}} 700-year-old mining history when uranium mining started after World War II, mining had nearly ceased in the area. Thus, there was neither a {{qualified}} work force nor mining equipment {{which could be}} used. However, after World War II unemployment was high in Germany, and the Soviet occupation zone administration in East Germany ordered the employment centers {{across the country to}} supply them with workers. Within a few years thousands of people from all across Germany and refugees from the formerly German regions now part of Poland and the Soviet Union were drafted to work in the uranium mining centers. People were ordered to start working in the uranium mines otherwise there would be strict sanctions for them. At the end of the 1940s, more than 100,000 people worked for SAG Wismut. This also included women, although they did not work on the stopes but operated machinery (locomotives, <b>hoisting</b> <b>machines)</b> at the mines, worked in the mills, laboratories and administration. In contrast to the Czech Republic and the Soviet Union, no prisoners were forced to work in the mines. But most of these people had never worked in the mining industry before and had no qualifications for this work. This and the lack of mining equipment caused the mines to be operated like centuries previously, with a high number of fatal work accidents. Forced drafting of workers ended in 1949, however security measures on the mine sites remained very strict. Between 1951 and 1953, 73 miners accused of espionage and sabotage were deported to the USSR and executed.|$|R

50|$|The basic hoist has two {{important}} characteristics to define it: Lifting medium and power type. The lifting medium is either wire rope, {{wrapped around a}} drum, or load-chain, raised by a pulley with a special profile to engage the chain. The power can be provided by different means. Common means are hydraulics, electrical and air driven motors. Both the wire rope hoist and chain hoist have been in common use since the 1800s, however mass production of an electric hoist did not start until the early 1900s and was first adapted by Germany. A hoist can be built as one integral-package unit, designed for cost-effective purchasing and moderate use, {{or it can be}} built as a built-up custom unit, designed for durability and performance. The built-up hoist will be much more expensive, but will also be easier to repair and more durable. Package units were once regarded as being designed for light to moderate usage, but since the 60s this has changed. Built-up units are designed for heavy to severe service, but over the years that market has decreased in size since the advent of the more durable packaged <b>hoist.</b> A <b>machine</b> shop or fabricating shop will use an integral-package hoist, while a Steel Mill or NASA would use a built-up unit to meet durability, performance, and repairability requirements.

40|$|The article {{represents}} an overview {{and analysis of}} trenchless technologies used {{to provide for the}} leak resistance and strength of dilapidated sections of pipelines made of ceramics, cast iron, asbestos cement and other materials. Sectional pipeline repair technologies, considered by the authors, include those for the repair of loose joints of straight sections of pipelines and loose joints in the points of connection to secondary pipelines. Technologies analyzed by the authors also include those applied for the restoration of pipe shell cracks. Organic resins and bandages are to be used as repair materials. Besides, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the composition and properties of pumping resins injected into pipe cracks to restore the structural strength of pipelines and to assure their further reliable operation. Moreover, the authors assess the basic strengths of the bandage technology, including its low cost, low time consumption, and suitability to various types of pipeline damages (depressurization of joints, cracks, leaks, etc.). Besides, this method does not require any excavations, trenches, <b>hoists</b> or other <b>machines.</b> In particular, sections of underground pipelines, having diameters of 150 – 180 mm, may be repaired by specialized repair robots. Robots may be equipped with special-purpose devices, including cutter heads, bandage application heads, and color motion cameras. Besides, sectional repair of pipelines, having the diameter of up to 600 mm, may be performed using robots produced by Hachler Umwelttechnik, which are particularly efficient if the repair work is needed to be performed in the points of pipeline branching. The choice of specific pipeline repair methods and substantiation of their application are mainly driven by (1) the post-cleaning condition of a pipeline, (2) the findings of the telediagnostics, (3) options for arrangement and use of specialized machinery on location, and (4) feasibility of the pipeline operation in the course of repair works and procedures.
