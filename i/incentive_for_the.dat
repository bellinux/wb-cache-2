5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> private sector to invest.|$|E
5|$|On 11October Valckenier unsuccessfully {{requested}} that officers control their troops {{and stop the}} looting. Two days later the council established a reward of two ducats for every Chinese head surrendered to the soldiers as an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other ethnic groups {{to assist in the}} purge. As a result, ethnic Chinese who had survived the initial assault were hunted by gangs of irregulars, who killed those Chinese they found for the reward. The Dutch worked with natives in different parts of Batavia; ethnic Bugis and Balinese grenadiers were sent to reinforce the Dutch on 14October. On 22October Valckenier called for all killings to cease. In a lengthy letter in which he blamed the unrest entirely on the Chinese rebels, Valckenier offered an amnesty to all Chinese, except for the leaders of the unrest, on whose heads he placed a bounty of up to 500 rijksdaalders.|$|E

5|$|Groups {{are often}} based on a single European {{political}} party such as the socialist group (before 2009). However, they can, like the liberal group, include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents. For a group to be recognised, it needs 25 MEPs from seven different countries. Once recognised, groups receive financial subsidies from the parliament and guaranteed seats on committees, creating an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> formation of groups. However, some controversy occurred {{with the establishment of}} the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty (ITS) due to its ideology; the members of the group were far-right, so there were concerns about public funds going towards such a group. There were attempts to change the rules to block the formation of ITS, but they never came to fruition. The group was, however, blocked from gaining leading positions on committees— traditionally (by agreement, not a rule) shared among all parties. When this group engaged in infighting, leading to the withdrawal of some members, its size fell below the threshold for recognition causing its collapse.|$|E

25|$|On January 1, 2008, {{a new tax}} <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film {{industry}} came into effect. The first major production {{to take advantage of}} the tax incentive was Michael Mann's Public Enemies. While the producers spent $18 million on the film, it was reported that most of that went to out-of-state workers and for out-of-state services; Wisconsin taxpayers had provided $4.6 million in subsidies, and derived only $5 million in revenues from the film's making.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} {{opted to}} use price ceilings on tortillas that protected local consumers of corn. This price control {{came in the}} form of the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact between the government and many of the main tortilla producing companies, including Grupo Maseca and Bimbo, to put a price ceiling at 8.50 pesos per kilogram of tortilla. The hope was that a ceiling on corn prices would provide <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> market to lower all prices nationally.|$|E

25|$|Import {{substitution}} {{policies were}} adopted by most nations in Latin America from the 1930s {{until the late}} 1980s. The initial date is largely attributed {{to the impact of}} the Great Depression of the 1930s, when Latin American countries, which exported primary products and imported almost all of the industrialized goods they consumed, were prevented from importing due to a sharp decline in their foreign sales. This served as an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> domestic production of the goods they needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{city council}} of Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen and the CSU faction {{in the town}} council of Karlsfeld {{proposed}} the above-ground extension of the U2 from Feldmoching to Karlsfeld as a measure to relieve the municipality of the heavy car traffic. Moreover, this should provide a greater <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> employees of the large companies MAN and MTU to use public transport for their work. After initial investigations had shown a low cost-benefit ratio for this route, it was not cost-effective and was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Class GA Garratt in proving the {{suitability}} of the Garratt design for South African conditions coupled with the economies in crew, fuel and water consumption it offered, provided an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> SAR to consider a new Garratt class for use on the Natal mainline. The aim was to eliminate double-heading as a regular practice with such a locomotive to be equivalent to three of the Class 1E electric locomotives which were then in use, or two Class 14 steam locomotives.|$|E

25|$|Water {{rates and}} fees for {{maintenance}} of irrigation systems are {{set by the}} National Irrigation and Drainage Service (SENARA). The water is not paid for by volume but per unit of area irrigated {{as in the case}} of DRAT above. As a contractual agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Costa Rica initiated a tariff adjustment by net area irrigable.

25|$|European donors {{increasingly}} fund projects jointly {{under the}} EU's Neighborhood Investment Facility (NIF), which supports the Improved Water and Wastewater Services Program (IWSP) in four governorates in the Delta {{during its first}} phase (Gharbia, Sharkia, Damietta, and Beheira) and four governorates in Upper Egypt during its second phase. IWSP pools loans from Germany, France and the European Investment Bank {{as well as a}} grant from the European Commission, which is used as an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other donors to pool their loans and to thus harmonize their procedures.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, diving {{stores were}} finding a purely {{economic}} reason to offer nitrox: {{not only was}} an entire new course and certification needed to use it, but instead of cheap or free tank fills with compressed air, dive shops found they could charge premium amounts of money for custom-gas blending of nitrox to their ordinary, moderately experienced divers. With the new dive computers which could be programmed {{to allow for the}} longer bottom-times and shorter residual nitrogen times that nitrox gave, the <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sport diver to use the gas increased. An intersection of economics and scientific validity had occurred.|$|E

25|$|The premier is {{selected}} by the president {{without the need for}} approval from the legislature, but the legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. After the election of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian as President in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority. Historically, the ROC has been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated {{in the office of the}} president rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly state the extent of the president's executive power.|$|E
25|$|Until 2001 the Italian state offered {{citizens}} {{living abroad}} a free return train journey {{to their home}} town in Italy in order to vote, however {{the portion of the}} train journey that was free of charge was only on Italian soil. Any costs incurred in getting from their place of residence abroad to the Italian border had to be covered by the citizen wanting to vote, therefore a free return train journey was hardly an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> large Italian communities living as far away as in the United States, Argentina or Australia. For this reason very few Italians abroad made use of this right to vote, unless they lived in cities and towns that bordered to Italy such as in Germany, Switzerland, France and Austria. Various Italian minorities living abroad (notably in the United States) protested frequently at this lack of political representation especially if they paid taxes on property owned in Italy.|$|E

As both men were wealthy landowners, they had little <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> program to succeed. The U.S. embassy received angry criticism of Thoi's lack of enthusiasm towards implementing the policy, stating, [...] "he is most certainly not interested in land distribution which would divest him of much of his property".|$|E
