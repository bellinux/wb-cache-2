Her eggs are sealed in a basket woven by her mother, who gives it to Coyote, instructing him not to open <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> reaches home. Hearing voices coming from it, however, Coyote opens the basket and the people, the world's first human beings, pour out of it in all directions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not having}} listened to heavy metal since age 13 or 14 {{in favor of}} new wave, Kijak was {{immediately}} drawn to the band's music, surprised {{he had never heard}} <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> <b>He</b> bonded with some of the band members; learning that Kiss' Love Gun was the first album he, Yoshiki and Toshi had ever bought and talking with Sugizo about the British new wave band Japan and its bassist Mick Karn, who was a friend of the guitarist.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff was}} then hidden deep below the castle and inscribed with {{powerful}} magical symbols to protect <b>it.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> died, Karnath broke the key into sixteen pieces and hid them throughout his castle. Centuries later, an aristocrat adventurer, Sir Arthur Pendragon, ventures inside the castle {{in order to}} defuse the orb before midnight. Should he fail, its power would be unleashed, and the resulting inter-dimensional rip would wipe out the human race.|$|E
60|$|TREHERNE. Everything we have {{he brought}} from the wreck--he went back to <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> sank. <b>He</b> risked his life.|$|R
60|$|Arnold {{laid down}} {{his hat and}} mixed himself a whiskey and soda. <b>He</b> drank <b>it</b> off <b>before</b> <b>he</b> spoke.|$|R
60|$|Stirling {{picked up}} the model and {{examined}} <b>it</b> carefully <b>before</b> <b>he</b> replaced <b>it</b> in the roll-top desk, which he shut with a snap.|$|R
5|$|Waitress Shelley Johnson (Mädchen Amick) {{is about}} to leave for work when her abusive husband Leo (Eric Da Re) demands she do more laundry. She finds a bloodstained shirt among Leo's clothes and hides <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> notices. However, he later realizes that it has gone missing. When she returns home that night, he {{questions}} her about its whereabouts, and savagely beats her with {{a bar of soap}} in a sock.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to Get Smart, Auto takes the plant and goes into {{the bowels of the}} ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E
25|$|The game {{tells the}} story of an unnamed protagonist who {{receives}} a frightened message from his brother asking for help. Encountering an ancient evil known as the Dark Fall, which traps souls between the realm of {{the living and the dead}} and feeds off their pain, the protagonist must attempt to imprison <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> too is overcome by its power.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the Quran was {{revealed}} in disjointed verses and chapters, a point came when it needed to be gathered into a coherent whole text. There are disagreements among both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars as to when the Quran was compiled. Some believe Muhammad compiled <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, while others believe it was collected by either Ali ibn Abu Talib or Abu Bakr.|$|E
25|$|During the task, Saira and Paul were {{involved}} in another heated argument between themselves, with James initially trying to stop <b>it,</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> and Raj decided to leave them alone until it was finished. During the argument Saira threatened to fire Paul, who refused to accept that she was allowed to do so, though she never carried through on her threat, making it unknown if {{she would have been}} allowed to do so.|$|E
25|$|In his Ireland and Her Neighbours in the Seventh Century, Michael Richter {{attributes}} this to {{the mission}} of Palladius seen within the wider context of the mission of Germanus of Auxerre to Britain around 429. Thus, {{this could be the}} context in which the Life of St Martin was brought from Gaul to Ireland at an early date, and could explain how Columbanus was familiar with <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> ever left Ireland.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{had better}} have cut <b>it</b> out, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> came, if he can't {{speak in a}} lower tone,' said Monks, grimly. 'So! He's your husband, eh?' ...|$|R

6000|$|P.S.--I {{have not}} {{time to read}} this over, but I may say, in case I omitted <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> that <b>he</b> really is a very {{remarkable}} baby.' ...|$|R
25|$|In 1757, Burke {{published}} a treatise on aesthetics, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, which {{attracted the attention}} of prominent Continental thinkers such as Denis Diderot and Immanuel Kant. It was his only purely philosophical work, and when asked by Sir Joshua Reynolds and French Laurence to expand it thirty years later, Burke replied that he was no longer fit for abstract speculation (Burke had written <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was nineteen years of age).|$|E
25|$|After Finn {{watched his}} girlfriend, Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco) and Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny) fight, {{he has a}} strange dream that gives him a sense of pleasure; however, he {{is not able to}} finish <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> wakes up. Upon awakening, he realizes that the Cosmic Owl (voiced by M. Emmet Walsh) was in the vision, which Jake interprets to mean that the reverie was a prophetic dream. Jake urges Finn to somehow finish the dream. Finn, therefore, gets Flame Princess and Ice King to fight once more, but this time Ice King nearly defeats Flame Princess. That night, Finn has a similar dream, only this time, he imagines Ice King {{blasting}} him with ice.|$|E

Nigel runs a Ministry of Arts programme [...] "Ark of the Arts", which [...] "rescues" [...] {{works of art}} such as Michelangelo's David (albeit with a broken leg), Pablo Picasso's Guernica, and Banksy's British Cops Kissing. He mentions {{that he tried to}} save Michelangelo's Pietà, but a mob destroyed <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|E
6000|$|... "To do him justice, <b>he</b> let <b>it</b> out <b>before</b> <b>he</b> quite {{realised}} {{what he was}} saying. I'd better {{own that}} I partly surprised him into giving me the information." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} found out?" [...] she asked, with a {{momentary}} surprise on her face, which faded from <b>it</b> again <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could gather breath enough to go on.|$|R

500|$|Elementare Quantenmechanik (Zweiter Band der Vorlesungen über Atommechanik), with Pascual Jordan. (Springer, 1930) – This was {{the first}} volume of what was {{intended}} as a two-volume work. This volume was limited to the work Born did with Jordan on matrix mechanics. [...] The second volume was to deal with Erwin Schrödinger's wave mechanics. [...] However, the second volume was not even started by Born, as he believed his friend and colleague Hermann Weyl had written <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could do so.|$|E
500|$|The last {{window that}} had {{contained}} plain glass was given stained {{glass in the}} late twentieth century. For many years well-known local musician Professor Ian Parrott regularly sat beneath this window during services.

The window, which was designed by John Petts, is on the theme of [...] "Music in Praise of the Lord".|$|E
500|$|Using a {{translation}} machine, the Ambassador of Mars announces that they [...] "come in peace".

50|$|McCoy drove Texas to a 21-yard {{field goal}} by Hunter Lawrence that made <b>it</b> 50-7 <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was {{relieved}} by freshman Garrett Gilbert on Texas' second {{possession of the}} third quarter.|$|R

60|$|They {{returned}} to Dunmore {{in the early}} autumn, and took up their residence at Sim Lynch's big house, as had been arranged. Martin was very shy about it: <b>it</b> was long <b>before</b> <b>he</b> talked about <b>it</b> as his house, or his ground, or his farm; and <b>it</b> was long <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could find himself quite at home in his own parlour.|$|R
500|$|Lee Percy {{served as}} editor of the film. He said the final cuts {{provided}} to him already contained the actors' strongest performances, but that he placed a greater focus on Father John's character in an effort to [...] "help the audience get inside him and connect emotionally".

[...] Janelle arrives, and Hayley once again urges Jeff to hang himself, promising that she will destroy the evidence. Defeated, Jeff lets Hayley slide the noose around his neck, and takes the last fatal step off the roof; after he falls Hayley says [...] "or not". Hayley then gathers her belongings and escapes through the woods. The film ends as Hayley walks {{down the road in}} her red hoodie.|$|E
500|$|When {{working on}} a chapter of Gintama, Sorachi {{sometimes}} has problems finishing the manuscript, leaving his supervisor to take <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> can revise it. He figures out what to write by staying in his room or going for a walk. Although he commented {{that some of his}} ideas are [...] "random," [...] he focuses on {{the fact that they are}} all related to the manga, and when he has problems coming up with ideas, Sorachi is often helped by his editor. Thinking of Gin Tama as a [...] "non-sense manga," [...] before writing a chapter, Sorachi decides whether it should be a comedy or a drama. Sorachi defines Gin Tama as a [...] "science fiction human drama pseudo-historical comedy." ...|$|E
