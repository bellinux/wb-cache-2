5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot speak about God, and {{proposed}} that this view <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In {{assisted}} reproductive technology, sperm washing is {{not necessary}} for males with hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk of transmission from mother to child with IVF <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from the risk in spontaneous conception.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} Cameroon contain {{some of the}} highest {{population}} density of forest elephants of any nation, and Nki <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different,</b> with an elephant density of roughly 2.5 per square kilometer for Boumba Bek and Nki combined. The population has been steadily rising, from 1,547 in 1998 to 3,000 in 2006. Gorillas are also reported to abundant; there are an estimated 6,000 adults in Nki. The park is also home to diurnal primates, such as the threatened crested monkey, De Brazza monkey, and the black colobus, who reportedly only live east of the Dja River.|$|E

25|$|Thiele and Ladiges' {{arrangement}} remained current {{only until}} 1999, when George's {{treatment of the}} genus for the Flora of Australia series of monographs was published. This was essentially a revision of George's 1981 arrangement, which took into account some of Thiele and Ladiges' data, but rejected their overall arrangement. With respect to B.ser. Dryandroideae, George's 1999 arrangement <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from that of 1981.|$|E
25|$|In {{males with}} {{hepatitis}} B, The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine advises that sperm washing {{is not necessary}} in IVF to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk of vertical transmission during IVF <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from the risk in spontaneous conception. However, {{there is not enough}} evidence to say that ICSI procedures are safe in females with hepatitis B in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring.|$|E
25|$|Some bank {{accounts}} are afforded an extra degree of privacy. Information concerning such accounts, known as numbered accounts, {{is restricted to}} senior bank officers, rather than being accessible to all the employees of a bank. However, the information required to open such an account <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from that of an ordinary account; completely anonymous accounts are not allowed by law. Should a criminal investigation take place, law enforcement has access to information related to a numbered account {{in the same way}} it has access to information about any other account.|$|E

25|$|Is {{he going}} to throw it away? Is {{he going to}} beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, Cristal and {{her boyfriend}} Zack Carey, the {{entertainment}} director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a lap dance from Nomi. Although the bisexual Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is also based upon her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she {{is little more than}} a prostitute. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like Cristal, tells Nomi that what she is doing <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from prostitution.|$|E
25|$|In {{its basic}} operations, the Israel Lobby <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> {{from the farm}} lobby, steel or textile workers’ unions, or other ethnic lobbies. There is nothing {{improper}} about American Jews and their Christian allies attempting to sway US policy: the Lobby’s activities are not a conspiracy of the sort depicted in tracts like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. For the most part, the individuals and groups that comprise it are only doing what other special interest groups do, but doing it very much better. By contrast, pro-Arab interest groups, {{in so far as}} they exist at all, are weak, which makes the Israel Lobby’s task even easier.|$|E

25|$|Sailor Chibi Moon is Chibiusa's {{identity}} as a Sailor Soldier. Her uniforms resemble Sailor Moon's, colored primarily in cherry blossom pink and red, with a prominent motif of small hearts, joined later by crescent moons and stars. Due to her small stature, certain details of her uniforms are slightly abbreviated. She is given various titles throughout the series, including Princess Soldier, Apprentice Soldier, and Soldier in Training. As the daughter of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, she exhibits traits of both parents in battle. Her personality <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from when she is a civilian, although certain powers are unavailable to her in that form.|$|E
25|$|Hymnody is an {{important}} aspect of worship in Anglicanism, and the ACC <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> There is no one hymnal required to be used, although the ACC has produced four successive authorized versions since 1908. The most recent, Common Praise, was published in 1998. Anglican plainsong is represented in the new hymnal, {{as well as in the}} older Canadian Psalter, published in 1963. Notable Canadian Anglican hymnists include Derek Holman, Gordon Light, Herbert O'Driscoll, and Healey Willan. For a time, beginning in the early 1970s, many Anglican congregations experimented with The Hymn Book produced jointly with the United Church of Canada under the direction of Canadian composer F. R. C. Clarke, but both churches have since abandoned the common hymnal.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E

25|$|That New England states, in general, regard {{cities and}} towns on equal footing, yet they are handled in two {{different}} ways by the Census Bureau, can be another source of confusion. The Census classifications should not be understood to imply that cities are incorporated but towns are not, or that {{cities and towns}} represent two fundamentally different types of entities. Note that the Census classifies New England municipalities strictly based on whether they are towns or cities, with no regard to the actual population-distribution pattern in a particular municipality. All municipalities titled as cities are classified as incorporated places, even if their population-distribution pattern <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> {{from that of a}} typical town; towns are never classified as incorporated places, even if they are thoroughly built-up. The ambiguity over whether certain municipalities in Massachusetts should be classified as cities or towns, and the Census Bureau's inconsistent handling of these municipalities (see the Statistics and Superlatives section below), further blurs matters.|$|E
25|$|Gyula László, a Hungarian archaeologist, {{suggests}} that late Avars, arriving to the qaganate in A.D 670 in great numbers, {{lived through the}} time between the destruction and plunder of the Avar state by the Franks during 791–795 {{and the arrival of}} the Magyars in 895. László points out that the settlements of the Hungarians (Magyars) did not replace but complement those of the Avars. Avars remained on the plough fields, good for agriculture, while Hungarians took the river banks and river flats, suitable for pastoring. He also notes that while the Hungarian graveyards consist of 40–50 graves on average, the Avars contain 600–1000. According to these findings the Avars not just survived the end of the Avar polity but lived in great masses and far outnumbered the Hungarian conquerors of Árpád. He also shows that Hungarians occupied only the centre of the Carpathian-basin, but Avars lived in a larger territory. Looking at those territories where only the Avars lived, one only finds Hungarian geographical names, not Slavic or Turkic as would be expected interspersed among them. This is further evidence for the Avar-Hungarian continuity. Names of the Hungarian tribes, chieftains and the words used for the leaders, etc., suggest that at least the leaders of the Hungarian conquerors were Turkic speaking. However, Hungarian is not a Turkic language, rather Finno-Ugric, and so they must have been assimilated by the Avars that outnumbered them and the genetics of today's modern Hungarians <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> than that of neighboring West Slavs as well as western Ukrainians. László's Avar-Hungarian continuity theory also states that Hungarians speak Avar, though this has been disproved as Hungarian belongs to the Finnic-Ugric branch of languages.|$|E

Now David Cameron <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from David Cameron. They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's anything left to vote for. I believe that I, as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and my point is that even casting that vote means that the same guy gets in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E
