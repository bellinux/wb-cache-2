40|$|Our talk today {{considers}} the issues facing a {{trustee in bankruptcy}} when attempting to ascertain the extent or existence of a bankrupt's interest in real property. We will highlight issues which a trustee might reasonably encounter in ascertaining the extent of property available for distribution to creditors. We will consider two elements in particular {{in light of the}} recent decision of the High Court in Cummins (a bankrupt) v Cummins, and the Federal Court in Anderson v Peldan. Both cases involved an examination of joint tenancy. Joint tenancy is one way for two or more co-owners to hold their <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> It will only arise where there is a unity of time, title, possession and interest between co-owners, and then only where there is an intention to hold as such (Property Law Act Qld provides for a presumption in favour of tenancy in common). The joint tenancy provides each co-owner the right to survivorship - upon the death of an owner that owner's estate is extinguished and the estate of surviving co-owners are enlarged proportionately to the extent of the deceased's estate. This occurs irrespective of the deceased’s testamentary wishes. Anderson v Peldan concerned the severance by an insolvent of joint tenancy held by the insolvent and his elderly spouse and whether the severance before death is capable of being a “transfer of property” in terms of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act...|$|E

5000|$|Intestacy has {{a limited}} {{application}} in those jurisdictions that follow civil law or Roman law because {{the concept of}} a will is itself less important; the doctrine of forced heirship automatically gives a deceased person's next-of-kin title to a large part (forced estate) of the estate's property by operation of law, beyond the power of the deceased person to defeat or exceed by testamentary gift. A forced share (or legitime) can often only be decreased on account of some very specific misconduct by the forced heir. In matters of cross-border inheritance, the [...] "laws of succession" [...] is the commonplace term covering testate and intestate <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> law jurisdictions together with forced heirship rules typically applying in civil law and Sharia law jurisdictions.After the Statute of Wills 1540, Englishmen (and unmarried or widowed women) could dispose of their lands and real property by a will. Their personal property could formerly be disposed of by a testament, hence the hallowed legal merism last will and testament.|$|R
