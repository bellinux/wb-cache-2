The structure resembled a subtropical cyclone as the surface circulation became broader. Late on February4, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the MFR classified Elita as an extratropical cyclone on the next day. For the next week, the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar. On February11, the residual circulation tracked southwestward, only to accelerate southeastward away from the region on February13, when the MFR ceased monitoring the system.|$|E
