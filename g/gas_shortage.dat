500|$|After the {{completion}} of a five-year PPP government, an election was scheduled for 11 May 2013. Abbasi ran for a seat in the National Assembly as a candidate of the PML (N) and successfully retained his seat from Constituency NA-50 (Rawalpindi) for the sixth time with 134,439 votes. Upon the victory of PML (N) in the 2013 national election, he was inducted into the federal cabinet and was appointed as the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources. During his tenure as Minister for Petroleum, he introduced a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and the importation of gas in Pakistan to control the shortage of gas in the country. He was credited for taking measures which helped Pakistan overcome <b>gas</b> <b>shortage</b> issues. In 2015, he was accused of issuing illegal contracts worth [...] for the import and distribution of LNG without a proper bidding process, after which the National Accountability Bureau registered a case and began an investigation. However, the case was closed in 2016 after it was found that all rules were followed during procurement and the bidding process to award the contract was transparent. The Express Tribune described the LNG project as successful and one of the cheapest regasifications in the world. He also denied the corruption allegations. Abbasi ceased to hold the ministerial office of Petroleum and Natural Resources on 28 July 2017 when the Sharif cabinet was disbanded following his resignation after the Panama Papers case decision.|$|E

2500|$|Overall, the <b>gas</b> <b>shortage</b> {{had a large}} {{impact on}} Western Australian industries, {{particularly}} mining, construction, and hospitality. Some affected companies declared force majeure, and others are expected to make large insurance claims. If Apache Energy was found responsible for the pipeline explosion, compensation claims could be made against the company. State Premier Alan Carpenter said the Government will not offer compensation to businesses affected by the energy shortage, because [...] "I don't think that the ordinary West Australian taxpayer would take too kindly to the State Government taking on a massive compensation bill for an interruption to a supply contract between commercial partners".|$|E
2500|$|A {{survey of}} 301 {{businesses}} {{conducted by the}} Chamber of Commerce and Industry showed on 18 June 2008 that nearly 630 employees had already been, or could be, stood down or made redundant - nearly 1% of the workforce surveyed. Almost 50% were affected by the <b>gas</b> <b>shortage,</b> with 11 companies already completely shut down. Up to 15% of companies surveyed could potentially close {{after three months of}} energy shortages. Chief Economist John Nicolaou said [...] "To the extent that WA represents about 20 percent of the growth in the national economy over the past year, then that means it is going to have broader implications for the national economy. So it's important people around Australia understand the issue is significant from a national perspective, not just WA's perspective." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 June, Carpenter warned {{he might}} need to invoke {{emergency}} powers and take control of all of WA's gas and electricity supplies, which would result in rolling stoppages, blackouts and brownouts. He also said he had discussed accessing emergency diesel supplies stored by the Department of Defence at Garden Island with Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard. [...] The state's Energy Minister, Fran Logan, said the decommissioned Muja AB coal-fired power station at Collie would be returned to service to supply 25 terajoules to industry. He estimated it would take up to six weeks before the plant was operational, and said, [...] "These units are old and not as environmentally friendly as new generators. However, the state is facing a significant <b>gas</b> <b>shortage</b> {{and we need to}} look at all avenues".|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to natural}} <b>gas</b> <b>shortage</b> {{concerns}} in the northeastern U.S. and surplus nature gas {{in the rest of}} the country, many new LNG import and export terminals are being contemplated in the United States. Concerns about the safety of such facilities create controversy in some regions where they are proposed. One such location is in the Long Island Sound between Connecticut and Long Island. Broadwater Energy, an effort of TransCanada Corp. and Shell, wishes to build an LNG import terminal in the sound on the New York side. Local politicians including the Suffolk County Executive raised questions about the terminal. In 2005, New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton also announced their opposition to the project. [...] Several import terminal proposals along the coast of Maine were also met with high levels of resistance and questions. On Sep. 13, 2013 the U.S. Department of Energy approved Dominion Cove Point's application to export up to 770 million cubic feet per day of LNG to countries that do not have a free trade agreement with the U.S. In May 2014, the FERC concluded its environmental assessment of the Cove Point LNG project, which found that the proposed natural gas export project could be built and operated safely. Another LNG terminal is currently proposed for Elba Island, Ga. Plans for three LNG export terminals in the U.S. Gulf Coast region have also received conditional Federal approval. In Canada, an LNG export terminal is under construction near Guysborough, Nova Scotia.|$|E

40|$|Argentina has a fully privatised gas sector, with {{powerful}} gas producers and a well-developed network infrastructure. However, serious <b>gas</b> <b>shortages</b> and power cuts, {{brought on by}} {{a significant increase in}} demand, hit the country in early 2004. In order to understand how a country such as Argentina, which is normally a net exporter of gas, with huge proven and probable reserves and a well-functioning privatised gas industry, is now facing <b>gas</b> <b>shortages,</b> it is necessary to look back to the early 1990 s. This paper analyses the origins of the 2004 energy crisis, examines the effects on the national gas industry and evaluates the government’s solutions to prevent further shortage and restore the attractiveness of the gas industry for foreign and domestic investors. The impacts of the Argentine crisis on surrounding countries and on the regional energy integration are considered in a final appendix...|$|R
