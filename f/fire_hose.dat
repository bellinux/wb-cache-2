5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a <b>fire</b> <b>hose.</b> Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth Helitack crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E

On 16 January 1698 Peter organized a farewell party and invited Johan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen, who had to sit between Lefort and the Tsar and drink.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 9 June 1979, a fire broke out inside the ride at {{approximately}} 10:15 pm. Due {{to a combination of}} low water pressure, under-staffing within the park, and inadequate coverage of the Ghost Train by the park's <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> system, the fire was able to completely consume the ride. It took an hour to bring the fire under control, but it was extinguished before any significant damage could be done to the adjacent River Caves and Big Dipper.|$|E

5000|$|Storz {{is a type}} of hose {{coupling}} invented by Carl August Guido Storz in 1882 that connects using interlocking hooks and flanges. Amongst other uses, it has been widely employed on <b>fire</b> <b>hoses</b> in firefighting applications. It is the standard coupling on <b>fire</b> <b>hoses</b> in Portugal, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Israel, and Greece. [...] It is also widely used in Australia.|$|R
25|$|On 9 June 1979, the park's Ghost Train caught fire. The fire quickly {{destroyed}} the ride, which was understaffed and not adequately {{covered by the}} park’s <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> system, although it was contained before spreading to the nearby Big Dipper and River Caves. Searches of the charred rubble revealed the bodies of six children and one adult. The park was immediately shut down. A coronial inquest was unable to establish {{the cause of the}} fire, but concluded that Luna Park's managers and operators had failed in their duty of care towards the park's patrons.|$|E
25|$|A fire burns {{due to the}} {{presence}} of three elements, often referred to as being the fire triangle. These are: fuel, oxygen and heat. The aim of firefighting is to deprive the fire of {{at least one of these}} elements. Sometimes this is referred to as a fire tetrahedron if a fourth element is added: a chemical chain reaction that can sustain or re-kindle a fire. Firefighters are equipped with a wide variety of equipment to accomplish this task. Some of their tools include ladder trucks, pumper trucks, tanker trucks, <b>fire</b> <b>hose,</b> and fire extinguishers. Very frequent training and refresher training is required.|$|E
25|$|In 1835, a law {{was passed}} {{requiring}} the purchase of an engine, along with better equipment, to be partially funded {{by the state and}} partially by the city, {{in order to protect the}} Indiana statehouse. From this, the Marion <b>Fire,</b> <b>Hose,</b> and Protection Company was established. An additional volunteer company was founded in 1841 and there were eight total volunteer companies in Indianapolis by 1859. Collectively, 600 men were volunteers in these eight companies, and although unpaid, they did receive perks such as immunity from being called on juries or militia duty, and not having to pay poll taxes or taxes for roads.|$|E

Many witnesses reported that Conway had insisted on filled water buckets to be positioned in various places back stage or in the rigging loft and kept the <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> maintained. In contrast, Mike Sweeny could recall using the hose only once, and was not certain of its condition {{on the day of the}} fire; many of his colleagues thought the hose leaked and was up in the painter's gallery in the roof above the stage.|$|E
25|$|This marble obelisk {{is on top}} of {{a square}} base with three reliefs on it. The south side of the base has a relief of Benjamin Grenup {{at the time of his}} death. The relief shows Grenup being run over by a fire water wagon and his fellow firefighters {{reacting}} to the accidental death—one has his arms in the air while the other firefighters stop the wagon. The west side of the base has a relief of a <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> and two nozzles. The east side has a relief of a fire axe, torch and spanner wrench tied together with a rope. Egg-and-dart motif along with garland and ribbons decorate the sculpture. The sculpture sits on a triangle plot surrounded by a fence. Fire hydrants sit at each of the three corners of the base.|$|E
25|$|The fire {{department}} {{was founded in}} October 1888. The Board of Fire Commissioners was created in 1896. The first motorized equipment was purchased in 1915. The largest fire in township history occurred on April 20, 1940, when a forest fire destroyed over 50 structures and burned down most of the southern half of town. The largest loss of life caused by fire occurred on February 12, 1936 when the Victoria Mansion Hotel (valued at $100,000) located on {{the southeast corner of}} Lexington Avenue and Seventh Street, was destroyed in a fire and 16 people died. The largest structure fire in department history occurred on March 29, 1967, when the block-long Laurel in the Pines Hotel was leveled by a suspicious fire that also killed three people. The last <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> was picked up a week later when the fire was finally declared out.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to call in}} the National Guard was made at 5:00p.m., but the guard did not arrive in town that evening until around 10p.m. By this time, a large demonstration was under way on the campus, and the campus Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) building was burning. The arsonists were never apprehended, {{and no one was}} injured in the fire. According to the report of the President's Commission on Campus Unrest:Information developed by an FBI investigation of the ROTC building fire indicates that, of those who participated actively, a significant portion weren't Kent State students. There is also evidence to suggest that the burning was planned beforehand: railroad flares, a machete, and ice picks are not customarily carried to peaceful rallies. There were reports that some Kent firemen and police officers were struck by rocks and other objects while attempting to extinguish the blaze. Several fire engine companies had to be called because protesters carried the <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> into the Commons and slashed it. The National Guard made numerous arrests, mostly for curfew violations, and used tear gas; at least one student was slightly wounded with a bayonet.|$|E
500|$|Hard {{suction hose}} differs from {{standard}} <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> in both its construction and usage: ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{rigid and}} {{generally}} scalloped. Often, such hose is manufactured using molded synthetic material (such as PVC) shaped {{into a series}} of rings. [...] This shape allows the hose to be somewhat flexible, without allowing it to collapse in on itself under suction, as a normal, woven-jacket <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> would.|$|E
50|$|In major unrest, {{police in}} {{armoured}} vehicles may be sent in following an initial subduing with firepower. Occasionally, police dogs, <b>fire</b> <b>hoses,</b> or mounted police are deployed.|$|R

500|$|It is short. [...] Typically, {{hard suction}} hose comes in [...] lengths, while <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> comes in [...] lengths. [...] Since a fire engine's pump only {{produces}} a partial vacuum, {{it is only}} recommended for lifting water [...] or less. [...] For this reason, and because each junction {{is an opportunity for}} a crack or imperfect seal to spoil the vacuum, it is rare to see many sections of hard suction hose connected together.|$|E
500|$|These hoses {{are built}} to {{withstand}} vacuum, rather than water pressure, abrasion, and heat. They are, therefore, constructed {{differently from the}} standard <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> and have different end fittings. In the United States, they are standard equipment according to the National Fire Protection Association standards for fire engines. Since hard suction hose cannot be folded, it is typically mounted {{on the side of}} a fire engine, often opposite ground ladders. [...] Such hose is used in both structural and wildland firefighting throughout the world.|$|E
500|$|Hard {{suction hose}} (alternatively, suction hose) is a {{specific}} type of <b>fire</b> <b>hose</b> used in drafting operations, when a fire engine uses a vacuum to draw water from a portable water tank, pool, or other static water source. [...] It is built to withstand vacuum, rather than pressure, abrasion, and heat. [...] In the United States, it is standard equipment according to the National Fire Protection Association standards for fire engines. It is used in both structural and wildland firefighting throughout the world, and is made in various diameters and connection types.|$|E
