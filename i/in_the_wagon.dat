5|$|The 1920s {{also saw}} an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain {{recovered}} from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At {{the end of the}} day the tourists would return to Tywyn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> powered by gravity. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} lack of {{regional}} uniform customs and other border controls that comply with international best practices, which makes documentation delays much more likely. Cargo documentation is often complicated with separate weigh bills for each country traversed; any documentation problem can result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> being detained for several days.|$|E
25|$|The {{garrison}} at Fort Kearny {{learned of}} the fight from its observation station on Pilot Hill. About 11:30 a.m., Major Benjamin Smith led 103 soldiers out of the fort to the wood camp to relieve the soldiers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> boxes. Smith took with him 10 wagons, driven by armed civilians, and a mountain howitzer. He proceeded carefully and, when he neared the wagon box corral, began firing his cannon at long range. The attackers were forced to withdraw. Smith advanced without opposition to the corral, collected the soldiers, and returned quickly to Fort Kearny. Additional civilian survivors, who had hidden in the woods during the battle, {{made it back to}} the fort that night.|$|E

25|$|In 1994 the Caprice {{received}} new engines, {{including an}} optional detuned {{version of the}} Corvette's LT1 350cuin (5.7L) engine that put out 260hp (194kW) and 330lb·ft (447N·m) of torque. The standard engine in all sedans, including the 9C1 police cars, was the , L99 263 (4.3L) V8. TheLT1 was optional in the 9C1 police package and standard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> The LT1350 was standard in the civilian sedans {{with the addition of}} the B4U towing package. The towing package also gave a heavy duty suspension nearly identical to the 9C1 police car suspension, 2.93 gears, heavy duty cooling, heavy duty rear drum brakes and limited-slip differential. The 1994 Caprice's interior had a redesign which featured a Camaro steering wheel, digital speedometer and a new console.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, 2004, {{a massive}} {{explosion}} occurred on a North Korean freight train {{heading for the}} port of Namp'o. According to British intelligence writer Gordon Thomas, the Mossad had learned that dozens of Syrian nuclear technicians were in a compartment adjoining a sealed wagon. According to Thomas, the Syrians had arrived in North Korea to collect the fissionable material stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> All of the technicians {{were killed in the}} train explosion. Their bodies were flown to Syria in lead-encased coffins aboard a Syrian military plane. A wide area around the explosion site was cordoned off for days as North Korean soldiers in anti-contamination suits collected wreckage and sprayed the area. Mossad analysts suspected they were trying to recover weapons-grade plutonium. Since the explosion, the Mossad tracked about a dozen trips by Syrian military officers and scientists to Pyongyang, where they met with high-ranking North Korean officials.|$|E

500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E

2500|$|Barada {{was known}} as a huge man, {{commonly}} thought to be almost seven feet tall and widely regarded as a giant. [...] His strength was well known as well, and he was always asked to assist with barn raising, as he would single-handedly hold heavy beams in place while they were fastened down. [...] When local farmers needed assistance loading hogs for market, they would also call on Barada. [...] Rather than use a loading chute, Barada simply picked the hogs up and set them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> [...] Every time townsfolk needed someone's strength, Barada took the call.|$|E

2500|$|The action having raised {{three of}} Adams's {{prerequisites}} to liability, the Barons of the Exchequer engaged defendant's counsel in a protracted discussion of whether Priestley {{was required to}} ride <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> or could have walked alongside it, then intended that the declaration was sufficient on this point. Serjeant Adams concluded his advocacy by proclaiming that [...] "there {{is nothing in the}} declaration which shews that this was anything more than a mere accident; and for a mere accident which happens in a master's service, the master is not responsible." [...] As with the arguments presented by his opposing counsel, Adams never raised the prospect of vitiating his client's liability due to the intervening act of a fellow servant.|$|E
2500|$|On August 2, 1867, Crazy Horse participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wagon</b> Box Fight, also near Fort Phil Kearny. Lakota forces {{numbering}} between 1000 and 2000 {{attacked a}} wood-cutting crew near the fort. Most {{of the soldiers}} fled to a circle of wagon boxes without wheels, using them for cover as they fired at the Lakota. [...] The Lakota took substantial losses, as the soldiers were firing new breech-loading rifles. These could fire ten times a minute compared to the old muzzle-loading rate of three times a minute. The Lakota charged after the soldiers fired the first time, expecting the delay of their older muskets before being able to fire again. The soldiers suffered only five killed and two wounded, while the Lakota suffered between 50 and 120 casualties. Many Lakota were buried in the hills surrounding Fort Phil Kearny in Wyoming.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{publicity}} method – undertaken {{mostly by}} smaller firms – was the medicine show, a traveling circus of sorts that offered vaudeville-style entertainments {{on a small}} scale, and climaxed in a pitch {{for some sort of}} cure-all nostrum. [...] "Muscle man" [...] acts were especially popular on these tours, for this enabled the salesman to tout the physical vigour the product supposedly offered. [...] The showmen frequently employed shills, who stepped forward from the crowd to offer [...] "unsolicited" [...] testimonials about the benefits of the medicine. [...] Often, the nostrum was manufactured and bottled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> in which the show travelled. The Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company became {{one of the largest and}} most successful medicine show operators. [...] Their shows had an American Indian or Wild West theme, and employed many American Indians as spokespeople. [...] The [...] "medicine show" [...] lived on in American folklore and Western movies long after they vanished from public life.|$|E

2500|$|Without {{identifying}} a related judgment, Park, J. disagreed with Adams's contention [...] "that {{there is no}} such case on the books," [...] and refused to nonsuit the plaintiff, opining that [...] "the defendant is liable." [...] At the same time, he pointed out that the jury could consider Priestley's acquiescence in light of the wagon's condition, and granted Adams permission to move the full court in Westminster should the jury enter a verdict against his client. Next, instructing the jury, Park, J. stated that Fowler could not be held liable for a hidden defect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> Instead the only question here was,--and it was one of fact—was the van shamelessly overladen; was it laden unsafely and to a dangerous degree; and, if so, was the master acquainted with the fact? [...] [...] [...] if the jury were of opinion that the accident was occasioned by the 'pigheadedness' of the defendant in over-loading the van they would find for the plaintiff.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, a {{group of}} people in Harmony began to {{threaten}} the progress of Smith's translation [...] Therefore, Oliver Cowdery wrote to one of his acquaintances named David Whitmer in Fayette, New York, who had previously shown an interest in the golden plates, and got permission for Smith and Cowdery to stay at David Whitmer's parents' house in Fayette], while they completed the translation [...] The Whitmers were happy to oblige, and offered free room and board [...] Thus, David Whitmer took a large wagon to Harmony at the beginning of June 1829, and moved Smith and Cowdery to Fayette [...] This time, rather than hiding the golden plates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> during the travels as he said he did on his trip to Harmony, Smith said he gave the plates to an angel, who transported the plates and then delivered them to Smith in Fayette [...] However, by this time, Smith was not directly using the plates in the process of translation [...] Emma did not initially accompany Smith to Fayette , although she came later for a time ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence {{had first}} {{arrived at the}} Spade Ranch in 1909 {{at the age of}} {{thirteen}} and grew up observing and working for its owners. In 1908 Bixby's father James, an eastern professor who had moved west for a position at the Spade School, filed on and moved to a section of land four miles (6km) east of the Spade Ranch Headquarters. On March 3, 1909 the rest of the Bixby family arrived at the depot in Ellsworth. From the back of the wagon, as they freighted north from Ellsworth, Lawrence led their milk cow, Old Roanie, and as they passed the Spade Ranch store, Mike Peterson saw them from the front porch. The Spade Foreman laughed when he saw the Bixby piano <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> [...] "I'll just give them six months," [...] he said. Bixby's mother Jennie worked as a ranch cook at the Spade Headquarters Cookhouse. Lawrence would later recall, [...] "Every time some old drunken cook drank up the extract, the foreman would send someone after mother. I used to go up and help her at the cookhouse. I rode Old Plunger and had an eleven dollar Sears Roebuck saddle." [...] In March 1909 James took Lawrence to a cattle sale near Hay Springs, Nebraska. There they bought 28 head of heifers for $467.00. This was the start of Bixby's herd {{and with the help of}} a neighbor they trailed the cattle south for the Spade. They stayed the first night at Newton's Ranch and the next at Sam Green's. [...] "Mr. Green couldn't read nor write," [...] Lawrence wrote, [...] "but he would tell us wonderful stories about Quantrill's Raiders. We stopped at the Spade and branded our heifers with the J Lazy B but before long Newton came with the sheriff and said he was short two white-faced heifers. We had no way to prove what we knew had happened, so we had to see them go". James chose the tranquil name of Cloverleaf Ranch for their new homestead but in the first year a rattlesnake bit their dog Spot, James killed a wolf and a neighbor threatened to contest Lawrence's sister Ina's homestead filing unless they gave him a cow, calf and a spool of wire.|$|E
