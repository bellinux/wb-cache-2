[...] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if she knew she had that much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, [...] "Not that much, no, that's amazing." [...] As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised.|$|E

These differences come out clearly in rescue cases. Consider: One Person, One Island While idly steaming through an almost-deserted South Sea archipelago, I receive a distress call. Agatha has recently been stranded on a nearby island. Mine is the only boat in the area. If I do not get over there with my provisions then she will die of thirst {{in a day or}} two. There are two safe routes to her island, one to the west, the other to the east.

Two People, Two Islands While idly steaming through the same archipelago, I receive another distress call. Andy and Ben have recently been stranded on nearby islands, one to my west and one to my east. Mine is the only boat in the area and, sadly, I have very limited supplies of fuel.

Looking back, I saw my Indian friend wheel round, raise his gun to his {{shoulder}} and fire. The moon was bright, and I {{could see that the}} man who had been closing with us dropped to the ground. Whether he was killed or only wounded we did not wait to ascertain, but dashed on again as fast as ever. We soon drew rein, however, on observing that the fall of our pursuer had checked his companions. On reaching him they halted, dismounted, and finally gave up the chase. We soon left them out of sight behind us, but still we held on at a hand-gallop, resolved to put as much distance as possible between us before encamping.|$|E

It was a well laid one, too, and had we ridden on we should have been riddled with bullets. No doubt there were men lying in the carts. They would have jumped up as we came up to them, and the fellows in the bushes would have taken us in the rear; between their two fires our chances would have been small indeed. No doubt they had a man on watch, and directly they saw us coming they got their carts across the road, and took up their positions.

60|$|That was {{the first}} of several visits to Bonaventure. The acreage of Crane Valley was ample, but the house a mere {{elongated}} sod hovel, of which Miss Steel monopolized the greater portion, although I reflected grimly that in existing circumstances it was quite good enough for me. Our life there was dreary enough, and, at times, I grew tired of Sally's alternate blandishments and railleries; so, when the frost bound fast the sod and but little could be done for land and cattle, it was very pleasant to spend a few days amid the refinement and comfort which ruled at Bonaventure. During one of my journeys there I met Cotton, and rode some distance with him across the prairie. I could see there was something he wished to say, but his usually ample confidence seemed to fail him, and finally he bade me farewell with visible hesitation where our ways parted. I had, however, scarcely resumed my journey before he hailed me, and when <b>I</b> <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> horse he rode back in my direction with resolve and irresolution mingled in his face.|$|E

Never, before nor since, have I had such a shock. I clung to the ladder and considered. I could not doubt my senses. That I had seen something there was no discussion. But what was it? Either a ghost or a joke. There could be nothing else. If a ghost, the question was: would it appear again? If it did not, and I aroused the ship's officers, I would make myself the laughing stock of all on board. And by the same token, if it were a joke, my position would be still more ridiculous. If I were to retain my hard-won place of equality, it would never do to arouse any one until I ascertained the nature of the thing.|$|E
