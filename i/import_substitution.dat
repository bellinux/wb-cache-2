5|$|In {{response}} to the Great Depression, successive governments pursued a strategy designed to transform Argentina into a country self-sufficient in industry as well as agriculture. The strategy of growth was based on <b>import</b> <b>substitution</b> in which tariffs and quotas for final goods were raised. The import-substitution process had progressively been adopted since the late 19th century, but the Great Depression intensified it. The government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agriculture, and agricultural production fell dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The {{single most important}} factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the most}} stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of <b>import</b> <b>substitution</b> to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of <b>import</b> <b>substitution,</b> in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E

40|$|In Colombia, {{as in the}} {{majority}} of Latin American countries, the rural sector has been confronted with economic policies that have modified the social relations between the different actors that compose it, in three historical periods: conservative modernization (1850 - 1930), <b>import</b> <b>substitutions</b> (1940 - 1960) and the economic aperture (since 1970) that have favored the big producers and land owners, in the rural population's detriment. The excluded and marginal groups constitute the social subjects of the current agrarian movement, to which rural workers with or without land, indigenous groups, afro—descendents, other movements and similar sectors have adjoined. In this text, the social subjects who make up the agrarian movement in Colombia are analyzed, and their protest repertoires are described. It also scrutinizes the transformation that these fights have undergone between 1990 y 2005, since the rural sector and the social actors who make it up, as well as their ways of live, have been the most vulnerable...|$|R

They are mostly originated in tropical and subtropical regions of the planet. In Cuba, the level of endemism is low and there are primarily herbaceous size species.

This device was aimed at correcting some market failures, specifically the rationing of credit that affected these types of enterprise. Previously, {{in the aftermath of}} the Revolution of 1910, a specific link had been established between the State and the economic agents. This probably altered the modality and scope of this public policy. This device proved to be ad hoc instrument in order to establish an implicit and perdurable agreement between the State?by means of its technocrac? and the business community within the model of <b>imports</b> <b>substitution</b> industrialization (ISI). The existence of this type of devices was only possible within the frame of a policy of indebtedness which was simultaneously a condition and a consequence. The incompatibility of the governance of this device and the logics of banking regarding the mechanisms of credit granting, combined with the structural adjustment policies, resulted in the suppression of FOGAIN in 1989. En 1953, l’Etat mexicain met en place une politique d’appui au financement des petites et moyennes entreprises industrielles (PMEI), le FOGAIN. Ce dispositif visait à combler les défaillances de marché, en particulier celles relevant du rationnement de crédit dont faisaient l’objet ce type d’entreprises.

Pakistan has strong potential if the determinants involved in the transformation of the agrarian structure of the economy to mechanized industrialization improve to induce more foreign investors in capital intensive projects by creating financial co-relation with domestic investors as the country has low access in the international resource markets of invisible items. Foreign Inflows of portfolio investments direct enhances foreign exchange reserves. Aim of this study to explain various factors involved to have more FCI and its impact on macroeconomic indicators like, Growth, Domestic Investment, Inflation and Trade Balance. Trend and Regression Analysis applied to evaluate thirty years secondary data collected from various sources. This Study focused on two Determinants of FCI i. e. 'Foreign Direct Investment' (FDI) and 'Foreign Portfolio Investment' (FPI). For checking interdependency of variables in six separate models are specified taking different macro-economic variables. Before analyzing the Time-Series data, Augmented Ducky Fuller test (ADFT) used to check stationarity of the data of those variables in models. For checking Non-Stationary data by Unit-Root showed that all the variables are not stationary at level but stationary at the first difference. For the analysis of variation in variables and finding long-run relationship, "Johansen'sCo-integration-Test" applied. For detection of short-run impacts of FCI on the selected variables in models "Vector-Error-Correction-Model" (VECM) used. Moreover, for examination of the inter relationship in the FCI with economic growth, domestic investment, consumption and inflation; Granger Causality Test (GCT) applied. For deriving the results, SPSS and E-views utilized. Major findings of the study showed that GDP growth rate positively and significantly affects (0. 147) FCI and negatively affected (- 0. 033) by the inflation rate in the country. FCI affected positively (0. 195) by the interest rate. Exchange rate is positively related (0. 027) to the FCI. Domestic investment affects positively (0. 545) FCI. GDP growth rate positively affects (0. 157) FDI. FDI negatively affected (- 0. 001) by the inflation rate of the country. FDI is affected positively (0. 015) by the interest rate of the country. Exchange rate positively related (0. 030) FDI. Domestic investment affects positively (0. 295) FDI. Exports affect FCI positively (0. 008). GDP growth rate positively affected (1. 083) by FDI in the country. GDP growth rate positively affected (0. 021) by the persistent rise in the general price level (inflation) of economy. Gross-Domestic-Product (GDP) growth rate affected negatively (- 0. 080) by the interest rate of the country. FDI positively affects (1. 479) the domestic investment of the country. Domestic investment positively affected (0. 284) by FCIs. Inflation rate is positively affected (0. 157) by the foreign direct investment to the country. FCI affect the inflation rate positively (0. 467). FCIs affect the balance of trade negatively (- 0. 127). The coefficient is significant at 5 % levels of significance. Balance of trade positively affected (0. 127) by the GDP growth rate of the country. The balance of trade affected positively (0. 237) by the relative prices of imports. Balance of trade negatively affected (- 0. 132) by the relative prices of exports. Foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate affects the balance of trade negatively. Similarly, as the currency depreciates, the exports become less expensive and hence the demand for exports increases in the international markets. Increase in exports lead to improve balance of trade. Incentives should be given to domestic investors to boost GDP and exports. The study revealed that inflation rate; imports volume affects the FCI negatively and has insignificant impact. So the government should control inflation through monetary/fiscal policy and reduce the imports of un-necessary items through restrictions or <b>imports</b> <b>substitution</b> and export orientation...|$|R
40|$|Reference prices {{constitute}} a main determinant of patient health care reimbursement in many countries. We study {{the effects of}} a change from an "external" (based on a basket of prices in other countries) to an "internal" (based on comparable domestic products) reference price system. We find that while our estimated consumer compensating variation is small, the reform led to substantial reductions in list and reference prices as well as co-payments, and to sizeable decreases in overall producer revenues, health care expenditures, and co-payments. These effects differ markedly between branded drugs, generics, and parallel imports with health care expenditures and producer revenues decreasing and co-payments increasing most for branded drugs. The reform also induced consumers to substitute from branded drugs - for which they have strong preferences - to generics and parallel <b>imports.</b> This <b>substitution</b> also explains the small increase in consumer welfare despite a substantial decrease in expenditures...|$|R

The fundamental changes from developments that had been playing out in global clothing markets and from which, as an <b>import</b> - <b>substitution</b> economy with high levels of protection, it had previously been shielded, were brought heavily to bear on the South African clothing industry. By all accounts, it did not adjust well to the new globalised environment. The once thriving industry withered under the combined impact of domestic and international factors. The negative impact of this transformation was manifest in a declining relative contribution to total manufacturing output, falling productivity levels, lack of capital investment, a large and significant contraction in sector employment and stagnant export performance, all of which occurred in the context of rapidly expanding domestic demand for clothing, which was increasingly fed by imports...|$|R

In the early 1970s, the performance of the export sector was undermined by an overvalued currency. With the trade balance under pressure, the oil shock led to a sharply higher import bill. Brazil opted to continue a high-growth policy. Furthermore, it adopted renewed strategies of <b>import</b> <b>substitution</b> industrialization and of economic diversification. In the mid-1970s, the regime began implementing a development plan aimed at increasing self-sufficiency in many sectors and creating new comparative advantages.
