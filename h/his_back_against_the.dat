5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a tag team match, in which the WWF Tag Team Champions Kane and X-Pac defended against Mark Henry and D'Lo Brown. During the match, Henry lifted X-Pac and rammed <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> steel ring post at ringside. Afterward, Brown and Henry simultaneously attacked X-Pac, which led Kane to launch himself from the top turnbuckle onto Brown and Henry. After the competitors reentered the ring, Kane performed a chokeslam on Henry, lifting him by the throat and slamming him down. Kane then pinned Henry to retain the WWF Tag Team Title. Next was the hardcore singles boutâ€”a match allowing no disqualifications or countouts. WWF Hardcore Champion Al Snow defended against Hardcore Holly. Holly and Snow began their bout in the ring but were scripted to move their brawl into the arena stands. From there, they proceeded to the backstage area, and into the concession stands {{before returning to the}} ring. The fight was decided when Snow lifted Holly onto his shoulders and threw him through a wooden table. Successfully covering and pinning Holly, Snow retained the WWF Hardcore Title.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} Raw, Ryback saved WWE Champion John Cena from assault by Mark Henry before attacking Cena as well, turning heel {{in the process}} {{for the first time}} since 2010. The following week on Raw, Ryback explained his attack on Cena as stepping out from his shadow and getting revenge for Cena not having <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>The</b> Shield; before Ryback got a measure of revenge later that night, by allowing the Shield to attack Cena. After becoming the number one contender to the WWE Championship, but Ryback continued his feud with Cena by attacking him on several occasions while also having confrontations with The Shield. Ryback received his title opportunity in a Last Man Standing match on May 19 at Extreme Rules. The match ended in a no contest after Ryback rammed Cena and himself into the electric backdrop at the top of the ramp. The following night on Raw, Ryback entered the arena in an ambulance and challenged Cena to an ambulance match for the WWE Championship at the first-ever Payback pay-per-view. The following week on the May 27 episode of Raw, Cena accepted Ryback's challenge, but announced their match would instead be a 3 Stages of Hell match; the first fall a lumberjack match, the second a tables match, and the third an ambulance match. On June 16 at Payback, Ryback won the lumberjack match, but went on to lose both the tables and ambulance matches and his shot at the WWE Championship, to end the feud.|$|E
2500|$|After Theresa May became {{leader of}} the Conservative and Prime Minister, Johnson was {{appointed}} as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on 13 July 2016. Johnson's appointment was criticised by some journalists and foreign politicians due to his history of controversial statements about other countries and their leaders. Former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt said [...] "I wish it was a joke", and France's foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault stated: [...] "I am not at all worried about Boris Johnson, but... during the campaign he lied {{a lot to the}} British people and now it is he who has <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall" [...] as the UK tries to negotiate its future relationship with EU. Conversely, former Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott welcomed the appointment and called him [...] "a friend of Australia". A senior official in the US government suggested that Johnson's appointment would push the US further towards ties with Germany {{at the expense of the}} Special Relationship with the UK.|$|E

2500|$|Rosecrans faced {{significant}} logistical challenges if {{he chose}} to move forward. The Cumberland Plateau that separated the armies was a rugged, barren country over 30 miles long with poor roads and little opportunity for foraging. If Bragg attacked him during the advance, Rosecrans {{would be forced to}} fight with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mountains and tenuous supply lines. He did not have the luxury of staying put, however, because he was under intense pressure from Washington to move forward in conjunction with Burnside's advance into East Tennessee. By early August, Halleck was frustrated enough with Rosecrans's delay that he ordered him to move forward immediately and to report daily the movement of each corps until he crossed the Tennessee River. Rosecrans was outraged at the tone of [...] "recklessness, conceit and malice" [...] of Halleck's order and insisted that he would be courting disaster if he were not permitted to delay his advance until at least August 17.|$|E
