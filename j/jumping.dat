Ahead of the 1992 Winter Olympics, {{the large and}} normal hills were built along with a cross-country stadium to host ski <b>jumping</b> and Nordic combined events. Since 1997, the hill has hosted an annual summer FIS Ski <b>Jumping</b> Grand Prix event. It has also been used for one FIS Ski <b>Jumping</b> World Cup and two FIS Nordic Combined World Cup rounds, in addition to four events of the FIS Ski <b>Jumping</b> Continental Cup. The medium hill opened in 2004 and the small hill in 2008.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, <b>Jumping</b> Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to <b>Jumping</b> Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give <b>Jumping</b> Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. <b>Jumping</b> Flash! 2 was not designed to be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Big Thunder Ski <b>Jumping</b> Centre was a twin ski <b>jumping</b> hill {{located in}} Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. It {{constitutes}} part of Big Thunder National Training Centre. The first hills were built by Knute and Thor Hansen and opened in 1963. They were originally known as Lille Norway Ski Area, then Mt. Norway Ski Area, and Sundance Northwest Resort {{before taking the}} current name. The large and normal hills were built in 1974 and the venue {{was taken over by}} the provincial government in 1985. The hills hosted 29 FIS Ski <b>Jumping</b> World Cup and 50 Canadian Ski <b>Jumping</b> Championships tournaments between 1975 and 1995, climaxing with the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1995. Funding was then cut and the venue has since been closed and unmaintained.|$|E

5|$|Events {{under the}} Ski Flying World Cup have several {{differences}} to the Ski Flying World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as the Ski <b>Jumping</b> World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the Ski Flying World Cup is part of the overall Ski <b>Jumping</b> World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski Flying and Ski <b>Jumping</b> World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the Ski Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the Ski <b>Jumping</b> World Cup standings to the Ski Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E

5|$|The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed for show <b>jumping</b> and three-day eventing. Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their <b>jumping</b> abilities. Show <b>jumping</b> is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (dressage, three-day eventing and show <b>jumping)</b> of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show <b>jumping</b> and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show <b>jumping,</b> which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show <b>jumping</b> and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show <b>jumping</b> stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by many of the more popular dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: jumps, and throws. In <b>jumping</b> competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} of <b>jumping</b> events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of <b>jumping</b> events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E

40|$|Large {{stock price}} {{movements}} are modeled as <b>jumps</b> in the stochastic processes of stock prices. In the current literature, the <b>jump</b> intensity is typically specified in models {{as a function}} of the current diffusive volatility and past <b>jump</b> intensities, while the <b>jump</b> size is assumed to be independent of the <b>jump</b> intensity. We use a nonparametric <b>jump</b> detection test to identify <b>jumps</b> in several stock indexes and examine the determinants of the <b>jump</b> intensity and the <b>jump</b> size. We find little evidence that the <b>jump</b> intensity depends on the current diffusive volatility. Instead, the <b>jump</b> intensity and the <b>jump</b> size depend on the current stock price level relative to its historical average, beside past <b>jump</b> intensities. The results in this paper provide new perspectives for modeling <b>jumps</b> in the theory of options pricing and in the applications of risk management. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, Shueisha {{got into}} the {{business}} of making manga magazines, the first being Omoshiro Book. In 1951, Shueisha created a female version of that anthology entitled Shōjo Book. Shōjo Book led to the publication of the highly successful Shōjo manga magazine: Ribon. Omoshiro Book went out of print and Shueisha decided to make another male version of their successful Shōjo Book to even it out and made the magazine Shōnen Book. In the middle of Shōnen Books publication, Shōnen <b>Jump</b> began its run (at the time was a Semiweekly magazine and had no [...] "Weekly"). Shōnen Book ended when Shōnen <b>Jump</b> became a Weekly magazine correctly changing its name to Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump.</b> In 1969 a special issue called Bessatsu Shōnen <b>Jump</b> took Shōnen Books place. In addition to the success of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump,</b> Shueisha created a Seinen version of the magazine in 1979, called Young <b>Jump</b> (now Weekly Young <b>Jump).</b> Bessatsu Shōnen <b>Jump,</b> later got renamed Monthly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> and became a magazine of its own. The seasonal issues of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> are now called Akamaru <b>Jump.</b> In 1985, Shueisha started the publication of two business related manga magazines; a salaryman <b>Jump</b> magazine called Business <b>Jump</b> and an office lady manga magazine called Office You, also in 1988 started the publication of Super <b>Jump.</b> Many other Seinen related <b>Jump</b> magazines, started as spin-off issues of the Weekly Young <b>Jump</b> magazine. In 1993, Shueisha announced and released the video game/manga magazine V <b>Jump</b> alongside the <b>Jump</b> light novel line <b>Jump</b> j-Books. In 2003 Shogakukans Viz Media released an English version of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> called Shonen <b>Jump.</b> Monthly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> discontinued in 2007 and was replaced with the <b>Jump</b> SQ. magazine, four series from the magazine were moved. In addition to the <b>Jump</b> SQ. anthology, a spin-off issue was created, called <b>Jump</b> SQ.II (Second).

5|$|While {{almost all}} <b>jumping</b> spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most <b>jumping</b> spiders walk {{throughout}} the day, so that they maximise their chances of a catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most <b>jumping</b> spiders, Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away.|$|E

5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four <b>jumping</b> species take nectar, either by sucking free nectar {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed their bodies and {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile <b>jumping</b> spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from blotting soaked with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper soaked with distilled water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. <b>Jumping</b> spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E

5|$|Almost all <b>jumping</b> spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey.

5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include <b>jumping</b> across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), or moving a box {{to use it as a}} jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal <b>jumping.</b> Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E
5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while <b>jumping.</b> The shotgun-like blast can supplement the <b>jumping</b> mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
40|$|We {{utilize the}} {{realized}} <b>jump</b> components {{to explore a}} new <b>jump</b> (including nonsystematic <b>jump</b> and systematic <b>jump)</b> risk factor model. After estimating daily realized <b>jumps</b> from high-frequency transaction data of the Chinese A-share stocks, we calculate monthly <b>jump</b> size, monthly <b>jump</b> standard deviation, and monthly <b>jump</b> arrival rate and then use those monthly <b>jump</b> factors to explain {{the return of the}} following month. Our empirical results show that the <b>jump</b> tail risk can explain the equity return. For the large capital-size stocks, large cap stock portfolios, and index, one-month lagged <b>jump</b> risk factor significantly explains the asset return variation. Our results remain the same even when we add the size and value factors in the robustness tests...|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} is the stag <b>jump,</b> {{in which the}} forward leg is bent in front while the back leg kicks out as in the regular split <b>jump.</b> Both the Russian split and stag <b>jump</b> can be done from the same <b>jump</b> entries as the regular split <b>jumps.</b> Bending both legs in a stag <b>jump</b> is sometimes called a double stag <b>jump.</b>|$|R
25|$|A jumper may {{be either}} {{stationary}} or moving when initiating a <b>jump.</b> In a <b>jump</b> from stationary (i.e., a standing <b>jump),</b> {{all of the}} work required to accelerate the body through launch is done in a single movement. In a moving <b>jump</b> or running <b>jump,</b> the jumper introduces additional vertical velocity at launch while conserving as much horizontal momentum as possible. Unlike stationary <b>jumps,</b> in which the jumper's kinetic energy at launch is solely due to the <b>jump</b> movement, moving <b>jumps</b> have a higher energy that results from {{the inclusion of the}} horizontal velocity preceding the <b>jump.</b> Consequently, jumpers are able to <b>jump</b> greater distances when starting from a run.|$|R
5|$|At the beginning, <b>jumping</b> {{on every}} cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. <b>Jumping</b> off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski <b>jumping</b> at these championships, the big winner in the <b>jumping</b> events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the ski <b>jumping</b> part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the ski <b>jumping</b> individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump.|$|E
5|$|C. Norwegian equestrian athlete Tony André Hansen's horse tested {{positive}} for the pain relieving medication capsaicin, a banned substance. Hansen, who won a bronze medal in the team <b>jumping</b> event, was disqualified. In the team <b>jumping</b> system, the top three scores garnered by the four riders are counted. Hansen had the best score on his team, and it was removed from the total. Without Hansen's score, his team was below the bronze medal threshold so the medal was awarded to the team from Switzerland on December 22, 2008.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary Version We develop {{volatility}} estimators for disentangling volatility {{into three}} parts: those due to diffusive components, positive <b>jumps,</b> i. e. upside <b>jump</b> risk, and negative <b>jumps,</b> i. e. downside <b>jump</b> risk.
