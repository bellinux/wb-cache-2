5|$|On the October 27 {{episode of}} Raw, after John Cena, the #1 {{contender}} for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, rejected an offer to join the Authority, Triple H announced a Traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match, with a team representing the Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon announced that if Team Authority loses at Survivor Series, the Authority will be ousted from power. During the match, Triple H tried to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> member of Team Cena, Dolph Ziggler, eliminated by attacking two referees and placing Seth Rollins (who was also the final member of Team Authority) on top of Ziggler and calling crooked referee Scott Armstrong into the ring to make the count, however the debuting Sting came out and attacked Armstrong and Triple H, giving Team Cena the win and thus disbanding The Authority. Stephanie and Triple H appeared on the episode of Raw after Survivor Series stating that without them the company would be driven to the ground. They were then escorted out of the arena by the returning Daniel Bryan and only to be insulted by Mr.McMahon for letting him down and the McMahon family before exiting the arena. On the December 29 episode of Raw, The Authority was brought back in power by John Cena, {{and she and her}} husband entered and stepped on the entrance ramp celebrating their return with a glass of champagne and a kiss. Stephanie and Triple H then proceeded to fire Erick Rowan, Ryback and Dolph Ziggler.|$|E

25|$|As {{officers}} {{searched for}} shooters inside the building, others aided the wounded. Probation officers initially {{set up a}} makeshift triage center near {{the entrance of the}} building, but deemed it to be too close and relocated it across the street by 11:15a.m. Because survivors were soaked from water pouring from the fire sprinkler pipe, they became slippery for officers to hold. Injured victims were carried out by hand, with blankets, and even on chairs, as litters and tactical stretchers were unavailable at the time. An SBPD tactical medic supervised the extraction operation. It took 57 minutes to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the injured to a hospital.|$|E

25|$|After Madson retired {{all three}} Cubs he faced {{in the top}} of the eighth, the Nationals staged their final rally in the bottom of the inning. Joe Maddon had called in Cubs closer Wade Davis to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> out of the seventh inning and kept him in to pitch the eighth and ninth in the hope that he would get a seven-out save, an unusually long outing for him. Davis started the eighth by walking Daniel Murphy and Anthony Rendon, but then got pinch-hitter Adam Lind to ground into a double play that {{advanced}} Murphy to third. Michael A. Taylor then singled to drive in Murphy and cut Chicago's lead to 9-8, and light-hitting catcher José Lobatón who had replaced Wieters in the game, singled, advancing Taylor to second. With Davis clearly tiring and the top of the Nationals′ order coming to bat, Washington′s hopes rose that they could at least tie the game. Trea Turner came to the plate and had worked his at-bat to a 2-1 count when catcher Willson Contreras threw to first to pick off Lobatón. Lobatón was called safe, but the Cubs challenged the call and the video replay revealed that Lobatón′s foot had lost contact with the bag for less than a second while Anthony Rizzo was applying the tag. Lobatón was ruled out, and the inning ended.|$|E
500|$|Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} post was [...] "a {{fascinating}} {{look at where}} Kanye's head is at these days", and complimented West for his [...] "humility and honesty". Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Many have tried, all have failed, {{but in the end}} it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West's ego. ... One day, we'll all look back on this day and thank South Park for ushering in this historic moment in the life of Kanye." [...] Kerrie Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly suggested West's modest response was actually a marketing stunt to help sell his upcoming personal fragrance and energy drink. Mitchell wrote, [...] "Did he just <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh on South Park? Conspiracy!" [...] In response to the media coverage, West wrote another blog entry on April 10 claiming he had only seen part of the episode and found it funny, but he had been working on his arrogance problem for some time and that South Park did not lead to his [...] "ego epiphany". The next day, he said in another blog entry that while visiting The Cheesecake Factory restaurant, the manager brought him a plate of fishsticks as a joke.|$|E
500|$|That same year, deHavilland {{made two}} more period films, {{beginning}} with The Great Garrick, a fictional romantic comedy about the 18th-century English actor's encounter with jealous {{players from the}} Comédie-Française who plot to embarrass {{him on his way}} to Paris. Wise to their prank, Garrick plays along with the ruse, determined to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh, even on a lovely young aristocrat, deHavilland's Germaine Dupont, whom he mistakenly believes {{to be one of the}} players. With her refined demeanor and diction, deHavilland delivers a performance that is [...] "lighthearted and thoroughly believable", according to Judith Kass. Variety praised the film, calling it [...] "a production of superlative workmanship". Despite the positive reviews, the film did not do as well at the box office. Her final film that year was Michael Curtiz's romantic drama Gold Is Where You Find It, a film about the late 19th-century conflict in the Sacramento Valley between gold miners and their hydraulic equipment and farmers whose land is being flooded. DeHavilland played the daughter of a farmer, Serena Ferris, who falls in love with the mining engineer responsible for the flooding. The film was released in February 1938, and was her first appearance in three-strip Technicolor.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1995-1997 solo {{acoustic}} Ghost of Tom Joad Tour and associated promotional media appearances, Springsteen radically recast [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] once again, playing an acoustic guitar version that was unlike both the original Nebraska and full band performances. [...] This was a stinging, snarling rendition that only included the title phrase twice. [...] This was both {{in connection with}} the Tom Joad Tour's wan moods as well as Springsteen's attempt to make clear the song's original and only purpose; in his introduction to the song in this shows he said he still wasn't convinced the song had been misinterpreted, but now as the songwriter he was [...] "going to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> say." [...] Fan reaction was divided, with some greatly liking the new arrangement and others thinking the song's musical ironies had been lost.|$|E
2500|$|The Rays {{would send}} a fifth player, making it the most they had ever sent to one All-Star Game, which was a record {{that had been set}} the {{previous}} season. Carlos Peña, who had never been to the All-Star Game, was a nominee for the All-Star Final Vote, a process in which fans choose one of five players in each league to take the final roster spots on the All-Star squads. Voting began after the initial All-Star rosters were announced. To help garner votes for Peña, the Rays started the [...] "Vote for 'Los" [...] campaign, having T-shirts made with Peña's face on them which players wore during batting practice. The Rays asked fans to bring their laptop computers to Tropicana Field and vote online during the game, as well as using advertisements, online commercials, fliers, merchandise, and even a video message from comedian Rob Schneider. Despite all efforts, Peña would ultimately finish fourth in the voting. Brandon Inge of the Detroit Tigers received the most votes to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> remaining spot. Even though he didn't win, Peña said he was flattered and humbled to see how many were in support of him to make the All-Star Game. Peña would eventually make the team anyway as a replacement to Dustin Pedroia, who would have been the starting 2nd baseman, as he pulled out due to a [...] "serious family health matter" [...] involving his wife.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, Bolland {{attended}} the British Comic Art Convention at the Waverley Hotel in London, and met [...] "a {{lot of the}} people who were key in the comics scene of the time," [...] including Dez Skinn, Nick Landau, Richard Burton, Angus McKie and – crucially – Dave Gibbons. Bolland and Gibbons became firm friends. After finishing his college course, Bolland was hit with [...] "the stark reality of unemployment" [...] and on the advice of Gibbons joined art agency Bardon Press Features. [...] "A few two-page strips" [...] for D.C. Thomson resulted, but Bolland would refer to this period as his [...] "lowest time." [...] Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was [...] "planning a bi-weekly comic about an African superhero," [...] Powerman, which was to be sold in Nigeria. Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues (Bolland's first issue was Powerman No. 2.), and Bolland recalls that [...] "soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages." [...] This knowledge – [...] "that Dave could produce a page a day... and that I was going to have to do the same" [...] – was a shock, but proved to be [...] "the very best kind of training ground." [...] With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria, Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be [...] "really simple; six panels on a page and [...] the panels had to be numbered." [...] Not only was this work [...] "he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling," [...] but [...] "better still, it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it." [...] He [...] "drew around 300 pages of that very straightforward, simple-to-follow work, and I guess the storytelling flowed naturally from that." [...] Even so, he [...] "was always struggling to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> eight or ten pages finished," [...] and was occasionally helped by friends, both from his [...] "Norwich School of Art days," [...] Gibbons and future-2000 AD and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen artist Kevin O'Neill.|$|E
