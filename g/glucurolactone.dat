40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{beneficial}} and harmful effects of medicinal herbs for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. METHODS: The databases of the Cochrane Collaboration, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS were searched combined with manual searches of five Chinese and one Japanese journals. We included randomized trials comparing medicinal herbs with placebo, no intervention, nonspecific treatment, other herbs, or interferon and/or ribavirin. Trials of herbs with or without other drug(s) were included. Methodological quality of the trials was evaluated by randomization, double blinding, and the Jadad scale. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized trials (n = 818) evaluated 14 medicinal herbs. Four trials had adequate methodology. Compared with placebo, none of the herbs showed effects on HCV RNA or liver enzyme, except for silybin, which showed a significant reduction of serum AST and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels in one trial. Oxymatrine showed effects on clearance of HCV RNA (relative risk = 9. 20, 95 % Cl = 1. 26 - 67. 35) compared with vitamins. The herbal mixture Bing Gan Tang plus interferon-alpha showed better effects on clearance of HCV RNA (relative risk = 2. 54, 95 % Cl = 1. 43 - 4. 49) and on normalization of serum ALT (relative risk = 2. 54, 95 % Cl = 1. 43 - 4. 49) than interferon-alpha alone. The herbal mixture Yi Zhu decoction showed better effects on clearance of HCV RNA and normalization of ALT compared with glycyrrhizin plus ribavirin. Yi Er Gan Tang showed effects on normalizing serum ALT compared with silymarin plus <b>glucurolactone.</b> The herbs were associated with adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: There is no firm evidence supporting medicinal herbs for HCV infection, and further randomized trials are justified...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{therapeutic}} effect of Chishaodanpi decoction (CSDPD) on chronic viral cholestatic hepatitis. MethodsA total of 107 subjects with chronic viral cholestatic hepatitis {{were enrolled in}} our hospital from March 2007 to November 2012. Patients were randomly divided into treatment (54 cases) and control groups (53 cases). The control group was treated with potassium magnesium aspartate, diammonium glycyrrhizinate, <b>glucurolactone,</b> vitamin C, and lamivudine, once a day. The treatment group was treated with modified CSDPD, 100 mL a time, twice a day, {{in addition to the}} treatment given to the control group. The patients in both groups were treated for 8 weeks. The main symptoms and signs were recorded every day throughout the clinical trial. Before and after the trial, changes in liver function including total bilirubin (TBil), direct bilirubin (DBil), total bile acid (TBA), and the activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), were all detected. Adverse reactions were also recorded. ResultsThere were no differences in gender, age, disease duration, symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings between the two groups (P> 0. 05). After an 8 -week treatment, improvements in jaundice, weakness, poor appetite, abdominal distention, and skin itching were significantly better in the treatment group than in the control group (P< 0. 05). In the treatment group, 43 patients had a significant response to the treatment, seven patients had a response, and four patients had no response, with 21, 12, and 20 patients in the control group, respectively. The total effective rate was 92. 6 % in the treatment group and 62. 3 % in the control group, which was a significant difference (P< 0. 05). The levels of TBil, DBil, TBA, ALP, ALT, AST, and γ-GT in both groups were significantly lower after treatment, and were significantly different between the two groups (P< 0. 05). A few patients in the treatment group had mild adverse effects such as increased bowel movement frequency and mild stomachache. No other adverse reactions were observed in either group. ConclusionCSDPD has a satisfactory therapeutic effect on chronic viral cholestatic hepatitis...|$|E
