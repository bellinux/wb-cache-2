In the <b>ethereal</b> <b>oil</b> of summer savory, 19 components were identified: carvacrol (89, 07 %), γ-terpinene (3, 53 %), α-thujone (1, 7 %), camphora (1, 48 %), terpinen- 4 ol 4 (0, 91 %), β-bisabolen (0, 56 %), β-caryophyllene (0, 45 %), bitsiklogermakren (0, 38 %) para-cymene (0, 34 %), 1, 8 -cineole (0, 33 %), trans-sabinengidrat (0. 25 %), 1 -octen- 3 -ol (0. 20 %), spatulenol (0, 18 %), β-thujone (0, 14 %), eugenol (0, 11 %), geranylacetate (0, 11 %), humulene (0, 09 %), α-terpinene (0, 09 %), octanol- 3 (0, 07 %). A high carvacrol content determines antimicrobial properties of summer savory. The antimicrobial activity of S. hortensis extract was studied in accordance with the common methodology of determining the sensitivity of microorganisms to antibacterial preparations. The aboveground part of plants harvested in the last ten-day period of August, in the flowering phase, was used in the experiments. The raw material was reduced to fragments of 1 - 1. 5 mm according to the requirements of pharmacopoeia. The extract of S. hortensis was obtained by the method of maceration in 40 % ethyl alcohol at a ratio of 1 : 5 and the concentration of 200 mg/ml. The availability of antimicrobial activity of extracted substances {{in the structure of the}} substances studied was determined by the way of comparison of their minimum inhibiting concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBC/MFC) with those in 40 % ethyl alcohol. The paper investigates the biological activity of 40 % ethanol extract of Satureja hortensis herb grown under the conditions of Ukrainian Polissya as to golden staphylococcus (Staphylococcus aureus), coliform bacillus Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans which are pathogenic in reference to other organisms. It has been shown that S. hortensis extract was characterized by antimicrobial activity since extracted substances increased 32 times the indices of minimum bacteriostatic concentration and 16 times those of minimum bactericidal concentration as to S. aureus. The less marked effect was registered concerning C. albicans. In this case twofold increase of MIC and MFC indices was only observed. In relation to E. coli the components of savory extract intensified two times the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal effect of 40 % ethanol. As to P. aerugionosa the antimicrobial effect was not registered. The paper draws attention to the prospects of the further more detailed study of ethanol extracts of summer savory with the aim of producing antibacterial and antifungal herbal preparations. Key words: Satureja hortensis, ethanol extract, minimal bacteriostatic concentration, minimal bactericidal concentration...|$|E

Therefore, we are left with a conclusion that such "invented" traditions exist in all epochs; the {{question of}} a "true", non-invented traditions is left unexplained or unanswered.

Demographic and clinical parameters in the main and the control groups were comparable. Inclusion criteria: age from 40 to 70 years, pain intensity in the target joint at least 40 mm on VAS, I-III radiological stage according to Kellgren, Leqesne score 4 - 10, treatment with NSAIDs during the previous 3 months. Exclusion criteria: indications for intra-articular glucocorticoid injection, clinically significant disturbances of internal organs function and skin damages {{in the region of}} knee joint. Clinical efficacy was assessed by WOMAC index, pain at movement and at rest, time of 15 meters walking, general assessment of efficacy (separately by the pt and by the doctor).

Local BMAW administration provided statistically significant decrease of WO MAC summated score (p= 0, 008), pain at movement (p< 0, 001) and at rest (p< 0, 005). So analgesic effect of the drug is sufficient for improvement of functional activity of pts with KOA.
