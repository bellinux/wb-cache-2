40|$|International audienceA {{closed loop}} control {{approach}} has been implemented for {{the case of an}} unstable open cavity flow. Model reduction techniques and Linear-Quadratic- Gaussian (LQG) control have been combined to stabilize the flow. A blowing/suction actuator has been placed upstream of the cavity and a skin <b>friction</b> <b>sensor</b> downstream of it. Reduced-order models based on global modes and balanced modes have been tested. We show that a reduced-order model based on the unstable global modes (to represent the unstable dynamics) and a few balanced modes (to capture the input-output dynamics of the stable sub-space between the actuator and the sensor) is optimal to stabilize the compensated system. On the other hand, it is shown that the direct and adjoint stable global modes are not appropriate to model the stable subspace due to their strong non-normality. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{experimental}} studies of whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensors have indicated that microspheres with diameters ranging between 300 - 950 µm may have force resolutions reaching 10 - 5 N [1]. In the present, we expand on the previous investigatons. Here, we carry out a systematic analysis and experiments to investigate the sensitivity, resolution and bandwidth limits of WGM-based force sensors. Expressions for WGM shifts due to applied force in the polar direction are obtained for microspheres of various dielectric materials, in the diameter range of 300 - 950 µm. The analyses are compared with experimental results for Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) Polydimethylsyloxane (PDMS) microsphere sensors. The present analysis shows that the strain effect on WGM shifts dominate over that of mechanical stress. It also indicates that force sensitivities {{of the order of}} a 1 pN are possible using hollow PDMS spheres. The sensor bandwidths (based on the mechanical properties of the sensor material alone) range between 1 kHz and 1 MHz. These results have significance also {{from the point of view}} wall shear stress since the same force sensing concept can be used for the development of high-sensitivity skin <b>friction</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R

40|$|In parallel-redundant {{actuation}} systems {{operating in}} active/active mode a position offset between the actuator outputs {{can lead to}} excessive forces and torsion of the primary flight control surface. The key drivers leading to a substantial force fight in systems involving two nominally identical electro-mechanical actuators (EMAs) were identified using a detailed nonlinear system model. While in hybrid configurations involving an EMA and a hydraulic actuator, dissimilar dynamics are the main source for a force fight, in the system at hand parameter deviations from the nominal state are crucial. A worst case study is performed to quantify the maximum resulting force fight paying special attention to wear causing increased gear backlash and <b>friction,</b> <b>sensor</b> uncertainties and signal delays. Moreover Monte Carlo simulations give insight in {{the likelihood of the}} event of excessive force fight assuming Gaussian and uniform distributions of the identified key parameters.

40|$|International audienceThere is a {{strategic}} {{importance for the}} steel rolling industry {{to get a better}} understanding of the strip–roll interaction to improve roll-gap models, increase strip quality and decrease roll degradation. This requires roll-gap sensors able to measure this interaction under industrial rolling conditions and in real time in order to propose a feed-back control of process parameters. To reach these goals, this paper proposes a new roll-gap <b>friction</b> <b>sensor</b> based on an inverse method that interprets optical fiber Bragg gratings(FBG) strain measurements under the roll surface (fully embedded), which enables to evaluate contact stresses with very short computation times, compatible with real time interpretation. This elastic inverse method is analytical and relies on plane-strain and isothermal assumptions. The experimental apparatus is detailed, technical issues are clearly exposed as well as calibration procedures. Several pilot cold rolling tests have been performed at various rolling speeds and different strip thicknesses in order to demonstrate the industrial feasibility. Resulting evaluations of contact stresses are then compared with numerical simulations.

Furthermore, non-collocation {{of the force}} sensors and the point of interaction results in shunt dynamics that degrade the interaction force estimation. In this paper, a method is presented to model, identify and compensate for the influence of shunt dynamics. Furthermore, a recently developed two-layer approach that enforces passivity in the time domain is implemented and evaluated in a practical setup that is dedicated for application in surgery.

Since friction is generally velocity-dependent and controlled mechanical systems are often only equipped with position <b>sensors,</b> <b>friction</b> compensation requires velocity estimation. Here, a reduced-order linear observer is used for this purpose. For exact friction compensation, design criteria {{in terms of the}} controller and observer parameter settings guaranteeing global exponential stability of the set-point are proposed. Moreover, for non-exact friction compensation it is shown that undercompensation leads to the existence of an equilibrium set and overcompensation leads to limit cycling. These results are obtained both numerically and experimentally...|$|R
40|$|DESIGN PROBLEM Existing {{elevator}} safety {{mechanisms are}} susceptible to variable friction conditions, which cause an inconsistent deceleration during emergency stops. The braking mechanism provides a constant normal force, which means the braking force and subsequent deceleration are proportional to the varying coefficient of friction (μ) between the brakes and the rail. Our goal is to design and manufacture a proof-of-concept prototype for a mechanically self-adjusting safety that produces a constant deceleration (0. 6 ± 0. 05 g) in spite of variable friction conditions (0. 15 < μ < 0. 25) during emergency stops. FINAL DESIGN The selected final design uses a rotating cam {{that acts as a}} <b>friction</b> <b>sensor</b> and as a brake. A vertical spring is attached to the cam and it provides a moment to help maintain constant contact with the rail and to oppose the upward and horizontal forces from the rail. The cam is contained in a wedge-shaped frame similar to the wedge on the existing design and a U-spring produces a compressive normal force on the frame. As a result, when μ increases the cam rotates upward and its radius (pivot-to-rail) decreases, which decreases the normal force. The inverse relationship between μ and the normal force results in a constant braking force and constant deceleration. Rather than contacting the rail directly, the cam contacts a brake shoe via a set of teeth (à la a rack-and-pinion mechanism). The brake shoe allows for a larger braking surface to help dissipate heat and contact forces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Hip joint wear {{simulators}} {{are used}} extensively {{to simulate the}} dynamic behaviour of the human hip joint and, through the wear rate, gain a concrete indicator about the overall wear performance of different coupled bearings. Present knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of important concurrent indicators, such as the coefficient of friction, could prove helpful for the continuing improvement in applied biomaterials. A limited number of commercial or custom-made simulators have been designed specifically for friction studies but always separately from wear tests; thus, analysis of these two important parameters has remained unconnected. As a result, a new <b>friction</b> <b>sensor</b> has been designed, built, and integrated in a commercial biaxial rocking motion hip simulator. The {{aim of this study}} is to verify the feasibility of an experimental set-up in which the dynamic measurement of the friction factor could effectively be implemented in a standard wear test without compromising its general accuracy and repeatability. A short wear test was run with the new set-up for 16106 cycles. In particular, three soft-bearings (metal-on-polyethylene, W 5 28 mm) were tested; during the whole test, axial load and frictional torque about the vertical loading axis were synchronously recorded in order to calculate the friction factor. Additional analyses were performed on the specimens, before and after the test, in order to verify the accuracy of the wear test. The average friction factor was 0. 110 ¡ 0. 025. The friction sensors showed good accuracy and repeatability throughout. This innovative set-up was able to reproduce stable and reliable measurements. The results obtained encourage further investigations of this set-up for long-term assessment and using different combinations of materials...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of flow {{separation}} is very essential for proper understanding of both {{external and internal}} aerothermodynamics of bodies. Because of unique flow features such as thick boundary layers, merged shock layers, strong entropy layers, {{flow separation}} in the flow field of bodies at hypersonic speeds, is both complex as well as interesting. The problem of flow separation is further complicated at very high stagnation enthalpies because of the real gas effects. Notwithstanding the plethora of information available in open literature even for simple geometric configurations the experimentally determined locations of flow separation and re-attachment points do not match well with {{the results from the}} computational studies even at hypersonic laminar flow conditions. In this backdrop the main aim of the present study is to generate a reliable experimental database of classical separated flow features around generic configurations at hypersonic laminar flow conditions. In the present study, flow visualization using high speed camera, surface convective heat transfer rate measurements using platinum thin film sensors, and direct skin friction measurements using PZT crystals have been carried out for characterizing the separated flow field around backward facing step, double cone and double wedge models. The numerical simulations by solving the Navier-Stokes equations have also been carried out to complement the experimental studies. The generic models selected in the present study are simple configurations, where most of the classical hypersonic separated flow features of two-dimensional, axi-symmetric and three dimensional flow fields can be observed. All the experiments are carried out in IISc hypersonic shock tunnel (HST 2) at Mach 5. 75 and 7. 6. For present study, helium and air have been used as the driver and test gases respectively. The high speed schlieren flow visualization is carried out on backward facing step (2 and 3 mm step height), double cone (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350 and 250 / 680) and double wedge (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350) models by using high speed camera (Phantom 7. 1). From the visualized shockwave structure in the flow field the flow reattachment point after separation has been clearly identified for backward facing step, double cone and double wedge models at hypersonic Mach numbers while the separation point could not be clearly identified because of the low free stream density in shock tunnels. However the flow visualization studies helped clearly identifying the region of flow separation on the model. Based on the results from the flow visualization studies both the physical location and distribution of platinum thin film gauges was finalized for the heat transfer rate measurements. Surface heat transfer rates along the length of two backward facing step (2 and 3 mm step height) models have been measured using platinum thin film gauges deposited on Macor substrate. The Eckert reference temperature method is used along the flat plate for predicting the heat flux distribution. Theoretical analysis of heat flux distribution down stream of the backward facing step model has been carried out using Gai’s dimensional analysis. The study reveals {{for the first time that}} at moderate stagnation enthalpy levels (~ 2 MJ/kg) the hypersonic separated flow around a backward facing step reattaches rather smoothly without any sudden spikes in the measured values of surface heat transfer rates. Based on the measured surface heating rates on the backward facing step, the reattachment distance was estimated to be approximately 10 and 8 step heights downstream of 2 and 3 mm step respectively at nominal Mach number of 7. 6. Convective surface heat transfer experiments have also been carried out on axi-symmetric double cone models (semi-apex angles of 15 / 35  and 25 / 68 ), which is analogous to the Edney’s shock interactions of Type VI and Type IV respectively. The flow is unsteady on the double cone model of 25 / 68  and measured heat flux is not constant. The heat transfer experiments were also carried out on the three-dimensional double wedge model (semi-apex angles of 15 / 35 ). The separation and reattachment points have been clearly identified from the experimental heat transfer measurements. It has been observed that the measured heat transfer rates on the double wedge model is less than the double cone model (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350) for the identical experimental conditions at the same gauge locations. This difference could be due to the three-dimensional entropy relieving effects of double wedge model. PZT- 5 H piezoelectric based skin friction gauge is developed and used for direct skin friction measurements in hypersonic shock tunnel (HST 2). The bare piezoelectric PZT- 5 H elements (5 mm × 5 mm with thickness of 0. 75 mm) polarized in the shear mode have been used as a skin friction gauge by operating the sensor in the parallel shear mode direction. The natural frequency of the skin <b>friction</b> <b>sensor</b> is ~ 80 kHz, which is suitable for impulse facilities. The direct skin friction measurements are carried out on flat plate, backward facing step (2 mm step height) and double wedge models. The measured value of skin friction coefficient (integrated over an area of 25 sq. mm; sensor surface area) at a distance of 23 mm from the leading edge of the sharp leading edge backward facing step model is found to be ~ 0. 0043 while it decreases to ~ 0. 003 at a distance of 43 mm from the leading edge at a stagnation enthalpy of ~ 2 MJ/kg. The measured skin friction matches with the Eckert reference temperature within ± 10 %. The skin friction coefficient is also measured on the double wedge at a distance of 73 mm from the tip of the first wedge along the surface and is found to be 4. 56 × 10 - 3. Viscous flow numerical simulations are carried out on two-dimensional backward facing step, axi-symmetric double cone and three-dimensional double wedge models using ANSYS-CFX 5. 7 package. Navier-Stokes Simulations are carried out at Mach 5. 75 and 7. 6 using second order accurate (both in time and space) high resolution scheme. The flow is assumed to be laminar and steady throughout the model length except on the double cone (semi-apex angles of 250 / 680) model configuration, which represents the unsteady flow geometry. Analogous Edney Type VI and Type IV shock interactions are observed on double cone, double wedge (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350) and double cone (semi-apex angles of 250 / 680) models respectively from the CFD results. Experimentally measured convective heat transfer rates on the above models are compared with the numerical simulation results. The numerical simulation results matches well with the experimental heat transfer data in the attached flow regions. Considerable differences are observed between the measured surface heat transfer rates and numerical simulations both in the separated flow region and on the second cone/wedge surfaces. The separation and reattachment points can be clearly identified from both experimental measurements and numerical simulations. The results from the numerical simulations are also compared with results from the high speed flow visualization experiments. The experimental database of surface convective heating rates, direct skin friction coefficient and shockwave structure in laminar hypersonic flow conditions will be very useful for validating CFD code...|$|E

In this project, a wheel based tire-road friction coefficient measurement system is first developed for snowplows. Unlike a traditional Norse meter, this system is based on {{measurement of}} lateral tire forces, has minimal moving parts and does not use any actuators. Hence, it is reliable and inexpensive. A key challenge is quickly detecting changes in estimated tire-road friction coefficient while rejecting the high levels of noise in measured force signals. Novel filtering and signal processing algorithms are developed to address this challenge including a biased quadratic mean filter and an accelerometer based vibration removal filter. Detailed experimental results are presented on the performance of the friction estimation system on different types of road surfaces. Experimental results show that the biased quadratic mean filter works very effectively to eliminate the influence of noise and quickly estimate changes in friction coefficient. Further, the use of accelerometers and an intelligent algorithm enables elimination of the influence of driver steering maneuvers, thus providing a robust friction measurement system.

In the roll gap we can observe the following: changes of rolling pressure, changes of relative velocity, influences of oxides and lubrication, etc. When taking into account all conditions mentioned above the determination of the boundary conditions is not trivial and extensive measurements are necessary. Therefore, this thesis is dealing with design of temperature and force sensors specified for the determination of friction coefficient and heat transfer coefficient in contact. The temperature sensor with an installed thermocouple measures subsurface temperature for a given depth; and then the inverse heat conduction task is used to compute temperature and heat flux on the surface.

At the same time, difficulties have been found to apply these models {{due to the lack of}} knowledge existing about the mechanical parameters of the bulk materials that are required by the theoretical models. So an ambitious set of bulk materials tests have been designed to get such parameters with enough accuracy. Nowadays the simulation of silo explosions is not one of the research team objectives, however tests include determination of parameters of the bulk material related with the analysis of explosions, which anyway are necessary to a proper design of installations for protection and prevention. Finally, three experimental silos have been erected. They are cylindrical of 1. 9 m in diameter and 5 m in height of the vertical wall, with emptying hoppers designed with three different eccentricities. The wall has been made of smooth steel, with enough thickness and reinforcements to be considered rigid. Specially designed sensors have been fixed in these silos, in order to measure the horizontal pressure and the friction force between the wall and the bulk solid. The horizontal pressure cells measure the deflection of a circular thin plate by means of four strain gauges, and the <b>friction</b> forces <b>sensor</b> measure the deformation of a small cantilever beam by two strain gauges. Although the research work is now in progress, the first results are hopeful and our research team wish to help in better understanding of these interesting structures...|$|R
40|$|A hinge {{specifically}} designed for continuous friction measurements during ice skating was tested and used. The hinge can handle large vertical normal forces to simulate {{the weight of a}} real person on a skate, and is very flexible in the horizontal direction, so it deforms under a <b>friction</b> force. Two <b>sensors</b> on the hinge measure the deformation. Friction measurements were done with a part of a real skate, with varying temperatures, skating speeds and normal forces on the skate. A clear dependence of friction on temperature was found. Friction coefficients for an ice temperature of - 20 C and air temperature of - 10 C varied between 0. 04 and 0. 1, and coefficients for an ice temperature of - 10 C and air temperature of - 6 C varied from 0. 006 to 0. 016. The temperature of the skate was held at - 10 C for both cases. The results also suggest friction dependence on skating speed and normal force, but this has to be verified. During the calibration of the setup {{it was found that the}} vertical force, controlled by air pressure, could be determined up to a factor of 2. Furthermore there was a large variation (up to a factor 2) in friction coefficients from measurements under the same circumstances, on the same ice layer. These could have been caused by changing humidity in the setup, as this was not monitored during the measurements. The setup works, but needs to be improved for more precise friction measurements. A humidity sensor in the setup is recommended...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{integrated}} powertrain control for gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions is developed. First, a detailed model of an automotive powertrain featuring a twin clutch transmission is developed in Matlab/Simulink®. This model includes detailed friction {{models for the}} twin clutch that enable {{an investigation into the}} effects of different friction materials on the performance of the gearshift controller. The transmission model also includes detailed models of the synchronisers and thus allows a simulation of synchroniser-to-synchroniser shifts. A simplified phenomenological model, derived from a more complex non-linear model, is employed to model the hydraulic actuation of clutches and synchroniser. The thesis finds that the dependency of the friction coefficient on the sliding speed has an important influence on the gearshift quality and the performance of gearshift controller, while the absolute level of the friction coefficient is less important. Based on this powertrain model the key problems of gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions were identified and a control that overcomes these problems was developed. The first stage was to devise a gearshift control algorithm that handles single clutch-to-clutch shifts without a oneway (freewheeler-, overrunning-) clutch. This basic gearshift control algorithm featured a control of clutch slip for the engine torque transfer and a control of engine speed through engine torque manipulation (plus clutch pressure manipulation for downshifts). In a second stage, an optional transmission output torque control was developed that could be integrated in the basic control. The thesis shows that these control strategies are superior, in terms of shift quality, to conventional gearshift controls as used on planetary-type transmissions and are also robust against variations in the powertrain parameters (including <b>friction</b> coefficient) and <b>sensor</b> noise. The control strategies developed for single clutch-to-clutch shifts were extended to handle double and other multiple gearshifts that take place in the same transmission half. The thesis also investigates the other main part of gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions, the gear pre-selection. The thesis shows that, on power-on gearshifts, the torque reactions at the transmission output due to the gear pre-selection with conventional hydraulically actuated synchronisers can be effectively compensated for by a simple manipulation of engine torque.
