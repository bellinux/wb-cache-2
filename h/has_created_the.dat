5|$|IPA letters {{have been}} {{incorporated}} into the alphabets of various languages, notably via the Africa Alphabet in many sub-Saharan languages such as Hausa, Fula, Akan, Gbe languages, Manding languages, Lingala, etc. This <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> need for capital variants. For example, Kabiyè of northern Togo has Ɖ ɖ, Ŋ ŋ, Ɣ ɣ, Ɔ ɔ, Ɛ ɛ, Ʋ ʋ. These, and others, are supported by Unicode, but appear in Latin ranges other than the IPA extensions.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea {{was created}} as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes {{are the most}} recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> -long Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, {{view is that the}} hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well understood and extensively studied, the nature of hotspots themselves remains fairly enigmatic.|$|E
5|$|Together with Smith, Pinkett Smith <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation in Baltimore, Maryland, {{a charity}} {{which focuses on}} youth in urban inner cities and family support. Her aunt, Karen Banfield Evans, is the foundation's {{executive}} director. The charity was awarded the David Angell Humanitarian Award by The American Screenwriters Association (ASA) in 2006. The Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation has provided grants to non-profit organizations such as YouthBuild, and Pinkett Smith has made personal donations to organizations such as Capital K-9s.|$|E

5|$|After the Cortex Vortex, a {{space station}} owned by Doctor Neo Cortex, is {{destroyed}} by Doctor Nitrus Brio's laser beam device, pieces of the station crash into a tropical mountain. This sets free an entity known as Uka Uka, the mastermind behind Cortex's previous schemes. He derides Cortex for failing to retrieve the crystals and gems, {{both of which are}} vast sources of world energy. However, feeling generous after being freed from prison, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Nefarious Tropy to join him and Cortex in their latest plan. Tropy <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> Time-Twisting Machine, a time machine that allows the villains to travel through time to find more gems and crystals scattered across the timeline.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, Orci and Kurtzman {{confirmed}} to Variety {{that they are}} no longer going to work together on film projects but will still collaborate on television. Kurtzman wanted to work on the Spider-Man film franchise, while Orci was linked to the directorial role for Star Trek 3. Orci confirmed later that year in July that he was not involved in the production of The Amazing Spider-Man 3 alongside Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman's K/O Paper Products continues to operate as a production company within CBS Television Studios, and <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> series Scorpion inspired by the life of Walter O'Brien for the 2014-15 season and Limitless was created for the 2015-16 season from the 2011 film.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea {{has been}} created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> -long Hawaiian Ridge–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, {{view is that the}} hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied, there remains no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect.|$|E

5|$|Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano has {{its origins}} in {{continental}} rifting—a long rupture in the Earth's crust where the lithosphere is being pulled apart. This incipient rifting has formed {{as a result of}} the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create effusive eruptions. The rift zone has existed for at least 14.9million years, and <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Several dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active, with The Volcano being one of the three having erupted in the last few hundred years. Tseax Cone, which last erupted in the 18th century, is the southernmost volcano in the province, while Prindle Volcano in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted more than 10,000years ago, is generally considered the northernmost.|$|E
5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to {{get caught in the}} gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there {{does not appear to be}} any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.|$|E
5|$|They meet {{an old man}} who angrily {{tells them}} that there are no monsters and sends them to see his son, a {{geneticist}} named Francis Pollidori (John O'Hurley). Dr. Pollidori shows them his experiments studying the Hox gene using the fruit fly Drosophila. This presentation includes images of a fly with legs growing out of its mouth. He tells the agents that the same kind of experiment could, in theory, be performed on humans. Afterward, Mulder tells Scully that he believes that Dr. Pollidori, acting as a modern-day Victor Frankenstein, <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>The</b> Great Mutato. Later, Dr. Pollidori's wife Elizabeth (Miriam Smith) is knocked unconscious and is attacked {{in the same manner as}} Shaineh. At the crime scene, Mulder and Scully find a chemical residue from an agricultural agent used to anesthetize animals, which leads them to suspect Dr. Pollidori's father, who is a farmer. Dr. Pollidori comes to his father's house, angrily confronts him, and murders him. Later, Mutato, who lives with Pollidori Sr., finds his dead body and tearfully buries it in a barn.|$|E
