40|$|Drash and Tudor {{describe}} six sets {{of reinforcement}} contingencies {{which may be}} present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of some children eventually diagnosed with autism and suggest that these contingencies account for the etiology of “autistic” behaviors. Nevertheless, merely observing such contingencies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of these children is insufficient to establish {{a positive correlation between}} the contingencies and “autistic” behaviors, let alone a causal relationship. To demonstrate a positive correlation, it is necessary to present evidence that the relevant contingencies are present more often <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of children exhibiting these behaviors than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of children not exhibiting these behaviors. This condition has not been met, since no evidence to the effect that such contingencies are absent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of typical children or children with disabilities other than autism has been presented. <b>In</b> fact, <b>the</b> opposite appears to be true, as is argued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present commentary. It appears that Drash and Tudor's account of autism etiology is incomplete in that it neglects the role of unlearned differences between children and their possible interactions with <b>the</b> social <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> shaping “autistic” behaviors. Despite the misconception held by some that behavior analysis is a radically environmental approach, unlearned differences may be discussed within a behavioral framework. A “completely behavioral” account may discuss such differences in terms of susceptibility to reinforcement or punishment, speed of conditioning, or other unlearned characteristics which are potentially testable...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of AGN, <b>in</b> particular, <b>the</b> density of galaxies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN. This determines whether AGN trace dense environments at high redshifts and whether <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> are important <b>in</b> addressing <b>the</b> problem of radio-loud dichotomy. I extend my research by investigating whether star-formation evolves differently in high-redshift AGN <b>environments</b> compared to <b>the</b> field. I begin by investigating <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of 169 AGN using Spitzer data at z ??? 1. I investigate the source density of star-forming galaxies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of radio galaxies, radio-loud quasars and radio- quiet quasars. I do not find any significant overdensity of star-forming galaxies in these environments, although I find tentative evidence for a diff	erence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colours of galaxies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> radio galaxy <b>environments</b> compared to <b>the</b> quasar and field environments. I next use VIDEO data to investigate <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> quasars out to z ??? 3. Firstly, I use a training sample of QSOs and galaxies, which trains a neural network to detect QSOs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> VIDEO data. I detect 274 possible QSOs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> VIDEO data using this method. I am able to determine that {{the efficiency of the}} neural network clas- sification is 95 per cent using the training sample. I compare these results to a colour selection method, which detects 88 QSOs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> VIDEO data, and find that the neural network is able to detect ??? 80 per cent of the colour selected QSOs at Ks = 21. I then investigate the source overdensity using a radial analysis on <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> VIDEO QSOs. I find a significant overdensity of galaxies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> whole QSO sample and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> radio-loud quasars compared to the radio-quiet quasars. I extend the density analysis by using a second density measure, called the spatial clustering amplitude technique, to compare <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> quasars with their radio luminosities, absolute magnitudes and redshifts. I do not fi any significant correlations between environmental density and radio luminosity, absolute magnitude or redshift for the QSOs.
