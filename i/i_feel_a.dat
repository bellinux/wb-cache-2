25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> <b>a</b> humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want {{nothing more than a}} little peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal with}} screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the release}} of Return of the Jedi, the name Jabba the Hutt has become synonymous in American mass media with repulsive obesity.

[...] Likewise, in the novel Steps and Exes: A Novel of Family (2000), Laura Kalpakian uses Jabba the Hutt to emphasize {{the weight of a}} character's father: [...] "The girls used to call Janice's parents Jabba the Hutt and the Wookiee. But then Jabba (Janice's father) died, and it didn't seem right to speak of the dead on those terms."

500|$|Millar did {{not like}} the first draft of the screenplay, {{considering}} that the approach was [...] "too tame" [...] and [...] "a little bit Americanized" [...] given he wanted [...] "basically be the opposite of the Spider-Man movie, the idea of someone getting powers and realizing they can do what they want, then choosing the dark path." [...] The author only started to support the direction the project was taking once Bekmambetov [...] "came in with his Eastern European madness" [...] and the intention of coming closer to the spirit of the book. Bekmambetov said that he would take liberty in adapting the comic book's world: [...] "It’s difficult for me to just follow.

500|$|Still, the United States made a push to {{have the}} orders placed in an American shipyard. The American {{government}} sent Henry Prather Fletcher {{to be the new}} minister to Chile in September 1910. Fletcher had successfully implemented President William Howard Taft's [...] "Dollar Diplomacy" [...] policy in China. He met with resistance, which he attributed to lingering sentiment from the 1891 Baltimore Crisis: [...] "My advances in the matter have not been met with frankness or encouragement and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> spirit of covert opposition. Under a very polite and courteous exterior there still exists a feeling of soreness towards us." [...] The US naval attaché opined that, barring anything short of a revolution, the contracts would be given to the British. Indeed, the bidding process specified ships very close to the armament and armor mounted on recent British warships. Fletcher asked for an extension to the bidding process so that American shipbuilding firms could tailor proposals to these requirements, and this was granted.|$|E
500|$|These letters set {{the tone}} for Tchaikovsky's {{relationship}} with Balakirev over the next two years. At the end of this period, in 1869, Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Having written his first symphony and an opera, he next composed a symphonic poem entitled Fatum. Initially pleased with the piece when Nikolai Rubinstein conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in Saint Petersburg. Fatum received only a lukewarm reception there. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in Fatum but also gave some encouragement. He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as [...] "precious to me as a sign of your sympathy towards me—and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> great weakness for you". Tchaikovsky was too self-critical not to see the truth behind these comments. He accepted Balakirev's criticism, and the two continued to correspond. Tchaikovsky would later destroy the score of Fatum. (The score would be reconstructed posthumously by using the orchestral parts.) ...|$|E

It was also included on their tenth studio album, <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>a</b> Song (1974), and released by Buddah Records on March 14, 1975 in a 7" [...] single format. Due to the inclusion of [...] "Try to Remember", the song features additional writing by Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt. Alex Henderson from AllMusic was surprised regarding their version, calling it an [...] "unlikely remake". He further critiqued Knight's [...] "ironic" [...] spoken monologue on the track by assuming she's [...] "reflecting on the nostalgia that seems to be human nature".

500|$|As with 1989's album Like a Prayer, Madonna's {{hair was}} dyed dark brown to signify [...] "seriousness", {{and on the}} cover of the album Madonna wore a beret while resurrecting the famous Guerrillero Heroico image of Guevara. In an {{interview}} with Veja magazine, she described Guevara as [...] "an icon instantaneously identified with an revolution spirit. That goes for the whole album: the current moment, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> revolutionary state of mind". Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández wrote in his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Subcultural Transformations, that the inclusion of Guevara as an inspiration for the cover was one of the many instances of Madonna incorporating Hispanic identity and the Latino subculture in her work. Because of the paramilitary theme, the dyed hair and the artistic composition, was compared with an infamous seventies photo of kidnapped newspaper heiress, Patty Hearst. The cover also had military styled stenciled lettering. The word [...] "American Life" [...] is written in blood red color and has a punk-rock style. Inside the CD booklet, she wielded an Uzi submachine gun, her body in various martial art poses, spelling out her name. By late 2003, she had wiped out the military image completely, and followed with another subtle toned-down image of that of a writer and philanthropist.|$|E

[...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before.

The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> little bit more complete."

500|$|Led by league MVP Tittle, {{who passed}} for over 3,000yards and 36 touchdowns, the Giants had an 11–3 record in 1963. They set what remains the NFL's {{record for most}} points in a 14-game season by scoring 448. They {{advanced}} to face the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field, New York's defense played well, but Chicago's newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times (including one returned for a score) and injured Tittle {{in the first half}} (though he finished the game). Several Giants players including linebacker Huff pleaded with Sherman to replace the hobbled Tittle, who the players felt was pressing and committing too many turnovers, from playing the second half. Sherman however, had little alternative. [...] "The old man kept saying 'I can do it. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> little better'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] "We had a young quarterback (Glynn Griffing), he had gone to get married a couple of weeks earlier but failed to come back in the days he said he would. We couldn't use him." [...] The Giants defense, led by Hall of Famer Huff, held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat. New York had a chance to take a 14–0 lead in the first quarter but wide receiver Del Shofner dropped a potential touchdown in the end zone, a drop he said in 2010, that he feels would have won the Giants the game. [...] "I was alone in the end zone—ball right into my hands, nobody around me—and I dropped the ball...as good a defense as we had that year, I don't think the Berar would have ever come back from being down 14–0." [...] On the next play, Tittle threw an interception to Chicago linebacker Larry Morris, which he returned to the New York five-yard line. Two plays later, the Bears tied the game.|$|E
