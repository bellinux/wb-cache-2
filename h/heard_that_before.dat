25|$|GIULIANI: That's {{really an}} {{extraordinary}} statement. That's an extraordinary statement, {{as someone who}} lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>before,</b> and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that.|$|E
500|$|Diane Warren wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] in 1995. When {{asked about}} her songwriting process, she said that songs usually come to her from a title, a chorus, or a drum beat. [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] was {{conceived}} from its title, and, according to Warren, [...] "it popped into my head, and I thought, 'I don't think I've <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>before,</b> that's kind of interesting.' I started playing around on the piano with these chords and did a key change, and then I knew, 'OK, this is magic.'" [...] Warren further explained that she wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] as a ballad and dance song, {{because that was the}} way she heard it. She said: [...] "some people only know it as a – gay – dance song!" ...|$|E

Stevens said, [...] "I thought, music for God? I'd never <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> – I'd heard of music for money, music for fame, music for personal power, but music for God!" ...|$|E

2500|$|During the debate, Congressman Paul {{commented that}} America's history of interventionism in the Middle East {{has led to}} an unpopular view of the U.S. in Middle Eastern countries, and argued that the CIA's removal of Iranian leader Mohammed Mosaddeq in Operation Ajax, the Iraq war and the bombing of Iraq in the 1990s had led to {{increasing}} anti-American sentiment in the Middle East and promoted terrorism. When the moderator asked if Paul was suggesting that the US had [...] "invited" [...] the 9/11 attacks, Paul argued with fellow candidate Rudy Giuliani, who responded to Paul's suggestion that the U.S. pay attention to the underlying causes of terrorism by saying [...] "I don't think I've <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>before,</b> and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that." [...] Paul responded that terrorists were the result of [...] "blowback" [...] from poor foreign policy, and that they [...] "don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free, they come and attack us because we're over there." ...|$|E

60|$|In an easy-chair {{opposite}} to me my listener sat and listened {{for two hours}} every evening. I interested myself by watching and attempting to analyze the expressions on his face, but what these appeared to indicate made no difference in my remarks. I do not think he liked repetitions, but if I chose to tell a thing several times, I did so. He {{had no right to}} tell me that he had <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>before.</b> Immunity from this remark was to me a rare enjoyment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>before.</b> No wonder smut is {{the worst}} trouble for wheat-raisers in the Northwest. I've fields {{literally}} full of smut. An' we never are rid of it. One farmer has one idea, an' some one else another. What could be of greater importance to a farmer? We're at war. The men who claim to know say that wheat will win the war. An' we lose millions of bushels from this smut. That's to say it's a terrible fact to face. I'd like to get your ideas." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Can't you?" [...] drawled Carter. [...] "I am {{not exactly}} surprised. I must say {{he does not}} snore but I believe it is because he is too crazy to sleep. He waylaid me on the poop just now and said {{something}} about evil communications corrupting good manners. Seems to me I've <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>before.</b> Queer thing to say. He {{tried to make it}} out somehow that if he wasn't corrupt it wasn't your fault. As if this was any concern of mine. He's as mad as he's fat--or else he puts it on." [...] Carter laughed a little and leaned his shoulders against a bulkhead.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{must say}} I began to bristle at being spoken to like that. I'm as {{proud of being}} an American as anybody can be, but I don't like {{the home of the}} free thrown into my teeth every time I open my mouth. There's no knowing what money Jone and I have lost through giving orders to London cabmen in what is called our American accent. The minute we tell the driver of a hansom where we want to go, that place doubles its {{distance}} from the spot we start from. Now I think the great reason Jone's rumbling worked so well was that it had in it a sort of Great British chest-sound, as if his lungs was rusty. The waiter had <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> and knew what it meant. If he had spoken out in the clear American fashion I expect his voice would have gone clear through the waiter without his knowing it, like the person in the story, whose neck was sliced through and who didn't know it until he sneezed and his head fell off.|$|E
60|$|Belding's {{unhappiness}} {{could hardly}} be laid to material loss. He had been rich and was now poor, but change of fortune such as {{that could not have}} made him unhappy. Something more somber and mysterious and sad than the loss of Dick Gale and their friends had come into the lives of his wife and Nell. He dated the time of this change back to a certain day when Mrs. Belding recognized in the elder Chase an old schoolmate and a rejected suitor. It took time for slow-thinking Belding to discover anything wrong in his household, especially as the fact of the Gales lingering there made Mrs. Belding and Nell, for the most part, hide their real and deeper feelings. Gradually, however, Belding had forced on him the fact of some secret cause for grief other than Gale's loss. He was sure of it when his wife signified her desire to make a visit to her old home back in Peoria. She did not give many reasons, but she did show him a letter that had found its way from old friends. This letter contained news {{that may or may not}} have been authentic; but it was enough, Belding thought, to interest his wife. An old prospector had returned to Peoria, and he had told relatives of meeting Robert Burton at the Sonoyta Oasis fifteen years before, and that Burton had gone into the desert never to return. To Belding this was no surprise, for he had <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> his marriage. There appeared to have been no doubts as to the death of his wife's first husband. The singular thing was that both Nell's father and grandfather had been lost somewhere in the Sonora Desert.|$|E

6000|$|Rear-Admiral Schley and Representative Charles F. Joy were {{standing}} near the Peace Monument, in Washington, discussing the question, Is success a failure?
