500|$|Reynolds was {{incorporated}} in 1971 as Reynolds Securities {{in advance of}} an initial public offering. [...] By early 1971, there was speculation that Merrill Lynch would sell shares to the public. [...] Reynolds initial public offering (and shortly thereafter <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter's</b> IPO) {{was part of a}} rush of Wall Street firms to sell an interest in their privately held businesses to public investors, following Merrill Lynch's initial public offering. [...] In 1976, Reynolds implements REYCOM, the most sophisticated high-speed wire system in the industry. [...] Meanwhile, the firm was continuing its expansion, acquiring its first international offices in Lugano and Lausanne, Switzerland. [...] A year later, Reynolds acquired Baker Weeks & Co. whose strength was securities research.|$|R

5|$|Prior to its {{merger with}} Morgan Stanley, <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds was a diversified {{financial}} services organization {{that provided a}} broad range of investment and consumer credit and investment products and services. <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> operated in two lines of business: securities (including investment banking) and credit services and its operations were primarily focused on the U.S.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its merger with <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> in 1978, Reynolds Securities had over 3,100 {{employees}} in 72 offices producing gross revenues of nearly $120 million.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Ninth Circuit {{had not had}} to rule on {{the problem}} before, it was a {{question}} of first impression for the panel. Citing precedential holdings that a federal court has the sole jurisdiction to decide the essential issues to a federal securities claim, Goodwin felt that not permitting intertwining might frustrate both the goals of speedy dispute resolution, which he believed the FAA was intended to promote, and the preservation of access to the federal courts. [...] "The 1925 Arbitration Act certainly did not anticipate the Supreme Court's 1953 determination that the protective intent of federal securities laws was to take priority over the economic advantages of arbitration," [...] he wrote, concluding that the district court's denial of <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter's</b> motion was proper.|$|R
5000|$|Blyth {{worked for}} {{financier}} Louis Sloss & Co. in 1910, {{where he met}} coworker <b>Dean</b> G. <b>Witter.</b> The Federal Reserve Act of December 1913 made Sloss unprofitable, and the company filed bankruptcy on April 1, 1914. One week later, Witter and Blyth formed the investment banking partnership Blyth Witter & Co., and asked other Sloss coworkers George Leib and Roy Shurtleff to join them as partners. Blyth, Witter and Shurtleff each owned two shares in the company, at $100 per share. Sloss colleague John D. [...] "Jack" [...] Hartigan was hired as an employee, to sell bonds. The company's young file clerk, Frank Weeden, would later pioneer the [...] "Third market" [...] of over-the-counter trading. The initial funding was composed of $50,000 loaned from the Bank of California, $10,000 loaned from Witter's mother, and whatever price Blyth got for selling his car. Blyth Witter was formally established on April 18, 1914, based out of offices in the Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco. Sloss aided the new firm with a gift of his office furniture and his customer files.|$|R
5|$|<b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> was {{the first}} big {{brokerage}} company {{to get into the}} online trading business when it bought a small San Francisco-based outfit called Lombard Brokerage in 1996.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, {{he became}} {{co-owner}} of a jazz club and bar that operated seasonally in Maine; {{he spent the}} off-season acting on stage in southern California. He auditioned for the television series M*A*S*H (1972–83) without success. By 1980, he was working in Los Angeles as an actor, appearing in films, television programs, live performances, and commercials. He portrayed roles in commercials for stock brokerage firms <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter,</b> as the company spokesman, and Paine Webber, as an executive.|$|E
5|$|Herbert L. Mitchell, Jr. (June 18, 1937– January 4, 2011), {{credited}} as Herb Mitchell {{and sometimes}} Herb L. Mitchell, was an American actor, director, and teacher. He was a stockbroker before {{he made the}} switch to acting, appearing in films; stage plays such as The Fiddler on the Roof, in which he played the lead role of Tevye; television shows including The Practice, on which he had a recurring role; and commercials, including ones for stock brokerage firms <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds and Paine Webber. He was married twice and had five children.|$|E
25|$|Discover {{was part}} of <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter,</b> and then Morgan Stanley, until 2007, when Discover Financial Services became an {{independent}} company. Novus was once the major processing center that partnered with the company. The Novus logo was retired, replaced by the Discover Network logo.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the appellate}} court {{decision}} had created a conflict among the circuits, the Supreme Court granted certiorari later in 1984. It heard oral arguments in December. Eugene Bell, a cofounder of the Los Angeles firm Jones Bell, argued for <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter,</b> while Eric V. Benham argued for Byrd. Lawyers for the Securities Industry Association filed an amicus curiae brief urging reversal.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, the Court {{once again}} heard a {{securities}} dispute where arbitrability {{was the central}} question. In <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd a brokerage firm sought to compel a client to arbitrate state-law fraud claims as Southland had required; the client resisted citing the need to avoid needless bifurcation. The Court held unanimously that the strong pro-arbitration policy it had found in the FAA in Moses Cone required that split.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 A. Lamar Byrd, {{a dentist}} in Southern California, sold his {{practice}} and invested the $160,000 proceeds with <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds, a retail brokerage firm. Over {{the next several}} months his account lost more than half its value; he alleged that his broker represented to him that the account was profiting. Byrd claimed that the broker was using his account to churn, or making trades primarily to generate commissions for himself.|$|E
25|$|Gardner {{worked to}} become a top trainee at <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds. He arrived at the office early and stayed late each day, {{persistently}} making calls to prospective clients with his goal being 200 calls per day. His perseverance paid off when, in 1982, Gardner passed his Series 7 Exam {{on the first try}} and became a full employee of the firm. Eventually, Gardner was recruited by Bear Stearns & Company in San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|The {{stockbroker}} {{in the red}} Ferrari was a {{man named}} Bob Bridges. He met with Gardner and gave him {{an introduction to the}} world of finance. Bridges organized meetings between Gardner and branch managers at the major stock brokerage firms that offered training programs—such as Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber, E.F. Hutton, <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds and Smith Barney. For the following two months, Gardner cancelled or postponed his sales appointments and his car amassed parking tickets while he met with managers.|$|E
25|$|Gardner {{returned}} home from jail to find his apartment empty. With no experience, no college education, virtually no connections, and with the same casual outfit he had been wearing {{on the day he}} was taken into custody, Gardner gained a position in <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds' stock brokerage training program. However, this offered no salary; apart from selling medical equipment that brought in 300–400 dollars a month in the early 1980s, and with no savings, he was unable to meet his living expenses.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether claims under the 1934 Act were likewise exempt from the Federal Arbitration Act had first been raised in a 1974 case, Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Inc.. At that time Potter Stewart had found them not relevant to the case and upheld the arbitration order {{on the grounds that}} the case involved an international dispute. They had resurfaced in the previous term, in Justice Byron White's concurrence in <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd. Lower courts began embracing White's analysis, eventually creating a conflict in the circuits on appeal.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the Discover Card was introduced, Sears was the largest {{retailer}} in the United States. It had purchased the <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds brokerage organization and Coldwell, Banker & Company (real estate) in 1981 {{as an attempt to}} add financial services to its portfolio of customer services. Ray Kennedy, Sr, father of country singer Ray Kennedy and the credit manager for Sears, conceived the card. Together with the Discover Card (and its issuing bank, the Greenwood Trust Company, owned by Sears), this was named the Sears Financial Network. Early Discover Cards bore a small embossed symbol representing the Sears Tower, then the company's headquarters.|$|E
25|$|His client {{agreement}} with <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> included a standard arbitration clause, {{by which the}} parties agreed to use that method to settle any disputes. However, it was limited by the Supreme Court's 1953 holding in Wilko v. Swan, another case in which an investor had sued a broker alleging fraud and the broker had responded with a motion to compel contractually mandated arbitration per the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) passed in 1925. The plaintiff had sued under the Securities Act of 1933, under which any provision mandating that an investor waive their right to sue was prohibited. A 7–2 majority found the latter statute was controlling.|$|E
25|$|Moore {{returned}} to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected {{to serve as a}} Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening {{as the result of the}} policy of Margaret Thatcher, then Secretary of State for Education.|$|E
25|$|Four other {{circuits}} accepted this. In Conover v. <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> Reynolds, the Ninth Circuit examined White's critique at length. Judge Mary M. Schroeder looked {{beyond the}} text of the statutes to the accompanying legislative history. When Congress had overhauled the 1934 Act in 1975, the conference committee report had contained statements referring to Wilko and making it clear that the conferees did not intend to require arbitration. She reiterated the concern that arbitration did not fully safeguard the rights of an unsophisticated investor, and noted that the right to sue was so well established by case law that an implied cause of action was not necessary.|$|E
25|$|Morgan Stanley had offices {{located on}} 24 floors across {{buildings}} 2 and 5 of the World Trade Center in New York City. These offices had been inherited from <b>Dean</b> <b>Witter</b> which had occupied the space since the mid-1980s. The firm lost thirteen employees during the September 11 attacks in 2001 (Thomas F. Swift, Wesley Mercer, Jennifer de Jesus, Joseph DiPilato, Nolbert Salomon, Godwin Forde, Steve R. Strauss, Lindsay C. Herkness, Albert Joseph, Jorge Velazquez, Titus Davidson, Charles Laurencin and Security Director Rick Rescorla) in the towers, while 2,687 were successfully evacuated by Rick Rescorla. The surviving employees moved to temporary {{headquarters in the}} vicinity. In 2005 Morgan Stanley moved 2,300 of its employees back to lower Manhattan, {{at that time the}} largest such move.|$|E

500|$|Dean Witter's core {{securities}} {{business and}} its Discover business generated combined revenue of $59 billion in 1992 and Sears {{announced that it}} would seek to monetize its investment.
