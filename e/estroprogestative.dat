40|$|Acne is a multifactorial {{disorder}} affecting {{the vast majority}} of adolescents and young adults. Among the therapeutic armamentum, <b>estroprogestative</b> contraception can be offered to young women. The choice must, however, be carefully targeted because the <b>estroprogestative</b> associations do not show similar anti-acne efficacy. A new contraceptive associating 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol and 100 micrograms of levonorgestrel (Lowette) has proven its clinical efficacy in this indication. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether oral or vaginal administration of contraceptive hormones might affect antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels. DESIGN: Prospective trial with women recruited by advertisement. Women who wished contraception were randomized between oral or vaginal <b>estroprogestative</b> contraception, {{and those who}} did not choose contraception were included in the control group. SETTING: Fertility clinic of a tertiary university hospital. PATIENT(S) : Twenty-four young, healthy volunteer women with regular cycles who had received no hormonal contraception for at least 3 months before the study. INTERVENTION(S) : Oral or vaginal <b>estroprogestative</b> contraception from day 5 to 25 of a menstrual cycle versus no contraception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Intercycle and intracycle variations of serum AMH levels in normally ovulating volunteers and following the initiation of oral or vaginal <b>estroprogestative</b> contraception. RESULT(S) : Fluctuations of AMH levels observed during the menstrual cycle remained within cycle-to-cycle variability in cycling controls and in women receiving oral or vaginal contraception. CONCLUSION(S) : Our findings confirm that AMH levels remain steady during the menstrual cycle and indicate that they are unaffected by exogenous sex steroids used for contraception whether administered orally or vaginally...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWomen who had gestational {{diabetes}} {{must have}} their glycemia closely checked after delivery to insure complete normalization. Few studies are published but breast feeding {{does not seem}} to modify the metabolic profile of the mother or the children. Contraception must take account associated risk factors. Very few studies are published and none notified a significant modification of the carbohydrate metabolism with hormonal contraception, either <b>estroprogestative</b> or progestative only. But associated obesity, hypertension or dyslipidemia need the prescription of a contraception with no vascular secondary effect. In these cases an intrauterine device represents a very good choice...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjective > The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the ă reasons given by women who have changed or suspended their contraceptive ă method in 2013. What influence had the 3 rd and 4 th generation ă <b>estroprogestatives</b> (EP) French controversy and advices from doctors? Did ă they notice any consequences of the controversy on their lifestyle? Did ă they feel an impact on their behavior to health professionals? ă Methods > A study was conducted on women of childbearing age. Data ă collection took place between November 4 and December 16, 2013. The ă included subjects were between 18 and 55 years old females. Subjects ă were surveyed through an anonymous self-administered questionnaire ă distributed through pharmacies. The protocol called for the construction ă of clusters of subjects by having heard about, or not, of the ă controversy. Patients reporting having heard about the controversy have ă formed the ``exposed'' group while the others have formed the ă ``unexposed'' group. We compared two parameters between these two ă groups: the rate of subjects who reported having modified or suspended ă their contraceptive method in 2013 on one hand, and the rate of subjects ă who reported having made a change in their contraceptive method without ă or against advices from a doctor on the other hand. ă Results > The sample included 988 subjects. The average age was 34 ă years. The level of exposure to media debates was 86. 5 %. Of the ă respondents, 19. 8 % were under 3 rd or 4 th generation EP in 2012, thus ă directly involved in the discussions and affected by health ă recommendations. Of the patients, 38. 5 % reported having changed their ă contraception in 2013. In these women, when they confirmed having heard ă about the controversy, 40. 1 % of them claimed to have conducted this ă process without or against advices from a doctor. This number dropped to ă 18. 2 % for those who had not heard of it. Media coverage of the 3 rd and ă 4 th generation EP vascular risk was not mentioned more by patients who ă suspended all medical contraceptive method than it was by patients who ă simply changed their method. In all, 52. 1 % of women who completely ă stopped their contraception indicated that this choice was at least ă partly due to a change in their sexuality or reproductive life. This ă reason was evoked only in 19. 0 % of women who have simply made a change ă of contraceptive method. Among the views of women, the EP controversy ă was one of the reasons for a change of contraception method in 41. 8 % of ă cases, while advices from a doctor did play a role in 19. 9 % of cases. ă One has seen a decline of 11. 0 % of oral contraception between 2012 and ă 2013, almost superimposed on that of oral 3 rd and 4 th generation EP ă (10. 6 %). However, the use of 1 st and 2 nd generation EP stagnated: their ă increase was 0. 4 %. Beyond any change of contraceptive method, 66. 9 % of ă women expressed the absence of any impact of the controversy on their ă behavior. Of the women, 6. 1 % showed a loss of confidence in health ă professionals. ă Conclusion > We have shown how patients who stopped or modified their ă contraception method during 2013 placed the controversy influence in the ă forefront of the reasons for their decision. Although a medical reason ă has been widely quoted, only one in five felt that the advice of her ă doctor had clearly contributed to her choice. The influence of the media ă seemed to encroach on the doctor-patient relationship, which is ă fundamental to the quality of healthcare in the long term...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} kininogens of low {{and high}} molecular mass along with prokallikrein activity in plasma of women with a normal menstrual cycle. We observed no difference between results for the follicular and luteal phases. We assayed the same constituents in women who were taking oral contraceptives (combined <b>estroprogestative)</b> and found that activity of prokallikrein and concentrations of low- and high-molecular-mass kininogens were significantly increased. Lastly, we studied {{the components of the}} kallikrein-kininogen system during pregnancy. We also observed a marked increase in their concentrations in plasma, despite a decrease in total proteins. Specifically, prokallikrein and kininogens increase continuously with gestational age, reaching their maxima around the eighth month of pregnancy. At that time, more than 50 % of observed results fall outside the normal reference interval. Our observations are even more striking when prokallikrein and kininogens are expressed in units per gram of total proteins, to account for the hemodilution. After delivery, the concentrations of prokallikrein and low- and high-molecular-mass kininogens decline promptly, returning to normal within three days. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|R Kreidy 1,&nbsp;N Irani-Hakime 21 Department of Vascular Surgery, 2 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Saint George Hospital, University Medical Center, University of Balamand, Beirut, LebanonAim: Factor V Leiden (R 506 Q) {{mutation}} is {{the most}} commonly observed inherited genetic abnormality related to vein thrombosis. Lebanon {{has one of the}} highest frequencies of this mutation in the world with a prevalence of 14. 4 % in the general population. The aim of this study is to define risk factors including inherited genetic abnormalities among Lebanese patients with lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. We report the clinical outcome of patients with thrombophilia. Methods: From January 1998 to January 2008, 162 patients (61 males and 101 females) were diagnosed with lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. Mean age was 61 years (range: 21 to 95 years). Results: The most frequent risk factors for vein thrombosis were surgery, advanced age, obesity, and cancer. Twenty-five patients had thrombophilia, 16 patients had factor V Leiden (R 506 Q) mutation, and seven patients had MTHFR C 677 T mutation. Ninety-two percent of patients screened for thrombophilia were positive. Screening was requested in young patients (16), patients with recurrent (11), spontaneous (8), and extensive (5) venous thrombosis, familial history (5), pregnancy (4), <b>estroprogestative</b> treatment (3), and air travel (1). Nine patients had one, 11 patients had two, and five had three of these conditions. Follow-up (6 to 120 months) of these 25 patients treated with antivitamin K did not reveal recurrences or complications related to venous thromboembolism. Conclusion: Factor V Leiden mutation followed by MTHFR mutation are the most commonly observed genetic abnormalities in these series. Defining risk factors and screening for thrombophilia when indicated reduce recurrence rate and complications. Recommendations for thrombophilia screening will be proposed.

40|$|OBJETIVOS: avaliar a densidade mamográfica antes e após um ano de terapia de reposição hormonal. METODOLOGIA: participaram 70 mulheres climatéricas, admitidas em Ambulatório do Climatério. As pacientes usaram, regularmente, a TRH estrogênica ou estroprogestativa por um ano, possuíam uma mamografia basal e, outra após um ano de TRH. Os esquemas de TRH possuíam a mesma bioequivalência hormonal. Foram avaliados: a densidade mamográfica antes e após um ano de TRH, faixa etária, estado da função ovariana, índice de massa {{corporal}}, relação cintura/quadril, e o tabagismo. A densidade mamográfica foi avaliada segundo BI-RADS do Colégio Americano de Radiologia (1998), e classificada em: A) mamas inteiramente lipossubstituídas, B) mamas lipossubstituídas com parênquima glandular disperso, C) mamas heterogeneamente densas e D) mamas extremamente densas. Foi proposta subdivisão das categorias em A e A 1, B e B 1, C e C 1, D e D 1, às quais atribuiram-se escores iniciais (antes da TRH) e finais (após um ano de TRH), que variaram de 1 a 8, respectivamente. Foram computadas as proporções de mulheres que mostraram aumento, diminuição ou não modificaram a densidade mamográfica, após 1 ano de TRH. Além disso, calcularam-se variações nos escores iniciais e após um ano de TRH, utilizando-se o teste t pareado do SPSS. RESULTADOS: a densidade mamográfica aumentou em 22, 9 %, diminuiu em 7, 1; e em 70 % permaneu inalterada. Constatamos diferença nas médias dos escores basal (2, 2 ± 1, 82) e após um ano da TRH (2, 5 ± 1, 9) (p = 0. 019). A relação cintura/quadril foi significativamente maior (0, 87) nas mulheres que mostraram aumento da densidade mamográfica, quando comparadas àquelas que mostraram diminuição ou não alteraram a densidade mamográfica (0, 82), após um ano de TRH. CONCLUSÕES: a TRH, após um ano de uso, pode aumentar a densidade mamográfica, principalmente em mulheres com distribuição da gordura corporal tipo androgênica. PURPOSE: {{to measure}} changes and predictors {{of changes in}} mammographic density of climacteric women, before and one year after hormone replacement therapy. METHODS: seventy climacteric women of 45 years or more participated in the study. They were followed-up at a Climacteric Outpatient Service. All of them used regularly either estrogenic or <b>estroprogestative</b> HRT for one year. They were submitted to one basal mammography and another {{at the end of}} the first year. HRT schedules could be different from each other, although with the same bioequivalence. Mammographic density was evaluated blindly at the beginning and {{at the end of the}} treatment. Age, ovarian function, time since menopause, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, age at menarche, age at first pregnancy, and smoking were evaluated as well. Mammographic density was classified according to the American College of Radiology BI-RADS system into one of the following four parenchymal patterns: A) entirely liposubstituted breasts, B) liposubstituted breasts with disperse glandular parenchyma, C) heterogeneously dense breasts, and D) extremely dense breasts. We proposed a subdivision of each category in to A e A 1, B e B 1, C and C 1, D and D 1 in order to identify smaller variations in mammographic density. Therefore, we attributed initial and final scores of 1 - 8 to each of the patients according to the mammographic density before and after HRT, corresponding to categories A to D 1. The proportions of women that presented increase, decrease and no variation in mammographic density after 1 year of HRT were calculated. In addition, we estimated initial to final score variation using the paired t-test of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: mammographic density increased in 22. 9 %, decreased in 7. 1 % and did not change in 70 % of the studied cases. A significant difference was observed between the score means before (2. 2 ± 1. 82) and after HRT (2. 5 ± 1. 9) (p= 0. 019). The androgenic distribution of body fat was associated with a denser mammographic pattern. CONCLUSIONS: an increase in mammographic density was shown in women undergoing HRT, and was most pronounced in women with androgenic fat distribution. Additional studies must be carried out in order to evaluate if this increment in mammographic density could impair the mammographic screening of breast cancer...|$|E
