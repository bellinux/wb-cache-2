5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E
5|$|Some animals' colours and {{patterns}} resemble a particular natural background. This {{is an important}} component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling parakeets are mainly green; woodcocks of the forest floor are brown and speckled; reedbed bitterns are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animal's coloration matches the hues of its habitat. Similarly, desert animals are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the gerbil or fennec fox, birds such as the <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> or sandgrouse, or reptiles like the skink or horned viper.Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example khaki uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.Many moths show industrial melanism, including the peppered moth which has coloration that blends in with tree bark. The coloration of these insects evolved between 1860 and 1940 to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas. This is taken by zoologists as evidence that camouflage is influenced by natural selection, as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{the area}} is still home to a diverse {{population}} of birds and mammals, {{and some of the}} breeding species found do not breed anywhere else in Jordan. Among the bird species found are the European roller, <b>desert</b> <b>lark,</b> Dead Sea sparrow, desert finch and blue-cheeked bee-eater. The King Talal dam has created a lake which is a habitat for migratory waterfowl and various fish species. Notable birds found in the lake area include the little bittern, cattle egrets, [...] grey herons, white storks, common teal and Eurasian coot. The lake's waters sustain fish, some of which are indigenous species and some are introduced species. The most common are tilapia. [...] Migratory birds also winter in the man-made pools which make up the Kherbit Al-Samra Sewage Treatment Plant, located in a broad depression close to Wadi Dhulayl, the main tributary of the Zarqa River. As many as 6,000 white storks have been spotted roosting there. Mammals found in the area include the common otter (Lutra lutra), and the Persian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus). The otter is considered a threatened species.|$|E
50|$|In {{the coastal}} belt, bird species {{recorded}} are American flamingo on the beaches, and also many birds of prey. Migratory birds pass through Libya, and are seen mostly along the coastline. The most notable ones are the flamingo, Kentish plover in the Bengazi Reserve. Houbara bustard and the European white stork {{are reported in}} the Kouf National Park and in the beaches and lagoons. In the oases, <b>desert</b> <b>larks,</b> <b>desert</b> sparrows, and spotted sandgrouse have been reported. Other notable species reported are Aquila chrysaetos, Alectoris barbara, Pterocles spp. and Chlamydotis undulata with herons, ducks, waders, Ciconia nigra, Ciconia ciconia, and Milvus milvus (red kite) from the brackish lagoons.|$|R

40|$|Because deserts are {{characterized}} by low food availability, high ambient temperature extremes, and absence of drinking water, one might expect that birds that live in these conditions exhibit a lower basal metabolic rate (BMR), reduced total evaporative water loss (TEWL), and greater {{ability to cope with}} high air temperatures than their mesic counterparts. To minimize confounding effects of phylogeny, we compared the physiological performance of four species of larks at ambient temperatures (T-a's) ranging from 0 degrees to 50 degreesC: hoopoe larks (Alaemon alaudipes) and Dunn's larks (Eremalauda dunni) live in hot and dry deserts, whereas skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and woodlarks (Lullula arborea) occur in temperate mesic areas. Mass-adjusted BMR and TEWL were indistinguishable between hoopoe lark and Dunn's lark and between skylark and woodlark. When grouping the data of the two <b>desert</b> <b>larks</b> in one set and the data of the two mesic <b>larks</b> in another, <b>desert</b> <b>larks</b> are shown to have 43 % lower BMR levels and 27 % lower TEWL values than the mesic species. Their body temperatures (T-b's) were 1. 1 degreesC lower, and the minimal dry heat transfer coefficients (h) were 26 % below values for the mesic larks. When T a exceeded T-b, the h of hoopoe larks and Dunn's larks was high and indistinguishable from h at 40 degreesC, in contrast to the prediction that h should be decreased to minimize heat gain through conductance, convection, or radiation from the environment when T-a exceeds T-b...|$|R
40|$|Condensation {{of water}} vapor in the exhaled air stream {{as it passes}} over {{previously}} cooled membranes of the nasopharynx {{is thought to be}} a mechanism that reduces respiratory water loss in mammals and birds. Such a mechanism could be important in the overall water economy of these vertebrates, especially those species occupying desert habitats. However, this hypothesis was originally based on measurements of the temperature of exhaled air (T-ex), which provides an estimate of water recovered from exhaled air as a proportion of water added on inhalation but does not yield a quantitative measure of the reduction in total evaporative water loss (TEWL). In this study, we experimentally occluded the nares of crested larks (Galerida cristata), a cosmopolitan species, and <b>desert</b> <b>larks</b> (Ammomanes deserti), a species restricted to arid habitats, to test the hypothesis that countercurrent heat exchange in the nasal passages reduces TEWL. T-ex of crested larks increased linearly with air temperature, (T-a) : T-ex = 8. 93 + 0. 793 x T-a. Following Schmidt-Nielsen and based on measurements of T-ex, we predicted that crested larks would recover 69 %, 49 %, 23 %, and - 5 % of the water added to the inhaled air at T-a's of 15 degrees, 25 degrees, 35 degrees, and 45 degrees C, respectively. However, with the nares occluded, crested larks increased TEWL by only 27 %, 10 %, and 6 % at T-a's of 15 degrees, 25 degrees, and 35 degrees C, respectively. At T-a = 45 degrees C, TEWL of the crested lark was not affected by blocking the nares. In contrast to our expectation, occluding the nares of <b>desert</b> <b>larks</b> did not affect their TEWL at any T-a...|$|R

40|$|A common {{perception}} is that desert birds experience greater extremes of heat and aridity than their mammalian counterparts, in part, because birds do not use burrows as a refuge from the desert environment. We report observations of Dunn's Larks (Eremalauda dunni), Bar-tailed <b>Desert</b> <b>Larks</b> (Ammomanes cincturus), Black-crowned Finch Larks (Eremoprerix nigriceps), and Hoopoe Larks (Alaemon alaudipes) using burrows of the large herbivorous lizard Uromastyx aegypticus as thermal refugia during hot summer days in the Arabian Desert. Continuous recordings of shade air temperature (T-a), soil surface temperature (T-surface), burrow air temperature (Ta-burrow), and burrow substrate temperature (T-substrate) showed that T-surface exceeded 60 degrees C on most days. T-a typically exceeded 45 degrees C, whereas Ta-burrow was around 41 degrees C during midday. Calculations of total evaporative water loss at different temperatures indicated that Hoopoe Larks can potentially reduce their water loss {{by as much as}} 81 % by sheltering in Uromastyx burrows during the hottest periods of the summer day...|$|R
50|$|Over {{five hundred}} species of bird have been {{recorded}} from Oman. Some of these are resident, others arrive in spring to breed, departing by autumn. Still more are in transit, on migration routes between the Palearctic ecozone, Africa and the Indian Subcontinent. The east coast with its mudflats and lagoons is visited by many species of wader, and the mangrove areas are home to the red-wattled lapwing and the collared kingfisher. The coast and offshore islands are home to gulls, terns and cormorants. The mountainous north of the country attracts many passerines in passage, the desert areas are home to the endangered houbara bustard, sand partridge, four species of sandgrouse, <b>desert</b> <b>larks,</b> pipits, wheatears and buntings. The mountains additionally attract golden eagles and Egyptian vultures. The Dhofar region in the south has {{a great variety of}} breeding and migratory species.

40|$|We {{call into}} {{question}} the idea that birds have not evolved unique physiological adaptations to desert environments. The rate at which <b>desert</b> <b>larks</b> metabolize energy is lower than in mesic species within the same family, and this lower rate of living translates into a lower overall energy requirement in the wild. We argue that selection has reduced oxygen consumption at the tissue level under basal conditions for birds living in deserts. We document that total evaporative water loss-the sum of cutaneous water loss (CWL) and respiratory water loss-is reduced in desert birds, and present evidence that changes in CWL are responsible for this pattern. The diminution in CWL is attributable to changes in the lipid structure of the stratum corneum of the skin, the physical barrier to diffusion of water vapor. Finally, we show linkages between physiology and life-history attributes of larks along an aridity gradient, birds from deserts have not only a reduced rate of metabolism but also a small clutch size and slow nestling development. Hence, attributes of physiology are correlated with traits that directly affect reproductive success. Our hope is that we will prompt students to question the notion that birds do not possess physiological adaptations to the desert environment, and raise the specter of doubt about "preadaptation" in birds living in deserts...|$|R

40|$|Immune defense {{may vary}} {{as a result}} of {{trade-offs}} with other life-history traits or in parallel with variation in antigen levels in the environment. We studied lark species (Alaudidae) in the Arabian Desert and temperate Netherlands to test opposing predictions from these two hypotheses. Based on their slower pace of life, the trade-off hypothesis predicts relatively stronger immune defenses in <b>desert</b> <b>larks</b> compared with temperate larks. However, as predicted by the antigen exposure hypothesis, reduced microbial abundances in deserts should result in desert-living larks having relatively weaker immune defenses. We quantified host-independent and host-dependent microbial abundances of culturable microbes in ambient air and from the surfaces of birds. We measured components of immunity by quantifying concentrations of the acute-phase protein haptoglobin, natural antibody-mediated agglutination titers, complement-mediated lysis titers, and the microbicidal ability of whole blood. Desert-living larks were exposed to significantly lower concentrations of airborne microbes than temperate larks, and densities of some bird-associated microbes were also lower in desert species. Haptoglobin concentrations and lysis titers were also significantly lower in desert-living larks, but other immune indexes did not differ. Thus, contrary to the trade-off hypothesis, we found little evidence that a slow pace of life predicted increased immunological investment. In contrast, and in support of the antigen exposure hypothesis, associations between microbial exposure and some immune indexes were apparent. Measures of antigen exposure, including assessment of host-independent and host-dependent microbial assemblages, can provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying immunological variation. ...|$|R

40|$|Nest {{placement}} {{affects the}} risk of predation on both eggs and incubating parents and determines the microclimate for incubation, two functions that may be in conflict, especially in hot deserts. We studied the roles of microclimate and nest predation on nest site selection by Hoopoe Larks (Alaemon alaudipes) in the Arabian <b>Desert.</b> Hoopoe <b>Larks</b> build nests in three microsites: on the gravel plain away from vegetation, {{at the base of}} bushes, or above ground in bushes. Early in the breeding season, 70 % of nests were placed on the ground, but as the season progressed, nests in small bushes represented 77 % of total nests; nest cover increased from 5 % to 21 %. Daily survival rate of natural nests was 0. 82. Predation on eggs did not differ among nest sites, either for natural nests or in an experiment with artificial nests. Measurements of operative and egg temperatures showed that artificial nests on the gravel plain experience higher temperatures than those under and in bushes. Nest attendance totaled 77 % of daytime in nests under bushes and 81 % in nests in or on top of bushes, with the larger share of attendance contributed by females. However, during midday, when evaporative water requirements—estimated from temperature profiles at artificial nests—were 10 – 15 -fold higher than during early morning, males and females shared incubation duties almost equally. We hypothesize that Hoopoe Larks favor exposed nest sites to reduce predation risk to themselves as incubating parents, but as the season progresses, they select nest sites with more cover at the base of or within bushes because the thermal environment forces them to do so. ...|$|R
