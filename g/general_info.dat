40|$|In {{the recent}} past, dense image {{matching}} {{methods such as}} Semi-Global Matching (SGM) became popular for many applications. The SGM approach has been adapted to and implemented for Leica ADS line-scanner data by North West Geomatics (North West) in co-operation with Leica Geosystems; it is used in North West’s production workflow. One {{of the advantages of}} ADS imagery is the calibrated color information (RGB and near infrared), extending SGM-derived point clouds to dense “image point clouds ” or, more <b>general,</b> information clouds (<b>info</b> clouds). With the goal of automating the quality control of ADS data, info clouds are utilized for Shear Analysis: Three-dimensional offsets of adjacent ADS image strips are determined from a pattern of info cloud pairs in strip overlaps by point cloud matching. The presented approach integrates geometry (height) and radiometry (intensity) information; matching is based on local point-to-plane distances for all points in a given cloud. The offset is derived in a least squares adjustment by applying it to each individual distance computation equation. Using intensities in addition to heights greatly benefits the offset computation, because intensity gradients tend to occur more frequently than height gradients. They can provide or complement the required information for the derivation of planimetric offset components. The paper details the combined geometric/radiometric point cloud matching approach and verifies the results against manual measurements...|$|R

In a post on his Myspace blog, Ruud said [...] "I decided {{to call it that}} because I think that name raises all the questions that don't have immediate answers in an instant. And what is more interesting than searching for answers? Everybody is looking for certain answers I guess. Even subconsciously. Therefore it's multi-interpretable. The only questionable thing about the name that might raise some eyebrows instead of questions is when you pronounce the abbreviation of it; FAWK. Ah well, that's just a minor detail...Musically it's going to be heavy in the basics. Very guitar oriented of course. It won't be a shred-fest but guitaristically (if that's even a word) interesting. Some keywords that come to mind right now are; Heavy, Hysterical, Melodic, Atmospherically, Ambient, Groovy, Mellow... Check out my influences in the <b>general</b> <b>info</b> section. Then you see what kind of music I listen to. I guess it's inevitable that some of the 'ingredients' of those bands and artist end up in my own musical stew.And no, it's not going to be something like Within Temptation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the public opinion of a rural town in northern Hokkaido with respect to the use of local forests for bioenergy production. The small Japanese town with 3, 800 citizens had been identified as an optimal case study location and selected because of its early decision to pursue forest management certification and because the municipality had been awarded the status of one out of 6 Japanese "Eco-Model Cities" - to encourage the creation of low-carbon communities - in 2008. In order to test the basic knowledge and information needs of the public, a questionnaire-based drop-off survey was conducted in mid 2009 among all households of Shimokawa Town. The questionnaire was divided into 4 sections (<b>general</b> <b>info,</b> forest, forest management, and bioenergy) in each of which up to 16 questions were asked with main focus on sustainable forest management, certification, and biomass for bio-energy. The answers were made on a 4 / 5 point scale, or in dichotomous-choice form and analyzed by using SPSS. Knowing the public opinion on forest, bioenergy and the environment is seen to be crucial for the design of future policies for integrating a range of discrete and sectoral approaches such as energy supply-demand measures, green building combined with certified wooden products, eco tourism or forest protection. Such bottom-up policies need to aim at tackling the problems of low forestry activity and climate change issues by concentrating on increasing people's knowledge and positive attitudes towards an environmentally sound use of domestic forests...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{contribute}} to filling the knowledge gap in public opinion and knowledge about forest and its certification in Japan, as well as to identify key elements and the possible role of public opinion within integrated bottom-up policies, bridging the sectors of forest, environment and energy. This article compares the public opinion of two rural towns in Japan, one of which is located in northern Hokkaido, whereas the other town is located on the southern Main Island Shikoku. Both municipalities had been identified as an optimal case study location and selected because of their early decision to pursue forest management certification and because both towns had been awarded the status of a Japanese "Eco-Model Cities" - to encourage the creation of low-carbon communities - in 2008 and 2009. In order to test the basic knowledge and information needs of the public, a questionnaire-based drop-off survey was conducted in early 2007 and mid 2009 respectively among all households of the two rural towns. The questionnaire was divided into 5 sections (<b>general</b> <b>info,</b> forest, forest management, bioenergy, and information needs) in each of which up to 15 questions were asked with main focus on forest certification and biomass for bio-energy. The answers were made on a 4 / 5 point scale, or in dichotomous-choice form and analyzed by using SPSS. Gaining better knowledge about what the public thinks regarding bioenergy and the environment is seen to be crucial for the design of future policies for integrating a range of discrete and sectoral approaches such as energy supply-demand measures, energy-efficient buildings, traffic measures, waste disposal measures and forest protection. Finally, this study describes and interprets differences and similarities in the public opinion of both Eco-Model Cities in Japan where bioenergy production and forest management certification plays an important role. Forest certification and bioenergy from forest were identified as key elements for future integrated bottom-up policies that need to concentrate on facilitating the linkage between forestry and renewable energy as well as on promoting environmentally sound management and forest certification...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{treats the}} {{research}} of a novel 9 ̆ 3 generator with converter 9 ̆ 4 design called 9 ̆ 3 Doubly Fed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine 9 ̆ 4, DF-PMSM, patented by SmartMotor. The thesis includes {{an introduction to the}} machine, a state-of-the-art survey, a hydro power case, simulations and a laboratory experiment. The DF-PMSM concept adds an important feature to fixed speed PMSM systems; the reactive power can be regulated. Compared to a direct coupled PMSM the DF-PMSM concept can add voltage control (by controlling the reactive power) in addition to active power control. The concept is based on a 6 -phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine where the windings are grouped into two sets of 3 -phase, both situated in the stator. These winding sets are named 9 ̆ 3 control 9 ̆ 4 and 9 ̆ 3 power 9 ̆ 4 winding, named after their purpose in the design. The 9 ̆ 3 control winding 9 ̆ 4 is routed through a converter with active-front-end rectifier. It will be used to control the reactive power and the active power from the control winding. The 9 ̆ 3 power winding 9 ̆ 4 will carry most of the generated power, directly coupled and in sync with the voltages of the connected grid. The state-of-the-art survey includes constant speed and variable speed generators utilized in hydro power generation today. It also includes some <b>general</b> <b>info</b> about doubly fed and multiphase machines. The grid regulations for Norway are also investigated to give a pointer to what requirements that the DF-PMSM needs to fulfill to be connected to the grid. The machine simulations are done in LTspice where machine simulation models are developed for this purpose. Simulation of machine startup and changes is load is done. The simulation models are developed as hierarchical sub blocks that can be re used in later simulation cases. The laboratory is done with two machines in back-to-back configuration with industry standard converters. The DF-PMSM is made from a 3 -phase permanent magnet machine that is rewired to a 6 -phase configuration. The laboratory exercise includes start up, synchronization of the power winding to the grid, machine loading and reactive power compensation by the active front end converter. The DF-PMSM is confirmed working and design considerations are given based experience gained from working with this design. All of this information is included in this report and the further work needed before this machine is constructed and sold is sketched in the conclusion...|$|E

It was heavily modified to incorporate Unicamp's front-matter requirements, and my own preferences. <b>General</b> <b>info</b> about this template can be found through the previously mentioned link. This README file will have specifics about my changes. Main features: Already structured and ready-to-go Unicamp's thesis front-matter format and requirements. Automatic bibliography citation Convenient Makefile compile output Makefile supports different citation styles Specifics In general terms, you will write your text in light markdown syntax, which will be compiled into pdf (or TeX, or docx) through pandoc. If you're unfamiliar with those terms, I recommend to read Pollard's original README file, and the README file of pandoc. /srcfolder is divided in three base sections: body, front-matter and end-matter. body will contain the base source text of your work. front-matter will produce the initial pages of your work, including title page, face page, approval sheet, abstract, ToC, etc. similarly, end-matter will produce the appendixes and reference section The whole idea, is to customize front-matter and end-matter sections once, and just work in the files of body section. A few commands to get started: make pdf will generate a full pdf. make pdf strip-frontmatter=yes will generate a pdf without any front matter. make pdf bibstyle=APA will generate a pdf with bibliography references in APA style (default is ABNT). Use command make help to see all possible options. Dependencies a LaTeX engine Pandoc uses LaTex under the hood to render pdf files. Instructions on how to setup LaTeX are available on pandoc's guide. One special note, is that if using XeLaTeX engine (which is recommended, in a macOS environment, {{it is necessary to}} install LaTeX fonts system-wide. In order to acomplish that, do the following: install MacTex or BasicTex, accordingly to pandoc's installation guide; install the specific fonts for LaTeX using either TeX Live or tlmgr. In this case, we're interested in cm-unicode package, so if using tlmgr, use the command sudo tlmgr install cm-unicode; using Finder, navigate to the installed font folder. It's probably something like /usr/local/texlive/ 2016 basic/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/cm-unicode. select all files in the font folder and install them system-wide by either right-clicking or dragging the files into Font Book app. pandoc-crossref This project needs an extra dependency besides the default ones from the original project, namely pandoc-crossref. Tom Pollard uses latex for cross-referencing figures, tables, etc. but I think that pandoc-crossref does a better job at that. Check the sample files in src/body for details. In OSX, you can install pandoc-crossref via homebrew: brew install pandoc-crossref wc The target make wc will count words in directory src. The tool wc is preloaded in OSX Darwin, however {{it may be necessary to}} install it in other operational system. language-tool The target make spellcheck will check the grammar in files in src. The tool languagetool will need to be installed. In OSX, you can install languagetool via homebrew: brew install languagetool Follow up on Pollard's original README. [...] Augusto Andrau...|$|E
