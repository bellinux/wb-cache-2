25|$|Bride burning or <b>dowry</b> <b>killing</b> {{is a form}} of {{domestic}} violence in which a newly married woman is killed at home by her husband or husband's family due to their dissatisfaction over the dowry provided by her family. The act is often a result of demands for more or prolonged dowry after the marriage. Dowry violence is most common in South Asia, especially in India. In 2011, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths in India, but unofficial figures estimate at least three times this amount.|$|E
50|$|Overall this western {{district}} of Odisha needs quick improvement {{to catch up}} with the other parts of the state and country. The government needs to take care of special responsibility towards the development like construction of roads, buildings, education to the people, developments like railway and air connectivity. For instance the nearest airport from any part of the district is Bhubaneswar, Raipur or Visakhapatnam which are minimum 7 hours journey from Balangir. Also the standard of living of the people needs to be improved by providing the minimum requirements to the people by providing jobs to them so that migration of the people from this part to other parts of the country could be avoided. At the same time, social menaces like <b>dowry</b> <b>killing,</b> and unsocial activities like theft, burglary and murder could be kept in control.|$|E

2500|$|Femicide {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} gender-based killing of women by men, {{although}} the exact definitions vary. [...] Femicides often occur {{in the context of}} DV, such as honor <b>killings</b> or <b>dowry</b> <b>killings.</b> For statistical purposes, femicide is often defined as any killing of a woman. The top countries by rate of femicide are El Salvador, Jamaica, Guatemala, South Africa and Russia (data from 2004–09). However, in El Salvador and Colombia, which have a very high rate of femicide, only three percent of all femicides are committed by a current or former intimate partner, while in Cyprus, France, and Portugal former and current partners are responsible for more than 80% of all cases of femicide.|$|R
5000|$|A {{negative}} {{factor is}} {{the rise in the}} rate of [...] "dowry deaths". In Bangladesh, <b>dowry</b> <b>killings</b> are more frequently done by stabbing or poison rather than burning. Dowry extortion is also a problem in Bangladesh. From January to October 2009, more than 3,413 complaints were made to the police in Bangladesh concerning beatings and other abuses related to dowries. [...] One of the methods used by families who are unhappy with dowry includes acid throwing, in which concentrated acid is thrown on the bride's face to cause disfiguration and social isolation. From 1995 to 1998, 15 women reported dowry disputes as the motivation behind acid attacks, though that number may be low due to under reporting. Bangladesh is combatting the problem with legislation largely copied from that of India. Laws prohibiting dowry in Bangladesh include Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980; Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1982; and Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1986.|$|R
50|$|Rita Banerji, feminist {{author and}} founder of The 50 Million Missing Campaign to end female {{gendercide}} in India, has {{said that there are}} also millions of girls and women killed through various forms of femicides, that extend across various age groups. In a U.N. Symposium on Femicide in Vienna on November 26, 2012, she talked about the six most widespread forms of femicide in India. These included female infanticide, the killing of girls under six years through starvation and violence, the killing of women due to forced abortions, honor <b>killings,</b> <b>dowry</b> murders, and witch lynchings. Many of the femicides in India are perpetrated against girls.|$|R
5000|$|Violence {{against women}} can fit into several broad categories. These include {{violence}} {{carried out by}} [...] "individuals" [...] as well as [...] "states". Some of the forms of violence perpetrated by individuals are rape; domestic violence; sexual harassment; coercive use of contraceptives; female infanticide; prenatal sex selection; obstetric violence and mob violence; as well as harmful customary or traditional practices such as honor <b>killings,</b> <b>dowry</b> violence, female genital mutilation, marriage by abduction and forced marriage. Some forms of violence are perpetrated or condoned by the state such as war rape; sexual violence and sexual slavery during conflict; forced sterilization; forced abortion; violence {{by the police and}} authoritative personnel; stoning and flogging. Many forms of VAW, such as trafficking in women and forced prostitution are often perpetrated by organized criminal networks.|$|R
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} {{attention given to}} specific forms of domestic violence, such as honor <b>killings,</b> <b>dowry</b> deaths, and forced marriages. India has, in recent decades, made efforts to curtail dowry violence: the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) was enacted in 2005, following years of advocacy and activism by the women's organizations. Crimes of passion in Latin America, a region which {{has a history of}} treating such killings in an extremely lenient way, have also come to international attention. In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, argued that there are similarities between the dynamics of crimes of passion and honor killings, stating that: [...] "crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [...] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable".|$|R
50|$|In May 2013, Adnan {{started her}} own jirga, the first run {{by women in}} the country. Traditionally, women {{in the region have}} been used as chattel to settle {{disputes}} of men, traded in marriage to absolve debts, claims of honor, and retribution for crimes. Because women have little power, Adnan recognized that her group would need to pressure authorities to act. Her 25-member all-female jirga pressures police and the traditional court system to act while providing legal assistance to the victims. The Khwendo Jirga, or Sister’s Council, in addition to providing justice support for women advocate for free education for girls; protection of women and girl's health; training in both traditional domestic and non-traditional vocational skills; microfinancing, access for women to peace negotiations, justice, and voting; and laws which protect women from violence, specifically, honor <b>killings,</b> <b>dowry</b> harassments, acid attacks, and torture. Initially the Khwendo Jirga was opposed both by men's jirgas and prominent women's rights activists.|$|R

40|$|AbstractViolence {{against women}} and {{children}} is a global human rights and public health issue. Gender violence - including rape, intimate partner violence, domestic violence, mutilation, sexual trafficking, <b>dowry</b> death, honor <b>killings,</b> incest, breast ironing {{is part of a}} global pattern of violence against women, a pattern supported by educational, economic, and employment discrimination. Intimate partner, family, and sexual violence is a major cause of death and disability for women aged 16 - 44 years of age worldwide. The most common rationale given for the denial of human rights to women is the preservation of family and culture. While gender violence is a significant cause of female morbidity and mortality, and has long been recognized as a human rights issue that has serious implications for public health and an obstacle for economic development, it persists. Drawing upon cross-national survey data and interviews with women participating in the Global Clothesline Project, this paper discusses the prevalence and patterns of gender violence across the developing and developed world, highlighting the voices of victim-survivors and the strategies that are empowering women and challenging gender violence in Cameroon, the Netherlands, and the United States...|$|R
