25|$|Power plant {{capacity}} {{is far greater}} than any individual locomotive uses, so electric locomotives can have a higher power output than diesel locomotives and they can produce even higher short-term surge power for <b>fast</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Electric locomotives are ideal for commuter rail service with frequent stops. They are used on high-speed lines, such as ICE in Germany, Acela in the U.S., Shinkansen in Japan, China Railway High-speed in China and TGV in France. Electric locomotives are used on freight routes with consistently high traffic volumes, or in areas with advanced rail networks.|$|E

2500|$|The Transperth Train {{system is}} {{generally}} regarded as a Commuter Rail system, however it shares many similarities with Rapid Transit systems, including high frequency services (Every 5 minutes from 2-6 pm on the Joondalup/Mandurah lines), short distances between stations (less than 2 km on Midland/Fremantle lines) and high capacity, single deck electric multiple unit trains with <b>fast</b> <b>acceleration.</b> The frequency of service on the Mandurah and Joondalup lines makes Transperth the most frequent suburban rail system in Australia. Trains on the new Sydney Metro rapid transit system will run every 5 minutes in peak periods, a frequency which has already been present on the Transperth suburban network for quite some time.|$|E
2500|$|... two roughly spoon-shaped blades {{at either}} end of a {{cylindrical}} shaft. This paddle style was developed for <b>fast</b> <b>acceleration</b> and sudden maneuvering in Whitewater kayaking, and then back-ported to sea-kayaking. Euro [...] paddles can be made of aluminum, plastic or even wood, but the best are usually formed of more expensive materials like carbon-fiber for lightness. Often the two blades are feathered, or set at an angle relative to each other (both for ergonomic efficiency, and so that as one blade moves backwards through the water, the opposite blade moving forward through the air presents its edge, rather than its face). This does make it less efficient with the wind on the side or behind.|$|E
50|$|Most racing V8s {{continue}} to use the single plane crankshaft because it allows <b>faster</b> <b>acceleration</b> and more efficient exhaust system designs.|$|R
50|$|Three {{different}} {{gear ratios}} {{exist for the}} European/Australasian, US and Japanese markets. These are relatively easily swapped between models, allowing rides to select between lower-revving touring style riding, and <b>faster</b> <b>acceleration.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The thrust {{required}} {{of the new}} engine, then designated B.E.10 (later Olympus), would initially be [...] with growth potential to [...] The pressure ratio would be an unheard of 9:1. To achieve this, the initial design used a low-pressure (LP) axial compressor and a high-pressure (HP) centrifugal compressor, each being driven by its own single-stage turbine. This two-spool design eliminated the need for features such as {{variable inlet guide vanes}} (Avon, J79), inlet ramps (J65), variable stators (J79) or compressor bleed (Avon) which were required on single spool compressors with pressure ratios above about 6:1. Without these features an engine could not be started nor run at low speeds without destructive blade vibrations. Nor could they accelerate to high speeds with <b>fast</b> <b>acceleration</b> times ("spool up") without surge. The design was progressively modified and the centrifugal HP compressor was replaced by an axial HP compressor. This reduced the diameter of the new engine to the design specification of [...] The Bristol Type 172 was cancelled though development continued for the Avro Vulcan and other projects.|$|E

50|$|Since {{electric}} trains do {{not need}} to carry a heavy internal combustion engine or large batteries, they can have very good power-to-weight ratios. This allows high speed trains such as France's double-deck TGVs to operate at speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph) or higher, and electric locomotives to have a much higher power output than diesel locomotives. In addition, they have higher short-term surge power for <b>fast</b> <b>acceleration,</b> and using regenerative brakes can put braking power back into the electrical grid rather than wasting it.|$|E
50|$|Transmission Upgrade: This {{allows the}} player to adjust gear ratios. On cars with high redlines and high top speeds, {{such as the}} mustang and GT-90, the gear ratios can be set to the <b>fastest</b> <b>acceleration</b> ratios without {{affecting}} top speed substantially.|$|R

50|$|FOC is used {{to control}} AC {{synchronous}} and induction motors. It was originally developed for high-performance motor applications that are required to operate smoothly over the full speed range, generate full torque at zero speed, and have high dynamic performance including <b>fast</b> <b>acceleration</b> and deceleration. However, {{it is becoming increasingly}} attractive for lower performance applications as well due to FOC's motor size, cost and power consumption reduction superiority. It is expected that with increasing computational power of the microprocessors it will eventually nearly universally displace single-variable scalar volts-per-Hertz (V/f) control.|$|E
50|$|The trains have <b>fast</b> <b>acceleration</b> as {{distances}} between stations was short, {{they needed to}} be able to speed up and brake quickly. The original idea was for {{them to be able to}} operate on the Amsterdam Metro network, so third rail would be needed as well as overhead pick-up, however in 1969 this idea was stopped. Their maximum speed is 125 km/h. The two-car units could accelerate from 0-125 km/h in 72 seconds. Each coach has 3 doors on each side, to allow for quick loading and unloading.|$|E
