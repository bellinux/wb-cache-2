5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{influential}} piper {{who broke}} the boundaries of traditional piping music. He {{was a member of}} the Vale of Atholl Pipe Band and also performed with the Atholl Highlanders, as well as being signed by Greentrax as a solo artist.|$|E
25|$|This loss made Harry M. {{the least}} {{successful}} candidate and most surviving in any incarnation of The Apprentice to date, having lost seven consecutive tasks, though Lord Sugar told him <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong candidate {{and did not}} deserve to hold such a record.|$|E
30|$|People say <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good communicator.|$|R

25|$|Agustín {{studied at}} the Catholic seminary called Colegio de San Nicolás in Valladolid, {{enrolled}} in the program for secular officials, though {{he was not a}} distinguished student. After that, he worked as an overseer at one of his family's haciendas for a short time, discovering <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good horseman.|$|E
25|$|The {{commander}} of the flight was Cedric Roberts (44). He had been with Bristow Helicopters Ltd since 1974. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> experienced pilot with more than 9,600 hours of flying time under his belt. The first officer was Lionel Sole (39). Sole had been with Bristow Helicopters Ltd since 1990. He had more than 3,100 hours of flying time to his credit.|$|E
25|$|Constantine's youth {{had been}} a sad one due to his {{unpleasant}} appearance, his taciturn nature, and his relegation to the third level of succession, behind Christopher Lekapenos, the eldest son of RomanosI Lekapenos. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> intelligent {{young man with a}} large range of interests, and he dedicated those years to studying the court's ceremonial.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> similar {{figure to}} Robin Goodfellow, a.k.a. Puck.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{senior and}} {{experienced}} politician of Indiana National Congress.|$|R
50|$|Ken Koala - <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> shy koala with an Australian accent.|$|R
25|$|Joe {{devastated the}} IRA in west Belfast in the mid-1980s. I {{was told he}} loved his work and got {{a great deal of}} {{pleasure}} after operations were compromised. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> willing agent and tried on at least two occasions to entrap senior republicans. But it was probably {{only a matter of time}} before he was caught out and by late 1988 he was under suspicion.|$|E
25|$|Guillaume-Francois Rouelle {{brought the}} theory of phlogiston to France, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{influential}} scientist and teacher so it gained quite a strong foothold very quickly. Many of his students became very influential scientists in their own right, Lavoisier included. The French viewed phlogiston as a very subtle principle that vanishes in all analysis, yet it is in all bodies. Essentially they followed straight from Stahl's theory.|$|E
25|$|His {{personal}} impact, however, was twofold: {{his image}} as a warm, gentle and kind man captivated the whole world. This image was immediately formed when he {{was presented to the}} crowd in St. Peter's Square following his election. The warmth of his presence made him a much-loved figure before he even spoke a word. The media in particular fell under his spell. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> skilled orator.|$|E
50|$|Barnabas: Marina's younger brother. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good {{inventor}} and {{his tail}} is blue.|$|R

25|$|Thys Lourens {{represented}} Northern Transvaal in 168 {{games of}} which 84 he captained. He played in 8 Currie Cup finals (4 as captain) {{and was never}} on a losing side. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> resourceful captain and player and highly respected {{on and off the}} field. The partnership he established with Brigadier Buurman van Zyl, was the foundation on which the Blue Bulls built their dominance of the Currie Cup scene in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{effective}} medium-fast {{swing and}} seam bowler who reached one thousand first-class wickets for his county, Surrey, in 2005, having achieved the milestone in all first-class matches the previous year. In 2000 he had match figures of 16-119 for Surrey against Leicestershire at Guildford, the second best match figures ever returned for the county. His {{figures in the}} second innings were 9-47. His best innings figures were 9-45, against Cambridge University at The Oval in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Davis was {{an active}} member of the Historical Association from his early days at UCL. He edited History {{magazine}} for the Association from 1968 to 1978, and he was its president from 1979 to 1982. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> active president, visiting many branches and campaigning for the teaching of history in schools and universities and founding the History at the Universities Defence Group (HUDG). In 1981, he and Eleanor were guests at a party attended by Queen Elizabeth II to celebrate the Association's 75th year.|$|E
50|$|The {{student council}} president, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{confident}} person who <b>was</b> also <b>a</b> former Princess one year {{prior to the}} beginning of the story, his first year. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good leader and often comes up with fool-proof plans which benefit him and the rest of the student council. <b>He</b> can also <b>be</b> very intimidating to talk with and in effect people often go along with his plans regardless.|$|R
50|$|Max Russo - Youngest {{child in}} the Russo family, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> goofy and funny type of teenager.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> able leg spinner and in {{his last}} season at Cranleigh School was second highest wicket taker.|$|R
25|$|Hanam Sunim {{was in the}} Diamond Mountains, at Jangan Temple by 1922, {{and later}} just outside Seoul at Bongeun Temple in 1926. He left then and, perhaps {{intending}} {{to return to the}} Diamond Mountains, wound up staying in the Odae Mountains, at Sangwon Temple. (This would have been on his path to the Diamond Mountains.) As <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> well known teacher, {{it seems likely that the}} monks at the nearby large temple, Woljeong Temple, had asked him to stay and teach.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{initially}} rumours of his departure, on 10 July 2007, {{he extended}} his contract with the club until 2010. For the 2007–08 Serie A season, his shirt number was changed from 16 to 8. Despite suffering several injuries during the 2007–08 season, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important and influential player in Juventus's first Serie A season since their return to the top flight season. He scored 5 goals in 22 appearances, and also won the Guerin d'Oro award, as the player with the highest average rating, for his performances throughout the season.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{the rest}} of his tenure of the Staffordshire seat, Littleton was either in default or on sick leave. He was {{considered}} still 'friendly' to the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, but was unable to vote for it. On his death in 1812, his nephew Edward Walhouse replaced him as MP, soon after changing his name to Littleton. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different MP from the 4th Baronet: urbane, studious, a master of political detail and a determined debater, he first joined the Canningite Tories, but later became a Whig.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{versatile}} {{player that}} can play either at right back, centre back {{or on the}} right wing.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> furseal-like alien with <b>a</b> Kansai dialect. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> clever swindler, {{which got}} Sorao, Mojacko and Donmoin great danger.|$|R

25|$|William Brockwell (21 January 1865 – 1 July 1935) was an English cricketer. Although {{primarily}} {{remembered as}} a batsman, {{he began his career}} as a fast-medium bowler. With George Lohmann, Tom Richardson and William Lockwood carrying all before them, Brockwell had few opportunities until they declined. However, from 1897 onwards, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> useful bowler and took 105 wickets in the 1899 season when Richardson was out of form and Lockwood never fully fit. Even in 1902, he took six for 37 on an excellent pitch in the last match of the season against Warwickshire.|$|E
25|$|Dink {{was one of}} Turkey's most {{prominent}} Armenian voices and, despite threats on his life, he refused to remain silent. He always said his aim was to improve the difficult relationship between Turks and Armenians. Active in various democratic platforms and civil society organizations, Hrant Dink emphasized the need for democratization in Turkey {{and focused on the}} issues of free speech, minority rights, civic rights and issues pertaining to the Armenian community in Turkey. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important peace activist. In his public speeches, which were often intensely emotional, he never refrained from using the word genocide when talking about the Armenian Genocide, a term fiercely rejected by Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Cadbury {{was also}} one of the few doctors known to {{rehabilitate}} both the mind and the body of his patients. Genuinely concerned for the wellbeing of his patients, he was known to check on them and wear his stethoscope at all times. Those around him observed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> knowledgeable, highly skilled, and effective doctor. Over the years, he became the most well-known internist in Canton. He tried to emulate William Osler, who was a famous internist in the 1800s. In 1913, he was named the principal doctor for the Canton Hospital. Then, in 1914, he joined the specialized medical staff of Canton Hospital.|$|E

Then Will sees sorcery books on Orman's table and thinks he's the magician in the woods. Will takes Alyss to Grimsdell wood {{during the day and}} Alyss sees how the magician made the ghost. Then Alyss sends a report to Halt and Crowley with a pigeon.|$|R
