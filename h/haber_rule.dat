50|$|<b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> or <b>Haber's</b> {{law is a}} {{mathematical}} statement {{of the relationship between}} the concentration of a poisonous gas and how long the gas must be breathed to produce death, or other toxic effect. The rule was formulated by German chemist Fritz Haber in the early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|It makes {{equivalent}} any two {{groupings of}} dose concentration and exposure time that have equivalent mathematical products. For instance, if we assign dose concentration the symbol C, and time the classic t, then for any two dose schema, if C1t1=C2t2, then under <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> the two dose schema are equivalent.|$|R
50|$|In {{his studies}} {{of the effects of}} poison gas, Haber noted that {{exposure}} to a low concentration of a poisonous gas for a long time often had the same effect (death) as exposure to a high concentration for a short time. He formulated a simple mathematical relationship between the gas concentration and the necessary exposure time. This relationship became known as <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> states that, {{for a given}} {{poisonous}} gas, , where [...] is {{the concentration}} of the gas (mass per unit volume), [...] {{is the amount of}} time necessary to breathe the gas, in order to produce a given toxic effect, and [...] is a constant, depending on both the gas and the effect. Thus, the rule states that doubling the concentration will halve the time, for example.|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn general, the {{exposure}} of experimental animals to inhalable compounds is discontinuous rather than continuous. Of interest however are the chronic toxic effects which occur {{after a lifetime of}} continuous exposure. For the extrapolation of discontinuous to continuous exposition Haber's Law: Concentration * Time = constant (toxic) effect is applied. In this report, the underlying assumptions of <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> are reviewed. From studies of literature, it is concluded that Haber's Law has limited validity. It can be reasoned that only at low dose ranges at which toxicokinetic processes are far from saturated, Haber's Law may be valid. Unfortunately, no scientific data are available on the validity of Haber's Law in the NOAEL-dose range. Therefore, no clear statements on the validity of Haber's Law in the extrapolation of NOAELs of discontinuous to continuous exposure can be made. However, it can be reasonably expected that <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> may be valid for certain groups of compounds. These compounds include: 1. agents with direct local irreversible toxicity. 2. agents with direct systemic irreversible toxicity which equilibrate rapidly with the blood. 3. agents with indirect irreversible toxicity of which the toxic metabolites hardly undergo further detoxification and evoke a rapid toxic response. In case of systemic toxicity a rapid equilibration with the blood is a prerequisite...|$|R
40|$|Strategies {{are needed}} for {{assessing}} the risks of exposures to airborne toxicants that vary over concentrations and durations. The goal of this project was to describe {{the relationship between the}} concentration and duration of exposure to inhaled trichloroethylene (TCE), a representative volatile organic chemical, tissue dose as predicted by a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, and neurotoxicity. Three measures of neurotoxicity were studied: hearing loss, signal detection behavior, and visual function. The null hypothesis was that exposure scenarios having an equivalent product of concentration and duration would produce equal toxic effects, according to the classic linear form of <b>Haber's</b> <b>Rule</b> (C x t = k), where C represents the concentration, t, the time (duration) of exposure, and k, a constant toxic effect. All experiments used adult male, Long-Evans rats. Acute and repeated exposure to TCE increased hearing thresholds, and acute exposure to TCE impaired signal detection behavior and visual function. Examination of all three measures of neurotoxicity showed that if <b>Haber's</b> <b>Rule</b> were used to predict outcomes across exposure durations, the risk would be overestimated when extrapolating from shorter to longer duration exposures, and underestimated when extrapolating from longer to shorter duration exposures. For the acute effects of TCE on behavior and visual function, the estimated concentration of TCE in blood at th...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> is an approximation, useful {{with certain}} inhaled poisons under certain conditions, and Haber himself {{acknowledged}} {{that it was not}} always applicable. If a substance is efficiently eliminated in the host, for example, then Haber's Law breaks down in the limit of t approaching the order of the half-life of the drug, rewriting the equation as the integral ∫Cdt = constant for arbitrary varying C and elapsed time T. It is very convenient, however, because its relationship between [...] and [...] appears as a straight line in a log-log plot.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a fumigant {{is determined by}} the gas concentration and exposure time. Typically, the gas concentration and exposure time are equally important in fumigation efficacy and their relationship is expressed as Ct = k, where C is the concentration, t is the time and k is a constant (<b>Haber’s</b> <b>rule).</b> However, deviation from <b>Haber’s</b> <b>rule,</b> i. e., the relative importance of time over concentration, has been reported for several stored-product pests, and a modified form (Cn t = k) is used to express the relationship between C and t. This study aimed to determine if this modified form could be applied to phosphine fumigation of the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (F.). Adult beetles from six cultures with different phosphine-resistance levels were exposed to phosphine (1 – 2000 ppm) at 25 °C for either 24, 72, 120, or 168 h, and the phosphine concentration necessary to achieve 50 % lethality (LC 50) was calculated. The phosphine concentration (C) and the exposure time (t) relationship at the LC 50 for all six cultures were determined by regression analyses. The equation Cn t = k was a good fit for all the cultures tested, irrespective of phosphine resistance. The results showed the exponent n was less than 1 (0. 51 ≤ n ≤ 0. 71, coefficient of determination 0. 90 – 0. 99), suggesting that time is more important than concentration in toxicity expression of phosphine against L. serricorne. Therefore, extending the exposure time rather than increasing the concentration should be emphasized to manage the future threat of resistance problems with phosphine...|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred years}} ago, Warren {{established}} {{for the first time}} a quantitative link between dose and time while studying the toxicity of sodium chloride in Daphnia magna (Straus). During this century, many toxicologists in different contexts returned to this idea, which has become known as <b>Haber’s</b> <b>Rule</b> of inhalation toxicology. Most attempts to explore this relationship ended in frustration because of the observed deviations from it, which were unfortunately called exceptions. Thus, toxicologists concentrated on the quantitative relationship between dose and effect under mostly isotemporal conditions, while time was assigned such arbitrary, semiquantitative designations as acute, subacute, subchronic, and chronic. Time itself as a quantifiable variable of toxicity was seldom studied and when it was examined, it was often not done under isodosic (steady...|$|R
40|$|The {{risk from}} inhaled {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) is presently assessed {{on the basis of}} lifetime exposure to average concentrations of the vapor. This strategy yields rational predic-tions of risk if the product of concentration (C) and the duration of exposure (0 yields constant effects on health (<b>Haber's</b> <b>Rule).</b> The validity of this assumption was evaluated by assessing the acute behavioral effects of inhaled trichloroethylene (TCE) vapor at various values of C and t. Adult male Long-Evans rats (n = 11) were trained to perform a signal detection task in which a press on one lever produced food on trials containing a signal (a brief, unpredictable light flash); a press on a second lever produced food on trials lacking a signal. Response time (RT) and indices of sensitivity (SI) and bias (RT) derived from the theory of signal detection were calculated at three times during repeated daily 60 -min tests conducted in air containing 0, 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{assessments}} often {{must consider}} exposures that vary over time or {{for which the}} exposure duration of concern differs from the available data, {{and a variety of}} extrapolation procedures have been devised accordingly. The present experiments explore the relationship(s) between exposure concentration (C) and time (t) to investigate procedures for assessing the risks of short-term solvent exposures. The first hypothesis tested was that the product of C t would produce a constant health effect (<b>Haber’s</b> <b>rule).</b> The second hypothesis tested was that exposure conditions produce effects in proportion to the tissue concentrations created. Awake, adult, male Long-Evans (LE) rats were exposed to trichloroethyl-ene (TCE) vapor in a head-only exposure chamber while pattern onset/offset visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded. Expo-sure conditions were designed to provide C t products of 0 ppm/h (0 ppm for 4 h) or 4000 ppm/h created through four exposure scenarios: 1000 ppm for 4 h; 2000 ppm for 2 h; 3000 pp...|$|R
40|$|A model {{based on}} the concept of {{reduction}} in life expectancy (RLE model) as a result of long term exposure to toxicant has been developedwhich has normal life expectancy (NLT) as a fixed limiting point for a species. Themodel is {{based on the}} equation (LC 50 = a ln(LT 50) + b) where a and b are constants. It was evaluated by plotting ln LT 50 against LC 50 with data on organic toxicants obtained from the scientific literature. Linear relationships between LC 50 and ln LT 50 were obtained and a Calculated NLT was derived from the plots. The Calculated NLT obtained was in good agreement with the Reported NLT obtained from the literature. Estimation of toxicity at any exposure time and concentration is possible using the model. The use of NLT as a reference point is important since it provides a data point independent of the toxicity data set and limits the data to the range where toxicity occurs. This novel approach, which represents a departure from <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule,</b> can be used to estimate long term toxicity from limited available acute toxicity data for fish exposed to organic biocides.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{exposure}} time is an important concept in toxicity that is long recognised but less well understood. This effect is particularly important when the exposure time is long {{such as in the}} assessment of health risks of environmental contaminants. The {{effect of exposure}} time may also be considered to include the kinetic effect of toxicant uptake within the target organism. This makes it even more difficult to understand the processes involved. Traditionally, the effect of exposure time has been empirically correlated by the use of the <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> or its various modified forms. The basic premise of the <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> is that the product of exposure concentration and the corresponding exposure time when the toxic effect is observed is a constant. A lower exposure concentration leads to a longer exposure time, which is generally consistent with experimental observations. However, this relationship cannot be expected to hold true when the exposure concentration is low and/or the exposure time is long. This is because of the fact that, when the concentration approaches zero, the exposure time must approach infinite to keep the concentration time product constant. As living organisms have finite life expectancies, this requirement cannot physically be met. In our earlier study on the effects of long exposure time and internal lethal concentrations of nonspecific toxicants in fish, a simple mathematical model based on the concept of life expectancy reduction was developed. This Reduced Life Expectancy Model can be used to describe the relationship between internal lethal concentration (ILC 50) and the exposure period (LT 50). However, a major problem with the use of ILC 50 is the lack of ILC 50 data in the scientific literature. In this paper, another form of the Reduced Life Expectancy Model, in which the ILC 50 is replaced with the more commonly used LC 50, was used for the evaluation of the effects of exposure time on aquatic toxicity. A number of sets of toxicity data with different aquatic organisms and toxicants were evaluated with the Reduced Life Expectancy Model. Results indicated that while many of the experimental data sets can be satisfactorily correlated with the simple Reduced Expectancy Model, significant deviations occurred for some data sets. For these cases, a Two Stage Reduced Life Expectancy Model was further developed to satisfactorily correlate the data sets. The two stage model was {{based on the assumption that}} the time course of toxicants in the organism can have two phases in the peripheral system and the central system. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|A risk {{assessment}} of nutmeg-based plant food supplements (PFS) containing different alkenylbenzenes was performed {{based on the}} alkenylbenzene levels quantified {{in a series of}} PFS collected via the online market. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of the alkenylbenzenes amounted to 0. 3 to 312 μg kg- 1 body weight (bw) for individual alkenylbenzenes, to 1. 5 to 631 μg kg- 1 bw when adding up the alkenylbenzene levels assuming equal potency, and to 0. 4 to 295 μg kg- 1 bw when expressed in safrole equivalents using toxic equivalency factors (TEFs). The margin of exposure approach (MOE) was used to evaluate the potential risks. Independent of the method used for the intake estimate, the MOE values obtained were generally lower than 10000 indicating a priority for risk management. When taking into account that PFS may be used for shorter periods of time and using <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> to correct for shorter than lifetime exposure it was shown that limiting exposure to only 1 or 2 weeks would result in MOE values that would be, with the presently determined levels of alkenylbenzenes and proposed uses of the PFS, of low priority for risk management (MOE > 10000). It is concluded that {{the results of the present}} paper reveal that nutmeg-based PFS consumption following recommendations for daily intake especially for longer periods of time raise a concern...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHuman {{health risk}} {{assessment}} {{can be used}} to support decisions for public health regulations and actions. Characterizing the hazards of inhaled toxicants generally includes extrapolation from observations on experimental animals, subjected to intermittent or subchronic exposures, to a human environmental context with exposure that is usually continuous and long-term. The extrapolation is usually based on a simple linear relationship derived from <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> which assumes that, for a given chemical compound, multiplying the same concentration by the same duration of exposure will yield the same biological response. This study assessed the reliability of this assumption. The p-power in the equation C×t(p) =k was calculated for 21 chemicals, based on a comparison of LOAELs for subacute, subchronic and chronic durations. A bibliographic survey was then carried out to study the reliability of the intermittent-to-continuous exposure adjustment factors currently used in risk assessment. The results showed that the value of p, assumed to be 1 in risk assessment methodology, was not in fact equal to 1 for any of the selected chemicals. Moreover, in the case of respiratory tract irritation, the value of p varied from 0 to 0. 44, as confirmed by experimental studies. These results suggest that a more in-depth and case-by-case approach is required for regulatory toxicology, based on toxicokinetics and toxicodynamic data analysis for each toxicant before applying a temporal-adjustment factor...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades {{scientists}} have shown that the hormone system {{of a wide range of}} organisms can be affected by numerous environmental chemicals. Society strongly demands studies about the fate and effects of such endocrine disruptors on the aquatic environment. It has been scientifically accepted that risk assessment studies done in aquatic microcosms can be used to extrapolate the potential impact of the tested compound on natural ecosystems. Realistic exposure situations were simulated and screening methods as well as analytical methods with high accuracy were applied on water and sediment. For the comprehensive risk assessment as many trophic levels as possible have to be investigated. Changes in the population dynamics and the community structure serve as ecotoxicological endpoints. Modelling the concentrations of the chemicals in the different aquatic compartments complements and confirms the analytical diagnostics. A directed design of the analytical procedures according to amount of sample and limits of determination becomes possible. Bridging acute and chronic time scales in effect diagnostics the 'area under the curve' -approach has been followed in combination with multivariate statistics. <b>Haber's</b> <b>rule</b> have been applied to the results about complex effect- and exposure-conditions.

30|$|Experimental {{inhalation}} studies with irritant gases cannot {{be considered as}} a “one-size-fits-all” approach. In case the most critical effect occurs in the lower airways of the respiratory tract, water solubility and chemical reactivity produce a marked concentration-dependent anterior–posterior gradient of injury within the tract. Depending on the concentration inhaled, the irritant gas will be scrubbed in the upper airways of obligate nasal-breathing rodents, whereas it may reach the lower airways in oronasally breathing humans. Hence, the sites of retention and injury may differ appreciably in relation any chosen concentration × time (exposure duration) relationship. <b>Haber’s</b> <b>rule,</b> “Cn × t = constant effect” with n =  1, is fulfilled for phosgene but deviates for other gases. The inhaled dose (Cxt) may vary appreciably across species with different respiratory minute volumes. Animal models of the past attempted to overcome this rodent-specific shortcoming by delivering test agents into the lung by endotracheal tubes. In doing so, the retained dose of the gas within the tract may possibly be more human-like at first glance; however, the distribution of the inhaled dose relative to the inspired volume and concentration gradient within the tract remains uncertain. Anesthesia, dead-space volumes and rebreathing increase the dosimetric uncertainties as well. Accordingly, animal models need to be dosimetrically adjusted to a ‘human-equivalent dose’ to produce the same profile of lung injury. This process may require higher equivalent concentrations in rodents to overcome the loss of agent within the upper airways.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} {{exposure}} regimens {{of cigarette smoke}} {{have been used in}} animal models of lung diseases. In this study, we compared biological responses of smoke exposure in rats, using different smoke concentrations (wet total particulate matter [WTPM]), daily exposure durations, and total days of exposure. As a range-finding acute study, we first compared pulmonary responses between SD and F 344 strains after a single nose-only exposure to mainstream cigarette smoke or LPS. Secondly, F 344 rats were exposed to cigarette smoke for 2 or 13 weeks under the comparable daily exposure dose (WTPM concentration x daily exposure duration; ac-cording to <b>Haber’s</b> <b>rule)</b> but at a different WTPM concentration or daily exposure duration. Blood carboxylhemoglobin was increased linearly to the WTPM concentration, while urinary nicotine plus cotinine value was higher for the longer daily exposure than the corresponding shorter exposure groups. Gamma glutamyl transferase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was increased dose dependently after 2 and 13 weeks of cigarette smoke exposure, while the neutrophil content in BALF was not increased notably. Smoke-exposed groups showed reduced body weight gain and increased relative lung and heart weights. While BALF parameters and the relative lung weights suggest pulmonary responses, histopathological examination showed epithelial lesions mainly in the upper respiratory organs (nose and larynx). Collectively, the results indicate that, under the employed study design, the equivalent daily ex-posure dose (exposure concentration x duration) induces equivalent pulmonary responses in rats.
