30|$|These {{measures}} need to {{be viewed}} {{in the light of}} the premise of the basic business policy of promoting the mechanization of coalmining. Taiheiyo Coalmine’s mechanization was inevitable due to the company’s shift to undersea mining. While some mechanization was achieved in the prewar period, the mechanization (mining with shield supports and <b>drum</b> <b>cutters)</b> introduced in 1967 ultimately raised the company’s mechanization to world-class level (Osanai and Takasaki 2003 : 56). Consequently, the working method on Taiheiyo Coalmine’s coalmining site was different from the methods used by other mines. This will be explained in Section “Revision of the wage system in 1966 ”.|$|R

Both {{companies are}} proposing using modified existing technology. Nautilus Minerals, in partnership with Placer Dome (now part of Barrick Gold), succeeded in 2006 in returning over 10 metric tons of mined SMS to the surface using modified <b>drum</b> <b>cutters</b> mounted on an ROV, a world first. Neptune Minerals in 2007 succeeded in recovering SMS sediment samples using a modified oil industry suction pump mounted on an ROV, also a world first.|$|R
30|$|Naturally, a class {{system like}} this is {{effectively}} abolished once inequality of wages and other working terms have been solved. In Taiheiyo Coalmine’s case, the wage system was revised. In 1966, the company made a fundamental shift from the contract-based wage system unique to the coal industry, as previously explained, to a fixed wage system. Under the fixed wage system, employees received a fixed wage based on their respective job descriptions. Routine workers’ job duties were initially {{similar to those of}} single-skill workers. However, following the mechanization introduced in 1967 in the form of SD coalmining (using Shield supports and <b>Drum</b> <b>cutters),</b> routine workers became similar to cross-trained workers. More specifically, in 1969, Taiheiyo Coalmine introduced a worksite system called “broad job category,” under which each worker worked a number of jobs (Shimanishi 2013 : 16 – 18).|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} property, Hokutan also bought the rights for prison labor, so the miners mostly {{consisted}} of prisoners. It continued until 1894, when the Meiji government {{under the pressure}} of the public opinion led by Protestant prison director Ōinoue Terusaki (1848-1912), decided on the abolition of prison labour. The prisoners were substituted by other forms of recruitment as that of subcontractors (飯場制度, hanbaseidō) and direct recruitment as well as a thorough mechanization. In 1938, the Tokiwakō (常磐坑), two inclined shafts were mined. Along these the coal was transported towards the coal preparation plant. In 1952, these shafts were equipped with conveyor belts. When in 1967, the Horonai mine merged with the Shin-Horonai mine (新幌内炭鉱, shin Horonai tankō), these belts transported coal from a depth of 520 meters, over a distance of 2.720 meters towards the plant. The merged Hokutan Horonai mine was equipped with two modern deep shafts and used <b>drum</b> <b>cutters</b> since 1968, which made {{it one of the most}} modern mines of Japan.|$|R

The removal of the road surface {{has the potential to}} release respirable crystalline silica, to which workers can be exposed. This article describes an evaluation of respirable crystalline silica exposures to the operator and ground worker from two different half-lane and larger asphalt pavement milling machines that had ventilation dust controls and water-sprays designed and installed by the manufacturers. Manufacturer A completed milling for 1120 days at 4 highway construction sites in Wisconsin, and Manufacturer B completed milling for 1020 days at 7 highway construction sites in Indiana. To evaluate the dust controls, full-shift personal breathing zone air samples were collected from an operator and ground worker during the course of normal employee work activities of asphalt pavement milling at 11 different sites. Forty-two personal breathing zone air samples were collected over 2120 days (sampling on an operator and ground worker each day).

40|$|Background: Frictional {{ignitions}} {{continue to}} be a problem facing the U. S. underground coal mining industry. Many methane ignitions are associated with the impact of mining machine cutter bits on quartzitic material (e. g., sandstone) during the coal-cutting process. Most ignitions result in small methane-air fireballs often only a few feet in size and limited to the cutter head location. However, under certain conditions, frictional ignitions can lead to larger methane explosions and/or fires with the potential for causing serious injury or death to the mining machine operator and other nearby miners. The requirements for a frictional ignition are a flammable volume of methane-air and an ignition source. This source is usually the hot streak caused by the frictional impact of the mining bit on hard rock, and the frequency of occurrence increases with increased bit wear. Another possible ignition source is the frictional impact of rock on rock during a roof fall. In addition to flammable methane gas, some underground coal mines encounter heavier molecular weight liquid hydrocarbons that can generate flammable vapors. For example, a coal mine in Utah experienced significant inflows of liquid hydrocarbons, with approximately 1, 200 gal being pumped from the mine per day. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) reported that this mine experienced several ignitions, including one in 1998 that led to a significant fire. MSHA listed liquid hydrocarbons as contributing to this fire [Elkins et al. 2001]. On July 31 -August 1, 2000, there were multiple explosions and a fire at the same mine, resulting in 2 fatalities and 12 injuries. The MSHA investigation report listed methane and liquid hydrocarbons as contributing to the explosions and fire [McKinney et al. 2001]. Approach: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effect of added hydrocarbon liquids on the frictional ignition potential from the impact of mining bits on sandstone. The experiments were conducted in a laboratory test apparatus where a single miner bit on a <b>cutter</b> <b>drum</b> struck a sandstone block. The bit was worn so that the shank steel was exposed. A 100 -ft 3 mixture of flammable methane-air was enclosed by a plastic diaphragm that broke and vented the explosion after ignition. The relative ease of ignition was measured by the number of strikes necessary to cause ignition. Tests were conducted with flammable methane-air mixtures and with added liquid hydrocarbons on the sandstone block. The first series of tests was conducted to determine the number of strikes of the bit on the sandstone block necessary to ignite a flammable mixture of methane-air. With the <b>cutter</b> <b>drum</b> rotating, the sandstone block was moved horizontally in front of the cutter bit so {{that there would be a}} fresh surface for each strike of the bit. Additional tests were done with hydrocarbon liquid sprayed on the sandstone just before each test. Since hydrocarbon liquid samples No. 530 March 2008 from actual mines were not available for this study, a liquid hydrocarbon simulant was mixed based on the MSHA analyses of the hydrocarbons at the Utah mine [Elkins et al. 2001]. MSHA reported that "the hydrocarbons were tested and were determined to be chemically similar to a mixture of 15 % gasoline, 35 % diesel fuel, and 50 % motor oil" [Elkins et al. 2001]. Results: Using a worn bit, five tests were conducted with only methane-air in the test chamber. The mixture did not ignite in any of the five tests, with an average of greater than 90 strikes per test. An additional five tests were conducted with added liquid hydrocarbon simulant on the sandstone. The methane-air mixture ignited in each of these five tests, with an average of about 30 strikes to ignition. The explanation may be that the liquid hydrocarbon ignites more easily than methane, and then it forms a pilot flame that ignites the methane. The hydrocarbon vapors can ignite at significantly lower temperatures than the methane. Based on these results, NIOSH researchers determined that the presence of a hydrocarbon liquid in the mining environment has the potential to increase the ignition hazard associated with the frictional heating from impact of steel on sandstone. Recommendations: Improving the ventilation airflow should be the main method for reducing any flammable gas volume, thereby limiting the extent of flame propagation if a frictional ignition should occur. The frictional ignition probability decreases with new sharp bits. Replacing worn bits on a regular basis and using adequate back-mounted water sprays (that cool the frictional hot spots) have been shown to reduce the frictional ignition probability of methane when used on longwall and continuous mining machines. The increased fire and explosion hazard associated with the presence of heavy hydrocarbons can be estimated by collecting and measuring the flash point of the fresh hydrocarbon liquid. If the flash point is at or below the ambient mine temperature, the liquid can ignite and burn even without methane. If the flash point is above ambient temperature, the liquid hydrocarbon can enhance the ignition probability of methane. When using a handheld methanometer in the presence of heavier hydrocarbons, the instrument needs to be calibrated with gas mixtures that reflect the presence of the heavier hydrocarbon vapors. The instrument manufacturer should be contacted for advice on calibration procedures that will ensure accurate measurement of potentially flammable mixtures. In summary, extra precautions to prevent fires and explosions must be taken when heavier molecular weight liquid hydrocarbons are present in addition to methane in an underground coal mine.

40|$|With {{the aid of}} a DOE grant (No. DE-FC 26 - 01 NT 41050), Stolar Research Corporation (Stolar) {{developed}} the Horizon Sensor (HS) to distinguish between the different layers of a coal seam. Mounted on mining machine <b>cutter</b> <b>drums,</b> HS units can detect or sense the horizon between the coal seam and the roof and floor rock, providing the opportunity to accurately mine the section of the seam most desired. HS also enables accurate cutting of minimum height if that is the operator's objective. Often when cutting is done out-of-seam, the head-positioning function facilitates a fixed mining height to minimize dilution. With this technology, miners can still be at a remote location, yet cut only the clean coal, resulting in a much more efficient overall process. The objectives of this project were to demonstrate the feasibility of horizon sensing on mining machines and demonstrate that Horizon Sensing can allow coal to be cut cleaner and more efficiently. Stolar's primary goal was to develop the Horizon Sensor (HS) into an enabling technology for full or partial automation or ''agile mining''. This technical innovation (R&D 100 Award Winner) is quickly demonstrating improvements in productivity and miner safety at several prominent coal mines in the United States. In addition, the HS system can enable the cutting of cleaner coal. Stolar has driven the HS program on the philosophy that cutting cleaner coal means burning cleaner coal. The sensor, located inches from the cutting bits, is based upon the physics principles of a Resonant Microstrip Patch Antenna (RMPA). When it is in proximity of the rock-coal interface, the RMPA impedance varies depending on the thickness of uncut coal. The impedance is measured by the computer-controlled electronics and then sent by radio waves to the mining machine. The worker at the machine can read the data via a Graphical User Interface, displaying a color-coded image of the coal being cut, and direct the machine appropriately. The Horizon Sensor program began development in 1998 and experienced three major design phases. The final version, termed HS- 3, was commissioned in 2000 {{with the assistance of the}} DOE-Mining Industry of the Future program, commercialized in 2002, and has been used 14 times in 12 different mines within the United States. The Horizon Sensor has applications in both underground and surface mining operations. This technology is primarily used in the coal industry, but is also used to mine trona and potash. All horizon sensor components have Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) (United States) and IEC (International) certification. Horizon Sensing saves energy by maximizing cutting efficiency, cutting only desired material. This desired material is cleaner fuel, therefore reducing pollutants to the atmosphere when burned and burning more efficiently. Extracting only desired material increases productivity by reducing or eliminating the cleaning step after extraction. Additionally, this technology allows for deeper mining, resulting in more material gained from one location. The remote sensing tool allows workers to operate the machinery away from the hazards of cutting coal, including noise, breathing dust and gases, and coal and rock splintering and outbursts. The HS program has primarily revolved around the development of the technology. However, the end goal of the program has always been the commercialization of the technology and only within the last 2 years of the program has this goal been realized. Real-time horizon sensing on mining machines is becoming an industry tool. Detailed monitoring of system function, user experience, and mining benefits is ongoing...|$|R
