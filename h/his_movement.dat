5|$|Aspects of Raonic's game {{which have}} been criticized include his return of serve, quickness and mobility, backhand, short game, {{and the use of}} {{backspin}} or sidespin. His above-average height—196cm (6ft 5in)—is linked to his strong serve, but is said to limit <b>his</b> <b>movement</b> around the court.|$|E
5|$|Clarence13X's {{funeral was}} held {{four days after}} his death. It was {{attended}} by about 400 people and {{was followed by a}} procession through Harlem. His death put the leadership of <b>his</b> <b>movement</b> in question—there was no clear successor. At that time, his followers were primarily teenagers, and several of his top leaders subsequently struggled with drug addiction.|$|E

5|$|From 1980 to 1992 Raël and <b>his</b> <b>movement</b> became {{increasingly}} global. In 1980 Claude Raël's fifth Raëlian book Sensual Meditation was published and formal {{publication of the}} Raëlian Messages in the Japanese language began {{as part of the}} Raëlian mission to Japan. Two years later, Africa became another target area in the mission to spread the Raëlian messages.|$|E
5|$|The LaRouche {{criminal}} {{trials in}} the mid-1980s stemmed from federal and state investigations into the activities of American political activist Lyndon LaRouche and members of <b>his</b> <b>movement.</b> They were charged with conspiring to commit fraud and soliciting loans they {{had no intention of}} repaying. LaRouche and his supporters disputed the charges, claiming the trials were politically motivated.|$|E

5|$|According to biographer M.D. Gopalakrishnan, Periyar and <b>his</b> <b>movement</b> {{achieved}} a better status {{for women in}} Tamil society. Periyar held that in matters of education and employment {{there should be no}} difference between men and women. Gopalakrishnan states that Periyar's influence in the State departments and even the Center made it possible for women to join police departments and the army. Periyar also spoke out against child marriage.|$|E
5|$|Charles V of France {{maintained}} {{the terms of}} the treaty of Brétigny but encouraged others in Aquitaine to challenge the authority of the Plantagenets in Aquitaine. The prince, who had suffered a debilitating illness for nearly a decade which often restricted <b>his</b> <b>movement</b> to being carried in a litter, returned to England, where he soon died. John of Gaunt assumed leadership in France with limited success, and peace negotiations over several years were inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|I had viewed Hitler and <b>his</b> <b>movement</b> {{with some}} skepticism, {{but when the}} {{abolition}} of the multi-party mess removed the obscenity of unemployment, and the first 1,000 kilometers of autobahns opened up a new era of mobility, I too saw the light: this was the time when Churchill said he hoped Great Britain would have a man like Hitler in time of peril, and when high church dignitaries and distinguished academics paid the Führer homage.|$|E
5|$|Baćović joined Đurišić's {{forces in}} their trek towards Slovenia, {{alongside}} Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić, detachments commanded by Ostojić, {{and a large}} number of refugees, totaling around 10,000. This force was formed into the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, consisting of the 1st, 5th, 8th and 9th (Herzegovina) divisions. Earlier, Đurišić and Mihailović had argued over the best course of action. Đurišić had wanted to withdraw through Albania to Greece, but Mihailović had told him to prepare for an Allied landing, the return of the king and the establishment of a national government. From the time Đurišić joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, he was very critical of Mihailović's leadership and argued strongly for all remaining Chetnik troops to move to Slovenia. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to Slovenia independently of him, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's Serbian Volunteer Corps already in Slovenia to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist <b>his</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having {{held the}} Ashes since 1934 but critics {{considered}} England {{to have a}} good chance of winning the series. Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis. His health was uncertain and he was troubled by fibrositis which restricted <b>his</b> <b>movement</b> and adversely affected his fielding. He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test, and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians. After dropping three catches in Australia's first innings in the second Test, Hutton scored 145 runs in his first innings. However, he was dismissed early in the second innings; England managed to draw the match, but Hutton faced press criticism for his cautious tactics. Rain prevented a result in the third Test, but Hutton scored 66 and his tactics were praised. After the match, he was confirmed as captain for the remainder of the series, and the forthcoming MCC winter tour of West Indies.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} he joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, Đurišić was very {{critical}} of Mihailović's leadership, and argued strongly for all the remaining Chetnik troops {{to move to the}} area of the Ljubljana Gap in modern-day Slovenia. At this point Ostojić and Baćović were also questioning Mihailović's plans. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to the Ljubljana Gap independent of Mihailović, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's forces already in the Ljubljana Gap to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist <b>his</b> <b>movement.</b> When he left Mihailović, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić and the Chetnik detachments commanded by Ostojić and Baćović as well as a large number of refugees.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that he was completely honest and joined <b>his</b> <b>movement.</b> She had left her husband, alleging violent behavior, shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular {{gathering}} place {{in the basement of}} a Harlem tenement. He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish <b>his</b> <b>movement</b> from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E

5|$|One {{factor that}} helped Tillman and <b>his</b> <b>movement</b> in the 1890 {{campaign}} was {{the organization of}} many South Carolina farmers {{under the auspices of}} the Farmers' Alliance. The Alliance, which had spread through much of the agricultural South and West since its origin in Texas, sought to get farmers to work together cooperatively and seek reform. From that organization would come the People's Party (better known as the Populists). Although the Populist Party played a significant role in the politics of the 1890s, it did not do so in South Carolina, where Tillman had already channeled agricultural discontent into an attempt to take over the Democratic Party. The Alliance in South Carolina generally backed Tillman, and its many local farmers' organizations gave Tillman new venues for his speeches.|$|E
5|$|Đurišić's forces {{proceeded}} to north-eastern Bosnia to join Mihailović.

5|$|Although not gifted with pace, stamina, physicality or notable {{defensive}} skills, work-rate, or tackling abilities, Pirlo {{was known}} for his composure in possession, and drew praise for his touch, technique, balance, close control, and dribbling ability, as well as his flair and creativity in beating players with feints during one-on-one situations, in order to retain the ball and create space. As a playmaker, he is highly regarded by pundits for his outstanding vision, awareness, and football intelligence, as well as <b>his</b> <b>movement,</b> inventive play, anticipation, ability to read the game, and his wide range of distribution, which enabled him to play the ball first time and rarely relinquish possession, even when put under pressure; in addition to being capable of playing precise, short exchanges to teammates, he was also known for frequently attempting riskier and more difficult passes and is renowned in particular for his extremely accurate long-range passing, both on the ground or in the air, with either foot, despite being naturally right footed. He is considered {{to be one of the}} best passers in the history of the sport, and is also known for his accurate striking ability from distance. These characteristics allowed him to contribute to his team's offensive play with goals and assists.|$|E
