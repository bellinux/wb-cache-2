5|$|Tipu's Tiger has {{provided}} inspiration to poets, sculptors, artists {{and others from}} the nineteenth century to the present day. The poet John Keats saw Tipu's Tiger at the museum in Leadenhall Street and worked it into his satirical verse of 1819, The Cap and Bells. In the poem, a soothsayer visits the court of the Emperor Elfinan. <b>He</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> strange noise and thinks the Emperor is snoring.|$|E
5|$|In Mendota, Minnesota, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} apartment building {{after getting a}} tip, and sees a figure bolt {{out of one of}} the rooms during the night. <b>He</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> scratching sound and claws away at the fresh plaster wall until blood begins streaming downward. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found and one of her FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses that the victim hooked up with a psychotic killer at a bar. Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this murder to another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett wonders why anyone tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File.|$|E
5|$|During Kratos' {{ten years}} {{of service to the}} Olympian Gods, he is sent to the city of Attica to help defend it from the invading Persian army. After {{successfully}} killing the Persian King, decimating his army and slaying their pet basilisk, Kratos observes the Sun fall from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. As he fights his way through the city of Marathon, the Spartan witnesses the black fog of the Olympian Morpheus cover the land. <b>He</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> haunting flute melody, which he recognizes as a melody once played by his deceased daughter Calliope. Finding the Temple of Helios, Kratos is tasked by Athena to find the missing Sun God, as Morpheus has caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber in the absence of light. The Spartan eventually locates Helios' sister, Eos, who tells Kratos that the Titan Atlas has abducted her brother. Eos advises Kratos to seek the Primordial Fires, which he uses to awaken the fire steeds of Helios. The steeds take the Spartan to the Underworld, where he has two encounters with Charon at the River Styx. Although Charon initially defeats Kratos and banishes him to Tartarus, the Spartan returns and destroys the ferryman.|$|E

25|$|After that, Popov hears a human baby crying. Popov {{tries to}} locate {{the source of the}} sound but the crying stops as {{suddenly}} as it started. Since infants are not allowed to leave Earth, Popov assumes he had an auditory hallucination. Popov carries on his work with the robots. Now, <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> female voice pleading for help from somebody named Shura. Popov cannot locate the source of the voice either.|$|E
25|$|The {{pendulum}} is withdrawn {{into the}} ceiling, {{and the walls}} become red-hot and start to move inwards, forcing him slowly {{toward the center of}} the room and the pit. As he loses his last foothold and begins to topple in, <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> roar of voices and trumpets, the walls retract, and an arm pulls him to safety. The French Army has captured the city of Toledo and the Inquisition has fallen into its enemies' hands.|$|E
25|$|All {{sound is}} {{inherently}} powerful. If a hunter kills a lion {{he can see}} it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> lion he must act, fast, because {{the sound of the}} lion signals its presence and its power. Speech is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.|$|E
50|$|Mitchell and Lynda {{go to the}} house. She again {{claims to}} hear the sound, but Mitchell {{identifies}} it as a rattling heating system and fixes the problem. Just as {{he is about to}} leave <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>an</b> unambiguous voice crying for help.|$|R

The {{thought of his}} love for Éponine gives him courage. <b>He</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> chorus of voices {{approaching}} and hides in the tomb which bears his name. Éponine and her followers arrive bringing the urn for burial. After the funeral, she plans to kill herself. She is shocked when she thinks she hears a groan from the tomb.

25|$|Everybody {{has left}} Mars {{to go to}} Earth, except Walter Gripp—a single miner {{who lives in the}} {{mountains}} and does not hear of the departure. At first excited by his find of an empty town, he enjoys himself with money, food, clothes, and movies. He soon realizes he misses human companionship. One night <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> telephone ringing in someone's home, and suddenly realizes that someone else is alive on Mars. Missing the call, and several others, he sits down with a phone book of Mars and starts dialing at A.|$|E
25|$|Six months earlier, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe tries selling Paramount Pictures {{producer}} Sheldrake on a {{story he}} submitted.

Later, while fleeing from men trying to repossess his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> woman calling him, apparently mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, her butler, Joe recognizes the woman as almost-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning he is a writer, she asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the title role herself in a comeback attempt. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor.|$|E

500|$|On [...] "Blame Game", West {{attempts}} {{to call his}} past lover, but he receives a call back instead and <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> conversation between her and Chris Rock, who begins an extended monologue approximately five minutes into the song. [...] Chris Rock performs a vulgar, profanity-ridden sketch in which he compliments his lover's dress sense and sexual technique, and asks her who taught her these skills. Each time he asks, the answer is the same: [...] "Yeezy taught me.". Andy Gill of The Independent commented that a similar [...] "alliance of aristocratic piano and cello with less rarefied elements underpins 'Blame Game', a brutal rumination on West's sexual appetite".|$|E
500|$|Jordan {{had to wear}} a wig and a fake goatee for the episode. Thomas {{described}} Jordan's one-word {{response to}} the question [...] "Do we look like we smoke?" [...] as the best quip of the season. Thomas was also laudatory towards Jordan's character's reactions towards Veronica about events he secretly already knew, such as when <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> voicemail from Hank not recommending him for an internship. He thought that he played the lie realistically but that one could see through his façade upon a repeat viewing. Because the Dean O'Dell storyline was six episodes instead of the initially scheduled seven, some plot strands had to be removed from the final episode and story arc.|$|E

After the battle, Homer brings the empty, dented keg back to Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart {{in an attempt to}} get the deposit. There, <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> giggle coming from a closet and finds Apu making love with the woman who delivers Squishees to Kwik-E-Mart.

500|$|Outside, Merlin {{stands up}} for a servant who is being bullied by his master, but as the master {{turns out to be}} the King's spoiled son, Arthur (Bradley James), Merlin is imprisoned. For the second night in a row, <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> voice calling his name. Gaius frees him the next morning, though Merlin has to spend time in the stocks. There he meets Morgana's handmaiden Guinevere or [...] "Gwen" [...] (Angel Coulby), who commends him for being brave. Merlin confronts Arthur after being released, who tricks him into a fight with maces. Merlin keeps Arthur away using magic, which is met with ridicule by Gaius. Hearing the same voice calling his name that night, Merlin follows it to a cave where a dragon (John Hurt) informs him that he is destined to protect Arthur with his powers.|$|E
500|$|In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and as {{he comes}} out of the water he sees the Holy Spirit {{descending}} to him like a dove and <b>he</b> <b>hears</b> <b>a</b> voice from heaven declaring him to be God's Son (...) [...] This is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus [...] "Son", the other being the Transfiguration. The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by Satan (...) [...] Jesus then begins his ministry after John's arrest (...) [...] Jesus' baptism in Matthew is similar. Here, before Jesus' baptism, John protests, saying, [...] "I need to be baptized by you" [...] (...) [...] Jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism [...] "to fulfill all righteousness" [...] (...) [...] Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness (...) [...] In Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying (...) [...] John implicitly recognizes Jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him [...] ). Jesus' baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public ministry.|$|E

McSween serves Shepard with a warrant for her arrest on charges of prostitution in front of Beam who was visiting her. He offers them a deal. If they leave town within 24 hours, he won't chase them. She threatens to kill J.R. J.R. calls Dr. Rogers to take Sue Ellen away that night. J.R. hangs up on Leland who is continuing to threaten him. Sue Ellen continues to ponder the gun and tucks it in her purse before heading out somewhere. Cliff visits Digger Barnes' grave. He apologizes to his dad that he let J.R. beat him like Jock had beaten the father. J.R. is at the office at night when Rogers arrives at Southfork to cart Sue Ellen away.

Upon arriving, he is met by a Council Page, who tells him that the council of immortal Gnosticenes have been kidnapped by the Shikadi and taken [...] "to the Shadowlands far to the west", leaving monsters and traps to guard them.
