40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the fluctuating phenomena in the wake was investigated to NACA 0008 and NACA 0015 blades with experimentally. It's found that when the attack angle a is small, the periodic fluctuating phenomenon emerges in the wake for both type blades. This phenomenon is the Karman vortex street which generates from the separation of a laminar boundary layer upstream of the trailing edge and from {{the formation of a}} <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region.</b> At NACA 0008 blade the frequency of the Karman vortex formation falls with the attack angle increasing, because the separation of the laminar boundary layer occurs mainly on the suction surface and the <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> becomes large as a attack angle increases. At NACA 0015 blade, the frequency of the Karman vortex formation increases with the attack angle in'creasing, because the separation occurs mainly on the pressure surface and the <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> becomes small as the attack angle increases. When the attack angle more increases, the Karman vortex street disappers for both blades because of the boundary layer on both surface of the blade attached before the trailing edge and no <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> formed. When the attack angle is very large, the flow of suction side separates near the leading edge and the large <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> forms so the Karman vortex street emerges and it's frequersy is very low...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of {{the wake of a}} rotating flat plate with a large attack angle were investigated experimentally with special attention of the flow near the tip of the plate. When the tip clearance is small, the <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> becomes large towards the tip of the plate and the shear layer of the suction side of the plate curves outward {{as a result of the}} accumulation of low-energy fluid. On the other hand, when the tip clearance is large, the leakage flow is so large that the leakage vortex is generated from the trailing edge of the suction side and the shear layer forms by contacting the leakage flow and the <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region.</b> The variations of the flow rate and the momentum of the wake flow are closely related to those of the leakage flow...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made into the mechanism of discrete frequency noise (DFN) generation from a NACA 0012 blade placed in a uniform oncoming flow. It was clarified that DFN was generated when the boundary layer on the blade surface was laminar and separated at the location upstream of the trailing edge. A <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> was formed just after {{the trailing edge of}} the blade. Therefore a Karman vortex street occurred. Meanwhile we could not observe a close relationship between the existence of a separation bubble and the generation of DFN. That is, DFN was generated even when the attack angle of the flow was nearly zero and no separation bubble was observed. When a separation bubble existed, the boundary layer became turbulent and the flow did not separate up to the trailing edge, so a <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> was not formed behind the blade, which resulted in the disappearance of DFN. The prediction of the sound pressure level of DFN generated from this stream lined blade by Fukano's theory for a flat plate model agreed well with the measured value...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The main {{aerodynamic}} features which are characteristic for a blunt based bluff body are the large region of separated and recirculating flow behind the body, a large pressure drag and highly unstable wake. The abrupt geometrical {{change at the}} base of the bluff body leads to flow separation and the formation of a <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region.</b> It is the low base pressure within the wake that is mainly responsible for the pressure drag of bluff bodies...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} to determine the geometrical configuration of an aeroassisted transfer vehicle with a high lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) are described and the constraints imposed on this type of entry vehicle are considered. The aerodynamic characteristics of three configurations, a flat-plate delta wing, a truncated straight cone, and a truncated bent biconic are compared. The effect of viscosity {{is included in the}} analysis which examines the rounding of the sharp leading edges. It is shown that, under the constraints of carrying a given volume in the <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region,</b> the values of L/D are similar for each configuration and that a small blunt leading edge only slightly affects each vehicle's aerodynamic performance, causing less than a 5 percent drop in L/D. The truncated bent biconic is found to be the only configuration that provides the necessary stabilizing moments...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of {{the wake of a}} blunt body near its tip were investigated experimentally. When the tip clearance is large, the downwash flow is so large that the radial component of the velocity in the wake promotes mixing and diffusion of the wake. Therefore the velocity recovery is rapid and the width of the wake increases quickly in the wake. The velocity fluctuation in the wake becomes irregular, and vortex shedding disappears near the tip of the body. On the other hand when the tip clearance is small, the downwash flow is weak and near the tip of the body the <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> becomes large as a result of gathering the low energy fluid. So the mixing and diffusion in the wake are inactive, and the regularity of the velocity fluctuation in the wake is kept up to the tip of the body...|$|E

40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} {{phases of the}} subject investigation are described. The analytical program for the single jet determines the terminal shock location, the jet boundary, the interface profile, the bow shock profile, the shear layer growth and the <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> pressure. The experimental program described was conducted over the range from free stream Mach 0. 4 to 2. 0 at angles-of-attack up to 18 deg and at thrusting coefficients up to C sub T = T/q sub infinity A sub m = 30. Variables investigated included aeroshell angle, number of nozzles, engine thrust, size of nozzles, nozzle throttling and gas composition. The influence of these variables on the aeroshell stability, drag, and loads was determined by integrating pressure measurements on the aeroshell. The total system forces consist of components due to pure thrust and components due to pressure on the aeroshell arising from the jet-free stream interaction. Shadowgraphs provided flow field geometries which proved to be within 10 % of those predicted analytically...|$|E
40|$|We {{researched}} the fluctuating flow {{on the three}} types airfoils in the transition region of Reynolds number. The visual technique with the video recorder was used. It {{was found that the}} core of the wake vortex was clear at the low Reynolds number (Re= 5450), but not clear at the high Reynolds number (Re= 26900), because of the dissipation of the shear flow just before the wake vortex rolling up. And the width of the <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> was one of the important parameters for generating the wake vortices (Karmman Vortex) so that the wide width of it made the wake vortex roll up near the trailing edge of the blade, but the narrow width of it made at far downstream of the blade. The position of the rolling-up vortex tended to the trailing edge at the high Reynolds number because the fluctuation of the shear layer increased. When the wake vortex rolled up from the shear layer directly near the trailing edge, not from the wake after the both side shear layers going together, the fluctuating flow on the blade was occurred...|$|E
40|$|We {{researched}} the fluctuating flow characteristics on three types airfoils, NACA 0008, NACA 0015 and NACA 65710 {{in the transition}} Reynolds Numbers (Re= 5450 ～ 120000). The visual technique with the video recorder and the camera was used. It {{was found that the}} Karman Vortex shedding (wake vortex) was generated in all Reynolds numbers at small attack angles. The core of the wake vortex was clear at the low Reynolds number (Re= 5450), but not clear when the Reynolds number increased (Re= 16300 ～ 120000), Because the dissipation on the shear flow occured just before rolling up of the wake vortex at high Reynolds number. There were two patterns of rolling up of the wake vortex that one was rolling up from the separated boundary layer of the airfoil and another was rolling up in the wake. At the case of rolling up in the wake, the wake voetex was rolling up near the trailing edge of the airfoil at high Reynolds number, but it was rolling up at far downstream of the airfoil at the low Reynolds number. At the case of rolling up from the separeated boundary layer, the wake vortex was always rolling up just behind the <b>dead</b> <b>air</b> <b>region</b> which was generated between two separated shear layears at the trailing edge. When the attack angle increased, the separation bubble on the suction side was generated near the leadind edge, then the turbulent boundary layer developed to the trailing edge. In this case the wake vortex was not rolling up and the dissipated wake was generated, This phenomenon often occuered when the Reynolds number increased...|$|E
