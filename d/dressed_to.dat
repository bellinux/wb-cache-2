5|$|TNA {{management}} {{were very}} upset with Sean Waltman after {{he failed to}} appear {{to participate in the}} Four Way Elimination Tag Team match. This anger was due to Waltman being one-half of the winners of the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament. Despite not appearing on the show, Waltman was in Orlando and <b>dressed</b> <b>to</b> compete, but did not arrive at the arena in time. Waltman was not used by TNA until January15, 2006 when he appeared at their Final Resolution PPV event.|$|E

In 1993, she introduced a successful pattern line for Simplicity Patterns, {{a collection of}} large-sized patterns based on her H-O-A-X body shapes. From 1997-99, she designed and presented a ready-to-wear clothing and accessory line for The Home Shopping Network, called [...] "Personality" [...] by Mary Duffy. The line was based on her theory that there are four distinct fashion personalities, which are defined by individual motivation: The Classic who <b>dresses</b> <b>to</b> be appropriate; The Dramatic who <b>dresses</b> <b>to</b> be noticed; The Casual who <b>dresses</b> <b>to</b> be comfortable; and The Artistic who <b>dresses</b> <b>to</b> be unique.|$|R

5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was <b>dressed</b> <b>to</b> fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were <b>dressed</b> <b>to</b> create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E
5|$|Waltman was {{not used}} again by TNA until their Final Resolution PPV event on January 15, 2006. There, Waltman {{defeated}} Raven in a Raven's Rules match, forcing Raven to leave TNA in the storyline. Waltman {{was not used}} by the company due to management being angered by his failure to participate at Unbreakable. Despite him not showing up to the event, Waltman was in Orlando and <b>dressed</b> <b>to</b> compete, but did not arrive at the arena in time.|$|E
5|$|In 1769, Day and his {{barrister}} friend, John Bicknell, chose Sabrina {{and another}} girl, Lucretia, from orphanages, and falsely declared {{they would be}} indentured to Day's friend Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Day took the girls to France to begin Rousseau's methods of education in isolation. After a short time, he returned to Lichfield with only Sabrina, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment. He used unusual, eccentric, and sometimes cruel, techniques to try to increase her fortitude, such as firing blanks at her skirts, dripping hot wax on her arms, and having her wade into a lake fully <b>dressed</b> <b>to</b> test her resilience to cold water.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex {{in a shop}} window in the third episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was <b>dressed</b> <b>to</b> look like a charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car comes through the shop window before setting it up on location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges {{were placed on the}} glass to achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in that episode herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E

As lead actress, she starred in Brian De Palma's 1980 erotic crime thriller <b>Dressed</b> <b>to</b> Kill, for which she received a Saturn Award for Best Actress.|$|E

25|$|At {{his court}} martial at Halifax the Board acquitted Hunter {{for the loss}} of Laura. The {{combination}} of Lauras loss and the fact Diligent had also had heavy casualties of nine killed and 10 wounded provided clear evidence that Hunter had done his utmost. However, the board condemned Seaman James Cooper, who had surrendered Laura while Hunter was having his wounds <b>dressed,</b> <b>to</b> death. Later his sentence was reduced to seven years transportation.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} attack seem more convincing, the Germans murdered Franciszek Honiok, a 43-year-old {{unmarried}} German Silesian Catholic farmer known for sympathizing with the Poles. He {{had been arrested}} the previous day by the Gestapo. He was <b>dressed</b> <b>to</b> look like a saboteur, then killed by lethal injection, given gunshot wounds, and left dead at the scene so that he {{appeared to have been}} killed while attacking the station. His corpse was subsequently presented to the police and press as proof of the attack.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Lovie Austin {{decided to}} make Chicago her home, and she lived and worked there {{for the rest of}} her life. She was often seen racing around town in her Stutz Bearcat with leopard skin upholstery, <b>dressed</b> <b>to</b> the teeth. Her early career was in vaudeville, where she played piano and {{performed}} in variety acts. Accompanying blues singers was Lovie's specialty, and can be heard on recordings by Ma Rainey ("Moonshine Blues), Ida Cox ("Wild Women Don't Have the Blues"), Ethel Waters ("Craving Blues"), and Alberta Hunter ("Sad 'n' Lonely Blues").|$|E

25|$|Fig {{also played}} all the drums {{on the next}} album, Unmasked, {{although}} he was uncredited, and Criss appeared on the cover. Showcasing a slick, contemporary pop sound, Unmasked (released May 20, 1980) had the dubious {{distinction of being the}} first Kiss album since <b>Dressed</b> <b>to</b> Kill to not achieve platinum sales. Soon after the album's release, Criss' departure was officially announced. Fig was considered a member of KISS for one day following the departure of Criss; he was fired by Stanley and Simmons, who felt he was not a good fit for the band.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 Brian De Palma, who {{directed}} Carrie, wanted Liv Ullmann {{to play the}} role of Kate Miller in the erotic crime thriller <b>Dressed</b> <b>to</b> Kill and offered it to her, but she declined because of the violence. The role subsequently went to Angie Dickinson. In 1982 Ingmar Bergman wanted Ullmann to play the main character Emelie Ekdahl in his last feature film, Fanny and Alexander and wrote the role with this in mind. But Ullmann felt the role was too sad and declined. Liv Ullmann later stated in interviews that turning it down was one of the few things she really regrets.|$|E
25|$|For many film-goers, De Palma's gangster films, {{most notably}} Scarface and Carlito's Way, pushed the {{envelope}} of on-screen violence and depravity, and yet greatly vary {{from one another}} in both style and content and also illustrate De Palma's evolution as a film-maker. In essence, the excesses of Scarface contrast with the more emotional tragedy of Carlito's Way. Both films feature Al Pacino {{in what has become}} a fruitful working relationship. In 1984, he directed the music video of Bruce Springsteen's song Dancing in the Dark. The 1980s were denoted by De Palma's other films <b>Dressed</b> <b>To</b> Kill, Blow Out, and Body Double.|$|E

25|$|De Palma {{is known}} for quoting and {{referencing}} other directors' work throughout his career. Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup and Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation plots {{were used for the}} basis of Blow Out. The Untouchables finale shoot out in the train station is a clear borrow from the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin. The main plot from Rear Window was used for Body Double, while it also used elements of Vertigo. Vertigo was also the basis for Obsession. <b>Dressed</b> <b>to</b> Kill was a note-for-note homage to Hitchcock's Psycho, including such moments as the surprise death of the lead actress and the exposition scene by the psychiatrist at the end.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of film, New York City was {{characterized}} as urbane and sophisticated. By the city's crisis period in the 1970s and early 1980s, however, films like Midnight Cowboy, The French Connection, Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver, Marathon Man, Cruising, <b>Dressed</b> <b>to</b> Kill, and Death Wish showed New York as full of chaos and violence. With the city's renaissance in the 1980s and 1990s came new portrayals on television; Friends, Seinfeld, and Sex and the City showed life in the city to be glamorous and interesting. Nonetheless a disproportionate number of crime dramas, such as Law & Order, continue to make criminality in the city as their subject even as New York has become the safest large city in the United States in the last two decades.|$|E
25|$|John F. Kelly {{was born}} in Boston, Massachusetts on June 29, 1901. He broke into the film {{industry}} in 1928 when he was cast as the chauffeur in the Fox silent film, Blindfold. He would work in two more Fox films in 1928, both directed by Irving Cummings. The first was <b>Dressed</b> <b>To</b> Kill, starring Mary Astor, where he played the supporting role of Biff Simpson; while the second was in the small role of a window-washer in Romance of the Underworld, again starring Astor. In 1929 he appeared in only one film, {{in the role of}} O'Farrell in the Warner Bros. film, From Headquarters, starring Monte Blue. Kelly's first appearance in a sound film, was in 1930's The Man Hunter, with its canine hero Rin Tin Tin.|$|E
