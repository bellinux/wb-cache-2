5|$|As the MacBook Pro uses a {{different}} hardware platform from earlier PowerPC (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, cannot emulate some lower-level PPC code, {{and does not}} support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features. Rosetta <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in Lion and later, so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.|$|E
5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E

5|$|If a cell {{containing}} {{the key is}} found, the search returns the value from that cell. Otherwise, if an empty cell is found, the key cannot be in the table, {{because it would have}} been placed in that cell in preference to any later cell that has not yet been searched. In this case, the search returns as its result that the key <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in the dictionary.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} do so by simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that are stored in a position later than the emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present.</b> Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction {{may have contributed to}} the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in the quarto edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore uncertain {{whether or not it was}} written by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Some {{varieties}} of eels, {{which are a}} primary food source for banded sea kraits, may have coevolved resistance to banded sea krait venom. Gymnothorax moray eels taken from the Caribbean, where the banded sea krait <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present,</b> died after injection with doses as small as 0.1mg/kg body weight, but Gymnothorax individuals taken from New Guinea, where banded sea kraits are endemic, were able to tolerate doses as large as 75mg/kg without severe injury.|$|E

5|$|WASP-13b is an {{extrasolar planet}} that was {{discovered}} in 2008 in the orbit of the sunlike star WASP-13. The planet has a mass of nearly half that of Jupiter, but a radius five-fourths the size of Jupiter. This low relative mass might {{be caused by a}} core that is of low mass or that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present</b> at all.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present</b> throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E

5|$|For {{implementing}} associative arrays, hash tables, a {{data structure}} that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records; most implementations require only amortized constant time on average. However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, {{as the only}} information given on a failed search is that the target <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. In addition, all operations possible on a sorted array can be performed—such as finding the smallest and largest key and performing range searches.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} (HD) is {{a common}} genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present</b> at birth but develops with age. Hip dysplasia is diagnosed by X-rays, {{but it is not}} usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe HD, X-rays may not always indicate the disease. In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages {{more often}} on the foliage of the grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata) over other trees, though it does also show some {{preference}} for narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra) if grey gum <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>present.</b> Red wattlebirds tend to oust noisy friarbirds (Philemon corniculatus) if both species were present. The red wattlebird often forages alongside the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), little friarbird (P. citreogularis), western and little wattlebirds, rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus), purple-crowned lorikeet (Glossopsitta porphyrocephala), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), pied currawong (Strepera graculina) and crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), though they generally chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of eucalypt flowers.|$|E
