40|$|In {{this article}} I use pooled time series data {{from more than}} 500 {{agencies}} in thirteen states to assess the effects of agency head selection methods on levels of gubernatorial support for agency budget requests and expansion of agency budgets. I find that elected agency heads from the governor’s political party receive greater support for both short-term budget success (the current request) and long-term success (increases to the previous year’s budget). Elected officials from the opposition party to the governor do not receive the additional gubernatorial support for budget requests or growth.

The Senate was slightly more supportive of sealift programs than was the House.

40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the history of}} budget reform in the United States indicates a perpetual tug of war between the executive and legislative branches of government for power. But surprisingly, in spite of this highly charged political process, there exists a consistent and common thread of concern for improving government performance and a desire to inject more “rationality” (measurement and evaluation) into budgeting decisions. In the past century, U. S. federal budget reforms have been centralizing (the Budget Act of 1921), activity-based (performance budgeting of the 1950 s), focused on program evaluation (PPBS in the 1960 s), management-oriented (MBO in the early 1970 s), bottom-up (ZBB in the mid- 1970 s), draconian (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings of the 1980 s), and concerned with results (GPRA in the 1990 s). Unfortunately, establishing a direct link between and among performance measurement, program evaluation and <b>final</b> <b>appropriations</b> remains elusive. In the U. S. today, the stakes have become too significant and entrenched. The sheer size of the U. S. federal budget as well as the dramatic change in the nature of federal expenditures (from predominantly supporting government administration to funding transfer payments to individuals) ups the ante of the politics of the public budgeting process. Perhaps more importantly, the overwhelming U. S. federal deficit and debt simply overshadow consideration of performance as the President and Congress mull over literally billions of dollars in cuts to the current and next fiscal year budgets. ...|$|E

However, ATP continues to be supported, although at levels below that achieved in FY 1995 when the activity was expanded significantly. The FY 2005 appropriations were 20 % lower than the earlier fiscal year.

"July 2011 "With a massive budget deficit and an ever-increasing national debt, while Congress and the President almost shut down the federal government over funding for Planned Parenthood in 2011, defense spending seems to be nearly immune to cuts. Scholars think of defense spending in two different ways. The conventional wisdom states that, as voters have little interest in foreign affairs, elites decide foreign and defense policy. On the other hand, public policy researchers emphasize the strong influence of public preference over Congressional budget making. Is defense spending used as a de facto jobs program, or does it truly reflect the needs of the American military?
