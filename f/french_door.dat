25|$|French {{doors are}} derived from an {{original}} French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels {{would be in a}} casement door. A <b>French</b> <b>door</b> traditionally has a moulded panel {{at the bottom of the}} door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} owner made further alterations to {{the house}} in 1902. The owner added a 20-foot (6.1 m) by 12 foot (3.7 m) Victorian front porch, complete with a gable roof and Victorian style wood tracery. He also reversed the home's staircase and filled in all four original fireplaces. During the 1940s the home underwent further remodeling, in part, to modernize the building. Inside, modern plumbing was added and outside a frame one car garage was attached to the west end of the house. The 1902 porch was torn off the east facade, thus restoring it to its original appearance. In addition, the pillars {{on the south side of}} the house were replaced with square designs and a <b>French</b> <b>door</b> was cut into the north facade to open onto a brick terrace.|$|E
25|$|A <b>French</b> <b>door</b> {{consists}} of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a French window, as it resembles a door-height casement window. When a pair of French doors {{is used as a}} French window, the application does not generally include a central mullion (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An espagnolette bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} elevation is timber {{framed and}} enclosed with glass windows and <b>French</b> <b>doors,</b> and houses service facilities. The southern elevation, extended during the 1990s, is timber framed with large windows with breezeway, <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> and a corrugated iron roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{main entrance}} from Herbert Street is raised several steps above the footpath. Recessed from the alignment {{the front doors}} are a pair of half-glazed <b>French</b> <b>doors.</b> A series of <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> provide access from the upper level to the verandah.|$|R
50|$|The {{verandah}} has a timber {{floor and}} elegant cast-iron grille columns supporting the concave roof. The {{underside of the}} verandah roof is lined with tongue and groove boards. A timber hand rail and modern wrought iron balustrade run between the columns. The main doorway is in {{the centre of the}} northern facade with three sets of <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> to the east and two sets of <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> and a bay window to the west. All the <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> have external shutters.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} 1838 {{structure was}} relatively small; only two storeys tall with a full-height, central, curved bay, and an accordingly curved pediment on top, the villa {{was designed by}} Thomas McKay (who had also designed and built Earnscliffe) in a Regency style, inspired {{by the work of}} architect Sir John Soane, who had himself designed a never realised government house for the then capital of Upper Canada, York, in 1818. Unlike the present arrangement, the rooms of the McKay villa for entertaining, sleeping, and service were dispersed throughout the two floors of the structure, with the main parlour located on the second level, in an oval room behind the curved, south bay, which National Capital Commission Chief Architect David Scarlett said in 2014 was made in such a shape so as to display the advanced abilities of McKay's stonemasons. The main entrance to the house was on the west side and opened into a hall with stairs to the upper floor directly ahead. Along the south front were a library, a dining room, and a boudoir, all with French doors opening onto a narrow balcony; the dining room was served by three of these doors, one of which now opens into the Tent Room's antechamber, one into the Long Gallery, and one that still opens to the outside. The <b>French</b> <b>door</b> originally opening from the boudoir is today the window of the Pauline Vanier Room.|$|E
60|$|And she, wicked {{that she}} was, admired {{every detail of}} his drawing-room. It was a {{pleasant}} room indeed, with roses outside the <b>French</b> <b>door,</b> and a lawn in sunshine beyond, with bright red flowers in beds. But indoors, it was insistently antique. Alvina admired the Jacobean sideboard and the Jacobean arm-chairs and the Hepplewhite wall-chairs and the Sheraton settee and the Chippendale stands and the Axminster carpet and the bronze clock with Shakespeare and Ariosto reclining on it--yes, she even admired Shakespeare on the clock--and the ormolu cabinet and the bead-work foot-stools and the dreadful SÃ¨vres dish with a cherub in it and--but why enumerate. She admired everything! And Dr. Mitchell's heart expanded in his bosom till he felt it would burst, unless he either fell at her feet or did something extraordinary. He had never even imagined {{what it was to}} be so expanded: what a delicious feeling. He could have kissed her feet in an ecstasy of wild expansion. But habit, so far, prevented his doing more than beam.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} shrewd and windy, and the chamber {{none of the}} warmest. An old, long-faced, long-bodied servant in quaint livery, who {{attended}} upon my uncle, threw down an armful of wood beside the fire-place, gave a queer look about the room, and then wished him bon repos, with a grimace and a shrug {{that would have been}} suspicious from any other than an old French servant. The chamber had indeed a wild, crazy look, enough to strike any one who had read romances with apprehension and foreboding. The windows were high and narrow, and had once been loop-holes, but had been rudely enlarged, as well as the extreme thickness of the walls would permit; and the ill-fitted casements rattled to every breeze. You would have thought, on a windy night, some of the old Leaguers were tramping and clanking about the apartment in their huge boots and rattling spurs. A door which stood ajar, and like a true <b>French</b> <b>door</b> would stand ajar, in spite of every reason and effort to the contrary, opened upon a long, dark corridor, that led the Lord knows whither, and seemed just made for ghosts to air themselves in, when they turned out of their graves at midnight. The wind would spring up into a hoarse murmur through this passage, and creak the door to and fro, as if some dubious ghost were balancing in its mind whether to come in or not. In a word, it was precisely the kind of comfortless apartment that a ghost, if ghost there were in the chateau, would single out for its favourite lounge.|$|E
50|$|A central hallway is {{entered by}} means of a large door {{surrounded}} by sidelights and an opening fan light, and the hall exits through a similar door to the rear verandah. To the north-east of the hall are three bedrooms. The western-most bedroom is larger than the other two, and has a bay window with three large double-hung windows that can be opened from floor level, overlooking the north-west verandah. This master bedroom also has a set of <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> to the north-east verandah. The centre bedroom also has a bay window set with <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> narrowly protruding onto the north-east verandah, with another set of <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> adjacent to the bay. The eastern-most bedroom has sets of <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> to both the north-east and south-east verandahs.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} arrangement of rooms demonstrates an early layout. The rectangular core comprises three rooms, each with <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> {{opening to the}} southern (front) verandah. There is no central hallway, but there are single leaf doors opening between these rooms. The central room is the larger, with two pairs of <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> in the southern elevation and another opening into an entrance vestibule on the enclosed northern verandah. <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> also open from the eastern and western rooms to the formerly open side verandahs, which have been enclosed as sunrooms.|$|R

50|$|When Sathish agrees, Vijay {{explains}} {{his plan to}} murder Latha the following evening. His plan consists of taking Anand to a party while leaving Latha at home and hiding the latchkey outside {{the front door of}} their house. Sathish will then sneak in when Latha is asleep and hide behind the curtains in front of the <b>French</b> <b>door</b> to the gardens. At 10:50, Vijay will telephone the house from the party so that when she answers the phone, Sathish can kill Latha. He will then leave the <b>French</b> <b>door</b> open and exit through the front door, hiding the key again while leaving signs that suggests a burglary has gone wrong.|$|E
50|$|East of {{the blind}} middle bay is a one-story bay window with stone facing {{covering}} most of the brick. Its central facet has another, more deeply recessed <b>French</b> <b>door</b> with alternating long and short panes topped by a similar transom; the flanking facets have similar windows, shorter and narrower. Beneath them the brick is exposed. Another balustraded balcony rises above a damaged cornice; a <b>French</b> <b>door,</b> no longer present, provides access. In the middle bay is an elliptical window {{identical to the one}} in the second story of the west facade; the west bay has an intact casement with elongated middle and transom. Two dormers pierce the mansard on the attic level.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground floor}} has {{a series of}} small windows which are located {{directly}} below the rendered section, whilst the first floor elevations incorporate large glazed sections.
