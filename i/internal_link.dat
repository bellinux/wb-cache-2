50|$|In the Lee approximation, it {{is assumed}} that each <b>internal</b> <b>link</b> between stages is already {{occupied}} by a call with a certain probability p, and that this is completely independent between different links. This overestimates the blocking probability, particularly for small r. The probability that a given <b>internal</b> <b>link</b> is busy is p = uq/m, where q is the probability that an ingress or egress link is busy. Conversely, the probability that a link is free is 1&minus;p. The probability that the path connecting an ingress switch to an egress switch via a particular middle stage switch is free is the probability that both links are free, (1&minus;p)2. Hence the probability of it being unavailable is 1&minus;(1&minus;p)2 = 2p&minus;p2. The probability of blocking, or the probability that no such path is free, is then 1&minus;(1&minus;p)2m.|$|E

These results are at the end of the chain of {{reasoning}} of your DA (starts with your <b>link</b> with <b>internal</b> <b>links</b> spanning over the Brink with Uniqueness and lead to the Impact), then continuing along with the example, an impact would be that economic collapse may cause nuclear war. The Impact is the edge of the sword of your DA and is usually a significantly bad event caused by inertia evident through the <b>internal</b> <b>links</b> inside the link off over the brink and uniquely so.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{conventional}} to {{have the}} top row of jacks wired at the rear to outputs and bottom row of jacks wired to inputs. Patch bays may be half-normal (usually bottom) or full-normal, [...] "normal" [...] indicating that {{the top and bottom}} jacks are connected internally. When a patch bay has bottom half-normal wiring, then with no patch cord inserted into either jack, the top jack is internally linked to the bottom jack via break contacts on the bottom jack; inserting a patch cord into the top jack will take a feed off that jack while retaining the <b>internal</b> <b>link</b> between the two jacks; inserting a patch cord into the bottom jack will break the <b>internal</b> <b>link</b> and replace the signal feed from the top jack with the signal carried on the patch cord. With top half-normal wiring, the same happens but vice versa. If a patch bay is wired to full-normal, then it includes break contacts in both rows of jacks.|$|E

5000|$|Internal links {{are often}} {{undesirable}} things by themselves, {{and could be}} considered impacts. However, {{the worst of the}} consequences, or the final one in the chain of events, is usually given the label of [...] "impact". For example, nuclear war is probably worse than economic collapse, so nuclear war is given the [...] "impact" [...] label, even though economic collapse (the <b>internal</b> <b>link)</b> could itself be viewed as an impact.|$|E
5000|$|However, these {{definitions}} become clouded {{when the}} same organization operates multiple domains functioning as a single web experience, e.g. when a secure commerce website is used for purchasing things displayed on a non-secure website. In these cases, links that are [...] "external" [...] by the above definition can conceivably be classified as [...] "internal" [...] for some purposes. Ultimately, an <b>internal</b> <b>link</b> points to a web page or resource in the same root directory.|$|E

Students rated application status, requesting information by a mailing address and e-mail, <b>internal</b> <b>links,</b> and a consistent main menu as most important. The most present features were links within the admissions site, graphics, links outside of the admissions site, active e-mail, and cookies.

40|$|In this paper, {{performance}} of wormhole routed 2 -D torus network with virtual channels has been evaluated for cache-coherent shared-memory multiprocessors with execution-driven simulation using various applications. The traffic in such systems {{is very different}} from the traffic in message-passing environment and is characterized by traffic bursts, one-to-many and many-to-one traffic, and small fixed length messages. We show the impact of various network parameters, such as number of virtual channels, number of flit buffers per virtual channel, and number of <b>internal</b> <b>links.</b> We have also considered low-order and high-order interleaving of memory blocks on nodes to show its impact on the network performance. The study shows that 4 virtual channels per link is most efficient for 2 -D torus networks. The number of flit buffers per virtual channel also has a considerable impact and 2 to 4 flit buffers are usually enough. The number of <b>internal</b> <b>links</b> also has an impact on the performance for applications, such as MP 3 D, that generate large contention for shared variables. Larger number of <b>internal</b> <b>links</b> are also useful in case of high-order interleaved memory to reduce hot-spots at the communication interface of favorite nodes...|$|R
