In some Asian cuisines, the buds are pickled and used to flavor rice and scent tea. In Japan, the young leaves and flower buds of Magnolia hypoleuca are broiled and eaten as a vegetable.

2500|$|The fish is {{prepared}} immediately after capture. After gutting the fish, {{it is either}} <b>dried</b> <b>whole,</b> or split along the spine leaving the tail connected. [...] The fish is hung on the hjell from February to May. Stable cool weather protects the fish from insects and prevents an uncontrolled bacterial growth. A temperature just above zero degrees Celsius, with little rain, is ideal. Too much frost will spoil the fish, as ice destroys the fibers in the fish. The climate in northern Norway is excellent for stockfish production. Due to the stable conditions, the stockfish produced in Lofoten and Vesterålen {{is regarded as the}} best. The traditional cod harvest in Lofoten also takes place during the best drying time. Due to a milder and more humid climate, salted/dried whitefish (klippfisk) was more common in the fisheries districts of Western Norway.|$|E
2500|$|Synephrine, or, more specifically, p-synephrine, is an alkaloid, {{occurring}} {{naturally in}} some plants and animals, {{and also in}} approved drugs products as its m-substituted analog known as neo-synephrine. p-Synephrine (or formerly Sympatol and oxedrine [...] ) and m-synephrine {{are known for their}} longer acting adrenergic effects compared to norepinephrine. This substance is present at very low concentrations in common foodstuffs such as orange juice and other orange (Citrus species) products, both of the [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "bitter" [...] variety. The preparations used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), also known as Zhi Shi, are the immature and <b>dried</b> <b>whole</b> oranges from Citrus aurantium (Fructus Aurantii Immaturus). Extracts of the same material or purified synephrine are also marketed in the US, sometimes in combination with caffeine, as a weight-loss-promoting dietary supplement for oral consumption. While the traditional preparations have been in use for millennia as a component of TCM-formulas, synephrine itself is not an approved OTC drug. As a pharmaceutical, m-synephrine is still used as a sympathomimetic (i.e. for its hypertensive and vasoconstrictor properties), mostly by injection for the treatment of emergencies such as shock, and rarely orally for the treatment of bronchial problems associated with asthma and hay-fever.|$|E

40|$|An {{elutriator}} for {{the separation}} of cysts from not previously dried soil samples to determine the population density of Heterodera species is described. With this apparatus a mixture of cysts and organic debris is obtained. For further separation this mixture is dried and the cysts are then separated from the debris by flotation with a modification of Buhr's method using water or a mixture of three parts of acetone and one part of carbon tetrachloride. Heterodera cysts differ from practically all other material, found in soil, in that they float for a fairly long time in water after having been dried thoroughly (Fenwick, 1940). In Fenwick's extraction method the soil samples are dried prior to extraction. Cysts are then separated from soil in three steps: first the cysts are concentrated in {{a small amount of}} mainly organic material by flotation in-water, then they are separated from most of this material again by flotation in water and finally they are picked from between the soil particles which float as well in water as dry cysts. However, <b>drying</b> <b>whole</b> soil samples, especially when they are large and many must be investigated, requires special equipment or much space.

50|$|A spice may be {{available}} in several forms: fresh, <b>whole</b> <b>dried,</b> or pre-ground dried. Generally, spices are <b>dried.</b> A <b>whole</b> <b>dried</b> spice has the longest shelf life, {{so it can be}} purchased and stored in larger amounts, making it cheaper on a per-serving basis. A fresh spice, such as ginger, is usually more flavorful than its dried form, but fresh spices are more expensive and have a much shorter shelf life. Some spices are not always available either fresh or whole, for example turmeric, and often must be purchased in ground form. Small seeds, such as fennel and mustard seeds, are often used both whole and in powder form.|$|R

The results indicated that drying of mint under different operating conditions occurred in the falling rate period, where no constant rate period of drying was observed. Also, the obtained data revealed that the drying rate of mint under forced convection was higher than that of mint under natural convection, especially during first hours of drying (first day).
