5|$|Actor Ryo Ishibashi {{wanted to}} work with Miike and agreed to the role. He commented that despite not being a great fan of horror films, he enjoyed scripts, such as that of Audition, that showcased human nature. Model Eihi Shiina was cast in the film as Asami. Shiina's career was {{primarily}} as a model and she only began acting after being offered a film role while she was on holidays. Shiina first learned about Miike through his film Blues Harp, which made her interested <b>in</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> director. When Shiina first met Miike, they began talking about her opinions on love and relationships. On their second meeting, Miike asked Shiina to play the part of Asami. Shiina thought that the opinions and feelings she expressed to Miike were the reason she was cast in the role, and she tried to play the role as naturally as she could without going over the top.|$|E

5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted <b>in</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working on it that night. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM chips for the mode and installed them in cabinets. The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.|$|E
5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works in a factory as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E

This patent was curcumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who had been developing a rebreather called the Porpoise. When a demonstration resulted in a diver passing out, he developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates {{the first and second}} stages by a low-pressure hose, and releases exhaled gas at the second stage.

25|$|Nevada State Prison {{had been}} the state-designated {{facility}} for hangings since 1903. At the urging of the Mormon population, the Nevada Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, which allowed condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. Only Mircovich and one other inmate selected shooting. However, the other prisoner's sentence was commuted. Warden Cowing tried to talk Mircovich out of his decision. Mircovich {{did not want to}} be hanged and insisted on being shot, claiming it would be quicker. Cowing was faced with a predicament <b>in</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> scheduled execution date of August 29, 1912, because he was unable to find five marksmen willing to participate in a firing squad.|$|E
