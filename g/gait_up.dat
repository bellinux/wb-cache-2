5000|$|The plague which struck Leith in 1645 {{was only}} one of many {{periodic}} outbreaks of plague that occurred in Edinburgh and Leith between the 14th and 17th centuries. The historian Christopher Smout believes that the 1645 epidemic, which occurred at a time when warring armies were on the march, probably resulted from the spread of typhus. It may have been carried north by Scottish soldiers present at the Siege of Newcastle where plague was reported after the town's surrender to General Leslie on 19 October 1644.The records of South Leith Parish Church reveal that the first cases of [...] "the pest" [...] appeared in Yardheads in April 1645 and that the outbreak reached its height that summer. David Alderstone, member of the Kirk Session and the town's Water Bailie, left a unique, detailed record of the epidemic. The town was divided into quarters, each under the supervision of a quartermaster charged with ascertaining the number of infected in each quarter and supplying them with food. As a quarantine measure the infected were removed to huts on the Links, divided into quarters corresponding to those in the town and similarly placed under quartermasters. An overseer appointed to co-ordinate their activities reported initially that [...] "he cannot <b>gait</b> <b>up</b> ane list of the names and ludges in the Linkes becaus none will go with him", but by 17 July he had succeeded in handing in [...] "a paper book of paper wrytin on both sides...divyding the Ludges, who buildit thm, to qm whom thei appertaine, how many people were in everie Ludge". However, he seems to have fallen victim to the plague because an entry for 20 July names someone else as overseer.|$|E

In this chapter an algorithm is presented to suit estimation of one foot angle in the sagital plane, independent on gait conditions. Only one gyro is used during swing and two accelerometers are needed for calibration during stance. Also, the sensor placement at the front foot avoids the need for heel strike for stance transition. Stair walking can therefore be studied. From the estimated swing trajectory three different <b>gait</b> conditions: <b>up</b> stair, horizontal and down stair are classified.

A computerised, three-dimensional gait analysis system {{was used to measure}} the walking pattern. After several trials of normal walking with voluntary stopping, distracting manoeuvres and obstacles on the walkway were used to provoke freezing or festination. The gait variables of normal (off phase), festinating, prestop, and prefreezing strides were analysed using analysis of variance for repeated-measures. Cadence was excessively increased (68 %) and stride length decreased (69 %) during festination compared with normal off walking; a pattern which remained pronounced when comparing prefreezing strides with normal stopping. Analysing in more detail the three steps before a freeze, we found a progressive decrease of stride length and stable cadence rates and proportions of double support phases. The relationship between cadence and stride length exhibited an exponential increase of cadence with a decreasing stride length during festination and freezing. Results suggest that freezing is caused by a combination of an increasing inability to generate stride length superimposed on a dyscontrol of the cadence of walking. status: publishe...|$|R

Objectives: To investigate the short- and long-term effects of a multi-dimensional indoor and outdoor exercise programme on balance, balance confidence and gait performance in people with PD. Methods: Eligible subjects with PD were randomly assigned to an eight-week indoor and outdoor balance training (EXP, N = 41) group or upper limb exercise (CON, N = 43) group. Outcome measures included BESTest total and subsection scores, gait speed, dual-task timed-up-and-go (dual-task TUG) time and Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) score. All outcomes were assessed before training (Pre), immediately after intervention (Post) and at six-month (FU 6 m) and twelve-month (FU 12 m) follow-ups. Results: Immediately after training, EXP group showed more significant improvements than CON group in BESTest total and subsection scores, gait speed and dual-task TUG time (p < 0. 05). At both FU 6 m and FU 12 m, EXP group showed significantly greater gains than CON group in BESTest total and subsection scores and dual-task TUG time (p < 0. 05).

During obstacle crossing, patients with PD modify their behavior in order to decrease the mechanical demands and enhance dynamic stability. Various descriptions of dynamic traits of gait that have been collected over longer periods, probably better synthesize the underlying structure and pattern of fluctuations in gait and can be more sensitive markers of aging or early neurological dysfunction and increased risk of falls. This confirmation challenges the clinimetric of different protocols and paradigms used for <b>gait</b> analysis <b>up</b> till now, in particular when analyzing obstacle crossing. The authors here present a critical review of current knowledge concerning the interplay between the cognition and gait in aging and PD, emphasizing the differences in gait behavior and adaptability while walking over different and challenging obstacle paradigms, and the implications of obstacle negotiation as a predictor of falls. Some evidence concerning the effectiveness of future rehabilitation protocols on reviving obstacle crossing behavior by trial and error relearning, taking advantage of dual-task paradigms, physical exercise, and virtual reality have been put forward in this article.

40|$|Human walking {{requires}} active neuromuscular {{control to}} ensure {{stability in the}} lateral direction, which inflicts a certain metabolic load. The magnitude of this metabolic load has previously been investigated by means of passive external lateral stabilization via spring-like cords. In the present study, we applied this method to test two hypotheses: (1) the effect of external stabilization on energy cost depends on the stiffness of the stabilizing springs, and (2) the energy cost for balance control, and consequently the effect of external stabilization on energy cost, depends on walking speed. Fourteen healthy young adults walked on a motor driven treadmill without stabilization and with stabilization with four different spring stiffnesses (between 760 and 1820 N m(- 1)) at three walking speeds (70 %, 100 %, and 130 % of preferred speed). Energy cost was calculated from breath-by-breath oxygen consumption. Gait parameters (mean and variability of step width and stride length, and variability of trunk accelerations) were calculated from kinematic data. On average external stabilization led to a decrease in energy cost of 6 % (p < 0. 005) {{as well as a}} decrease in step width (24 %; p < 0. 001), step width variability (41 %; p < 0. 001) and variability of medio-lateral trunk acceleration (12. 5 %; p < 0. 005). Increasing stabilizer stiffness increased the effects on both energy cost and medio-lateral <b>gait</b> parameters <b>up</b> to a stiffness of 1260 N m(- 1). Contrary to expectations, the effect of stabilization was independent of walking speed (p = 0. 111). These results show that active lateral stabilization during walking involves an energetic cost, which is independent of walking speed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{overall goal}} {{of this paper was}} to {{investigate}} approaches to controlling active participation in stroke patients during robot-assisted gait therapy. Although active physical participation during gait rehabilitation after stroke was shown to improve therapy outcome, some patients can behave passively during rehabilitation, not maximally benefiting from the <b>gait</b> training. <b>Up</b> to now, there has not been an effective method for forcing patient activity to the desired level that would most benefit stroke patients with a broad variety of cognitive and biomechanical impairments. Methods Patient activity was quantified in two ways: by heart rate (HR), a physiological parameter that reflected physical effort during body weight supported treadmill training, and by a weighted sum of the interaction torques (WIT) between robot and patient, recorded from hip and knee joints of both legs. We recorded data in three experiments, each with five stroke patients, and controlled HR and WIT to a desired temporal profile. Depending on the patient's cognitive capabilities, two different approaches were taken: either by allowing voluntary patient effort via visual instructions or by forcing the patient to vary physical effort by adapting the treadmill speed. Results We successfully controlled patient activity quantified by WIT and by HR to a desired level. The setup was thereby individually adaptable to the specific cognitive and biomechanical needs of each patient. Conclusion Based on the three successful approaches to controlling patient participation, we propose a metric which enables clinicians to select the best strategy for each patient, according to the patient's physical and cognitive capabilities. Our framework will enable therapists to challenge the patient to more activity by automatically controlling the patient effort to a desired level. We expect that the increase in activity will lead to improved rehabilitation outcome. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{problems}} of generating and optimizing motor behaviors for both simulated and real, physical robots have been investigated, using the paradigms of evolutionary robotics and behavior-based robotics. Specifically, three main topics have been considered: (1) On-line evolutionary optimization of hand-coded gaits for real, physical bipedal robots. The evolved gaits significantly outperformed the hand-coded <b>gaits,</b> reaching <b>up</b> to 65 % higher speed. (2) Evolution of bipedal gait controllers in simulators. First, linear genetic programming was used with two different simulated bipedal robots. In both these cases, the gait controller was evolved starting from programs consisting of random sequences of basic instructions. The best evolved programs generated stable bipedal locomotion, keeping the robot upright and moving indefinitely. However, the evolved gaits were not very human-like. Thus, a different approach, inspired by the neural mechanisms involved in the locomotion of biological organisms, was tried. Here, both the structure and parameters of a central pattern generator network, controlling the locomotion of a simulated robot, were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The evolved controllers generated a stable human-like gait and were also able to handle gait transitions. (3) Behavior selection in autonomous robots, using the utility function method. In particular, {{the performance of the}} method {{as a function of the}} polynomial degree of the utility functions was investigated. It was found that adequate behavior selection systems can be found rapidly for low polynomial degrees (1 - 2), but also that the best solutions can only be obtained by using a higher polynomial degree (3 - 4). Furthermore, the performance of different evolutionary algorithms in connection with the utility function method was also investigated and, somewhat surprisingly, it was found that the standard method, employing a simple genetic algorithm, generally outperformed the modified methods...|$|R

Bottlenecks during implementation of the diagnostic strategy were experienced by 67. 1 %; lack of awareness among other healthcare professionals, acquisition of equipment and time constraints to perform the diagnostic measures were reported most often. Before attendance, 36. 4 % stated not to consult a physiotherapists or exercise therapists (PT/ET) or dietitian for sarcopenia interventions, 10. 5 % consulted a PT/ET, 32. 7 % a dietitian and 20. 5 % both a PT/ET and dietitian. Five months after attendance, these percentages were 28. 3 %, 21. 7 %, 30. 0 % and 20. 0 % respectively. Conclusion: The concept of sarcopenia is familiar to most Dutch healthcare professionals but application in practice is hampered, mostly by lack of knowledge, availability of equipment, time constraints and lack of collaboration...|$|R
40|$|Sarcopenia is an {{emerging}} clinical challenge in an ageing population and {{is associated with}} serious negative health outcomes. This study aimed to assess {{the current state of}} the art regarding the knowledge about the concept of sarcopenia and practice of the diagnostic strategy and management of sarcopenia in a cohort of Dutch healthcare professionals (physicians, physiotherapists, dietitians and others) attending a lecture cycle on sarcopenia. This longitudinal study included Dutch healthcare professionals (n = 223) who were asked to complete a questionnaire before, directly after and five months after (n = 80) attending a lecture cycle on the pathophysiology of sarcopenia, diagnostic strategy and management of sarcopenia, i. e. interventions and collaboration. Before attendance, 69. 7 % of healthcare professionals stated to know the concept of sarcopenia, 21. 4 % indicated to know how to diagnose sarcopenia and 82. 6 % had treated patients with suspected sarcopenia. 47. 5 % used their clinical view as diagnostic strategy. Handgrip strength was the most frequently used objective diagnostic measure (33. 9 %). Five months after attendance, reported use of diagnostic tests was increased, i. e. handgrip strength up to 67. 4 %, <b>gait</b> speed <b>up</b> to 72. 1 % and muscle mass up to 20. 9 %.

40|$|A {{simple and}} cost {{effective}} technique of video gait analysis applicable within rehabilitation clinics and clinical gait laboratories has been developed. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine intra- and inter- rater reliability of kinematic and temporo-spatial gait parameters measured using the commercially available ProTrainer system (Sports Motion Inc®, Cardiff, CA) software, a printed vinyl walk mat and a video camera. Twelve healthy adults, four stroke patients and three raters participated in the study. The experimental setup comprised the walk mat, paper ‘bulls-eye’ markers, four photoswitches mounted on tripods, a light indicator, video camera, and a computer with the software. Participants performed three <b>gait</b> trials each <b>up</b> and down the walk mat. Three raters evaluated the results using the ProTrainer system (Sports Motion Inc®, Cardiff, CA) software. Values were extracted for kinematic and temporospatial gait measurements. Data were analysed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for intra-rater reliability to calculate ICC values with 95 % Confidence Intervals. Cronbach’s coefficient alpha was used to quantify the intra-rater reliability. The ICC values for both intra and inter-rater reliability ranged between 0. 731 and 1. 000. The results suggest this gait measurement technique is simple, reliable, effective and easy to implement as a gait outcome measuring system...|$|R
40|$|Background. Random {{whole body}} {{vibration}} (WBV) training leads to beneficial short-term effects {{in patients with}} Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the effect of WBV lasting several weeks is not clear. Objectives. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess a random WBV training over 5 weeks in PD. Methods. Twenty-one participants with PD were allocated to either an experimental or a placebo group matched by age, gender, and Hoehn&Yahr stage. The WBV training consisted of 5 series, 60 [*]s each. In the placebo group, vibration was simulated. The primary outcome was the change of performance in Functional reach test (FRT), step-walk-turn task, biomechanical <b>Gait</b> Analysis, Timed <b>up</b> and go test (TUG), and one leg stance. Findings. In most of the parameters, there was no significant interaction of “time*group. ” Both groups improved significantly in Gait parameters, TUG, and one leg stance. Only in the FRT [F(1, 15) = 8. 397; P< 0. 05] and in the TUG [F(1, 15) = 4. 971; P< 0. 05] the experimental group performed significantly better than the placebo group. Conclusions. Random WBV training over 5 weeks seems to be less effective than reported in previous studies performing short-term training. The slight improvements in the FRT and TUG are not clinically relevant...|$|R
40|$|Background. The Continuous-Scale Physical Functional Performance 10 Test (CS-PFP 10) quantitatively assesses {{physical}} functional {{performance in}} older {{adults who have}} {{a broad range of}} physical functional ability. This study assessed the validity and reliability of the CS-PFP 10 German version. Methods. Forward-translations and backtranslations as well as cultural adaptions of the test were conducted. Participants were German-speaking Swiss community-dwelling adults aged 64 and older. Concurrent validity was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients between CS-PFP 10 and <b>gait</b> velocity, Timed <b>Up</b> and Go Test, hand grip strength, SF- 36 physical function domain, and Freiburger Physical Activity Questionnaire. Internal consistency was calculated by Cronbach’s alpha. Results. Backtranslation and cultural adaptions were accepted by the CS-PFP 10 developer. CS-PFP 10 total score and subscores (upper body strength, upper body flexibility, lower body strength, balance and coordination, and endurance) correlated significantly with all measures of physical function tested. Internal consistency was high (Cronbach’s alpha 0. 95 – 0. 98). Conclusion. The CS-PFP 10 German version is valid and reliable for measuring physical functional performance in German-speaking Swiss community-dwelling older adults. Quantifying physical function is essential for clinical practice and research and provides meaningful insight into physical functional performance of older adults.

40|$|Background: Reversibility of {{weakness}} {{is rare in}} inherited muscle disease and suggests a channelopathy as the underlying pathology. Improvement in muscle strength after treatment with beta-adrenergic agonists has been documented in hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis and only very recently in the congenital myasthenic syndromes. The exact mechanism of action is not understood. Case description: Case A, the second youngest of 10 siblings from a non-consanguineous Irish kindred, presented {{at the age of}} 46 years with mild limb-girdle muscle weakness with no other symptoms and no demonstrable fatiguability. Three siblings were similarly affected (2 / 3 were examined, 1 / 3 died before examination from unrelated causes). Case B and C reported first symptoms aged 62 and 45 respectively. All 3 remained independently mobile with a waddling <b>gait</b> after follow <b>up</b> of between 11 and 25 years from first symptoms. Case A reported marked improvement in function after a short course of inhaled Salbutamol prescribed by his GP. On oral Salbutamol treatment limb-girdle strength returned to MRC grade 5, but deteriorated to MRC grade 4 when treatment was stopped. The other siblings showed similar response. Results: Initial investigation of cases A and B revealed slightly elevated creatinine kinase (CK: 307; CK: 283) and some fibre atrophy and type II predominance on muscle biopsy. Case B showed 16...|$|R
