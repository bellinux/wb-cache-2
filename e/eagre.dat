25|$|Bache was {{awaiting}} {{boiler work}} {{the summer of}} 1884 with her party assisting in work {{in the vicinity of}} New York with a change of command from Lieutenant H. R. Mansfield, USN, to Lieutenant E. D. F. Heald, USN, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey and former commander of the schooner <b>Eagre,</b> who then took the ship to survey the coasts of Alabama, Louisiana and the west coast of Florida. The routine of surveys in the north during summer, a yard period and then a winter season in southern waters, ranging to Texas, continued until an accident with the Bache's boilers in the vicinity of Nantucket Shoals required she be towed by the Blake to New York for major repairs, taking her out of service for a month.|$|E
60|$|The steamer Silveropolis was {{sharply and}} {{steadily}} cleaving the broad, placid shallows of the Sacramento River. A large wave like an <b>eagre,</b> diverging from its bow, was extending to either bank, swamping the tules {{and threatening to}} submerge the lower levees. The great boat itself--a vast but delicate structure of airy stories, hanging galleries, fragile colonnades, gilded cornices, and resplendent frescoes--was throbbing throughout its whole perilous length with the pulse of high pressure and the strong monotonous beat of a powerful piston. Floods of foam pouring from the high paddle-boxes on either side and reuniting {{in the wake of}} the boat left behind a track of dazzling whiteness, over which trailed two dense black banners flung from its lofty smokestacks.|$|E
50|$|USC&GS <b>Eagre</b> was {{a survey}} ship of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, {{originally}} the yacht Mohawk, which later {{served in the}} United States Navy as USS <b>Eagre.</b>|$|E
50|$|VolkerRail began {{life as a}} British Steel {{subsidiary}} {{known as}} Grant Lyon <b>Eagre</b> Ltd. The company can trace their roots as a contractor in the industry right back to 1935. In 1996 Grant Lyon <b>Eagre</b> Ltd teamed up with Railbouw, based on their existing partnerships, specifically the track renewal works for the London Underground, and became GrantRail.|$|E
5000|$|In 1890 <b>Eagre</b> {{was part}} of a {{squadron}} of ships under the command of Lieutenant E.M. Hughes making the first systematic survey of the hazardous Nantucket Shoals along with the steamer [...] as flagship, the schooner Scoresby and the steam tender Daisy.|$|E

50|$|The Trent Aegir, {{also known}} as the <b>Eagre,</b> is a tidal bore on the River Trent in England. At certain times of the year, the lower tidal reaches of the Trent {{experience}} a moderately large bore (up to five feet (1.5m) high). It is said to take its name from Ægir, the Norse god of the ocean, although this is disputed.|$|E
5000|$|In 1876, the Mohawk, a large {{centerboard}} schooner, capsized {{due to its}} sheets being [...] "made fast" [...] (fastened securely) when a freak squall struck. Vice-Commodore William T. Garner, {{his wife}} and crew died in the accident. It is believed that this tragedy led to the extinction of the great centerboard schooner yachts. The Mohawk was later sold to the U.S. Navy and recommissioned as the U.S. <b>Eagre.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Eagre</b> was {{eventually}} {{transferred from the}} Coast and Geodetic Service to the United States Navy on 31 July 1903, initially for use as tender to , the receiving ship at Naval Station Norfolk, and as training ship for apprentice seamen in the Chesapeake Bay area. These duties terminated in late 1906, and she remained at Norfolk until approved {{for use as a}} houseboat for enlisted men who were attached to the Norfolk Navy Yard. She was stricken on 10 September 1910 and sold.|$|E
50|$|In 2001 Wilfreda began {{operating}} service buses again. It operates a mixed fleet ranging from modern high quality coaches to old double-deckers. Many of its routes are school services or South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive contracts, {{a large number}} of which have been won from other operators in recent years. However, it more recently has restarted operating competitive commercial services, such as the 52. In 2006, the company took over <b>Eagre</b> Coaches, Gainsborough which runs many coach tours and holidays.|$|E

5000|$|Born in Springfield, Ohio to Orson Williams and Pamela Floyd, he {{graduated}} from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1884 and was ordered to the sloop , flagship of the Pacific Squadron. He then served aboard the Coast Survey schooner <b>Eagre</b> from 1886 to 1887, aboard the sloop [...] patrolling the Gulf of Saint Lawrence from 1887 to 1889, and as instructor in mathematics at the U.S. Naval Academy from 1889 to 1893. From 1893 to 1896, he served as watch officer aboard the protected cruiser , which protected American interests and shipping in South America during the Brazilian Revolution and evacuated missionaries from the coast of China during the Sino-Japanese War. He returned to the Academy as an instructor of higher mathematics from 1896 to 1898.|$|E
5000|$|VolkerRail also {{undertake}} the Permanment Way maintenance at Tata's Scunthorpe works. This {{is a very}} long standing contract and is a legacy of British Steel's ownership of Grant Lyon <b>Eagre</b> and subsequently Corus' part ownership of GrantRail. Work undertaken encompasses all aspeects of permanent way work. As well as usual maintenance tasks VolkerRail also undertake renewals and some small scale new build work - larger scale projects are put out to tender although the largest rail project, The Rail Service Centre for handling Continuous Welded Rail trains, was also undertaken VolkerRail (though as GrantRail at the time). As rail is now produced on site Tata supply this for renewals work and it allows rails of 120', rather than the usual 60' lengths, to be used and {{reduce the number of}} rail joints. Due to the changing nature of a steel works and the traffic requirements there is a small amount of recovery work for sections which are no longer in use.|$|E

He co-authored the book Fluid Mechanics for Ecologists (IPC Press, 2002) and he edited several other books (Balkema 2004, IEaust 2004, The University of Queensland 2006, 2008, 2014). The textbook The Hydraulics of Open Channel Flow: An Introduction {{has already been}} translated into Chinese (Hydrology Bureau of Yellow River Conservancy Committee) and Spanish (McGraw Hill Interamericana) and the second edition appeared in 2004. He has further published over 700 peer-reviewed papers and his work was cited over 3,500 times (WoS) to 13,700 times.

40|$|A case is {{made for}} the {{derivation}} of the regional word <b>eagre</b> ‘tidal surge’, ‘bore’, and relatives or variants found in other contexts, from OE e(a) gor- meaning ‘flood’ or the like, despite the phonological difficulty. A Latin source is proposed. The evidence for the word is considered alongside place-name evidence, and explanations are tentatively reaffirmed, and proposed, respectively, for two problematic names in Nottinghamshire and Gloucestershire...|$|E
40|$|To {{benefit from}} the Cloud platform's {{unlimited}} resources, managing and evaluating huge volume of RDF data in a scalable manner has attracted intensive research efforts recently. Progresses have been made on evaluating SPARQL queries with either high-level declarative programming languages, like Pig [1], or a sequence of sophisticated designed Map Reduce jobs, both of which tend to answer the query with multiple join operations. However, due to the simplicity of Cloud storage and the coarse organization of RDF data in existing solutions, multiple join operations easily bring significant I/O and network traffic which can severely degrade the system performance. In this work, we first propose <b>EAGRE,</b> an Entity-Aware Graph compREssion technique {{to form a new}} representation of RDF data on Cloud platforms, based on which we propose an I/O efficient strategy to evaluate SPARQL queries as quickly as possible, especially queries with specified solution sequence modifiers, e. g., PROJECTION, ORDERBY, etc. We implement a prototype system and conduct extensive experiments over both real and synthetic datasets on an in-house cluster. The experimental results show that our solution can achieve over an order of magnitude of time saving for the SPARQL query evaluation compared to the state-of-art MapReduce-based solution...|$|E
