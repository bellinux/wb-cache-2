30|$|It is {{possible}} that depositors lost interest in monitoring banks due to government intervention, even during crises.

5000|$|Correct {{position}} of the rider: Some riders have a habit of riding crookedly when performing lateral movements, especially if the horse tends to do so. To counteract this, it is often {{a good idea to}} have a person on the ground watch your position. Common faults to avoid include the dropping of a shoulder, raising or lowering a hand, collapsing a hip, leaning (rather than staying centered over the saddle), and twisting the body. Although it may be possible to perform correct movements when the rider's body is contorted, it makes it more difficult, decreases the balance of the rider, and reduces the independence of the seat which tends to decrease the clarity of the aids. Loss of position also tends to give <b>incorrect</b> <b>signals</b> to the horse, and if it creates a stiff seat, will make the horse move stiffly, discourage impulsion, suppleness, and forwardness, and therefore decrease the benefit of the exercise.|$|R

40|$|Despite many contact-sensor-based {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to monitor and detect structural defects, there are still difficulties compensating for environmental effects and malfunctions of attached sensors, which are main reasons for transmitting false signals.

Thus, a computer-vision method for detecting loosened bolts is proposed. This study includes two algorithms. The first one is a preprocessing to crop bolt images from bolted-joint images. The second algorithm is a feature extraction by integrating previously proposed algorithms in computer-vision. To accomplish an automated inspection, linear support vector machine is trained and used as a classifier. The robustness of the proposed is verified by the experimental validation; 22 bolt images are used to build a classifier, and 40 bolt images are tested...|$|R

40|$|Changes in sensory {{function}} {{that have been}} described in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) can be either 'pure' disorders of conscious perception such as elevations in sensory threshold, or disorders of sensorimotor integration, in which the interaction between sensory input and motor output is altered. In this article, we review the extensive evidence for disrupted tactile, nociceptive, thermal and proprioceptive sensations in PD, {{as well as the}} influences exerted on these sensations by dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation. We argue that abnormal spatial and temporal processing of sensory information produces <b>incorrect</b> <b>signals</b> for the preparation and execution of voluntary movement. Sensory deficits are likely to be a consequence of the dopaminergic denervation of the basal ganglia that is the hallmark of PD. A possible mechanism to account for somatosensory deficits is one in which disease-related dopaminergic denervation leads to a loss of response specificity, resulting in transmission of noisier and less-differentiated information to cortical regions. Changes in pain perception might have a different explanation, possibly involving disease-related effects outside the basal ganglia, including involvement of peripheral pain receptors, as well as structures such as the periaqueductal grey matter and non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems...|$|R

40|$|The CFA franc, {{currency}} for 13 West and Central African countries (the CFA zone), {{has been}} {{tied to the}} French franc via a fixed exchange rate arrangement since 1948.

Further, France's ability to maintain the current arrangement is uncertain {{in light of the}} approaching economic integration in Europe. After reviewing the history of the CFA zone, this paper assesses the appropriateness of the fixed rate arrangement for the zone, with emphasis placed on recent events, especially the 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc. The paper then reviews alternative exchange rate arrangements for the CFA franc, and discusses their applicability in the setting of the CFA zone. The paper finds that a more flexible exchange rate arrangement, for example a peg to a common European currency, is appealing because it better reflects trade flows and may reduce exchange rate variability with non-CFA countries in West and Central Africa, thus aiding regional development.

We present here an iterative nonparametric nonlinear normalization scheme called simultaneous alternating conditional expectation (sACE), which is designed to maximize correlation between chip repeats in all-chip-against-all space. We tested sACE on 28 experiments with 158 Affymetrix one-color chips. The procedure should be equally applicable to other DNA–microarray technologies, e. g., two-color chips. We show that the reduction of noise compared to a simple normalization scheme like the widely used linear global normalization leads to fewer falsepositive calls, i. e., to fewer genes which have to be laboriously con � rmed by independent methods such as TaqMan or quantitative PCR.

40|$|Abstract Background Raw data {{normalization}} {{is a critical}} step in microarray data analysis because it directly affects data interpretation. Most of the normalization methods currently used {{are included in the}} R/BioConductor packages but {{it is often difficult to}} identify the most appropriate method. Furthermore, the use of R commands for functions and graphics can introduce mistakes that are difficult to trace. We present here a script written in R that provides a flexible means of access to and monitoring of {{data normalization}} for two-color microarrays. This script combines the power of BioConductor and R analysis functions and reduces the amount of R programming required. Results Goulphar was developed in and runs using the R language and environment. It combines and extends functions found in BioConductor packages (limma and marray) to correct for dye biases and spatial artifacts. Goulphar provides a wide range of optional and customizable filters for excluding <b>incorrect</b> <b>signals</b> during the pre-processing step. It displays informative output plots, enabling the user to monitor the normalization process, and helps adapt the normalization method appropriately to the data. All these analyses and graphical outputs are presented in a single PDF report. Conclusion Goulphar provides simple, rapid access to the power of the R/BioConductor statistical analysis packages, with precise control and visualization of the results obtained.
