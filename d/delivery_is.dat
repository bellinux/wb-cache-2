5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should generally {{be carried out}} until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen <b>delivery</b> <b>is</b> unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E

The company's products can now be found in major Greek supermarket chains. A postal-delivery system for their products has been established to reach the internal Greek market. The <b>delivery</b> <b>is</b> free inside Greece and the meat is packed in special polystyrene packaging with dry ice to preserve freshness.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the great white shark's mating habits. It is {{possible}} that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating. Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. <b>Delivery</b> <b>is</b> in spring and summer. The Northern Pacific population of great whites is suspected to breed off of the Sea of Cortez, as evidenced by local fisherman who have said to have caught them and evidenced by teeth found at dump sites for discarded parts from their catches.|$|E

2500|$|The terms [...] "bowling" [...] and [...] "pitching", as words, both denote underarm <b>deliveries,</b> as <b>were</b> once {{required}} in both games. The rules for <b>delivery</b> <b>were</b> also initially very similar. Once overhand <b>deliveries</b> <b>were</b> permitted in the respective sports, and pitchers were compelled to toe the pitching rubber instead of throwing from anywhere within the [...] "pitcher's box", {{the actions of}} bowling and pitching diverged significantly.|$|R

5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi <b>delivery</b> <b>is</b> only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug <b>delivery</b> <b>is</b> that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E

25|$|A <b>{{delivery}}</b> <b>is</b> a no ball if it bounces {{more than}} twice before passing the popping crease: an underarm delivery cannot be performed rolling along the ground.

It is unlikely that any bowler would reintroduce the style, given modern pitch conditions.|$|E

40|$|Aim: to {{investigate}} whether an antenatal surveillance protocol including ultrasound and Cardiotocograph monitoring reduces intra-uterine death (IUD) in cases of gastroschisis. Secondary outcomes included neonatal death rate, mode of delivery and rate of intervention before planned time of <b>delivery.</b> Methods:this <b>was</b> a retrospective observational study of all women with an antenatally diagnosed gastroschisis who were managed according to our surveillance programme between 2002 and 2015 in a tertiary fetal medicine and paediatric surgical centre covering the Wessex Region of England. We reviewed and analysed data from the WANDA database as well as prospectively managed maternity, ultrasound and neonatal databases over the given time period. Case notes <b>were</b> reviewed when <b>delivery</b> <b>was</b> expedited. Results: the intra-uterine death rate was 2. 2 %, a 58 % reduction since the introduction of our surveillance protocol. <b>Delivery</b> <b>was</b> expedited in 35. 4 % of cases and in 86 % of these, <b>delivery</b> <b>was</b> by caesarean section. In women being induced as planned at 38 weeks, the vaginal <b>delivery</b> rate <b>was</b> 88 % and for those in spontaneous labour before 38 weeks it was 75 %. Conclusions: an antenatal surveillance programme appears to reduce the intra-uterine death in gastroschisis. In a third of cases, <b>delivery</b> <b>was</b> indicated before the planned date of delivery. When expedited <b>delivery</b> <b>was</b> indicated, the chance of caesarean section was high. <br/...|$|R
