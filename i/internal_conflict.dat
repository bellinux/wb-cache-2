5|$|Primarily {{created to}} block further {{communist}} gains in Southeast Asia, SEATO {{is generally considered}} a failure because <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> and dispute hindered general use of the SEATO military; however, SEATO-funded cultural and educational programs left long-standing effects in Southeast Asia. SEATO was dissolved on 30 June 1977 after many members lost interest and withdrew.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted over whether to defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature. In 1939, a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles. During the early 1950s and Cold War McCarthyism, the board was divided on whether to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed over whether to represent Dr. Benjamin Spock's anti-war activism. In 1973, there was <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> over whether to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. In 2005, there was <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> {{about whether or not}} a gag rule should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} the end of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. At present, there is no {{satisfactory}} explanation for the collapse of the Mycenaean palace systems.

5|$|Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky: A novice actor, he is {{the only}} cast member to have read the script and book and {{attended}} the assigned boot camp prior to the film. Sandusky plays a young soldier named Brooklyn in the film-within-a-film. Brooklyn and Sandusky each occupy the position of straight man in character in the film-within-a-film and its cast, being the only actor without an <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> or deep-seated insecurity. He often serves as a mediator when tensions between the cast get high.|$|E

5|$|Migration from Cyprus to the UK has {{occurred}} {{in part due to}} the colonial links between the countries and the <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> that followed Cyprus' independence from the British Empire in 1960. Migration peaked at the time of independence but has continued on a smaller scale. The number of Cypriot-born people in the UK fell between the 1991 and 2001 censuses, but the community, including people of Cypriot ancestry, remains sizeable, and the Cypriot-born population grew slightly between the 2001 and 2011 censuses.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{had been}} {{authorized}} by Congress to recruit {{an army of}} up to 28,501 troops, but he had only 19,000 when he reached New York. Military discipline was inadequate; routine orders were not carried out, muskets were fired in camp, flints were ruined, bayonets were used as knives to cut food, and firearm readiness was lax. Petty <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> was common under the strain {{of a large number}} of people from different environments and temperaments in relative closeness.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire loomed, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay which pitted its political parties against one another. The <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. Brazil's progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War. The dictator of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the Uruguayan situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a regional power. In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War, and then invaded Brazil.|$|E

5|$|For the music, the {{development}} team felt that symphony orchestra would {{work best for}} Knights of the Old Republic II. The musical score was composed by Mark Griskey, who developed music and themes for characters and places, including the Jedi's theme, Darth Sion's theme and Darth Nihilus's theme (which both have many similarities with the Emperor's theme from The Return of the Jedi). He also created a theme for the main character, which is heard occasionally {{when he or she}} experiences <b>internal</b> <b>conflict.</b> The 70-minute score was recorded by the Sinfonia Orchestra in Seattle. The opening crawl utilizes the version of John Williams' main Star Wars theme that was re-recorded for the prequel trilogy.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, the Progressive League {{was plagued}} by <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> between Progressives (former Moderate Conservatives) and Historicals (former Liberals). All of the {{cabinets}} formed by the League after 1862 were short-lived. The Paraguayan invasion in 1864 led to a conflict far longer than expected, increasing tensions within the party. By 1868, a rift had opened between the Marquis of Caxias (then Commander-in-Chief of Brazilian forces in the war) and the Progressive Cabinet. With its credibility for prosecuting the war now vanished, the Cabinet resigned and the Emperor called the Conservatives back into power on 16 July 1868. Once again Paranhos—who was extraordinary member of the Council of State since 18 August 1866—became Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|In circa 1250 BC, {{the first}} wave of {{destruction}} has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. These incidents appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Nevertheless, none of these measures appear to have prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and <b>internal</b> <b>conflict.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1840s Caxias {{became a member}} of the Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order and finally the Conservative Party. He was elected senator in 1846. The Emperor {{appointed}} him president of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) in 1856; he briefly held that office again in 1861, but fell when his party lost its parliamentary majority. Over the decades Caxias witnessed the growth and zenith of his party, then its slow decline as <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> divided it. In 1875, he headed a cabinet for the last time, and after years of failing health he died in May 1880.|$|E
5|$|Matthew died in 1973, {{sparking}} an <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> {{over who}} would succeed him {{as head of}} the Harlem congregation. Shortly before his death, Matthew named his grandson, David Matthew Doré, as the new spiritual leader. Doré was 16 years old at the time. In 1975, the synagogue's board elected Rabbi Willie White to be its leader. Rabbi Doré occasionally conducted services at the synagogue until the early 1980s, when White had Doré and some other members locked out of the building. Membership declined throughout the 1990s and by 2004, only a few dozen people belonged to the synagogue. In 2007 the Commandment Keepers sold the building, while various factions among former members sued one another.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Spirit Fruit Society lived {{according}} to the following basic principles: seek happiness through selflessness; follow one's conscience; take responsibility for one's actions—and develop {{an awareness of the}} consequences of one's actions on others; and accept whatever happens. Beilhart believed very strongly in the individual's right to guide his own actions, and not be dictated to by others. While {{there was no mention of}} any kind of organization or hierarchy in any documents, as the leader, Beilhart likely made important decisions concerning the group. There is no record of any kind of <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> between members.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{entitled}} "The Impact of Political Geography on Intrastate Conflicts" {{examines how}} big is the impact ofvarious geographic factors on the intrastate conflicts, if there are any. In the initial part, the thesis deals with the definitions of conflicts in general and analyzes the basic trends in typology, classification and history of intrastate conflicts. The second part gives specific examples of various geographic factors with premises to have impacts on <b>internal</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The third part includes analysis of the geographic factors, whether and how they affect <b>internal</b> <b>conflicts.</b> This part is also analysis of a sample of states and their intrastate conflicts, which in the end gives {{the answer to the}} question, whether these states share any geographic factors that would influence the <b>internal</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The last chapter is devoted to the comparison of the geographic impact on two specific <b>internal</b> <b>conflicts</b> using results of previous analysis.

5|$|On 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, {{detailing}} {{the plan of}} attack and command structure for the invasion. Hungary and Bulgaria were promised the Banat and Yugoslav Macedonia respectively and the Romanian army was asked not to take part, holding its position at the countries' border. <b>Internal</b> <b>conflict</b> in Hungary over the invasion plans between the army and Teleki led to the Prime Minister's suicide that same evening. Also on 3 April, Edmund Veesenmayer, representing the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, arrived in Zagreb {{in preparation for a}} regime change. Croatian pilot Vladimir Kren, a captain in the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, defected to the Germans on 3 April taking with him valuable information about the country's air defenses.|$|E
5|$|The general's {{stance on}} human rights issues has also been quite controversial. It has been {{reported}} that he was behind the Army's refusal to provide any information on the 1984 massacre at the village of Putis. Requests issued on June 2008 by prosecutor Rubén López for a detailed report on the military personnel deployed there at that time were answered the following month by the Defense Ministry stating that the Army did not have any information on the subject in its archives. Donayre also joined a campaign to raise funds to defend armed forces personnel accused of committing human rights abuses during the <b>internal</b> <b>conflict</b> in Peru.|$|E
5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively.

They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of <b>internal</b> <b>conflict.</b> Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E
