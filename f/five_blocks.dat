5|$|In {{the knot}} of {{highways}} that is the Genesee County seat, NY33 crosses and briefly overlaps with not only NY5, the other east–west route in town, but both north–south routes, NY63 and NY98.

5|$|The {{water pipit}} in {{breeding}} plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or <b>five</b> <b>blocks,</b> each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{producers}} knew that Macfayden {{would leave the}} series, {{they did not know}} when he would do so, and so the first two episodes were initially written without him.

The producers also took information from advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The series was directed in <b>five</b> <b>blocks</b> of two episodes in each.

5|$|Old Business Spur I-96 (Old BS I-96) is {{the section}} of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the {{intersection}} with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in downtown Detroit and an unsigned state trunkline highway. It was previously a business spur of I-96. Picking up where M-5 ends at the interchange with I-96, Old BS I-96 follows Grand River Avenue southeasterly. The road itself is bounded by businesses as it passes through residential neighborhoods on Detroit's West Side. About a mile and three-quarters (2.8km) along, the highway crosses I-96 again, and I-96 from here into the downtown area parallels Grand River Avenue. Old BS I-96 here is mostly residential. It passes Bishop Park near Grand Boulevard and then crosses I-94. In the North Corktown neighborhood, Grand River Avenue crosses M-10 (Lodge Freeway) near the MotorCity Casino. About a half mile (0.7km) past M-10, Old BS I-96 crosses I-75 (Fisher Freeway) and enters Downtown Detroit's Foxtown neighborhood. State maintenance ends at the five-way intersection between Grand River Avenue, Cass Avenue, and Middle Street. Grand River Avenue continues another <b>five</b> <b>blocks</b> to Woodward Avenue and another four blocks as it curves in an arc around Grand Circus Park.|$|E

The light rail line is paralleled to the east by a mixed-use bicycle trail called the SODO Trail, which connects SODO Station to Stadium station at South Royal Brougham Way. The Seattle Department of Transportation plans to extend the trail to Spokane Street, connecting it to a bike trail on the Spokane Street Viaduct, serving West Seattle; a connector trail on Forest Street to a segregated cycletrack on Airport Way is also being considered.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or <b>five</b> <b>blocks,</b> each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic {{in the absence of}} other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E
