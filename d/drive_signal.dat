25|$|A {{direct field}} is {{generated}} by audio drivers arranged to encircle the test article. Two different control schemes {{can be used to}} perform a direct field test. One method, known as single-input-single-output or SISO, uses a single <b>drive</b> <b>signal</b> to all acoustic drivers with multiple control microphones averaged to produce the control measurement. This method will produce a set of correlated plane waves that may combine to produce large magnitude variations creating local fluctuations on the test article surface. Magnitude variations as much as +/−12dB can be experienced. The second method, known as MIMO, uses multiple independent drive signals to control multiple independent microphone locations. This method produces a more uncorrelated field that is much more uniform than the SISO field. Magnitude variations in the range of +/-3dB are typical when using MIMO control.|$|E

50|$|It was {{developed}} to {{eliminate the need for}} a driver tube in radios, and has rather more gain than is usual in a power pentode, producing full output from a relatively small <b>drive</b> <b>signal</b> (the EL84 requires less than 4.4Vrms for 5.7W output compared with 9Vrms for 5.5W from a 6V6 or 8.7Vrms for 11W from an EL34). This eliminated the need for a preamplifier triode in radios, making them cheaper to produce. As the EL84 uses a 9 pin Noval construction, it was also cheap to produce and manufacturers were quick to adopt it in general use, and they are found in many old European valve radios and other audio equipment. A single EL84 was used in low-cost equipment, and a push-pull pair for lower distortion and higher power.|$|E

Mainly due to the output transformer primary inductance with respect to plate resistance..The 6146 is much lower in transconductance and is less sensitive to <b>drive</b> <b>signal,</b> thus needs a bigger voltage swing to drive than a 6550... another reason the 6146 amps have more growl than its 6550 counterpart is because the pre-amp is turned up a bit higher to achieve the equivalent power output swing, thus more [...] "grind" [...] (fuzz bass) can be obtained from the preamp.|$|E

40|$|Envelope {{elimination}} {{and restoration}} (EER) power amplifier architecture can achieve high efficiency and linearity. However, when used with modern modulation schemes such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and wideband code {{division multiple access}} (W-CDMA), it suffers from expanded bandwidth problem. This paper shows that, the straightforward bandwidth limitation results in poor efficiency of the power amplifier (PA). We propose a new repetitive bandwidth limitation technique which reduces bandwidth expansion of both the envelope and phase polar <b>drive</b> <b>signals</b> without compromising the efficiency of the PA. It has been found that the improvement in bandwidth of <b>drive</b> <b>signals</b> is proportional to the number of repetition. The bandwidth limitation often results in spectral splatter and error vector magnitude (EVM). To counter this, we employ a QAM correction technique which reduces the in band distortion...|$|R
50|$|Servomotors are {{generally}} {{used as a}} high-performance alternative to the stepper motor. Stepper motors have some inherent ability to control position, as they have built-in output steps. This often allows them {{to be used as}} an open-loop position control, without any feedback encoder, as their <b>drive</b> <b>signal</b> specifies the number of steps of movement to rotate, but for this the controller needs to 'know' the position of the stepper motor on power up. Therefore, on first power up, the controller will have to activate the stepper motor and turn it to a known position, e.g. until it activates an end limit switch. This can be observed when switching on an inkjet printer; the controller will move the ink jet carrier to the extreme left and right to establish the end positions. A servomotor will immediately turn to whatever angle the controller instructs it to, regardless of the initial position at power up.|$|E
50|$|Scanners are {{characterized}} by their sensitivity, which is the ratio of piezo movement to piezo voltage, i.e., by how much the piezo material extends or contracts per applied volt. Because of differences in material or size, the sensitivity varies from scanner to scanner. Sensitivity varies non-linearly with respect to scan size. Piezo scanners exhibit more sensitivity at the end than {{at the beginning of}} a scan. This causes the forward and reverse scans to behave differently and display hysteresis between the two scan directions. This can be corrected by applying a non-linear voltage to the piezo electrodes to cause linear scanner movement and calibrating the scanner accordingly. One disadvantage of this approach is that it requires re-calibration because the precise non-linear voltage needed to correct non-linear movement will change as the piezo ages (see below). This problem can be circumvented by adding a linear sensor to the sample stage or piezo stage to detect the true movement of the piezo. Deviations from ideal movement can be detected by the sensor and corrections applied to the piezo <b>drive</b> <b>signal</b> to correct for non-linear piezo movement. This design is known as a 'closed loop' AFM. Non-sensored piezo AFMs are referred to as 'open loop' AFMs.|$|E
