5|$|Back in Kristiansund, Løvold {{started working}} {{with the idea of}} {{building}} a subsea road tunnel from Kristiansund to the mainland. He discussed the issue in Foreningen Kristiansunderen where it received support. Løvold was an important enthusiast for the fixed link project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992. The local press dubbed him the fixed link general. In 1955 he organized an inspection of Freifjorden; using <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> it was possible to survey the depth of the fjord. Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans.|$|E

30|$|The fluvial morphodynamics of the Inde River were {{analyzed}} {{over a period}} of almost 15 years taking sediment samples, analyzing <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> of the river’s bathymetry and determining the heavy metal content of the sediment as a tracer material for the morphological development.|$|R
40|$|To be able {{to carry}} out physical, {{chemical}} and biological investigations on a lake, one needs a thorough knowledge of the volume of water and the shape of the lake basin. Little is known about the about the morphology of the lakes in Schleswig-Holstein and its ecological consequences. For this research a 30 KHz echo sounder with sediment transceiver was used to carry out profile determinations (<b>echo</b> <b>soundings).</b> This apparatus continuously records on paper the different reflexions and absorptions of the sediment and water body in the corresponding depth. By this, acoustically noticeable layers and different densities in the sediment and 'scattering layers' in the water body due to physical, chemical and biological reasons (e. g. plans and single fish) are made visible. Result are summarised here regarding the <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> in Blunker See...|$|R
50|$|Two flying boats, the Boreas and the Passat, {{equipped}} with aerial photography equipment were {{on board the}} ship Schwabenland. The application of this technology over Antarctica was revolutionary. Stereo photography was used. On {{the way back to}} Europe, the aircraft carrier conducted oceanographic, biological and meteorological observations and every fifteen to thirty minutes <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> were taken.|$|R

25|$|<b>Echo</b> <b>sounding</b> is {{a process}} used to {{determine}} the depth of water beneath ships and boats. A type of active sonar, <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.|$|E
50|$|The Stanford Exploration Project (SEP) is an industry-funded {{academic}} consortium {{within the}} Geophysics Department at Stanford University. SEP research has contributed greatly {{to improving the}} {{theory and practice of}} constructing 3-D and 4-D images of the earth from seismic <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> (see: Reflection seismology). The consortium was started in the 1970s by Jon Claerbout and is currently co-directed with Biondo Biondi.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{definition}} {{of the nature of}} the bottom sediments in underwater gravel and sand quarries represents a major problem for the Mining Authorities in Italy. Bylaw the residual fine sediments could not be dumped in the water. Furthermore the damping of fine sediments is often used to mask non-compliance excavations.

40|$|ASTER green, red {{and near}} infra-red (NIR) imagery with a {{resolution}} {{on the order}} of handheld GPS <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> was calibrated to model bathymetry of Rongelap Atoll to a depth of 10 meters. The ASTER model was converted into of depth contours at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 meters. Beyond that depth nautical charts and <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> were used to model bathymetry. The combined result was a bathymetric digital elevation model of Rongelap Atoll and surrounding seas, which was converted to X,Y,Z file and for input into reverse engineering software. The reverse engineering software then created a NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational BSpline) surface model, for input into the finite element meshing program GAMBIT (ANSYS Fluid Dynamics International). These data were then ordered in volumetric and substrate surface elements of coral reefs and input to the FLUENT computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package. Bluelink (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO) was used to apply boundary conditions, and results are hydrodynamic charts of the atoll. The resulting map of substrate shear stress at Rongelap is displayed in Figure 2. Figure 2 Benthic shear stress of Rongelap Atoll...|$|R
25|$|Abosso was a motor ship, {{with two}} eight-cylinder {{two-stroke}} single-acting marine diesel engines driving twin screws and a combined rating of 1,660 NHP. Her navigation equipment included wireless direction finding and an <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> device.|$|E
25|$|By 1930 Aguila had {{wireless}} direction finding equipment, {{and from}} 1934 {{she had an}} <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> device. Up to 1933 Lloyd's Register records no code letters for Aguila, but when the new wireless call signs were introduced for 1934, she was designated GPVD.|$|E
25|$|Cap Arcona had modern {{navigation}} and communication equipment. She was equipped for submarine signalling, which {{for a time}} was considered an alternative to radio.

40|$|Digital {{elevation}} models (DEMs) of seabed relief are now commonly {{available at}} a number of scales. On a global scale three-dimensional (3 D) relief maps of the ocean floor are derived from satellite gravity measurements validated by single-beam <b>echo</b> <b>soundings.</b> On a smaller, more local, scale, the development of multibeam bathymetric mapping technology provides detailed seabed data from which DEMs are derived. Over the past 30 years multibeam bathymetry has replaced single-beam <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> as the main tool used to map the sea floor. Multibeam bathymetry has revolutionized our ability to interpret seabed morphology. It has the capability to provide complete seabed coverage and gives a 3 D visualization of the seabed not previously available. DEMs derived from multibeam are comparable to those on land. One aspect of the improved seabed visualization is in mapping marine geohazards. Here three DEMs, from Papua New Guinea, Hawaii and the Indian Ocean, are presented. These DEMs have been used to investigate submarine seabed failure and volcanic flank collapse {{in the context of their}} tsunami hazard. For these three areas the DEMs contribute to an improved interpretational capability in marine geohazards. In addition, the DEMs underpin newly developed modelling methodologies of landslide-generated tsunami. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, Svalbard glaciers {{have been}} widely radioecho sounded. The {{earliest}} extensive surveys of ice thickness were the airborne <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> {{carried out in the}} 1970 s and 1980 s (Macheret and Zhuravlev, 1982; Dowdeswell and others, 1984). These studies used low-accuracy radar and positioning systems and mostly consisted of a single profile along the centre line of each glacier. Subsequent radar campaigns, mostly ground-based but sometimes also airborne, used increasingly improved radar and positioning systems providing a wider coverage of the glacier surfaces by radar profiles. A complete summary of glaciers on Svalbard with readily available radio-echo sounded ice-thickness data can be found in Martín-Español and others (2015) ...|$|R
50|$|The 2009 and 2010 maximal depths {{were not}} {{confirmed}} by the series of dives Nereus made to the bottom during an expedition in May-June 2009. The direct descent measurements by the four expeditions which have reported from the bottom, have fixed depths in a narrow range from 10,916 m (Trieste) to 10,911 m (Kaikō), to 10,902 m (Nereus) to 10,898 m (Deepsea Challenger) Although {{an attempt was made}} to correlate locations, it could not be absolutely certain that Nereus (or the other descents) reached exactly the same points found to be maximally deep by the sonar/echo sounders of previous mapping expeditions, even though one of these <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> was made by Nereus mothership.|$|R

30|$|River restorations or even entire river relocations are {{complicated}} and expensive {{to plan and}} implement. Due {{to the fact that}} morphological changes can always have positive as well as negative consequences, it must be determined if such an intervention will improve the morphodynamics and the river-floodplain system as an environmental habitat. Here, the Inde River is used as a case study to analyze these consequences extensively and to learn from this example for future relocations and restorations. Initially, the results of different analyses of sediment samples and <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> of the Inde River are presented. Then, the results of the Inde River, focusing on the temporal scale of its fluvial morphodynamics, and its continuous sediment transport, are discussed and compared to its pre-defined guiding principles.|$|R
30|$|The field {{measurement}} campaign {{started in}} 2005 AD, {{after the completion}} of the relocation and restoration of the Inde River, and ended in 2018 AD. The campaign is subdivided into two parts: (1) For the years 2005 AD until 2012 AD, sediment samples from the riverbed were collected for sedimentological characterization, and sediment traps, <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> and the adjacent hillsides were analyzed. The focus was on the initial morphological development of the new Inde River after its hydraulic connection to the already existing river reaches. (2) Different sediment samples from the riverbed of the years 2017 AD and 2018 AD as well as suspended sediments sampled during a bankfull discharge were analyzed, focusing on its heavy metal content as a tracer for the ongoing morphological development of the Inde River in the restoration reach.|$|R
40|$|A global {{estimate}} of the energy conversion rate from geostrophic flows into internal lee waves in the ocean is presented. The estimate {{is based on a}} linear theory applied to bottom topography at O(1 – 10) km scales obtained from single beam <b>echo</b> <b>soundings,</b> to bottom stratification estimated from climatology, and to bottom velocity obtained from a global ocean model. The total energy flux into internal lee waves is estimated to be 0. 2 TW which is 20 % of the global wind power input into the ocean. The geographical distribution of the energy flux is largest in the Southern Ocean which accounts for half of the total energy flux. The results suggest that the generation of internal lee waves at rough topography is a significant energy sink for the geostrophic flows as well as an important energy source for internal waves and the associated turbulent mixing in the deep ocean.

25|$|After delivery, Irma {{served on}} the BergenNewcastle route until she was {{transferred}} to Norway {{in the autumn of}} 1921 to carry out tourist voyages to the North Cape and Spitsbergen in the summer seasons. In 1927, she was put on the NorwayHamburg route, replacing SS Neptun and SS Mira. A new heating system was installed in 1913 and wireless radio in 1914. Irma had a new streamlined rudder put in place in 1928. In 1931, she joined the Hurtigruten route in Norway, replacing SS Hera after the latter's shipwreck in March that year. Irma was rebuilt that year and once again the year after that. In a series of upgrades she received a refrigeration system in 1933, improved navigational equipment in 1938 and an <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> device in 1939. Irma was a very popular ship amongst her passengers, with her smoking salon receiving particular praise. She had only one serious accident in the pre-war years, which occurred when she hit a reef off Kabelvåg in the Lofoten islands in 1937. Although suffering leaks in her port side, Irma managed to make port in Kabelvåg and put ashore all of her 120 passengers. Repairs were carried out at a shipyard in Bergen.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the media}} hype {{described}} above, {{it appears that}} the Ambrose Channel pilot cable never met with large scale commercial success. Initially, some contemporaries of the cable proposed that it be extended several miles past the Ambrose light. Such plans never came to fruition, as advances in technology rendered the pilot cable obsolete. By 1929 the Baltimore Sun reported ships navigating the Channel blindly without making any reference to the cable. In that year, Marriott publicly complained that navigation cables still had unrealized potential for guiding ships. Leader cable systems appear to have been obsoleted by the refinement of radio direction finding and the placement of radio beacons (low-power radios broadcasting an identifiable signal) at strategic locations. They are analogous to lighthouses, but can be [...] "seen" [...] in all weather, and are used for navigation {{in the same way as}} regular lighthouses. The first successful application of these radio beacons as [...] "radio fog signals" [...] were three stations installed near New York in 1921. In 1924, there were eleven stations in operation in the United States and nearly three hundred ships suitably equipped. By 1930, an article in the Journal of the Royal Society of Arts declared that [...] "wireless aids and <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> have superseded [...] ". [...] Today, more modern navigation tools such as radar, GPS, and lighted buoys help ships navigate Ambrose Channel.|$|E
