[...] The Daily Telegraph wrote of his Jack Point: [...] "Whether giving expression to poor Jack’s professional wit, or hiding a sorry heart behind light words... Mr Grossmith was master of the part he assumed." [...] In 1883, The Times, reviewing a matinee performance of Iolanthe, wrote: [...] "Mr. Grossmith's impersonation of the Lord Chancellor has ... become an exquisitely refined satire."

[...] Gilbert and the actor had a famous exchange during rehearsals for The Mikado about an improvised bit of [...] "business" [...] in which Jessie Bond pushed Grossmith, as they kneeled before the Mikado, and he rolled completely over.

(This assumes the subject is not {{breaching}} etiquette by trying to attract attention, including wandering around.) However, another person may argue that erections—even if non-sexual—are impolite, and certain groups are likely to be offended (e.g. some females who have experienced past sexual abuse). Complicating the matter, many would-be adult newcomers mistakenly think this is inevitable. [...] "What if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> erection?"
