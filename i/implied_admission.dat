40|$|Admissions {{of white}} {{privilege}} and/or racism are common among white anti-racists {{and others who}} want to combat their racism. In this article, I argue that because such admissions are conscious attempts to address unconscious habits, they are unhappy speech acts and contrary to their <b>implied</b> aims. <b>Admissions</b> of white privilege or racism can be conceptualized as Foucauldian confessions that are pleasurable to enact but ultimately reinforce white people’s feelings of goodness {{and allow them to}} avoid addressing this racism. I ground my argument in Shannon Sullivan’s analysis of white privilege and Sara Ahmed’s critique of confessions of racism/privilege to show that in addition to doing no anti-racist work at the moment of saying, these confessions actually reify white privilege deeper into the unconscious and make it harder to address. Sullivan’s work, I conclude, offers white people a more productive way forward than their unhappy performative declarations of privilege. A white person’s understanding of her confessing habit cannot break this habit, but it might orient her toward examining what sorts of anti-racist moves do work...|$|R
40|$|Students, {{particularly}} older children, {{generally do}} not ask questions or seek academic assistance from teachers in class or their peers. Reasons include concerns about perceptions of incompetence amongst group members, a {{lack of confidence in}} helpers to give accurate help or communicate ideas clearly, and self-beliefs that seeking help threatens a student’s independence. Findings are similar for both face-to-face situations and within online learning communities. Appealing for help when attempting to solve a mathematical problem can be a daunting task for a student. Asking for help requires the ability to articulate a question. It involves a student acknowledging they are unsure about what to do, and could <b>imply</b> an <b>admission</b> of perceived inability or confidence in mathematics to fellow students.

40|$|This paper aims at {{approaching}} some crucial themes {{from the}} viewpoint of a feminist epistemology that is oriented to a sociological interpretation of contemporary societies. In feminist epistemology women’s historical and social experience is a necessary premise to the interpretation of social dynamics. However, the proposition of its own internal heterogeneity <b>implies</b> an <b>admission</b> of partiality and relative sidedness of the assumption which, while trying to assert itself, cannot but distance itself from any anthropology of identity or politics of truth, following a deconstructive method. These considerations show the meaning of meta-narration in contemporary feminist epistemology: it is closely concerned with the domination-freedom relationship, which is nowadays the individual’s dilemma par excellence. For women, the dilemma is between protection and caring, subjection and seduction: these are the forces regulating, reproducing and partially solving gender contracts, patriarchal and post-patriarchal configurations in public and private relations, the ways in which {{and the extent to which}} the female body is accessible to men. By looking from a sociological perspective of the feminist debate around social conflicts on necessaries such as caring, time, money, body, procreation, sexuality, I mean to highlight the cruces and reconfigurations of gender relationships in globalized European societies, where the intersection between gender, race and social class seems to advance various dual political constructions, among which the old tradition-modernity dichotomy...|$|R

This <b>implies</b> that hospital <b>admission</b> may be recommended {{on the basis of}} exceeding an arbitrarily defined risk of adverse outcome, rather than weighing the potential benefits, risks and costs of hospital admission. This approach is likely to lead to irrational decision making, unnecessary hospitalisation and unrealistic expectations regarding risk. Instead of using the concept of a safe discharge, we should take a more rational approach to decision making, weighing the benefits, risks and costs of hospitalisation against a default option of discharge home. Hospital admission should be recommended only if the expected benefits outweigh the risks and can be accrued at an acceptable cost. Guidelines should be developed using this approach and used to promote and support rational decision making...|$|R
30|$|Our {{findings}} imply {{strong and}} substantial program impacts {{with little or}} no lag. In contrast, previous studies suggest that participants obtain little benefit initially—possibly experiencing earnings reductions due to “lock-in” effects—as they engage in training activities that supplant employment. In our data, the mean duration for participation in the program is between two and three quarters, so we expect that program participation would hinder participants’ early employment and earnings, consistent with previous studies. One possibility is that differential selection induces these observed estimates, in which case WIA participants have unmeasured attributes that make them more likely than those in the comparison program to obtain employment or higher earnings. This explanation <b>implies</b> that staff <b>admission</b> criteria or participant choice selected program entrants who would have obtained higher earnings and employment levels in the absence of participation than comparison group members with similar attributes and similar prior employment and program experiences.|$|R
40|$|The most {{significant}} and intriguing Jaina contribution to Indian philosophical heritage is beyond doubt {{the theory of}} the multiplexity of reality (anekânta-vâda), that trifurcates into the method of the four standpoints (nikšepa-vâda, nyâsa-vâda), the method of the seven-fold modal description (sapta-bhaógî 1, syâd-vâda) and the doctrine of viewpoints (naya-vâda), or the (usually) sevenfold method of conditionally valid predications.

The directors of Inside Deep Throat responded to the article, suggesting that actual revenues from the film were possibly even higher than the $600 million figure.

40|$|In three-tiered web applications, {{some form}} of {{admission}} control is required to ensure that throughput and response times are not significantly harmed during periods of heavy load. We propose Q-Cop, a prototype system for improving admission control decisions that computes measures of load on the system based on the actual mix of queries being executed. This measure of load is used to estimate execution times for incoming queries, which allows Q-Cop to make control decisions {{with the goal of}} minimizing the number of requests that are not serviced before the client, or their browser, times out. Using TPC-W queries, we show that the response times of different types of queries can vary significantly, in excess of 50 % in our experiments, depending not just on the number of queries being processed but on the mix of other queries that are running simultaneously. The variation <b>implies</b> that <b>admission</b> control can benefit from taking into account not just the number of queries being processed, but also the mix of queries. We develop a model of expected query execution times that accounts for the mix of queries being executed and integrate that model into a three-tiered system to make admission control decisions. This approach makes more informed decisions about which queries to reject, and our results show that it significantly reduces the number of unsuccessful client requests. Our results show that this approach makes more informed decisions about which queries to reject and as a result significantly reduces the number of unsuccessful client requests. For comparison, we develop several other models which represent related work in the field, including an MPL-based approach and an approach that considers the type of query but not the mix of queries. We show that Q-Cop does not need to re-compute any modelling information in order to perform well, a strong advantage over most other approaches. Across the range of workloads examined, an average of 47 % fewer requests are denied than the next best approach...|$|R

Adverse events that require intensive care <b>admission</b> <b>imply</b> a considerable financial burden to the healthcare system. The epidemiology of adverse events in Belgian hospitals has never been assessed systematically. Findings A multistage retrospective review study of patients requiring a transfer {{to a higher level}} of care will be conducted in six hospitals in the province of Limburg. Patient records are reviewed starting from January 2012 by a clinical team consisting of a research nurse, a physician and a clinical pharmacist. Besides the incidence and the level of causation and preventability, also the type of adverse events and their consequences (patient harm, mortality and length of stay) will be assessed. Moreover, the adequacy of the patient records and quality/usefulness of the method of medical record review will be evaluated. Discussion This paper describes the rationale for a retrospective review study of adverse events that necessitate a higher level of care. More specifically, we are particularly interested in increasing our understanding in the preventability and root causes of these events in order to implement improvement strategies.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality in hospitalized (critically ill and non-critically ill) patients. This was a retrospective study conducted during the period of June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014, at the Postgraduate Department of Pediatrics, G. B. Pant Hospital, an Associated Hospital of Government Medical College, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. All patients between the ages of one month and 18 years were included in the study, who had AKI. In general, out of 23, 794 patients, 197 developed AKI (0. 8 %). On subgroup analysis, 2460 were critically ill and had Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission among whom 99 developed AKI (4 %), whereas 21, 334 had general pediatric ward admissions and 98 developed AKI (0. 5 %). Infantile age group was the most commonly 91 (46. 2 %) affected. The common causes of AKI were renal in 73 (37 %), neurologic in 38 (19 %), septicemia in 35 (18 %), and inborn errors of metabolism in 30 (15. 2 %). Out of 197 pAKI patients, 42 (21. 3 %) died and all of them were critically sick (ICU admissions).

This study aimed to determine the potential risk factors and outcomes of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus in aneurysmal SAH patients but without hydrocephalus upon arrival at the hospital. Methods One hundred and sixty-eight aneurysmal SAH patients were evaluated. Using functional scores, those without hydrocephalus upon arrival at the hospital were compared to those already with hydrocephalus on admission, those who developed it during hospitalization, {{and those who did not}} develop it throughout their hospital stay. The Glasgow Coma Score, modified Fisher SAH grade, and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade were determined at the emergency room. Therapeutic outcomes immediately after discharge and 18 [*]months after were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Score. Results Hydrocephalus accounted for 61. 9 % (104 / 168) of all episodes, including 82 with initial hydrocephalus on admission and 22 with subsequent hydrocephalus. Both the presence of intra-ventricular hemorrhage on admission and post-operative intra-cerebral hemorrhage were independently associated with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus in patients without hydrocephalus on admission. After a minimum 1. 5 [*]years of follow-up, the mean Glasgow outcome score was 3. 33 [*]±[*] 1. 40 for patients with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and 4. 21 [*]±[*] 1. 19 for those without. Conclusions The presence of intra-ventricular hemorrhage, lower mean Glasgow Coma Scale score, and higher mean scores of the modified Fisher SAH and World Federation of Neurosurgical grading on <b>admission</b> <b>imply</b> risk of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus in patients without initial hydrocephalus.

5000|$|Upon their 'discovery', Foreign Secretary William Hague {{requested}} Anthony Cary, {{a former}} British High Commissioner to Canada, {{to conduct an}} internal review into why the migrated archives had been spotlighted neither by the FoI requests nor by the initial Court Disclosure request. Cary reported the following month, and outlined the background as follows: As British dependent territories came to independence decisions {{had to be taken}} about which papers to destroy, which to leave for successor administrations, and which to ship back to the UK. The general rule, as set out in a Colonial Office guidance telegram of 3 May 1961 on the 'disposal of classified records and accountable documents', was the successor Governments should not be given papers which:* might embarrass HMG or other Governments;* might embarrass members of the police, military forces, public servants or others eg police informers;* might compromise sources of intelligence information; or* might be used unethically by Ministers in the successor GovernmentIn addition [...] "There would be little object in handing over documents which would patently be of no value to the successor Government". A great many documents were destroyed on this basis, but others were returned to the UK. These became the so-called 'migrated archives', eventually totalling around 8,800 files. [...] Britain does not stand alone in facing such colonial legacies. Despite a public apology made in 2004 and the pledge of increased aid commitments to Namibia, the German Government still faces claims from the Herero peoples over a genocide inflicted in 1904. The Italians, too, are entangled in claims from their occupation of Libya. Silvio Berlusconi has gone further than the Germans, issuing an apology and promising a reparations payment of $5 billion.The British will look toward the German and not the Italian model in handling the Mau Mau case. An apology should be issued to Kenya, and if it was to be given with a pledge of development assistance, then this might help to lay the ghosts of the past.This should happen, but is it likely? It would <b>imply</b> an <b>admission</b> that torture had taken place under British rule in Kenya. We are making fools of ourselves by denying this. It is time to face up. —Professor David Anderson, June 2009 Though sympathetic to the FCO, Cary's report nonetheless judged that despite the involvement of relatively junior staff, who had been genuinely ignorant about the contents of the migrated archives, there were more knowledgeable staff who had not been. Conveniently, in 2006, after the FoI requests came in, the fifty-year-old migrated archives were relocated to the section for [...] "FCO material of between 3 and 30 years old".|$|R

This master thesis analyses the challenges of fairness and equity in access to HE in Georgia. Main focus {{of this study is}} directed to the introduction of General Ability Test at university entrance examinations and its influence on accessibility of HE for entire population of Georgia. The study aims to answer on following research questions: what are the ideas behind introduction of GAT as admission tool; what is the experience of different stake holders of General Ability Test (GAT) and its impact (role) on state study grant distribution policy; and what are general challenges of fairness and equity in access to higher education in Georgia and to what extent had introduction of GAT influenced these challenges? Access <b>implies</b> assessment and <b>admission</b> tools and financial aid policy. General Ability test was introduced in Georgia as admission tool with thinking on social equilibrium and fight against private tutoring. The study highlights some problematic issues: implications for equity on merit based grant distribution policy, quality of secondary schools and impact of private tutoring on fairness and equity in access to HE. A model of equal opportunities by Jacobs is applied to bring to light notion of fairness in Georgian admission anxiety. Education reforms driven by globalisation are used to highlight challenges of equity in access to HE within competition driven education reforms. Qualitative research methods were applied to find the answer on research questions. Policy documents, interviews and questionnaires were used to collect the data. Data analyses showed that major obstacle for equity in access to HE is low quality of public secondary schools in Georgia and flourish of private tutoring in all subjects included GAT. High correlation of GAT to other subject based test indicates that GAT is as SES biased as curriculum based subjects. Measurements made by policy makers to improve quality of public schools by introduction of voucher based financing of public schools did not result in substantial changes. Empirical findings show that majority of high scorers in GAT are students who passed mathematic as their fourth choice exam. GAT results show that it has some qualities for equity and fairness in access to HE, for instance for minorities, but can XI produce other type of inequalities. Based on empirical results it is possible to assume that introduction of GAT produced new wave of private tutoring directly in GAT or in mathematic.

Potilaita oli yhteensä 309 ja bakteremiaepisodeja 314. Tutkimuksessa selvitettiin eri emm tyyppien merkitystä verenmyrkytyksen vaikeusasteeseen ja tappavuuteen. Kaikki A-, C- ja G- ryhmän veriviljelykannat emm-tyypitettiin. Harvinaisille Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis kannoille ja kannoille, joille emm tyyppiä ei saatu määritettyä, tehtiin pulssikenttä-geelielektroforeesi (PFGE) -tyypitys. S. pyogenes kannoille tehtiin superantigeenien määritys. Väitöstutkimuksessa havaittiin G-streptokokin aiheuttamien verenmyrkytysten ilmaantuvuuden suureneminen Pirkanmaalla. Ihorikot altistavat A- ja G-streptokokin aiheuttamille verenmyrkytyksille ja ihoinfektiot olivat tärkein infektion lähtökohta A- ja G-streptokokin aiheuttamissa verenmyrkytyksissä. Tutkimuksessa todettiin myös, että aiempi ruusuinfektio näytti suojaavan kuolemalta beetahemolyyttisissä verenmyrkytyksessä. Selluliitti infektion lähtökohtana liittyy hyvään ennusteeseen. Kuumeen esiintyminen parantaa ennustetta. Alkoholismi, vaikea perustauti, matala leukosyyttitaso ja korkea plasman C-reaktiivinen proteiini (CRP) - taso lisäsivät kuolemanvaaraa. Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (C- ja G-streptokokki) verenmyrkytyksessä todettiin harvinaisten emm-tyyppien liittyvän suurempaan tappavuuteen (3 - kertainen vaara) ja vaikeampaan taudinkuvaan (4 -kertainen vaara). C- ja G-streptokokkin aiheuttamissa verenmyrkytyksessä iho-ja pehmytkudosinfektioita kuten esim. selluliittia esiintyi tilastollisesti enemmän yleisten emm-tyyppien aiheuttamissa infektioissa. A-streptokokin emm-tyyppien, superantigeenien ja infektion lähtökohdan välillä ei todettu yhteyttä. Nykyinen kehitteillä oleva A-streptokokkirokote kattaa vain 62 %:a verenmyrkytyksiä aiheuttavista emm-tyypeistä Pirkanmaalla. A Population-based Study of Beta-hemolytic Streptococcal Bacteremia: Epidemiological, {{clinical}} and molecular characteristics Background and aims. The serogroups A (Streptococcus pyogenes, GAS), B (Streptococcus agalactiae, GBS), C and G (GCS and GGS) are generally defined as beta-hemolytic streptococci. Human large colony-forming groups C and G streptococci are now classified as S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. Beta-hemolytic streptococci cause {{a variety of}} infections ranging from mild pharyngitis and skin and soft-tissue infections to severe life-threatening infections such as bacteremia, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF). The most common presenting clinical manifestations are infections of skin and soft-tissue, respiratory, urinary, intestinal or genital tract. S. pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis share virulence factors. The M protein is a major virulence factor in that it confers resistance to phagocytosis. The classical M-protein serological typing was largely replaced in the late 1990 s by sequence-based typing of the emm-gene encoding for the M protein. Based on the variability of the N-terminal end of the emm gene, as many as 150 defined emm types are recognized among S pyogenes isolates, and more than 50 sequence types presently described among S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates, respectively. The first aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the predisposing factors, clinical presentations and outcome in beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia in the Pirkanmaa area, Finland. The second aim was to determine emm types of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis and S. pyogenes bacteremic isolates and the relation of emm types to the severity of bacteremia. Methods. This study was based on population-wide surveillance for beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia in adults. The predisposing factors, clinical presentations and outcome in beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia during the 10 -year observation period (1995 - 2004) in Pirkanmaa, Finland, was studied retrospectively. A case was defined as a positive blood culture for group A, B, C or G beta-hemolytic streptococci. The number of patients was 309 and the number of bacteremia episodes was 314. All risk factors associated with severe disease and mortality were analyzed. S. pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates were emm-typed. Non-typable S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strains and strains isolated from patients with recurrent GGS bacteremia were characterized using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Isolates of S. pyogenes were superantigen profiled. Results. The incidence of GGS bacteremia increased statistically significantly during the study period (p= 0. 013). Skin infections as the presenting manifestation were particularly common in patients with GAS and GGS bacteremia. A history of previous cellulitis seemed to be a protecting factor against death (p= 0. 014). Fever was associated with a good prognosis. Alcoholism, ultimately or rapidly fatal underlying disease, high plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) level and leukopenia on admission predicted a poor outcome. StG 480, stG 6, stG 485, stG 643, stC 6979, stG 166 b and stC 74 a were the seven most common emm types, covering 75 % of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates. The mortality (p= 0. 01) and severity of the disease (p= 0. 001) were higher in S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis bacteremia caused by rare emm types than those caused by common types. Skin and soft-tissue infections such as cellulitis were significantly more frequent clinical manifestations in episodes caused by common than rare types (p= 0. 007). No association was found between emm type, underlying diseases and disease manifestations of S. pyogenes bacteremia. No association was found between single SAg genes and presenting clinical manifestations of S. pyogenes infections. The putative 26 -valent GAS vaccine could have covered 62 % of the isolates causing invasive disease in the Pirkanmaa Health District during the study period. Conclusions. The incidence of GGS bacteremia was increasing in Pirkanmaa, Finland, during 1995 - 2004. A similar trend in incidence has also been noted in Denmark. Disruption of the cutaneous barrier as a predisposing factor and skin infections as a presenting infection focus were particularly common in patients with GAS and GGS bacteremia. A history of previous cellulitis seemed to be a protecting factor against death (p= 0. 014). Also cellulitis as the presenting clinical manifestation predicted a favourable outcome. Confusion, a lowered level of consciousness or dyspnea as the first sign or symptom were markers of a poor prognosis, while fever seemed to be a protecting factor against death. Alcoholism, ultimately or rapidly fatal underlying disease, high plasma CRP level and leukopenia on <b>admission</b> <b>implied</b> a poor prognosis. It is important to identify factors associated with a poor prognosis in order to find patients most likely to benefit from possible preventive measures as well as needing more intensive therapeutic regimens. The mortality (p= 0. 01) and severity of the disease (p= 0. 001) were higher in S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis bacteremia caused by rare emm types as against common types. Skin and soft-tissue infections such as cellulitis were significantly more frequent clinical manifestations among common than among rare emm types (p= 0. 007). No associations between GAS emm types, SAg genes and disease manifestations were observed. The current formulation of GAS vaccine would provide only limited coverage of GAS emm types in Finland...|$|R
