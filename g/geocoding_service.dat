However, Chinese geocoding faces great challenges because {{of the complexity of}} the address string format in Chinese, which contains no delimiters between Chinese words, and the poor address management resulting from the existence of multiple address authorities spread among different governmental agencies. This paper presents a <b>geocoding</b> <b>service</b> based on an optimized Chinese address matching method, including address modeling, address standardization and address matching.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of Internet-based mapping and geospatial analysis has caused {{an increase in the}} demand for online <b>geocoding</b> <b>services.</b> Although such services provide convenience, low (or free) cost and immediate solutions, their characteristics, sometimes, overshadow the expectation of producing quality of geocoded results. In recent years, several geocoding techniques have emerged, including rooftop geocoding, but they have yet to receive much attention in the literature. This paper examines and compares the quality of online rooftop and street <b>geocoding</b> <b>services</b> based on match rates and positional accuracy. Six <b>geocoding</b> <b>services</b> by five providers (i. e., Microsoft Virtual Earth, Google, Geocoder. us, MapQuest, and Yahoo!) were evaluated using addresses in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Results of the comparison indicate that rooftop geocoding produces slightly lower match rates but significantly higher positional accuracy than street <b>geocoding.</b> The hybrid <b>service,</b> which combines the two techniques, produces match rates as high as other street <b>geocoding</b> <b>services</b> but improves in positional accuracy close to the level of rooftop <b>geocoding.</b> <b>Geocoding</b> <b>services</b> employing reference databases with similar quality trend to produce compatible match rates and positional accuracy. This paper examines the sensitivity of different address types on geocoding quality. The results reveal that both rooftop and street geocoding produce high match rates and high accuracy for residential addresses. However, positional accuracies of agricultural and industrial address types are not very reliable due to the small sample sizes. With these, it is recommended to use online rooftop <b>geocoding</b> <b>services</b> if high positional accuracy is the priority, use street geocoding if high match rate is the priority, and use the hybrid approach if both high match rates and high positional accuracy are required...|$|R

Many online map providers such as Google Maps, Bing Maps and Yahoo Maps present geocoding as one of their basic capabilities. Despite the diversity of <b>geocoding</b> <b>services,</b> users usually face some limitations when they use available online <b>geocoding</b> <b>services.</b> In existing <b>geocoding</b> <b>services,</b> proximity and nearness concept is not modelled appropriately as well as these services search address only by address matching based on descriptive data.

In order to implement the proposed method, a web-based system is designed. In proposed method, nearness to places is defined by fuzzy membership functions and multiple fuzzy distance maps are created. Then these fuzzy distance maps are integrated using fuzzy overlay technique for obtain the results.

All the geocoding tools tested produced varying results, indicating that analysts should indeed take care when geocoding physical locations, especially when doing so for purposes of location-based analysis, and should take that same care when selecting geocoding tools in the first place.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Geocoding {{has become}} one of the most popular on-line services. Nowadays, there exist many Web <b>Services</b> {{providing}} <b>geocoding</b> functionality which differ not only in technological aspects (interface, invocation style, etc.) or terms of use, but also in type of geographic information provided and spatial data quality. Currently, there is no problem to find geocoding providers but to choose the proper one, which is determined by user’s requirements. The public administration is responsible for providing the official and appropriate information for citizens or deal with risk and health management issues; therefore, urban management systems require <b>geocoding</b> <b>services</b> of high quality in terms of quality of service (QoS) and spatial data. However, the present Web geocoding public market is dominated by <b>geocoding</b> <b>services</b> for average users, i. e. users that can accept low QoS or are not interested in the lineage of data. In this situation, a compound geocoder can join data from several services of geographic information and provide services oriented to the users that demand high quality, for example urban management systems.

There is also an abundance of free web maps bundled with first-class services. Therefore, we expect them and even demand them. We came to a similar conclusion in our company, so I implemented three advanced services for the geographic information system that are very popular at the moment. 	The <b>geocoding</b> <b>service</b> finds addresses, streets or buildings that match a given search string. User chooses a locator and sets its properties, including a name of the place they are looking for. I also considered the full text searching, but which I didn't use for several reasons. 	The reverse <b>geocoding</b> <b>service</b> finds the nearest addresses, streets or buildings located in the nearby vicinity of a specified location. User chooses a locator, sets location coordinates and the working radius to be searched in. A method for computing the shortest distances is very important here. The best such method {{has proven to be a}} computation of distances on an Earth-shaped spherical model. The thesis contains other extensively tested methods, too. 	The routing service calculates the least expensive route from one location to another. User specifies a start and a goal location and two path evaluation functions. The A* algorithm is used, which speeds up the computation by using heuristic assumptions. One function estimates the path already handled; the second heuristically estimates the remaining path to the goal. 	All three services are built in the form of server services. They all use the same, newly developed, data model, in which the data is not duplicated. The model stores data universally for any location in the world and is flexible enough for any future expansions. 	Streets', buildings' and addresses' data is stored in a relational database and can use multiple geographical names. Object-relational mapping is used for communicating the data between the database and the server. The whole system is based on the Java technology. 	The result of this thesis is a fully-operational system, although it goes without saying, that the potential for improvements is enormous. ...|$|E

40|$|Web {{services}} {{have been more}} and more migrated to cloud computing platforms during the last years. Also Web GIS services are being migrated while becoming more commonly used and more frequently implemented. These aspects increase the need for models showing how these kinds of services should be implemented in cloud environments. In this study, architectural models were developed for four different, and commonly used, Web GIS services in a cloud environment. Based on the architectural models, one model was implemented as a proof of concept in the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. To {{be able to develop}} the models, a literature review was done to define what Web GIS, cloud computing, Microsoft Azure and geospatial web services are. One architectural model, based on the three-tier model for web services, was created for each of the following services: WMS, WMTS, WFS and <b>geocoding</b> <b>service.</b> The models were made general and should be seen as guidelines that can be adapted to cloud environments, not as definitive models for specific platforms. As a proof of concept the WMTS model was implemented {{as a part of a}} project at Karttakeskus Oy. The service was implemented as an IaaS service consisting of a combined GIS and web server and a separated cache server. The combined web and GIS server was implemented as horizontally scalable. The cache server was a crucial part in implementation because the maps provided by the service only existed as pre-made tiles in the cache. However, it turned out that the cache server also was the bottleneck of the service. Still all but one technical requirements were met during the performance tests that were conducted on the service. The use of virtual hard disks as server templates ensured an increased management, maintenance and simplicity of the service in terms of the requirements set on the implementation. The study concludes that it is possible to implement a WMTS service in the Azure cloud platform while utilizing the benefits from cloud services, e. g. scalability was taken into account in both the architectural models and in the proof of concept. Under de senaste åren har allt fler webbtjänster migrerats till molntjänstplattformer. Också allt fler Web GIS tjänster migreras samtidigt som de både används och implementeras allt oftare. Dessa faktorer ökar behovet av modeller på hur dessa tjänster borde implementeras i molnmiljöer. I denna studie utvecklades arkitekturmodeller för fyra, vanligen förekommande, Web GIS tjänster i molnmiljö. Baserat på modellerna implementerades sedan en av tjänsterna som ett koncepttest i Microsofts Azure molnplattform. För att kunna utveckla modellerna utfördes en litteraturstudie där bl. a. begreppen Web GIS, molntjänst, Microsoft Azure och geospatiala webtjänster definierades. Det skapades en enskild arkitekturmodell, med grund i treskiktsmodellen för webbtjänster, för varje enskild av följande tjänster: WMS, WMTS, WFS och geokodningstjänst. Modellerna gjordes generella och skall ses som anpassningsbara riktlinjer för molnmiljöer, inte som strikta modeller för någon specifik plattform. Som ett koncepttest implementerades en WMTS tjänst som en del av ett projekt på Karttakeskus Oy. Tjänsten implementerades som en IaaS tjänst bestående av en kombinerad webb och GIS server samt en åtskild cache server. Den kombinerade webb och GIS servern implementerades som horisontellt skalbar. Cache servern var en viktig del av implementationen eftersom de kartor som publicerades via tjänsten endast fanns som cache på den servern. Det visade sig dock att just cache servern var tjänstens flaskhals. Trots detta uppfylldes alla förutom ett av prestandakraven under de tester som utfördes på tjänsten. Användningen av virtuella hårdskivor, som fungerade som server mallar, möjliggjorde en ökad hantering, underhållning samt enkelhet hos tjänsten, i enlighet med kraven som ställts på tjänsten. Studien drar slutsatsen att det är möjligt att implementera en WMTS tjänst i Azure plattformen samtidigt som man utnyttjar fördelarna med molntjänster, t. ex. skalning togs i beaktande i såväl arkitekturmodellerna som i koncepttestet...|$|E

First, for increasing geocoding match rates with reduced positional uncertainty, an integrated geocoding technique was developed after an empirical comparison of the geocoding results based on manually built and online <b>geocoding</b> <b>services</b> and subsequently applied to generate geographic coordinates of PHC practices which are an essential element for measuring potential access to health care. Next, the results of the Three-Step Floating Catchment Area (3 SFCA) method was compared with simpler approachs to calculate the City level physician-to-population ratios and this research highlights the benefit of using the 3 SFCA method over simpler approaches in urban areas by providing similar or comparable results of City level physician-to-population ratios with the advantage of intra-urban measurements. Further, the results point out that considerable spatial variation in geographical accessibility to PHC services exists within and across Canadian urban areas and indicate the existence of clusters of poorly served neighbourhoods in all urban areas. In order to investigate the low accessibility scores in relation to population health care needs, spatial statistical modeling techniques were applied that revealed variations in geographical accessibility to PHC services by comparing the accessibility scores to different socio-demographic characteristics across Canadian urban settings. In order to analyse how these relationships between accessibility and predictors vary at a local scale within an urban area, a local spatial regression technique (i. e., geographically weighted regression or GWR) was applied in two urban areas. The results of GWR modelling demonstrates intra-urban variations in the relationships between socio-demographic variables and the geographic accessibility to PHC services. In addition, the influences of “unit of analysis” on accessibility score were analyzed using spatial statistical modeling that emphasize the use of units of analysis that are pertinent to policy and planning purposes such as city defined neighbourhoods. Overall, this research shows the importance of measuring geographic accessibility of PHC services at local levels for decision makers, planners, researchers, and policy makers in the field of public health and health geography. This dissertation will advance current understanding of access to primary care in Canadian urban settings from the perspective of the neighbourhood...|$|R

Curs acadèmic 2014 - 2015 In {{the last}} few years, we have {{observed}} an exponential increasing of the information systems, and parking information is {{one more example of}} them. The needs of obtaining reliable and updated information of parking slots availability are very important in the goal of traffic reduction. Also parking slot prediction is a new topic that has already started to be applied. San Francisco in America and Santander in Spain are examples of such projects carried out to obtain this kind of information. The aim of this thesis is the study and evaluation of methodologies for parking slot prediction and the integration in a web application, where all kind of users will be able to know the current parking status and also future status according to parking model predictions. The source of the data is ancillary in this work but it needs to be understood anyway to understand the parking behaviour. Actually, there are many modelling techniques used for this purpose such as time series analysis, decision trees, neural networks and clustering. In this work, the author explains the best techniques at this work, analyzes the result and points out {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each one. The model will learn the periodic and seasonal patterns of the parking status behaviour, and with this knowledge it can predict future status values given a date. The data used comes from the Smart Park Ontinyent and it is about parking occupancy status together with timestamps and it is stored in a database. After data acquisition, data analysis and pre-processing was needed for model implementations. The first test done was with the boosting ensemble classifier, employed over a set of decision trees, created with C 5. 0 algorithm from a set of training samples, to assign a prediction value to each object. In addition to the predictions, this work has got measurements error that indicates the reliability of the outcome predictions being correct. The second test was done using the function fitting seasonal exponential smoothing tbats model. Finally as the last test, it has been tried a model that is actually a combination of the previous two models, just to see the result of this combination. The results were quite good for all of them, having error averages of 6. 2, 6. 6 and 5. 4 in vacancies predictions for the three models respectively. This means from a parking of 47 places a 10 % average error in parking slot predictions. This result could be even better with longer data available. In order to make this kind of information visible and reachable from everyone having a device with internet connection, a web application was made for this purpose. Beside the data displaying, this application also offers different functions to improve the task of searching for parking. The new functions, apart from parking prediction, were: - Park distances from user location. It provides all the distances to user current location to the different parks in the city. - <b>Geocoding.</b> The <b>service</b> for matching a literal description or an address to a concrete location. - Geolocation. The service for positioning the user. - Parking list panel. This is not a service neither a function, is just a better visualization and better handling of the information...|$|R
