25|$|However, if no {{possible}} arrangement of ground conditions {{leads to the}} port conditions, the circuit might not behave the same way. The improvement factors (1 + βFB AOL) for determining input and output impedance might not work. This situation is awkward, because a failure to make a two-port may reflect a real problem (it <b>just</b> <b>is</b> not possible), or reflect a lack of imagination (for example, just {{did not think of}} splitting the emitter node in two). As a consequence, when the port conditions are in doubt, at least two approaches are possible to establish whether improvement factors are accurate: either simulate an example using Spice and compare results with use of an improvement factor, or calculate the impedance using a test source and compare results.|$|E
