5000|$|The terms rhizotomy and {{neurotomy}} {{are also}} increasingly becoming interchangeable {{in the treatment}} of chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease. This is a procedure called a <b>facet</b> <b>rhizotomy</b> and is not a surgical procedure but is instead done on an outpatient basis using a simple probe to apply radiofrequency waves to the impinged pain-causing nerve root lying between the facet joint and the vertebral body. Such radio frequency nerve lesioning results in five to eight or more months of pain relief before the nerve regenerates and another round of the procedure needs to be performed. A <b>facet</b> <b>rhizotomy</b> {{is just one of many}} different forms of radiofrequency ablation, and its use of the [...] "rhizotomy" [...] name should not be confused with the SDR procedure.|$|E

The zygapophyseal (facet) joints are true synovial joints, which connect adjancet vertebrae posteriorly. The medial branch of the posterior primary ramus is responsible for joint sensation. Symptoms of facet arthropathy include: hip and buttock pain,cramping lower extremity pain, usually not lower than the knee, low back stiffness, especially in the morning, pain commonly aggravated by prolonged sitting or stending. Signs of lumbar facet arthropathy are: paraspinal tenderness, worse over the affected joint, pain with movements that stresses the joints, i. e., hyperextension, lateral rotation and side bending, hip, buttock, or back pain on straight leg raising, absence of signs of nerve root irritation. Lumbar facet joint injection are performed for theurapeutic and diagnostic reason. Most studies have found that facet injection provide temporary pain relief. The current recommendations suggest the primary role of facet injection (intra-articular or medial branch block) to be diagnostic. These procedures may facilitate the diagnostic of facet syndrome and help predict if patient would benefit from more permanent measures, such as <b>facet</b> <b>rhizotomy...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{speculation}} that the facet joint (FJ) can {{be a source of}} spinal pain was first proposed in 1910 and examined by Goldthwait in 1911. 1 In 1927, Putti focused specifically on degenerative processes in the articular facets 2 nd suggested the possibility that they might constitute nonmechanical sources of nerve irritation. Not until 1933 was the term “facet syndrome” ABSTRACT: Background:There have been many reports of percutaneous radiofrequency <b>facet</b> <b>rhizotomy,</b> perhaps better referred to as facet denervation, usually performed under general anaesthesia, with inconsistent success rates. Obj c ives:To repor the authors’ outcome data using both general and local anaesthesia and to reassess the value of this controversial procedure. Me hods:Our experience with 118 consecutive percutaneous radiofrequency facet rhizotomies performed on 90 patients in the T ronto West rn Hospital was analyzed. Sixty percent of the procedures were performed under general anaesthesia, 40 % under local anaesthesia. All patients had been temporarily virtually relieved of pain after local anaesthetic blockade of the subject facets by an independent radiologist. Results:The patients were monitored from 1 – 33 (mean 5. 6) months after surgery, with complete elimination or a greater than 50 % subjective reduction of pain considered the criteria for success. For the first or only procedure this was 41 % overall, 37 % in cases done under local anaesthesia, 46 % in cases done under general anaesthesia (difference not statistically significant p= 0. 52).
