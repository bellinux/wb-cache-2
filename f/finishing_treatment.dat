25|$|Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, {{abdominal}} cramps, and constipation {{are common}} side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells. Malnutrition and dehydration can result {{when the patient}} does not eat or drink enough, or when the patient vomits frequently, because of gastrointestinal damage. This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the patient eats too much {{in an effort to}} allay nausea or heartburn. Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with antiemetic drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or ginger tea, are often recommended. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of <b>finishing</b> <b>treatment.</b> However, a high index of suspicion is appropriate, since diarrhea and bloating are also symptoms of typhlitis, a very serious and potentially life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.|$|E

50|$|The {{properties}} of petroleum-based synthetic fibers, most important among them being polyamide, polyester and polyacrylonitrile, are essentially {{different from those}} of natural cellulosic and protein/wool fibers.

50|$|Family {{members can}} be {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} cancer experience of their loved ones.

50|$|Finishing {{treatments}} {{can affect}} the workpiece surface {{in a wide variety}} of manners. Some clean and/or remove defects, such as scratches, pores, burrs, flash, or blemishes. Other processes improve or modify the surface appearance by improving smoothness, texture, or color. They can also improve corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and/or reduce friction. Coatings are another type of <b>finishing</b> <b>treatment</b> that may be used to plate an expensive or scarce material onto a less expensive base material.|$|E

5000|$|The Bofinger Chair, {{also named}} BA 1171, was {{designed}} by architect and designer Helmut Bätzner in 1964. In close co-operation with Bofinger company, situated in Ilsfeld in Baden-Württemberg/Germany, under owner and managing director Rudolf Baresel-Bofinger, the Bofinger stacking chair was developed into the first one-piece plastic chair worldwide in fibreglass- reinforced polyester to be mass-produced in one single pressing process over a steel mould. [...] The material was dyed all way through before being processed and available {{in a range of}} colours including white, yellow, black, red, blue, green, brown and orange. In a long trial series the characteristic shape of the chair was found in regard to seating shape, maximum stability by smallest quantity of material used, required elasticity, stacking capability, and industrial mass-production. The pressing process in the heated steel mould with a weight of approximately 11 tons lasted under five minutes and required as <b>finishing</b> <b>treatment</b> only simple scraping round the edges to remove excess polyester.|$|E
50|$|Chrome plating is a <b>finishing</b> <b>treatment</b> {{using the}} {{electrolytic}} deposition of chromium. The {{most common form}} of chrome plating is the thin, decorative bright chrome, which is typically a 10-&#181;m layer over an underlying nickel plate. When plating on iron or steel, an underlying plating of copper allows the nickel to adhere. The pores (tiny holes) in the nickel and chromium layers work to alleviate stress caused by thermal expansion mismatch but also hurt the corrosion resistance of the coating. Corrosion resistance relies on what is called the passivation layer, which is determined by the chemical composition and processing, and is damaged by cracks and pores. In a special case, micropores can help distribute the electrochemical potential that accelerates galvanic corrosion between the layers of nickel and chromium. Depending on the application, coatings of different thicknesses will require different balances of the aforementioned properties. Thin, bright chrome imparts a mirror-like finish to items such as metal furniture frames and automotive trim. Thicker deposits, up to 1000&#160;µm, are called hard chrome and are used in industrial equipment to reduce friction and wear.|$|E

50|$|The {{processes}} that affect surface integrity can be conveniently broken up into three classes: traditional processes, non-traditional processes, and <b>finishing</b> <b>treatments.</b> Traditional processes {{are defined as}} processes where the tool contacts the workpiece surface; for example: grinding, turning, and machining. These processes will only damage the surface integrity if the improper parameters are used, such as dull tools, too high feed speeds, improper coolant or lubrication, or incorrect grinding wheel hardness. Nontraditional processes are defined as processes where the tool does not contact the workpiece; examples {{of this type of}} process include EDM, electrochemical machining, and chemical milling. These processes will produce different surface integrity depending on how the processes are controlled; for instance, they can leave a stress-free surface, a remelted surface, or excessive surface roughness. <b>Finishing</b> <b>treatments</b> are defined as {{processes that}} negate surface finishes imparted by traditional and non-traditional processes or improve the surface integrity. For example, compressive residual stress can be enhanced via peening or roller burnishing or the recast layer left by EDMing can be removed via chemical milling.|$|R
50|$|Furniture oils are not {{recommended}} for maintenance {{as many of them}} contain linseed oil or other drying oils, and when used repeatedly will create a gummy, insoluble surface coating that darkens and obscures the grain of the wood.

Silicone polishes are also {{not recommended}} as they leave a film that is difficult to remove and can interfere with future <b>finish</b> <b>treatments.</b>|$|R

30|$|But in Fig.  11 b a {{different}} trend was observed. When depth of whip roller’s position was decreased at constant height, shrinkage decreased in both state because tension of warp yarns was gradually decreased at long shed area.

30|$|Interim {{analyses}} are generally performed after half {{or more of}} the subjects have completed follow-up (Pedley 2011). Depending on the duration of accrual relative to the length of follow-up, this strategy may be inefficient because it is possible that accrual will have been completed and patients will have <b>finished</b> <b>treatment</b> prior to the interim analysis. If, however, the interim analysis was done earlier and a statistically significant effect was found, the trial may be stopped, and all future subjects would receive the experimental therapy.|$|R
