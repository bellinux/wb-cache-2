25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the <b>fluted</b> <b>feed</b> <b>rollers,</b> under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} into material wrinkling failure mechanics of conventional metal spinning {{and the effects}} of process parameters and material properties are presented in this paper. By developing finite element (FE) models using the Box-Behnken design of experiments, the effects of six key process and material parameters on the start of material wrinkling have been investigated. These key factors include <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> per pass, feed rate, blank thickness, tool path profile, material Young’s modulus, yield stress and strain hardening exponent. The results of FE simulation are validated by comparing the modelled roller tool forces and spun part end shape with those measured during a spinning experiment. From FE simulations, large residual stresses in the form of bending moments are found to be present in the flange of the blank, induced by the roller contact. It is found that material wrinkling failure begins when a plastic hinge is formed between the roller and the edge of the blank. It is found that both <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> per pass and feed rate produce the most significant effect on the initiation of wrinkling failure, as they increase the bending stresses causing a plastic hinge to form more rapidly, thus wrinkling to occur more quickly...|$|R

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} the mass of grain seeds, which flow {{in the shape of}} clumps, was suggested in this paper. The methodology used an off-the-shelf digital fibre sensor to detect the behaviour of the clumps and multiple linear regression modelling {{to estimate the}} mass by the parameters detected by the sensor which were the length and the density of the clumps. An indoor apparatus was used for modelling which resembled the sowing process using the grain drill. A <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> was installed in the apparatus to regulate the flow of seeds. It was rotated by a motor at 2, 4 and 6 rpm to cover all the possible mass flow rates which might occur during actual sowing. Modelling was based on several assumptions, such as the linearity between the sensor parameters and the mass. Although errors were observed while estimating each clump independently, the methodology was able to estimate the mass of a continuous flow of seed clumps. The average difference in estimation at 4 rpm was 0. 9 %, while there was overestimation at 2 rpm and underestimation at 6 rpm resulting in an overall estimation error of 5. 3 %. These results showed that the digital fibre sensor could be used for estimating mass flow of seeds at variable sowing rates within the speed limits of the grain drill. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Rocket & missile casing, rocket motor case, cartridge case, rocket nose cones are few examples of flow forming process. The nature of process is non linear with complex deformation behavior. There are mainly two strategies used during the process viz. forward and backward/reverse. In forward method, the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> and material deformation is same and in reverse method, the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> and material deformation is opposite. Usually there are three force components encountered during the process i. e. axial, radial and circumferential. The understanding and knowledge of forces are crucial for tooling design for various geometrical and material conditions. The online force measurement during the process is quite difficult in commercial machines. Therefore, a simulation model is developed to estimate forces during the process. Taguchi L 9 design has been used to develop the model because it is a well established design of experiment method to solve complex and time consuming problems. Three levels of three operating variables (rotational speed, axial feed and depth of forming) along with friction factor have been used during the study. The material utilized as Aluminum Alloy 6063 due to its light weight, excellent corrosion resistance, recyclable, cost effectiveness, ease of availability, durability etc. It has been observed that axial force is found to be highest followed by the radial and circumferential force. Also it has been discerned that axial feed and friction factor are the most prominent factors affecting axial and circumferential forces during the process. Further, radial force is influenced by friction factor only. The effect on von mises stress and equivalent plastic strain also studied and reported...|$|R

Hence a planter for such diverse cropping systems needs to have multi-functional capabilities. Service providers {{also need to be}} able to hire out their planter for business all year round to justify the investment cost. There are a number of other criteria and challenges that would need to be satisfied by potential purchasers of a planter.

Wear will be minimum for rubber material with high hardness but indeed it pronounce the breakage of rice. Hence, for efficient husking the rubber roll material should possess the balance of physico-mechanical properties.

A seed drill {{that can be}} drawn by the widely-available two-wheel tractor (2 WT) is an attractive option for mechanization of no-till in small-sized fields. The Versatile Strip Seed Drill (VSSD) was designed with the capacity to make up to 40 mm wide and 60 mm deep strips in untilled land along with seed and basal fertilizer application in a single-pass operation, while powered by the 8. 95 to 11. 93 kW 2 WT. An important innovation of the VSSD was to fit the seed box with both fluted roller-type seed meters for delivery of sufficient small-size seeds to achieve adequate plant density per unit row length; and vertical disk-type seed meters for precision and spaced row planting of larger seeds. Both incessant seed dropping by <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> seed meters and spaced planting by vertical disk type seed meters provided optimum plant populations that were generally higher than in conventional, full-tillage plots with the same rate of hand broadcasted seed and fertilizers. Time required for crop establishment by VSSD ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 18 ha·h− 1.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{wrinkling}} {{failure in}} conventional spinning of a cylindrical cup {{has been investigated}} by using both finite element (FE) analysis and experimental methods. FE simulation models of a spinning experiment have been developed using the explicit finite element solution method provided by the software Abaqus. The severity of wrinkles is quantified by calculating the standard deviation of the radial coordinates of element nodes {{on the edge of}} the workpiece obtained from the FE models. The results show that the severity of wrinkles tends to increase when increasing the <b>roller</b> <b>feed</b> ratio. A forming limit study for wrinkling has been carried out and shows that there is a feed ratio limit beyond which the wrinkling failure will take place. Provided that the feed ratio is kept below this limit, the wrinkling failure can be prevented. It is believed that high compressive tangential stresses in the local forming zone are the causes of the wrinkling failure. Furthermore, the computational performance of the solid and shell elements in simulat-ing the spinning process are examined and the tool forces obtained from wrinkling and wrinkle-free models are compared. Finally, the effects of the feed ratio on variations of the wall thickness of the spun cylindrical cup are investigated...|$|R
