Harrison and fellow Quartet guitarist Ken Brown, however, missed a show, causing Les Stewart to fire the two and drop the residency. This caused distress to Best, but Harrison offered a solution: he recruited Lennon and McCartney to play, and they returned to calling themselves the Quarrymen. After helping Best finish converting the cellar, the new four guitarist line-up of the Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Brown) opened the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959.

5000|$|Burgess Macneal {{continued}} {{working with}} ITI and hired George Massenburg. Together they began {{creating a new}} prototype recording console for ITI. [...] During {{the building of the}} console, around 1966, Macneal and Massenburg conceptualized an idea for a sweep-tunable EQ that would avoid inductors and switches. In approximately 1967, an engineer attending Princeton University named Bob Meushaw, a friend of Massenburg, built a three-band, frequency adjustable, fixed-Q, IC op-amp-based EQ based on passive 2 resistor/2 capacitor or 3 resistor/3 capacitor “T” filters (a design that was primarily from a 1940s Bell Labs filter handbook). Meushaw’s design provided further inspiration for the EQ concept that Macneal and Massenburg were designing. While working on the design of the circuit, Massenburg had a marked breakthrough and together with an <b>input</b> <b>amplifier</b> built by ITI’s chief engineer, the concept was functional around 1969.|$|E

50|$|The ATA {{has four}} primary {{advantages}} for scientific studies over all major radio telescopes built to date: {{a very wide}} field of view (2.45° at λ = 21 cm), complete instantaneous frequency coverage from 0.5 to 11.2 gigahertz (GHz), multiple simultaneous backends, and active interference mitigation. The area of sky which can be instantaneously imaged is 17 times that obtainable by the Very Large Array telescope. The instantaneous frequency coverage of more than four octaves is unprecedented in radio astronomy, and {{is the result of}} a unique feed, <b>input</b> <b>amplifier</b> and signal path design. Active interference mitigation will make it possible to observe even at the frequencies of many terrestrial radio emitters. All-sky surveys are an important part of the science program, and the ATA will have increased efficiency through its ability to conduct radio astronomy observations and extraterrestrial intelligence searches (SETI) simultaneously. The telescope can do this by splitting the recorded signals in the control room prior to final processing. Simultaneous observations are possible because for SETI, wherever the telescope is pointed, several target stars will lie within the large field of view afforded by the 6 m dishes. By agreement between the UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory (RAL) and the SETI Institute, the needs of conventional radio astronomy will determine the pointing of the array.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A rail to rail input, 2. 5 V CMOS <b>input</b> <b>amplifier</b> is {{designed}} that amplifies uniformly at all {{common mode voltage}} levels. The design makes use of a rail to rail stage which performs transconductance (G M) control of the transistors in the input amplifying stage.

A high gain output stage is used to produce a high 68 dB gain from the circuit. Care has been taken to avoid any extra pole in the circuit to keep the phase margin high. To get extra phase margin (65 degrees), capacitances have been added in a cascoded Miller design style to increase {{the value of the}} capacitance. Resistances have also been added in series to the capacitances to reduce the effect of the zero, pushing frequency at which it exists higher and thereby getting a unity gain frequency (100 MHz) performance from the circuit.

40|$|This bachelor's thesis aims at {{designing}} the circuit diagram of {{input and output}} circuits of analog to digital and, simultaneously, digital to analog convertors intended to process audio signals and their realization. The introductory theoretical part deals with the qualitative requirements concerning the way low-frequency audio amplifiers process audio signal. The following part focuses on the active component base selection {{with respect to the}} achievement of the required quality and parameters as defined in the task description. The next part comprises the design of the input and output amplifier circuit diagram itself and then the realization of their functional samples. The <b>input</b> <b>amplifier</b> provides some of the functions which are common with high quality sound production; such as attenuator activation, input signal phase inversion, and MUTE function.
