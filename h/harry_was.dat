The animal, a male called <b>Harry,</b> <b>was</b> owned by the {{explorer}} John Ainsworth Horrocks. <b>Harry</b> <b>was</b> ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.|$|E

The headmaster reveals that <b>Harry</b> <b>was</b> able to defeat Quirrell because when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, giving Gryffindor enough points to win the House Cup.|$|E
40|$|On the {{dominant}} view of vagueness, if it <b>is</b> vague whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald, {{then all the}} specific facts about the distribution of hair on Harry’s head, together with all the facts about Harry’s comparison class, together with all the facts about our community-wide {{use of the word}} ‘bald’, fail to settle whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald. On {{the dominant}} view, if it <b>is</b> vague whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald, then nothing settles whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald—it is unsettled, not merely epistemically, but metaphysically, whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald. Call this view vagueness-as-indeterminacy. Vagueness-as-indeterminacy entails the following proposition: that clear vagueness as to whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald clearly does not entail that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald. I argue against this proposition, and thus against vagueness-as-indeterminacy. My argument consists of a defense of the following rival proposition: that it is vague whether clear vagueness as to whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald entails that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald. The argument itself is short. Most of the paper is devoted to responding to various objections to the argument, as well as attempting to explain away the initial appeal of the proposition that clear vagueness as to whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald clearly does not entail that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald...|$|R
40|$|The two {{standard}} {{theories of}} vagueness—vagueness-as-ignorance and vagueness-asindeterminacy—agree {{on the following}} principle: if you are certain that it is clearly vague whether p, then you clearly should not believe p and you clearly should not believe not-p. I argue against the principle, and thus against the two standard theories. I offer {{an explanation of the}} initial appeal of the principle. And I show how a rival principle helps to better explain a recalcitrant trio of widely accepted data. You are certain that it is clearly vague whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald. How confident should you <b>be</b> that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald, and how confident should you <b>be</b> that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> not bald? More generally, what is the rational stance to take toward an apparently vague issue? Call this the rationality question. On vagueness-as-indeterminacy, if it <b>is</b> vague whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald, then there is no answer to the question whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald. 1, 2 This suggests that you should have absolutely no confidence that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald, and absolutely no confidence that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> not bald. For however confident you are in a candidate answer to a question, you should be at least as confident that the question has an answer. To accommodate the possibility of questions without answers, Hartry Field (2000, 2003, 2004) develops a 1 Some proponents of this view hold that all vagueness-related indeterminacy has its source in semantic indeterminacy. On this version of vagueness-as-indeterminacy, the reason that there is no {{answer to the question of}} whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald is that our linguistic practices fail, in the first place, to settle which question is the question of whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald...|$|R

5|$|John Truman was {{a farmer}} and {{livestock}} dealer. The {{family lived in}} Lamar until <b>Harry</b> <b>was</b> ten months old, when they moved to a farm near Harrisonville, Missouri. The family next moved to Belton, and in 1887 to his grandparents' 600-acre (240-ha) farm in Grandview. When Truman was six, his parents moved to Independence, so he could attend the Presbyterian Church Sunday School. Truman did not attend a traditional school until he was eight.

5|$|Throughout the six {{previous}} {{novels in}} the series, the titular character Harry Potter {{has struggled with}} the difficulties of adolescence along with being famous as the only wizard to survive the Killing Curse. The curse was cast by the evil Tom Riddle, better known as Lord Voldemort, a powerful evil wizard, who had murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby, in the belief this would frustrate a prophecy that Harry would become his equal.

40|$|On two {{standard}} {{views of}} vagueness, vagueness {{as to whether}} <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald entails that nobody knows whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald—either because vagueness {{is a type of}} missing truth, and so there is nothing to know, or because vagueness is a type of ignorance, and so even though there is a truth of the matter, nobody can know what that truth is. Vagueness as to whether <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald does entail that nobody clearly knows that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald and that nobody clearly knows that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> not bald. But it does not entail that nobody knows that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> bald or that nobody knows that <b>Harry</b> <b>is</b> not bald. Hence, the two standard views of vagueness are mistaken. Where exactly does your chin meet your cheek? It is vague where your chin meets your cheek. On two standard views of vagueness, it is therefore impossible for you to know where your chin meets your cheek, either because vagueness is a type of missing truth—and so there is nothing for you to know—or because vagueness is a type of ignorance— and so even though there is a truth of the matter, you cannot know what it is.

5|$|Throughout {{the three}} {{previous}} novels in the Harry Potter series, the main character, Harry Potter, {{has struggled with}} the difficulties of growing up, and the added challenge of being a famed wizard: when <b>Harry</b> <b>was</b> a baby, Lord Voldemort, the most powerful Dark wizard in history, killed Harry's parents but mysteriously vanished after unsuccessfully trying to kill Harry, which left a lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. This results in Harry's immediate fame and his being placed {{in the care of}} his abusive muggle, or non-magical, aunt and uncle, Aunt Petunia Dursley and Uncle Vernon Dursley, who have a son named Dudley Dursley.|$|E
5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was {{tackling the}} perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he was concerned the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, <b>Harry</b> <b>was</b> able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E
5|$|Harry learns from Snape's memories, {{that while}} Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, {{he loved his}} late mother, Lily.

Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe {{he saw in the}} woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within <b>Harry</b> <b>was</b> killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. He fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.|$|E

5|$|The {{last half}} of the century's first decade was a time of sorrow, {{loneliness}} and constant work for Pankhurst. In 1907 she sold her home in Manchester and began an itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place as she spoke and marched for women's suffrage. She stayed with friends and in hotels, carrying her few possessions in suitcases. Although she was energised by the struggle–and found joy in giving energy to others– her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU. In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, <b>Harry</b> <b>was</b> paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed. She hesitated to leave the country while he was ill, but she needed money to pay for his treatment and the tour promised to be lucrative. On her return from a successful tour, she sat by Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910. Five days later she buried her son, then spoke before 5,000 people in Manchester. Liberal Party supporters who had come to heckle her remained quiet as she addressed the crowd.|$|E

5|$|This sparks the rumour mill yet again, as {{students}} {{around the school}} suspect Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin (as Slytherin was also a parselmouth), and circumstantial evidence to support this theory arrives {{in the form of}} another attack, this time on Hufflepuff second-year Justin Finch Fletchley and the Gryffindor ghost. Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to suspect that Draco is behind the attacks, given his family history of remaining well within Slytherin ranks and open hostility toward Muggle-born students, and so Hermione concocts Polyjuice potion, which allows them to become Draco’s boorish lackeys, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, for an hour to interrogate him. This comes to nothing, as Draco’s father only told his son the general facts of the previous opening of the Chamber and that it occurred fifty years previously. Meanwhile, Myrtle Warren, an existentially mopey ghost that haunts a bathroom, unwittingly provides a new clue {{in the form of a}} diary deposited in her stall—a diary, moreover, that belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who knows all too well about the Chamber, having been witness to a fellow student’s death fifty years ago.
