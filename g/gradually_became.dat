5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance left Central America on September 22. Despite some wind shear, the system <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> better organized and a tropical depression formed September 26, being upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} several hours later. The cyclone immediately moved north. Instead of strengthening into a hurricane before landfall as forecasted, Olaf weakened due to its proximity to land. On September 29, Olaf made landfall near Salina Cruz, Oaxaca.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, the {{automobile}} <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> the primary form of transportation. Motorists crossing the Pennsylvania mountains during the 1930s {{were limited to}} hilly, winding roads such as the Lincoln Highway (US30) or the William Penn Highway (US22), which had grades exceeding nine percent. Due to their sharp curves and steep grades, the roads were dangerous and caused many fatal accidents from skids.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of the Manners, Etal Castle was managed by the Collingwood family, who <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> the castle's {{hereditary}} constables, renting the demesne lands on the estate from the family as well. The castle was heavily involved in the border wars with Scotland, usually holding a garrison of 100 men and forming an important strategic defensive location, one step removed from the fortifications along the border itself.|$|E
5|$|Lasker {{followed}} Steinitz's principles, {{and both}} demonstrated {{a completely different}} chess paradigm than the “romantic” mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) But, while Steinitz created a new school of chess thought, Lasker’s talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{introducing}} any revolutionary tactical doctrine, crews <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> {{more experienced}} and increased their effectiveness that way, while specialist training was provided {{when it was}} required.

However, with greater innovations, such as radar, better designed aircraft, and more potent weaponry, the crews built on their experiences and the service became an effective naval air service.|$|E
5|$|The Kowloon Bay salt-fields {{were rich}} in salt, and this brought wealth to the {{residents}} near the bay. Gradually, Ham Tin Shan became villages.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave. Environmental conditions favored tropical development, and the system <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> better organized, although convection was initially limited near the center. On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the system to be considered a tropical depression; at the time, it was located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on November5. It tracked steadily west across the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Its forward motion slowed after it passed the Lesser Antilles on November12. A large well-defined anticyclone persisted across much of the Caribbean Sea, providing a favorable environment for the system. A low-level circulation <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> evident on satellite imagery within the disturbance. Based on ship observations, the National Hurricane Center estimated that the system organized into a tropical depression on November17, about 280miles (450km) south of the western tip of Haiti.|$|E
5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> dilapidated before falling down.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Chinese Daoism, {{ancestor}} worship, and foreign-originated Buddhism {{were the}} most prominent religious practices in the Song period. Daoism developed largely from {{the teachings of the}} Daodejing, attributed to the 6th century BC philosopher Laozi ("Old Master"), considered one of the Three Pure Ones (the prime deities of Daoism). Buddhism in China, introduced by Yuezhi, Persian, and Kushan missionaries in the first and second centuries, <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> more native in character and was transformed into distinct Chinese Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} during the 1990s, it {{appeared}} that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. As more and more difficulty emerged in his life, he <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 with the help of Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E

Cunningham began his training in August 1935, flew solo in March 1936 and received his wings in 1937. He <b>gradually</b> <b>became</b> an established test pilot, gaining considerable flying time on different types of aircraft.|$|E
