500|$|Continuing their {{theme of}} {{collectible}} 7" [...] vinyl releases, which had seen [...] "Vow" [...] packaged in an aluminium sleeve and [...] "Subhuman" [...] in black rubber, Mushroom packaged the 7" [...] format for [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] in a [...] "Prismaboard" [...] (rain-effect) die-cut card sleeve, with a hologram logo sticker on the <b>inner</b> <b>jacket.</b> The b-side of the vinyl was pressed with a double-groove, so that either [...] "Girl Don't Come" [...] or [...] "Sleep" [...] played {{depending on where}} the stylus landed; the songs were shorter on the vinyl than {{they were on the}} CD or cassette formats to accommodate both {{on one side of the}} disc. This pressing was limited to 5,000 copies. The original design for the vinyl was for the sleeve to be made from wood, or corrugated cardboard, with wing-nuts in each corner like a flower-press. The nuts would have to have been unscrewed to find the vinyl disc inside - between ten layers of different types of cardboard.|$|E
50|$|A steam {{connection}} {{is attached to}} {{each end of the}} assembled hose, and pressurized steam is injected into the hose. This makes the liner swell against the <b>inner</b> <b>jacket</b> and causes the thin sheet of uncured rubber to vulcanize and bond the liner to the <b>inner</b> <b>jacket.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{jackets and}} liner are {{cut to the}} desired length. The <b>inner</b> <b>jacket</b> is {{inserted}} into the outer jacket, followed by the liner.|$|E
60|$|The farmers {{as a rule}} {{preferred}} the open carrefour for their transactions, despite its inconvenient jostlings and the danger from crossing vehicles, to the gloomy sheltered market-room provided for them. Here they surged on this one day of the week, forming a little world of leggings, switches, and sample-bags; men of extensive stomachs, sloping like mountain sides; men whose heads in walking swayed as the trees in November gales; who in conversing varied their attitudes much, lowering themselves by spreading their knees, and thrusting their hands {{into the pockets of}} remote <b>inner</b> <b>jackets.</b> Their faces radiated tropical warmth; for though when at home their countenances varied with the seasons, their market-faces all the year round were glowing little fires.|$|R
25|$|Several Minutemen album {{sleeves and}} covers, {{such as the}} Paranoid Time EP and What Makes a Man Start Fires? LP and the <b>inner</b> {{gatefold}} <b>jacket</b> for Double Nickels, feature drawings by noted artist Raymond Pettibon, {{who was at the}} time associated with the SST label. Other album covers, like on The Punch Line, , and 3-Way Tie (For Last), featured paintings by Boon.|$|R
50|$|Photographs & Memories: His Greatest Hits is a 1974 {{compilation}} album (and second posthumous release) by Jim Croce, originally {{released on}} ABC Records. The album was released {{a year after}} Croce's 1973 death in an airplane crash. The <b>inner</b> photo <b>jacket</b> includes a tributatory essay {{on one side and}} a photo of Jim's son A.J. on the other. The title track originally appeared on the You Don't Mess Around with Jim LP as well as the B-side of the album title track single in 1972.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{presented}} the MELCOR preliminary calculation, which {{was performed to}} investigate behavior of the parameters during the Boil-off test at QUENCHfacility. The experiment QUENCH-II on boil-off and subsequent quenching is dedicated to investigate degraded core refiood situations with a rather low mass flow rate. MELCOR 1. 8. 5 computer code {{has been used to}} simulate the investigated transient. The MELCOR 1. 8. 5 base tine input model was providedfrom Forschungszentrum, Karlsruhe. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE QUENCH FACILITY The scheme of the QUENCH facility is presented on Figure 1. In radial direction the QUENCH fuel rod bundle is composed of an unheated rod at center position, an inner ring of 8 heater rods connected to an electric power supply, an outer ring of 12 heater rods connected to another electric power supply system, and a set of 4 corner rods at the vacant rod positions. The test section is made from 20 heated fuel rod simulators, approximately 2. S m long, and an unheated rod in the center. They are filled with a mixture of 95 vol % Argon and 5 vol % krypton at a pressure slightly about fluid pressure in the bundle and connected to a compensating volume at room temperature. The bundle is enclosed in a shroud, which is composed of Zircaloy liner (2. 38 mm thick), ZK> 2 fiber insulation (37 mm thick) and the <b>inner</b> cooling <b>jacket,</b> made of stainless steel. The region between the shroud and the <b>inner</b> cooling <b>jacket,</b> i. e. the Z 1 O 2 fiber insulation and the region (space) above this insulation are flooded with argon before the test, the pressure being about 2 bar...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the final pressure testing, each hose is subjected {{to a variety of}} inspections and tests at each stage of manufacture. Some of these inspections and tests include visual inspections, ozone resistance tests, accelerated aging tests, adhesion tests of the bond between the liner and <b>inner</b> <b>jacket,</b> determination of the amount of hose twist under pressure, dimensional checks, and many more.|$|E
5000|$|Buffett has {{mentioned}} in past interviews that {{the album was}} recorded during a very 'painful' time. This was because he had broken his leg {{at one point during}} the tour, and was performing in a cast (as referenced several times on the record and even pictured in the <b>inner</b> <b>jacket).</b> He would usually be immobile, and would take painkillers to continue on during the frenzied performances.|$|E
5000|$|Their debut 7", [...] "Girls Don't Count", was {{released}} in July 1980 on Factory Records, produced by Ian Curtis and Rob Gretton of Joy Division. All Section 25 releases would be released through either Factory Records (until the demise of that label), or sister imprint Factory Benelux. Their debut LP, Always Now, appeared in 1981 and was produced by Martin Hannett at Britannia Row studio. The pochette sleeve {{was among the most}} expensive and elaborate in the label's history (designed by Peter Saville) utilising an exclusive 'marble' effect design printed on the <b>inner</b> <b>jacket</b> and a fold-out cover that resembled a match-book similar to the cover used by Cabaret Voltaire for their 2x45 album.|$|E

5000|$|Flight Log {{was first}} reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 {{as a part}} of the [...] "Paper Sleeve Collection" [...] reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release {{features}} an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and <b>inner</b> sleeve <b>jackets</b> for the CDs. Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. Unfortunately it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of [...] "Silver Spoon". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D.|$|R
50|$|These {{built-up}} guns {{consisted of}} a rifled tube encased within an <b>inner</b> and outer <b>jacket</b> with a horizontal sliding breech block. The breech was sealed with an 18 kg (40 lb) brass case containing 30 kg (66 lb) of smokeless powder with a 160 gram (5.6 oz) gunpowder igniter. A cloth bag containing an additional 21 kg (40 lb) of smokeless powder and 380 grams (13 oz) of gunpowder was loaded between the projectile and the brass case. Each gun could fire approximately five rounds per minute. Useful life expectancy was 510 effective full charges (EFC) per barrel.|$|R

50|$|In Bhutan {{there is}} a {{traditional}} national dress prescribed for men and women, including the monarchy. These have been in vogue {{for thousands of years}} and have developed into a distinctive dress style. The dress worn by men is known as Gho which is a robe worn up to knee-length and is fastened at the waist by a band called the Kera. The front part of the dress which is formed like a pouch, in olden days was used to hold baskets of food and short dagger, but now it is used to keep cell phone, purse and the betel nut called Doma. The dress worn by women consist of three pieces known as Kira, Tego and Wonju. The long dress which extends up to the ankle is Kira. The jacket worn above this is Tego which is provided with Wonju, the <b>inner</b> <b>jacket.</b> However, while visiting the Dzong or monastery a long scarf or stoll, called Kabney is worn by men across the shoulder, in colours appropriate to their ranks. Women also wear scarfs or stolls called Rachus, made of raw silk with embroidery, over their shoulder but not indicative of their rank.|$|E
50|$|These cables use two {{parallel}} bus wires which carry electricity {{but do not}} create significant heat. They are encased in a semi-conductive polymer. This polymer is loaded with carbon; as the polymer element heats, it allows less current to flow. The cables are manufactured and then irradiated and by varying both the carbon content and the dosage then different tape with different output characteristics can be produced. There is then an <b>inner</b> <b>jacket</b> which separates the bus wires from the grounding braid. In commercial and industrial cables, an additional outer jacket of rubber or Teflon is applied. The benefits of this cable are the ability {{to cut to length}} in the field, It is more rugged but not necessarily more reliable than series or zone heaters, it cannot over-heat itself so in theory it can be crossed, but it is bad practice to install tape in this way. Self-regulating heating cables have a specific maximum exposure temperature based on the type of polymer which is used to make the heating core which means that if they are subject to high temperatures then the tape can be damaged beyond repair. Also self-limiting tapes are subject to high inrush currents on starting up similar to an 'induction' motor so a higher rated contactor is required.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} vinyl {{album was}} a single platter in a gatefold sleeve. The cover featured a piece of Russian folk art from a painted lacquer box, attributed to CCCP (U.S.S.R. in Russian). Kantner has said he enjoyed stealing the art from Russia because many of their albums were bootlegged on the Russian black market. The back cover painting depicts a partially opened parcel revealing a room inside with Jerry Garcia peeking out, behind him a Heavy Naked Woman standing on an American Flag the parcel being flown on a string by a trio of breasts with wings. Inside the gatefold is more artwork with track listings and credits, done in silver ink on black background and featuring a Paul Kantner caricature with a head of marijuana-leaf hair rising over a mountainous planetscape and inkblot pair of marijuana leaves in the lower fold. A mushroom on the left hemi-sphere pyramid {{on the right and}} the mountainous planetscape is nearly a mirror image. The <b>inner</b> dust <b>jacket</b> was decorated with collages of musician photos, writings and doodles. Original pressings included a full-color booklet as well, with lyrics, poetry and drawings mostly done by Slick during the recording sessions and collected daily by Kantner. Subsequent pressings included a black & white version of the booklet.|$|R
2500|$|The 40-caliber barrel was {{constructed}} of twelve parts, notably the inner tube and various <b>inner</b> and outer <b>jacket</b> pieces. The hydro-pneumatic recoil system was {{mounted on the}} cradle above the gun. It used the same horizontal sliding block breech as the 38 cm Belagerungshaubitze M 16. The gun carriage rested on a base box or bedding platform which measured [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high. The base box incorporated a turntable resting on a ball race capable of 360° traverse. At {{the rear of the}} turntable was a [...] tilting crane used to move ammunition from the shell cart to the roller race and to help assemble the roller race and to remove the breech. The roller race was mounted directly behind the gun on four tilting arms. When the gun returned to the prescribed loading angle of 6° the roller race was raised so that it met the rear end of the breech, a shell was placed on roller race by the crane and it was hand-rammed with the shell sliding forward on the rollers. It was followed by a cartridge case containing the propellant. While the gun was being elevated to its firing angles between +10° and +41° 30' the roller race was lowered out of the recoil path of the gun.|$|R
40|$|Three phase {{induction}} motors {{are widely}} used in industries due to their various technical {{as well as economical}} advantages. About 60 % of industrial electricity is consumed by these motors, but the heat generation inside the motor due to various losses is a critical factor which degrades the dielectric properties of insulation and shortening the lifespan of motor. This paper presents the capillary based water cooling method of three phase squirrel cage induction motor. In this method, a jacket of capillaries made of jute and cotton is used as a outer cover for the motor casing. A small air gap passage is provided in between motor casing and <b>inner</b> surface of <b>jacket.</b> Natural Water Cooling Capillaries (NWCC) method is used to lower down the surrounding temperature of motor which reduces heating limitations of motor. For this purpose we select a 1. 1 kW three phase, 50 Hz squirrel cage induction motor. Heat run test is performed on this motor to determine the total loss of energy dissipated as heat on three phase squirrel cage induction motor with and without adopting capillary based water cooling method. Comparison is done on the basis of experimental result which shows that the temperature withstanding capacity of induction motor will increase by 15. 5 % after adopting capillary based water cooling method. This is an economical method and no external energy is required for cooling purpose...|$|R

After first believing he has {{ended up at the}} concert hall instead, as a man plays the accordion, he soon learns he is at the right place, the {{department}} store. Sune goes to a toy store where two guys check a cap gun that Sune purchases, and forgets the money for Sophie's present, a pink cloth cat. Sune steals the cloth cat and puts it in his <b>inner</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket, when discovering the store using camera surveillance. Sune is ashamed, but pays for the cap gun and nobody notices him stealing the cloth cat. Sune takes the bus home, and rings on Sophie' s doorbell and says he stole the cloth cat, while Sophie means he's a criminal, is ashamed and believes he will end up in prison. Sophie declares that's not the case, but stealing is outlawed in Sweden and that Sophie tells him to return the cloth chat, that she doesn't want.

40|$|Coagulation-flocculation {{followed}} by sedimentation, filtration and disinfection, often by chlorine, is used worldwide {{in the water}} treatment technology before distributing treated water to consumers. The aim of the present work is to study the parameters affecting on the coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation by a non-traditional technology. Synthetic turbid water was treated with alum [Al 2 (SO 4) 3. 18 H 2 O], Ferric Chloride [FeCl 3. 6 H 2 O], Ferric sulfate [Fe 2 (SO 4) 3. 9 H 2 O] and cationic polyelectrolyte (C- 492 HMW) in the jar test to determine the critical dosage of the coagulant before applying in the proposed system. The proposed system is based on inline mixing and exploiting the feed pump to perform the rapid mix. Feed inters tangentially to a cylindrical tank where the circular motion facilitates the slow mix in an annular space between {{the wall of the}} tank and an inside jacket. The flow is reversed inside the jacket upward where sedimentation occurs. The clarified water passes over a weir to a filtration unit. An experimental program were conducted at various turbidity levels, retention time, slope of feed angle, slope of <b>inner</b> <b>jacket,</b> coagulant injection point from the mixing pump, flow rate and slow mixing (flocculation) time. The results obtained showed that the proposed system reduces turbidity to about 3. 2, 2. 5 and 2 NTU for retention times 120, 150 and 160 minutes respectively, where in the conventional technology the retention time is about 210 minute...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} LNG rollover has been performed, using cryogenic liquids to simulate a two-layered LNG system. A vacuum insulated glass vessel {{was designed and}} constructed for rollover simulation experiments. Thin metal oxide coatings on the <b>inner</b> <b>jacket</b> of the vessel enabled the simultaneous heating and visualisation of the liquid in the vessel. Mixtures of liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen were successfully used to form two differing density layers. An oxygen analysing system with an accuracy of 0. 01 % by volume oxygen, and a fifteen junction copper-constantan thermocouple array were used for primary measurements of mass concentration and temperature. For a number of initial density differences between layers, various liquid layer heating configurations were used to obtain the variations in evaporation flowrate, and detailed temperature and concentration profiles during experiments. Convective flow patterns in single and two-component liquid mixtures were obtained, using the Schlieren method. Results show that the mixing of layers is primarily due to entrainment of fluid from the intermediate layer separating the two convective layers. The intermediate layer can be described by Double-Diffusive convection theory, and controls the transport of heat and mass between layers. The measured peak flowrate {{is a function of}} the initial density difference between layers. The peak to equilibrium flowrate values are much lower than those reported in rollover incidents, due to the enhanced mixing processes occurring in the simulation mixture. A correlation between the evaporative mass flux and bulk fluid superheat fails during transient heating conditions, and cannot predict very high flowrates. Schlieren flow - visualisation studies clearly show various surface patterns for increasing surface evaporation mass fluxes. <br/...|$|E

Later on,all the jews in Lublinske were gathered up by German soldiers and being taken into the Parczew Forest and where they would probably be killed. Yossel decides to attack the Germans and the jews run away during this encounter. Shayna decides they should come back and check on Yossel and we find the dismembered bodies of the German soldiers and Yossel alive near the riverbank. Yossel has a dozen bullet wounds,some bayonett stab wounds, and was visibly in a lot of pain. Yossel asks Shayna to remove the Shema because that would signify him completing his mission and {{he would be able to}} die. Shayna does this and Yossel goes still and dies.

40|$|The steel-jacketed {{steam heating}} {{pipeline}} employs vacuum insulation {{to improve the}} insulating effect and reduce the corrosion, and hence increases the heat transfer efficiency of the heating network and building energy efficiency. It is important in improving the thermal insulation to investigate the impact of factors that insulate the effects and thermal properties of the pipeline. The thermal insulation of this pipeline comprises the vacuum layer and the insulating material layer. Experiments were performed to measure the combined heat transfer and equivalent thermal conductivities of the insulating material in the vacuum and rarefied air employed in the pipeline's insulation. The thermal properties {{of this type of}} insulation at vacuum pressures of 0. 5 ~ 1013 mbar, employing thermal media temperatures of 343 ~ 573 K and with different thicknesses of vacuum layer, are discussed for this pipeline, for which diameters of <b>inner</b> steel pipe/steel <b>jacket</b> are DN 50 /DN 250, DN 100 /DN 300, DN 200 /DN 500 and DN 500 /DN 850, respectively. The results show that reduction in vacuum pressure reduces the heat loss in the pipeline. The equivalent thermal conductivity of the insulating material layer is distinctively lower than the vacuum layer, but decreasing the vacuum pressure improves the insulating effect of vacuum layer substantially more than insulating the material layer. As the vacuum pressure decreases from 1013 mbar (atmospheric pressure) to 10 mbar at the thermal media temperature of 523 K e. g., the reduction of equivalent thermal conductivities of vacuum layer is approximately three times greater than that of insulating material layer. The equivalent thermal conductivities of the vacuum layer are lower and decease faster as the vacuum pressure is lower than 100 mbar, but the equivalent thermal conductivities of insulating material layer are lower and decease faster as the vacuum pressure is lower than 50 mbar. The pressure in vacuum insulation should be controlled lower than 20 mbar to achieve desirable insulating effects. Every 10 mm addition of thickness of insulating material layer (every 10 mm reduction of thickness of vacuum layer) decreases the heat loss of approximately 6. 8 percent at the vacuum pressure of 0. 5 mbar...|$|R
