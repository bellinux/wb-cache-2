Low-level wastes include paper, rags, tools, clothing, filters, and other materials which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity. Materials that originate from any region of an Active Area are commonly designated as LLW as a precautionary measure even if there is only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials. Such LLW typically exhibits no higher radioactivity than one would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same material disposed of in a non-active area, such as a normal office block.|$|E
25|$|According to the Free-radical theory, {{oxidative}} damage initiated by {{reactive oxygen species}} is {{a major contributor to}} the functional decline that is characteristic of aging. While studies in invertebrate models indicate that animals genetically engineered to lack specific antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD), in general, show a shortened lifespan (as one would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> theory), the converse manipulation, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, has yielded inconsistent effects on lifespan (though some studies in Drosophila do show that lifespan can be increased by the overexpression of MnSOD or glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes). Also contrary to this theory, deletion of mitochondrial SOD2 can extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.|$|E

On Sunday, 10 May 1857, Kotwal Dhan Singh Gurjar opened {{the gates of the}} prison. These soldiers, along with other imprisoned soldiers escaped prison and declared themselves free, revolted, attacked and killed several of the British authorities to take the city under their control. This marked the beginning of a widespread revolt across northern India as these soldiers marched towards Delhi. 10 May is still celebrated as a local holiday in Meerut.|$|E

Vladimir worked for Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, the largest {{iron and steel works}} in Russia and the city's {{dominant}} industry, and played in the Metallurg Magnitogorsk youth and club hockey system. Malkin has one brother, Denis, who is older by one year. Malkin began skating at age 3. He joined his first organized hockey league two years later. He showed an aptitude for the sport at an early age, as one might <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> son of a pro. However, because both of his parents were short, no one suspected that Malkin would be a world-class athlete.|$|E
25|$|Important {{members of}} the {{scientific}} community were spared from Stalin's usual amount of wrath and their punishments were often lessened from what one usually would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> regime. In the beginning this was mainly because of ideological reasons to not harm the party by punishing someone who had received a major award or had international accreditation. Scientists were given more chances to explain their behavior or prove their innocents than average citizens because they were seen as valuable. Later, though it would be for more practical reasons as scientists became the leaders in the arms race which played a major part in the Cold War. The Soviet Science Academy would become the dominant institute where these scientists were educated and often worked.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{highlighted}} is the mansa’s betrayal by Hammad Amina, {{the chief of the}} Fulbe at Masina. Previously, Amina had promised support in taking Jenné, but went over to the Moroccans with whom he already had a king-vassal type relationship. He advised the Moroccans on what to <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mandinka-Bamana force and kept his own forces from joining the battle. The Fulbe are not mentioned as lending military aid to Jenné’s defenders, but their absence from the battlefield may have had a great effect on the final outcome. The pashalik of Timbuktu would also regret putting faith in Hammad Amina. The Fulbe would eventually thrown off their nominal vassalage to the pashalik and hand the Moroccans their first major defeat in the Sahel.|$|E

25|$|Mansa Mahmud IV {{tried to}} take {{advantage}} of the situation with the support of Fulbe and Bambara chiefs. In 1599, the mansa led this army in a march on Battle of Jenné. The rulers of Jenné called on the Moroccan garrison of Arma in Timbuktu for reinforcements. The other obstacle to the mansa's success was his betrayal by a major ally prior to the battle. The reasoning behind this betrayal, according to Mandinka oral traditions was that Mahmud IV did not have the support of Mali's traditional generals, the Farim-Soura and Sankar-Zouma. This major ally of the mansa abandoned him at the last moment and went over to the Moroccans and advised them on what to <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mansa's army. Despite their amazement at the size of the mansa's force, the Arma won the battle after a violent bombardment.|$|E
25|$|David Hemp made 71 as Glamorgan {{made their}} way to a {{relatively}} competitive total of 255 in 77.3 overs on the first day, while Mushtaq Ahmed took five for 89 and James Kirtley four for 42 in response. When Glamorgan bowled, Alex Wharf and Dean Cosker took a wicket each, as Sussex worked their way to 70 for 2, with the match finely poised {{at the end of the}} first day. However, nineteen wickets tumbled on the second day, as Sussex took the victory one would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> relative table positions of the two sides. They lost Ian Ward for 48 early on in the day, but fifties from Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams propelled them to a total of 317, a lead of 62. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan then made up for his wicketless first innings effort by having two men caught behind and one bowled, as Glamorgan crashed to 22 for 3, only to see a small rebuilding effort. But a good bowling effort from Mushtaq and Rana saw Glamorgan crash from 73 for 4 to 78 for 9 as four batsmen were out for ducks. Opener David Cherry was last out, for 39, as Glamorgan were bowled out for 96 in just 28 overs - Rana taking five for 41 and Mushtaq five for 29. Sussex chased 35 to win with ease, losing only Ward in a nine-wicket victory.|$|E

Sasha Frere-Jones, writer from The New Yorker was enthusiastic with the song, calling it a [...] "loud dance tune that {{is reminiscent of the}} songs on Control", although she criticized some lyrics. For Don Baiocchi from Blogcritics, the song was not [...] "the flawless dance floor anthem" [...] her fans were hoping for. Chuck Taylor from Billboard called it disappointing, and felt it was bland and lacked innovation.

Stylus Magazine stated that the [...] "great" [...] track [...] "achieves symbiosis between techno and guitar-pop better than anything else they've done before". The BBC agreed calling [...] "Slow Life" [...] the band's [...] "most successful mindrattling techno attempt so far". The song was placed at number 46 in the 2003 Festive Fifty on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Mellon Collie, the Pumpkins contributed a number of songs to various compilations. Released in early 1997, the song [...] "Eye", which {{appeared}} on the soundtrack to David Lynch's Lost Highway, relied almost exclusively on electronic instruments and signaled a drastic shift from the Pumpkins' previous musical styles. At the time, Corgan stated his [...] "idea [...] to reconfigure the focus and {{get away from the}} classic guitars-bass-drum rock format." [...] Later that year, the group contributed [...] "The End Is the Beginning Is the End" [...] to the soundtrack for the film Batman & Robin. With Matt Walker on drums, the song featured a heavy sound similar to [...] "Bullet With Butterfly Wings" [...] while still having strong electronic influences. The song later won the 1998 Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.
