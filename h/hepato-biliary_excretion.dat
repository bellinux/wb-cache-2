30|$|This {{involves}} the use of MR lipophilic paramagnetic contrast agents, which when given intravenously, show <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>excretion.</b> Contrast agents include gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA, Multihance; Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy), gadolinium ethoxybenzyldiethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA, Primovist; Bayer-Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) and, historically, mangafodopir trisodium (Teslascan; GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway). Delayed imaging in the axial and coronal plane, performed between 10 - 120 min following intravenous administration, normally results in hyper-intense bile on 3 D T 1 -weighted fat-saturated GRE images. The signal-to-noise ratio is higher than conventional T 2 -weighted MRCP, allowing better delineation of the bile ducts. This technique can be used for similar indications as for T 2 -weighted MRCP and in most cases has a similar diagnostic accuracy. It is more expensive than conventional T 2 -weighted MRCP and only the biliary tree is depicted. For these reasons, most centres continue to use conventional T 2 -weighted MRCP. However, functional MRCP does have a number of advantages, as follows: (1) it better demonstrates communications between cystic lesions and draining bile ducts in the diagnosis of congenital biliary disorders (e.g. Caroli’s disease) [11], (2) it helps to distinguish true obstruction in a dilated biliary system (where delayed or no biliary excretion is demonstrated) from pseudo-obstruction [9], and (3) it can demonstrate active extravasation of contrast in suspected bile leaks [12, 13]. Another advantage is that these gadolinium-based hepatobiliary-specific contrast agents initially distribute in the extracellular fluid compartment, thus allowing for early dynamic pre-contrast and post-contrast images in the arterial, portal venous and equilibrium phase prior to the functional cholangiogram.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{aimed to explore}} the {{possibility}} of developing a immuno-imaging/therapeutic agent for hCG-expressing tumors by using antibodies raised against them. Three human cancer cell lines were selected: lung adenocarcinoma (A 549), glioblastoma (U 87 MG) and breast cancer (MCF 7). Anti-β-hCG monoclonal antibody, obtained from ascitic fluid, was purified by affinity chromatography followed by characterization and titration. Ectopic expression of hCG on these cell lines was tested by flow cy-tometry and in-vitro cytotoxicity with antibodies was tested by MTT assay on the cell line with the highest percentage binding. For positive and negative controls, immortalized trophoblast cells (SW 71) and peripheral blood monocytes were used. Antibody was then radiolabeled with lutetium- 177 (177 Lu) and in vivo biodistribution studies were conducted in murine tumor model. Antibodies could be puri-fied to homogeneity with a concentration 28 mg/mL. Percentage receptor expression on A 549, U 87 MG and MCF 7 cells was 95 %, 66 % and 55 % respectively. About 90 % of A 549 cells could be killed with anti-body at 72 h post-treatment. No cytotoxicity was observed on SW 71 despite a high binding percentage (96 %). Antibodies were radiolabeled with high efficiency (~ 98 %). In-vivo studies using radiolabeled antibodies showed <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>excretion</b> route and significant uptake in A 549 tumor. In conclusion, among the 3 cancer cell lines, lung adenocarcinoma significantly expresses β-hCG and shows dose de-pendent cytotoxicity with anti-β-hCG antibody. Radiolabeling of this antibody can aid in imaging and also {{has the potential of}} enhancing its therapeutic potential. This study provides a platform for further studies for targeted radio-immuno imaging and subsequent therapy of hCG-expressing cancers...|$|E
30|$|The liver {{blood vessel}} fenestrations and low {{blood flow rate}} [34] allowed blood {{carrying}} PPDCT NPs {{to interact with the}} hepatic cells. PPDCT NPs were recognized by hepatocytes as foreign materials and phagocytosed by scavenger receptors. Progressive NPs uptake in the liver was observed from 24  h post-injection (hpi). At 72 hpi, an absence in overlap of the EGFP and PPDCT NPs fluorescence indicated that almost all the NPs had extravasated. Progressive breakdown of internalized NPs followed from 96  h, which is suggested by the decrease in red fluorescence detected in CHT. A similar approach of tracking PPDCT NPs uptake was applied to the liver-tumor-bearing larvae (Fig.  3 c). Seven dpf larvae were injected with the fluorescent PPDCT NPs and tracked over 4  days. In the hyperplastic liver tumor, successful uptake of red fluorescent PPDCT NPs is indicated by its detection in EGFP-positive liver cancer cells. Hence, confocal imaging using two different emission detection channels for EGFP emission at 509  nm and PPDCT emission at 660  nm identified co-localization of NPs in liver cancer cells, an unbiased in vivo assessment of uptake efficiency. Successful NPs internalization by liver cancer cells results in visualization of yellow fluorescence in the overlay image (Fig.  3 d). The PPDCT red fluorescent intensity in the liver tumor was computed {{as a percentage of the}} EGFP intensity using ImageJ, to ascertain the concentration of the PPDCT NPs in the tumor tissue (Fig. S 2). At 24 hpi, since most NPs were in circulation, the red fluorescence as a percentage of EGFP fluorescence in the liver was low. It gradually increases as the liver filters out the PPDCT NPs with time. Since the liver was hyper-proliferative and responsible for <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>excretion</b> and degradation of the NPs, the uptake of PPDCT NPs from the single intravenous delivery would change significantly with time. At 96 hpi, the total concentration of PPDCT in continuously dividing liver cancer cells became suboptimal, such that there was less co-localization of red fluorescent PPDCT in EGFP-positive liver cancer cells (Fig. S 2). Therefore, 48 hpi or 2  days post-injection (dpi) was chosen as the earliest trigger time after analyzing the uptake profile (Fig.  3 d). We considered this period as the ideal time to conduct PDT testing in injected zebrafish to trigger an optimal therapeutic response because of the maximized cellular uptake of the PPDCT NPs.|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} {{the second and third}} most leading cancer in Europe and the US, respectively. One of the main risk factors of this {{malignancy}} of the large bowel has been associated to western-style diets rich in high saturated fat and meat and low in fiber. During the last years, {{it has been reported that}} a regular uptake of fruits and vegetables may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. One of the most consumed fruits in western diet patterns are apples. Several epidemiological and case-control studies have indicated that usual consumption of one or more apples a day may reduce the risk for colon cancer. But so far, the possible preventive effects of apple juice have not been completely investigated. Our previous examinations showed that polyphenolic extracts from apple juice are biologically active in terms of radical scavenging, influence on drug metabolism as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-hormonal potential in vitro. Moreover, we used the colorectal chemoprevention Apc Min/+ mouse model to study the chemopreventive effect of apple juices. This strain is highly susceptible to spontaneous intestinal adenoma formation. The results showed that cloudy apple juice and polyphenolic apple juice extract had a significant impact diminishing the tumor development in the small intestine of Apc Min/+ mice. However, the possible mechanism remained to be understood. In the present study, the possible molecular mechanism was investigated in a second animal experiment. Animals were treated with water (as a control), cloudy apple juice (CAJ), placebo juice (apple juice without polyphenols), 0. 2 % B-PAE (procyanidin-rich apple extract) and a combination between cloudy apple juice and 0. 2 % B-PAE. Both cloudy apple juice and B-PAE intervention significantly reduced adenoma development by 24 % and 34 %, respectively. These findings indicated polyphenols as the main chemopreventive compounds in this model. On the other hand, placebo juice and cloudy apple juice plus B-PAE treatments, inhibited intestinal adenomas in a nonsignificant manner by 7 % and 17 %, respectively. Moreover, placebo juice intervention enhanced small adenomas in the whole small intestine. In the liver, cloudy apple juice- and cloudy apple juice plus B-PAE-treated animals resulted in an induction of Phase II enzymes (GST, QR, and TrxR). Further investigations identified a high concentration of polyphenol metabolites in the urine of animals treated with cloudy apple juice and cloudy apple juice plus B-PAE. This indicated that polyphenol metabolites may reach the liver after intestinal absorption. However, due to an overnight fasting prior to dissection, the protein content of liver cells of mice in the water and B-PAE intervention groups was disminished. Several enzymatic activies such as CYP 1 A 1, QR and TrxR were decreased as a result of this fasting effect. In contrast, placebo juice, CAJ and CAJ + B-PAE maintained hepatic protein contents due to the carbohydrate uptake from these drinks. The possible mechanism of the development of adenomas was investigated using protein array technology. Proteomic analysis revealed that fasting effects increased phosphorylated ERK and the target iNOS in intestinal adenomas. Similarly, Cyclin D 1 was reduced but only in the middle parts of the small intestine. B-PAE treatments reduced fasting associated effects by decreasing p-ERK, iNOS, and Cyclin D 1. Since only very low concentrations of metabolites of polyphenols were found in urine and in analogy to other comparable compounds, a direct passage into the intestine or <b>hepato-biliary</b> <b>excretion</b> can be assumed. Therefore these results might be attributed to procyanidins acting locally. CAJ and B-PAE treatments did not affect inflammation markers such as nitric oxide content in urine or PGE 2 in serum. In vivo levels of apple polyphenols were not high enough to efficiently inhibit these inflammation markers. Cyclin D 1 was strongly reduced in the distal parts of the small intestine by CAJ and CAJ + B-PAE. As well as in a non-significant manner, beta-catenin was reduced in a similar way. Overall, apple polyphenols from CAJ and B-PAE reduced adenoma development in the Apc Min/+ mouse model. This chemopreventive potential was dependent on the intestinal bioavailability. Control animals (12 h fasted) resulted in an increase of Erk phosphorylation and of iNOS expression. B-PAE-treated animals suppressed these fasting-associated effects compared to water controls as well as in the groups that had access to high-calorie apple juice...|$|E
