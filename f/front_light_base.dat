40|$|This study {{discusses}} a semi-physical {{simulation platform}} for Adaptive <b>Front</b> <b>lighting</b> System (AFS) <b>based</b> on vehicle driving simulator. The research background, performance {{and development of}} AFS are introduced firstly. Then the architecture of AFS is proposed which includes three parts: vehicle sensors, control module and actuator unit. On the semi-physical simulation platform, the signals of gear, throttle pedal, clutch pedal, brake pedal and steering wheel are sampled by PC and with which the vehicle kinematics model is established. On the base of these, a genetic-based hybrid fuzzy-PID controller is proposed for coordinately controlling of AFS. This developed controller has capability to collect sensors data, send them into the algorithmic program and control <b>front</b> <b>light</b> up-down and left-right movement. The kinematics model and controller are tested on the semi-physical simulation platform and {{the results can be}} analyzed. This provides a convenient testing platform for control algorithm of AFS...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of adaptive <b>front</b> <b>lighting</b> systems for vehicles has increased road safety and drivers' comfort significantly {{within the last}} years. A next step in this development is the realization of higher resolution systems to further increase the functionality of vehicle headlamps toward fully adaptive <b>front</b> <b>lighting</b> systems. In this paper, we present a short overview on highly dynamic <b>front</b> <b>lighting</b> systems and the essential technologies for their realization. Different approaches are compared and evaluated regarding their applications for headlamp systems. As an example for on-road projection systems, a laser-based scanning unit is set up and evaluated. © 2016 THOSS Media & De Gruyte...|$|R

40|$|People spend a {{significant}} amount of time in their cars (US: 86 minutes/day, Europe: 43 minutes/day) while commuting, shopping, or traveling. Hence, the variety of entertainment in the car increases, and many vehicles are already equipped with displays, allowing for watching news, videos, accessing the Internet, or playing games. At the same time, the urbanization caused a massive increase of traffic volume, which led to people spending an ever-increasing amount of their time in front of red traffic lights. An observation of the prevailing forms of entertainment in the car reveals that content such as text, videos, or games are often a mere adaptation of content produced for television, public displays, PCs, or mobile phones and do not adapt to the situation in the car. In this paper we report on a web survey assessing which forms of entertainment and which types of content are considered to be useful for in-car entertainment by drivers. We then introduce an algorithm, which is capable of learning standing times in <b>front</b> of traffic <b>lights</b> <b>based</b> on GPS information only. This, on one hand, allows for providing content of appropriate length, on the other hand, for directing the attention of the driver back to-wards the street at the right time. Finally, we present a prototype implementation and a qualitative evaluation...|$|R
