50|$|Known for its milk, the Alpine goat {{is famous}} for its rich dairy production. Alpine goats are {{extremely}} popular in the dairy industry for their docile temperament, <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>milk</b> output and long lactation. Alpine milk has relatively low fat content, with an average fat percent of 3.4%. It is higher in sugars than cows' milk but balances itself in terms of the amount of protein. Alpine Goats' milk has 2.3g of protein per 250ml while Cow’s milk has 3.4. A higher protein count is not always good, since it packs more calories with an increased fat content. Compared to Saanen Goat Milk, it is higher in all nutritional aspects, except the fat content, making it a much healthier choice.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this studywas to evaluate a premium program for very <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>milk</b> in a US cooperative. Data were available {{on a monthly basis}} from a large USmilk cooperative fromApril 1998 throughDecember 2005. The data set consisted of 36, 930 observations rep-resenting producer-months. The actual amount of the low bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC) premium varied from $ 0. 15 per hundred pounds (cwt.) of milk to $ 1. 00 /cwt. with steps in between of $ 0. 50 and $ 0. 60 per cwt. of milk during the data collection period. Data analysis was done to evaluate the impact of the pre-mium program on average BTSCC and on the probabil-ity of a producer to ship milk with < 100, 000 cells/mL in a given month. The results showed a strong effect of the premium program on both the average BTSCC and the probability of producingmilk with very low BTSCC. On average, the BTSCC of all the milk in the coopera-tive was reduced by 22, 000 cells during the high pre-mium period. The probability of producing milk with BTSCC < 100, 000 doubled during some months of the high premium period from 4 to 8 %, and an associated 10 % increase in probability to produce milk below 200, 000 cells/mL was observed. The data clearly indi-cate that premium offerings for very <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>milk</b> affect the overall milk quality in the population affected by the premium. Producers responded to the high pre-miums and the overall impact on milk quality was sub-stantial. We argue that the combination of a penalty program for highBTSCCmilkwith a premiumprogram for very <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>milk</b> (low BTSCC) provides a strong incentive for improvement of milk quality.

40|$|This paper uses a Markov chain {{model to}} analyse the {{dynamics}} in farm size distribution among the Flemish dairy {{sector and the}} impact of quota policy regulation on such changes. The model predicts a decline in number of farms in 2014 compared with the current situation of 24 % with a more liberal exchange policy and a decline of 18 % with a restricted quota exchange policy. From these Markov chain model results, we analysed the impact of farm size distribution on 8 different <b>milk</b> <b>quality</b> parameters (total bacterial count, somatic cell count, coliform count, freezing point, urea-N, fat- and protein content and penalty-points). In general, larger farms produce <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>milk</b> than smaller farms, especially with respect to the microbiological parameters (total bacterial count, somatic cell count and coliform count). The change in farm size distribution from a liberal quota exchange policy would decrease the average total bacterial count by 18. 0 %, the somatic cell count by 2. 1 % and the coliform count by 11. 0 %.

40|$|In the European Union {{member states}} (EU), it is {{necessary}} to evaluate hygienic condition of milk in order to determine milk price. Similar requirement was set by the Republic of Croatia in 2000. The Rulebook defines minimal quality criteria that fresh raw milk must have in order to be purchased. Upon completion of analysis, milk is classified into quality classes, each having a defined price. Increased value of somatic cell count (SCC) (higher than 400. 000 /ml) and MO (higher than 100. 000 /ml) directly decreases the raw milk price, while higher content of fat and protein causes its increase. Since the system of market milk price formation was established, producers have been stimulated to produce milk of higher quality: in a total of milk being purchased, the <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> <b>milk</b> share increased from 23. 3 % to 34. 2 %.

Game model is established and the solution for the model is obtained. Based on analyzing the relationship of the interests between the dairy farmer and the company in ecological agriculture, two mixed strategies of Nash equilibrium are obtained. One is that when the probability is equal to, there are no differences between purchasing or not purchasing; if the probability of company purchase is equal to, there are no differences between producing high-quality milk and poor-quality milk. The other is that if the probability of dairy farmer under normal transaction is equal to, there are no differences for the company to select high-quality inspection or low-quality inspection; if the probability of high-quality inspection is equal to, passing off inferior milk as high-grade one has no differences with normal transaction. Therefore, moral risk of the dairy farmer should be prevented by probability and high-quality inspection. Finally, countermeasures are put forward, such as reducing the risk of transaction, ensuring the basic interest of the dairy farmer engaged in ecological production, intensifying the supervision, correctly preventing the moral risk of dairy farmer, improving the laws and regulations, and coordinating interests between dairy farmer and company in industrial chain.

40|$|This NebGuide {{outlines}} good milking {{procedures to}} follow to assure <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>milk</b> production while minimizing mastitis {{and other health}} problems. Milking, or harvesting the milk crop, is a critical step between planting crops, building facilities, and paying bills on a dairy farm. While highly productive cows and a properly functioning milking system are essential, how the cows are handled and the milking system is used are equally important. Proper milking procedures are necessary to assure a bountiful harvest of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>milk.</b> The nature of milk-secreting tissue and the anatomy of the udder make harvesting the milk crop impossible without the cow 2 ̆ 7 s cooperation. Stimulating the cow so she releases the 2 ̆ 2 let-down 2 ̆ 2 hormone oxytocin is critical. The effects of oxytocin last about 5 to 7 minutes. Milking should be done within this {{amount of time to}} be most effective. Remember [...] a milking system does not pull or squeeze milk out of the udder. Rather, it simply sets up the conditions (low pressure or vacuum) to allow a difference in pressure between the udder and milking system to force milk out through the teat orifice. In this respect, milking is much like letting air escape from a tire through the valve stem [...] if there is no difference in pressure between the inside and outside, there is no flow of air (or milk).

Design/methodology/approach – In total, eight hypotheses are tested using partial least square methods on survey results from 133 dairy producers in Malaysia.
