The gum Arabic in North Kordofan (the main producers) had been studies for the period 1960 - 2009. The statistical out put showed the real state in the Hashab gum market during 1970 s, 1980 s, 1990 s, 2000 s with remarkable declination during drought years. Scheduled field work with sampling surveys had been conducted in the Hashab gum produced areas in North Kordofan where (20) villages were selected for the research data. The results showed that there is clear declination in Hashab gum production attributed to the clearance of the vast areas covered by Hashab species and the ignorance of the forestry strategies towards Hashab plantations and weakness in Hashab nurseries main programs. Also the study depicted that there is decreasing in the number of the producers all over the study area, due to the weak return from <b>gum</b> <b>tapping</b> that doesn't balance the expenses of the activity processes...|$|E
40|$|In Sudan the gum belt {{extends from}} east to west between 10 ◦- 14 ◦ N. Until fairly recently, Kordofan has been more widely known for the {{production}} of gum arabic from the tree of A. senegal. The apparently well-balanced traditional system began to decline due to variety of factors, some projects exerted considerable efforts to rehabilitate the gumbelt in the state, but the price of gum arabic is declining compared with other cash crops that led farmers to ignore tapping their hashab trees, or cut them for charcoal. The broad objective of this research is to investigate the possibility of rehabilitating the gumbelt zone through the establishment of Gum Arabic Farmer’s Associations and guarantee raising of standard of living of the local communities. Two types of data were collected to provide the necessary information, namely; primary and secondary data. The primary data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations. The main findings of the research are; through the establishment of farmer’s associations, the project of rehabilitation of gumbelt was able to sustain the activity of gum belt. The associations act as a rural bank. Using the project’s revolving fund allocation as a grant, it was envisaged that the “Sanduk” will evolve as a permanent and sustainable credit institutions. After the establishment of the associations there is a tremendous increase of areas and stocking density of hashab trees. There are two types of markets of gum before the establishment of the associations namely; village markets and urban markets. After the establishment of the associations the village committee is the responsible body for marketing and facilitation of credits. The benefits of the associations as perceived by the farmers are; provision of credit accessibility, abolishment of the role of peddlers, brokers and the “sheil” system, and provision of extension services beside other benefits. The main conclusions of the research are: adoption of the farmer’s associations increased the stocking density of the hashab trees in the study area and controlled the market mechanisms of gum Arabic. The main recommendations of the research are; the importance of constructing special extension messages to recruit the youth in the field of <b>gum</b> <b>tapping</b> and picking. The FNC should find channels for financing the farmers through credit accessibilit...|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{prevailing}} stagnation of the colony's economy and society {{during most of}} the century prior to the 1930s, seeds of change were being sown. The mahogany trade remained depressed, and efforts to develop plantation agriculture in several crops, including sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas, and coconuts failed. A brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the United States. Exports of chicle, a gum taken from the sapodilla tree and used to make chewing gum, propped up the economy from the 1880s. Much of the <b>gum</b> was <b>tapped</b> in Mexican and Guatemalan forests by Mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in British Honduras. A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources. The introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s, but this development led again to only a temporary revival. At this time, mahogany, cedar, and chicle together accounted for 97 percent of forest production and 82 percent of the total value of exports. The economy, which was increasingly oriented toward trade with the United States, remained dependent and underdeveloped.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} between 2008 and 2010 to assess annual gum production potential per tree for different varieties of Acacia senegal (var. kerensis; var. senegal and var. leiorhachis) growing naturally in Kenyan drylands. Eight sample plots of 1. 0 hectare were established, one at each site. All trees in each sample plot were measured for basal diameter and classified into three diameter size classes (3. 0 - 6. 0 cm, 6. 1 - 9. 0 cm and > 9. 0 cm). Ten trees from each diameter class {{were selected for}} tapping while another ten trees left untapped as control. Results indicate that gum yield by different varieties of A. senegal varied with basal diameter (BD) size classes. A. senegal var. senegal yielded high quantities of gum {{compared to the other}} two varieties. Tapping increased yield by 47. 1 %, 91. 8 % and 85. 7 % for trees in diameter classes 3. 0 - 6. 0 cm, 6. 1 - 9. 0 cm and > 9. 0 cm respectively. On average, <b>tapping</b> increased <b>gum</b> production by 74. 9 %. These results can be used for estimating gum yield potential of naturally growing A. senegal in relation to the variety, tree size and site conditions. Besides, the upshot of these findings offers new management guidelines that can improve <b>gum</b> production through <b>tapping</b> for the economic, social and environmental benefits of local communities living in the drylands of Kenya...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in Umfakarin natural forest reserve, South Kordofan, Sudan. The main objective was to investigate the possibility of managing Acacia seyal Del. variety seyal for the production of gum talha. Three stand densities (strata), namely dense, medium, and slight, were distinguished {{based on the number of}} trees per hectare. During the sampling phase, the study adopted the method of identifying the competitors (neighboring trees) from the subject one (trees selected for gum production experiments). From the three stand densities, a total of 482 subject trees, covering variable diameter ranges (d= 9 - 11. 5, 13. 5 - 16, 18 - 20. 5 and above 21 cm) were selected, based on the diameter at 0. 25 m height (d 0. 25). In each stratum, competitor trees were identified within a radius equal to the height of subject tree multiplied by a factor (1. 25). The diameter at breast height, height to crown base, height, crown radii, and tree coordinates were measured for each of the subject trees and its competitors. Subject trees were exposed to tapping on first of October, the fifteenth of October, and the first of November, using local tools (Sonki and Makmak). Additionally, untapped trees were used as controlling-variables. The initial gum collection was completed fifteen days after the tapping, while the subsequent (7 - 9 pickings) were done at an interval of fifteen days. Six stand height functions were tested and the results illustrated that the Michailow stand height function was suitable for predicting the height of Acacia seyal in Umfakarin natural forest. The predictive ability of this height function ranged from 19. 3 % to 24 %. The volume function used in this study was able to predict the volume of standing trees with more than 92 percent accuracy. Competition among trees of Acacia seyal was assessed in terms of competition indices. Eight competition indices were quantified using the CroCom program. The relationship between these indices and tree dimensions (diameter at breast height, height and crown diameter) was tested using logarithmic models. Among these indices, the Hegyi_ 2 index is considered a suitable index to be applied for estimating the degree of competition in natural stands of A. seyal of dense stratum when using diameter at breast height as a predictor. About 70 % of the total variability is explained by this logarithmic model. Gum yielded by each subject tree per season was obtained by summing up the gum samples collected from all pickings. Gum production per unit area was also determined. Regression tree, general linear model (GLM) and logistic regression techniques were used for analyzing the obtained data. The results of the study indicated that the gum yield is independent of stand density. Tapping has influence on <b>gum</b> yield. Trees <b>tapped</b> by sonki on the first of October at medium stand density have the highest gum with an average value of about 56 g/tree/season. Significant difference (p = 0. 021) was detected between two groups of dates; the first of October and first of November in medium stand density. The results also revealed that the most important variable influencing gum production was found to be diameter at breast height with 23. 95 cm threshold. Between 41 - 53 percent of subject trees produce gum less than 50 g/season. The results indicated that A. seyal species produces a very low quantity of gum talha (3. 6 - 4. 8 kg/ha) and for economic reasons, its tapping is not recommended. The findings of the regression analysis revealed to a model which could be used to estimate the yield of gum talha from A. seyal natural stands in the Umfakarin forest, South Kordofan, Sudan. Conducting experiments on the production of gum talha in permanent plot trials in different climatic regions of the Sudan is highly recommended...|$|R
40|$|Acacia senegal, which {{produces}} gum arabic, has suffered greatly {{from the effects}} of the drought. This tree with the golden sap (gum arabic) does not thrive in plantations, so the only viable method of restoring it to previous numbers is to protect its natural environment. Trees in the Sahel have a variety of ways of resisting the vagaries of the climate. Acacia tortilis delays blooming until the last rains because the onset of the cool season fluctuates so much. The baobab keeps its reserves of water inside its trunk. Most species have developed huge root systems which can seek water as far away as possible. But the Acacia senegal, has perhaps the most interesting drought defence system of all: to avoid dehydration when the wind, animals or insects damage its trunk, it secretes a viscous liquid known as gum arable. Gum arabic- a rare and precious commodity Man has long harvested gum arabic as something rare and precious. In ancient fumes it had considerable commercial value and this has not diminished. Its rarity {{comes from the fact that}} only the gum tree produces it, and a satisfactory substitute has never been found. It is used for glue, sweets, pills and lozenges; it stabilizes wine and fizzy drinks; it is a fixative for paintings and ceramics; and local people use it for starching their traditional costumes, for cooking, and for medicine. Over the years, the tapping of the trees for gum has developed into a skilled operational In Mauritania, northern Senegal, Niger and Mali all the stockmen, from the Moors to the Peulhs, shepherds and nomads, collect the gum when they go in search of new pastures for their flocks and herds. Some even take their cattle to those areas where there are <b>gum</b> trees to <b>tap</b> because they know they can sell what they get as additional income. A small tree well adapted During the drought years of the Seventies, the Sahelian landscape lost many gum trees, despite the fact that this five-six metre tree with its low thorny bushy branches is well suited to the Sahelian climatic conditions. It needs only about 250 - 270 mm rainfall, and can withstand nine to eleven months of drought and temperatures of 45 C. Its rough thick bark protects it from this heat. Its main roots can descend one metre, and its secondaries are long and supple and can spread out through the sand so the strong Harmattan winds cannot uproot the tree. However, the disappearance of the gum tree is more the result of disarry in herd movements than of the drought. Herdsmen lead their stock into the least arid areas, but that is precisely where the gum tree is most likely to flourish again and young shoots get eaten and the trees destroyed. Nomads have not yet gone back to their old routes and they need to graze their herds and flocks where they are at present but the gum tree is specially enjoyed by goats, cattle, and - above all - camels. As a result the production of gum declined sharply, from 60, 000 tonnes in 1970 to 20, 000 tonnes in 1980, and has now stabilized around 45, 000 tonnes Large-scale plantations There have been various attempts to domesticate this tree, but large plantations have not been successful Acacia senegal plantation, principally in Mali have had variable results: some trees produce gum well (between five and ten kilo per annum) but others produce only one kilo. Scientists have not yet managed to isolate, and then reproduce, the most productive strains. Research programmes are in train but no results will be published for some years. Meanwhile the best means of preserving this useful tree is still to protect it from the ravages of man, beast and fire where it occurs naturally.
