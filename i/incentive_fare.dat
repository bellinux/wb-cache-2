50|$|By 1840 {{the company}} had {{introduced}} <b>incentive</b> <b>fares</b> for visitors to the Hull market, allowing the purchasers of specific single tickets to return free of charge by a later train; {{the success of this}} scheme led to the return train being occupied by around 400 persons. The company began issuing cardboard tickets to simplify bookings in 1841.|$|R
50|$|Belgium {{operates}} {{a policy of}} cheap rail travel. Citizens in Belgium, especially students and older citizens, are offered <b>incentives</b> and cheaper <b>fares</b> in order to alleviate congestion on the nation's roads. Public sector employees {{are entitled to a}} free or heavily subsidised season ticket for commuting by rail. Many private sector employers will make a contribution to the cost of a season ticket. Smoking is prohibited in all railway stations (since it is an enclosed public place) and passenger cars.|$|R
40|$|Increases in {{ridership}} are outpacing capacity expansions in {{a number}} of transit systems. By shifting their focus to demand management, agencies can instead influence how customers use the system, getting more out of the capacity they already have. However, while demand management is well researched for personal vehicle use, its applications for public transportation are still emerging. This thesis explores the strategies transit agencies can use to reduce overcrowding, with a particular focus of how automatically collected fare data can support the design and evaluation of these measures. A framework for developing demand management policies is introduced to help guide agencies through this process. It includes establishing motivations for the program, aspects to consider in its design, as well as dimensions and metrics to evaluate its impacts. Additional considerations for updating a policy are also discussed, as are the possible data sources and methods for supporting analysis. This framework was applied to a <b>fare</b> <b>incentive</b> strategy implemented at Hong Kong's MTR system. In addition to establishing existing congestion patterns, a customer classification analysis was performed to understand the typical travel patterns among MTR users. These results were used to evaluate the promotion at three levels of customer aggregation: all users, user groups, and a panel of high frequency travelers. The incentive was found to have small but non-negligible impacts on morning travel, particularly {{at the beginning of the}} peak hour and among users with commuter-like behavior. Through a change point analysis, it was possible to identify the panel members that responded to the promotion and quantify factors that influenced their decision using a discrete choice model. The findings of these analyses are used to recommend potential improvements to MTR's current scheme. by Anne Halvorsen. Thesis: S.
