We first show that goods traded formally and informally are very different and that the overlap between {{the two types of}} trade is very thin, suggesting the existence of two separate channels of trade. For example, agricultural products are mainly traded informally. Second, we illustrate how including informal cross-border trade gives to regional trade a higher role compared to that measured using formal trade only, which is particularly low by global standards. Finally, we study trade policy variables, and the time sensitiveness of products, as potential determinants of informality. We find that trade policy variables (tariffs and import bans) significantly explain informality of trade. We also find that, for re-exports, time sensitive products {{are more likely to be}} traded through the informal channel. This suggests a potential role for trade facilitation measures in reducing informality. Working paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; AGRODEPMTI...|$|R

The heavy industry collapsed {{during the first half}} of 1990 s in most former socialist countries. However, since the second half of 1990 s the industrial output, export, productivity and even employment (in some branches) has been increased remarkably. And instead of a de-industrialisation, which has been general trend in Western Europe since 1970 s, we may speak about a re-industrialisation. Foreign investors have played major role in the restructuring and efficiency growth of manufacturing in transitional economies. The rising importance of foreign investors and the growing <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-export</b> to other BSR countries are showing, that the industries in transitional countries are becoming more and more integrated to developed BSR countries. Still, especially textiles and electronics that are concentrated on relatively low-skilled subcontracting are characterised by a sharp rise in re-exports. Hypothetically, when considering the price convergence in the case BSR transition countries joining the European Union, those low value added booming industries can run into crisis soon and relocate the production to further cheaper regions in Russia or South-East Asia. The empirical part analyses recent industrial development trends (employment structure, exports, investments) in three Baltic countries and Kaliningrad oblast.

40|$|AbstractThe UAE {{per capita}} energy {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the highest in the world. Since the energy sector is the center of most ecological problems facing the world today, eco-efficiency and eco-innovations are {{at the top of the}} sustainability agenda in most countries. The UAE “Green Economy for Sustainable Development” (2012 – 2021) aims to position the country as a center for the <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-export</b> of green products and technologies. In light of the above, the focus of this paper is to present a smart plug system for monitoring and controlling household energy consumption using a mobile application. The smart plug system is an essential component in smart grids as it provides real-time high-resolution information for distribution companies to aid them in decision-making. In addition, the study measures the perceived usefulness and satisfaction of the smart plug system and its mobile application in the UAE. The paper makes an important theoretical contribution by including environmental concern as an additional variable to a well-established information systems success model. Our findings suggest that the smart plug system provides users with convenient access to information regarding their personal energy consumption and allows them to control their per capital energy consumptions via the mobile application at very low costs. Further, we validated our theoretical model using structural equation modeling and conclude that environmental concern has an indirect impact on the perceived satisfaction and both an indirect and a direct impact on the perceived usefulness of the smart plug system. The practical implications of our study suggest that per capita energy consumption is likely to significantly decrease with wide adoption of the smart plug system in the UAE...|$|E
40|$|A {{market survey}} and review of {{government}} statistics {{were carried out}} to establish imports and exports of marine ornamental fishes {{into and out of}} Hong Kong, and to examine the local trade in terms of volume, value and species composition. Official government import figures for marine aquarium fishes were available from 1984 to 1991 and from 1997 and 1998. When compared with net imports, <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-export</b> volumes over the 15 -year period were small, indicating that most imports entered the local market, or were exported unrecorded. The market survey of marine aquarium shops in Hong Kong was carried out between August 1996 and January 1997. From this survey, an annual estimate of 957, 563 coral reef fish was calculated for the local trade, valued at HK$ 57, 453, 780, with a mean retail price of HK$ 60 per fish. These figures account for an estimated 2 - 3 % of the global value and volume of marine aquarium fish trade, according to 1992 figures and, compared with government figures, indicate that official declarations of imports are underreported by at least 2 - 3 fold. A total of 342 marine aquarium fish species, from 49 families, were recorded with about 60 % belonging to the families Labridae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae and Pomacentridae. It was estimated that {{a large proportion of the}} trade was in juvenile fishes and almost all fish were less than 10 cm in standard length. It was common to see fishes in poor condition, species hard to maintain in captivity, or those listed for conservation concern, on sale. There are no regulations for local traders of live marine fishes other than those relating to either protected species or animal welfare. Licensing of traders in marine fishes could be introduced under existing Hong Kong legislation if fishes were to be re-classified as animals. This is strongly recommended as a step towards regulating and managing the trade in Hong Kong. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The United Arab Emirates {{with its}} coastal {{land from the}} western borders {{with the state of}} Qatar and the Saudi Arabia to the Omani borders in the east has many {{economic}} activities which the recent studies have not covered. The UAE has two coasts the western and the eastern. The coastal area of the western coast has rich oil deposits, whilst the area on the eastern coast has no oil deposits. This has led the inhabitants at the eastern coast to develop other alternatives. Fishing and farming became the main economic activities for the inhabitants of this coast, especially during the pre-oil period. Also, since the East Coast does not have the oil deposits, some {{of the people of the}} East Coast prefer to work in other oil rich Emirates, especially Abu Dhabi and Dubai. At the same time the oil wealth from the other Emirates has played major role in developing the East Coast in terms of financing the construction of the new facilities, seaports, airport and the other facilities. As a result of the latest government attention paid to the East Coast in terms of building new facilities as well as exploiting natural resources derived from the Hajar mountains, a lot of new manufacturing, eg rockwool, has come to play a major role in the area. The government of the area is in the process of exploring the geostrategic location of the East Coast with a view to it playing an important role in the future shipping industry in the area. The study evaluates the economic activities during the pre- and post-oil eras and gives a comparison between the two periods as well as exploring future prospects to develop these activities. It examined some of the area's problems as a result of the new development and future alternatives to be developed. It also evaluates and explores the importance of the area's geostrategic location in terms of future industry, e. g. <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-export</b> industry...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{establish}} the development of foreign trade in the Muscovite lands, the Baltic provinces and in the areas which were newly settled in the mid eighteenth century with particular reference {{to the role of}} British merchants in these changes. This has required an analysis of the structure of trade through the 'Russian' Baltic and White Sea ports and an investigation of the changing patterns of commercial acitivity caused by fluctuations in the boundaries of their supply areas and of internal and external markets for the goods they handled. Detailed consideration has been given to the commodities handled in the import, <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-export</b> trades utilising data from the Sound Toll accounts together with British and Russian customs statistics. Having established a wide framework for the investigation of Russian foreign trade, detailed consideration has been given {{to the role of the}} British commercial community. In order to do so it has been necessary to reconstruct the methods used by British merchants in Russia in organising their commercial activities: this includes examining the structure of the British mercantile 'houses' in all the Russian ports, but especially in St. Petersburg; the patterns of recruitment of young men into the trade and their style of life in Russia; the network of contacts which they established among their compatriots, whether involved in commerce or other professions, with other foreign merchants and also with their aristocratic clients and their Russian counterparts involved in internal trade. Merchants in the Russia trade faced changing costs to their business for freight, insurance and customs duties and the fluctuations in these charges and their responses to them have been assessed. One of the most important aspects of their activities was the way in which they financed their trade. Decision-making in this matter was influenced by events throughout Europe as well as in Russia, for account had to be taken of the relative value in silver of the commodities which the Russia merchant handled in that country and elsewhere. Thus, during the late seventeenth century, they paid for Russian goods in specie whilst increasingly in the eighteenth century it made better economic sense to deal in imported commodities as far as the market allowed and finance the balance with trade surpluses accumulated elsewhere, thereby causing the emergence of a close co-operation between the British and Dutch communities in Russia in financing their trade, with the Dutch lending the proceeds of their import surplus to the British in return for bills of exchange on Amsterdam. The costs arising from the movement of the rate of exchange and interest rates within the financial network so formed, have been fully inves¬ tigated and their effect on the trade explored. The effects of these changes on Russia's overseas trade and the internal impact of the development of this external commercial sector to the Russian economy receives especial consideration with particular emphasis being placed on the response of the aristocracy in both their changing patterns of consumption of imported goods and in the development of their estates to provide raw materials for export or supplying Russian merchant and serf manufacturers who were at this time responding to growing overseas markets for their products...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Data {{representing}} transshipment or re-exports {{are almost}} always excluded from analytical portrayals of international trade, yet transshipment is potentially an important phenomenon in understanding a number of economic questions, and is increasing in importance. Rapid technological change {{in areas such as}} containerization and hub-and-spoke routing has promoted the practice of transshipment. While there are significant gaps in the data, the share of re-exports in global exports has undoubtedly increased rapidly, from perhaps 1 in 20 in the mid- 1980 s to perhaps 1 in 6 today. Econometric analysis of U. S. domestic <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>exports</b> (<b>re-exports)</b> over pairs of U. S. ports and destinations suggests that re-exports are significantly more sensitive than domestic exports to factors influencing transaction costs, including distance, containerization, price-fixing liner agreements, and port efficiency and restrictive port policies in the importing country...|$|R

This barrier against proliferation is also at the heart of UNSCR- 1540 of 2004, calling States to establish effective national systems to control <b>export,</b> transit, trans-shipment <b>and</b> <b>re-export</b> of items related to chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. In response to that, the Regulation setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology in the EU was thoroughly revised in 2009 to address the broader scope of “exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items” (Council Regulation 428 / 2009). The implementation of this legislation is a national competence and duty, supported by the European Unions through a variety of instruments and initiatives, {{both inside and outside the}} EU. A key issue is the technical competence required in all phases of the strategic trade control (industry compliance, licensing and enforcement, prosecution). Including the analysis of global trade-related data. This paper will describe how the JRC contributes to this relatively new field with strongly growing importance, complementing its nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation activities,JRC.

25|$|Re Fong Thin Choo (1991), {{involved}} regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, which {{stated that}} the owner of goods or his agent could be required by a customs officer to produce evidence that the goods had been <b>exported</b> or <b>re-exported,</b> <b>and</b> if the goods were not accounted for to the customs officer's satisfaction or {{were found to have}} been illegally re-landed in Singapore, the owner was liable to pay customs duty on them. The High Court held that the goods not having been exported was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require the owner to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the impact of {{manufacturing}} internationalisation, in the forms of international trade, cooperation agreements – measured by inward and outward processing trade (IPT and OPT, respectively) - and FDI, on the transport industry employment. Descriptive statistics and econometric analysis are carried out at the “regional-industry” level (20 NUTS 2 regions and 8 transport sub-industries) with reference to Italy in the period 1996 - 2001. Results show that <b>export,</b> FDI <b>and</b> the components of IPT (temporary import <b>and</b> <b>re-export)</b> positively affect the transport employment variation in 1996 - 2001, while import and the components of OPT (temporary <b>export</b> <b>and</b> re-import) display a negative impact...|$|R
