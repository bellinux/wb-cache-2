50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and circular combing. The Noble comb {{is an example of}} circular <b>combing.</b> The <b>French</b> <b>comb</b> is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When <b>combing</b> <b>wool,</b> the discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|R

50|$|The Noble comb is {{no longer}} used in worsted system as {{technology}} is inefficient. Noble combing may have uses for woollen system, or long fibers 250 mm+. The predominant technology for all fibers is the <b>French</b> <b>comb</b> system. A cotton comber is scaled and simplified mechanically version of a rectilinear comb relative to a mean fiber length (similar to Naismith comber). This scaled version of <b>wool</b> <b>comb</b> {{can be seen in}} stroke of the components used in a cotton comber.

50|$|In England in the 18th and 19th centuries Blaise {{was adopted}} as mascot of woolworkers' pageants, {{particularly}} in Essex, Yorkshire, Wiltshire and Norwich.

Jersey was certainly a centre of export of woollen goods (as witnessed by the name jersey for the woollen textile).

5000|$|To {{measure the}} {{fineness}} of sheep wool fiber before microscopes and lasers were so used, English wool handlers {{in the city}} of Bradford described wool by estimating (with experienced eyes) how many 560-yard hanks of single strand yarn could be made by a good spinner from a pound of [...] "top." [...] (Top is cleaned <b>combed</b> <b>wool</b> with the fibers all parallel) The finer the average diameter of a single wool fiber, the more hanks could be spun.

50|$|There are two {{competing}} combing technologies: the Noble (1853) comb (variants Lister, Heilman (1846) and Holden) and the <b>French</b> <b>comb.</b> The Noble comb technology is inefficient, hence most combing {{in the world}} is carried out on the French system. The French system is superior as it combs the entire length of a fiber. Noble combs suffer from the problem that they will not comb 2 mm of a fiber's length. The 2 mm is the distance between counter-rotating pins. The French system is a rectilinear combing system as opposed to earlier woollen systems developed in England. Although the Heilman and Noble comb was an original circular design (also developed in min and 18-19th-century England) as it happens in modern history, English mills didn't share technology - resulting in development of superior technology on continental Europe in the mid-19th century, as in France.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper was}} pursued to {{prioritize}} the worsted fabrics type, for {{the manufacture of}} outerwear products by characterization indeces of fabrics, using the mathematical model of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). There {{are a number of}} variables with a certain influence on the quality of fabrics, but some of these variables are more important than others, so it is useful to identify those variables to a better understanding the factors which can lead the improving of the fabrics quality. A solution to this problem can be the application of a method of factorial analysis, the so-called Principal Component Analysis, with the final goal of establishing and analyzing those variables which influence in a significant manner the internal structure of <b>combed</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics according to armire type. By applying PCA it is obtained a small number of the linear combinations (principal components) from a set of variables, describing the internal structure of the fabrics, which can hold as much information as possible from the original variables. Data analysis is an important initial step in decision making, allowing identification of the causes that lead to a decision- making situations. Thus it is the action of transforming the initial data in order to extract useful information and to facilitate reaching the conclusions. The process of data analysis can be defined as a sequence of steps aimed at formulating hypotheses, collecting primary information and validation, the construction of the mathematical model describing this phenomenon and reaching these conclusions about the behavior of this model...|$|R

The purpose of this research is to investigate whether the radix of Dipsacus spp (commonly known as Teasel root) has beneficial medicinal properties, and to identify what properties have been studied and what have not. As many valuable botanicals have been known to be very effective clinically, but also been lacking in actual scientific studies to prove the efficacy, the clarification in the current status of the studies may be helpful in implementing the treatment protocols with more controlled approaches. Knowing what is anecdotal, clinically proven or scientifically proven, may always be a important step for any practitioners.

40|$|Yarn {{diameter}} is {{an important}} property which affects the physical properties of the end products. Variations in yarn diameter cause undesirable effects such as imperfections in the knitted or woven fabric and difficulties in weaving prep-aration stages. Thin places in the yarn cause low breaking strength creating difficulties in the downstream processes such as warping, sizing and weaving. Thick places and neps cause appearance imperfections in the fabric. As is known in winding, yarns on spinning bobbins are assembled into larger yarn packages with different tech-niques of splicing. In splicing, {{it is very important}} to obtain a splice with a diameter that is close to the diameter of the parent yarn for the reasons mentioned above. Many studies have been carried out in order to investigate the effects of splicing parameters on the diameter of the splices in yarns. Cheng and Lam investigated different properties of spliced ring spun yarns such as abrasion, bending rigidity and appearance [1, 2]. 1 They used an overall score to evaluate the data obtained from experiments and found that yarn linear density and the degree of overlapping of yarn ends mostly affect the overall spliced yarn properties [1, 2]. Das et al. studied the parameters of fiber friction, yarn twist and splicing air pressure. They observed that the diameter of the splices in yarn is influenced by yarn twist and splicing air pressure [3]. Drobina and Machnio applied image analysis for the identification of the geometric sizes of spliced zones [4]. Hassen et al. found that increasing the time of water injection and yarn overlapping length improved the appear-ance of splices in yarns in water injection splicing [5].

25|$|In the <b>French</b> <b>comb</b> the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|R
