500|$|There are {{different}} ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast furnace. Some blast furnaces use a [...] "double bell" [...] system where two [...] "bells" [...] are used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace. First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then opens to empty the charge into the large bell. The small bell then closes, to seal the blast furnace, while the large bell rotates to provide specific <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> before dispensing the charge into the blast furnace. A more recent design is to use a [...] "bell-less" [...] system. These systems use multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into the blast furnace through valves. These valves are more accurate at controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or conveyor system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of these bell-less systems also implement a discharge chute in the throat of the furnace (as with the Paul Wurth top) in order to precisely control where the charge is placed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe effect <b>of</b> <b>material</b> {{composition}} <b>distribution</b> on the electro-thermal {{response of}} a thin, non-uniform functionally graded metal (FGM) line is investigated under a direct current field. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> composition along the FGM line {{is expressed in}} terms of a general power-law function of space variable, which, in turn, suggests the corresponding <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> properties involved. The governing differential equations associated with the electro-thermal problem are derived in terms of variable electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity <b>of</b> the <b>material.</b> The solution <b>of</b> the coupled boundary-value problem is then obtained numerically using finite-difference technique. The electro-thermal response of the FGM line is obtained for different composition profiles and environmental conditions, which are discussed in light of comparison with those of individual constituent metal lines...|$|R
