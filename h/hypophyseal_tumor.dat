40|$|A 68 -year-old female {{patient with}} {{previous}} history of transsphenoidal hypophysectomy operation underwent three-vessel {{coronary artery bypass}} graft (CABG) surgery for extensive coronary artery disease. Preoperative neurological examination revealed sequelae visual loss at right temporal visual field. Follow-up Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies showed a residual <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>tumor</b> tissue extending to suprasellar area. No additional pathology was detected in the early postoperative cranial control CT, but aggravation of visual field defect was determined. Coincidently, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hemorrhage into the tumor tissue. We decided to follow-up the patient who exhibited no additional symptoms and was discharged well on the fifth day due to the signs of resolution of hemorrhage. Follow-up controls of the patient at sixth and twelfth months demonstrated normal hormone levels without any additional clinical complaints. We present preoperative assessment, perioperative anesthesia management, and postoperative clinical follow-up of a patient with a residual <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>tumor...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>tumor</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} of tumors which arise in the brain, and in general, about 10 % of intracranial tumors are of this type. Such a tumor shows miscellaneous clinical manifestations. Among these are remarkable hormonal symptoms and optic chiasmal syndromes which physicians, ophthalmologists and surgeons (especially neurosurgeons) have been very much interested in. It is rare to encounter a <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>tumor</b> in a forensic autopsy. Even if found, the ophalmological symptoms which enable one to ascribe the direction of tumor extention and the syndromes suspected to be derived from a hormonal imbalance due to the abnormal growth of tumor cells can hardly be investigated. But it is only occasionally that we cannot adequately pursue a past history which is interesting for examining the symptoms which existed. The present paper reports a man who died after a quarrel and in whom subdural hemorrhages were found by forensic autopsy, and by which a tumor in the sella turcica was thereby revealed after removal of the brain. The tumor was diagnosed as a pituitary adenoma, and as of the chromophobe type histologically...|$|E
40|$|Hypophyseal tumors occur {{rarely in}} mice. Only one mouse among 11, 000 autopsied in Dr. Slye's {{laboratory}} showed a <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>tumor.</b> 11 A chromophobe-cell adenoma of the pituitary gland {{was reported in}} a mouse which had bilateral granulosa-cell tumors of the ovaries. 6 This animal also showed evidence of hyperestrogenic stimulation, as indicated by multiple mammary tumors and uterine glandular cystic hyperplasia. Generalized hypertrophy of the pituitary gland occurs frequently in rats and mice receiving estrogens. 9 Almost simultaneously three groups of investigators reported hypophyseal adenomatous hypertrophy or adenomas in rats or mice receiving estrogens in large amounts over long periods. ' 2 On the other hand, such tumors were not observed among 11 1 mice of 3 different strains (A, CBA, and C 3 H) given estrogens, 4 while, in another laboratory,l one tumor was found among 679 mice. Lacassagne' 0 ascribed an initial failure to observe hypophyseal lesions to a contamination of the "folliculin" benzoate he used with equilin or equilenin. Recently, Zondek' 4 described large tumors of the pituitary gland in rats given large amounts of estrogens {{over a period of}} from 7 to 9 months. Some of these tumors weighed more than 300 mg...|$|E

40|$|Only a few {{references}} {{have been}} made in the literature concerning <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>tumors</b> in domesticated animals. Nieberle states that tumors of the hypophysis may occur in domesticated animals, and that adenomas are the predominating type. He does not give any indication, however, where these tumors are more fully described, nor in what species they occur. It is because of this situation that the authors feel a description of a fibroma involving the pituitary of a fifteen year old Boston Terrier would be highly beneficial to report...|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{cases of}} brain tumors, {{encephalomalacia}} and brain contusion were investigated by Aird's method. (1) The {{fact that the}} result of diagnosis localizing the lesion by this method was correct at 100 % of all cases except the midline <b>tumors</b> such as <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>tumors,</b> was ascertained by operation. (2) After the operation, the cases, in which the-tumor was completely excised and clinical symptoms recovered, presented normal encephalogram. Therefore we have known, that it excellent value for judgement {{of the effect of}} therapy. (3) It is clarified experimentally, that the basic abnormat waves in brain tumors consist slow waves with 3 - 4 - 5 cycles, and the slow waves with 6 - 7 cycles are caused by brain swelling.

40|$|Lymphocytic or granulomatous {{hypophysitis}} {{is a rare}} entity with {{a difficult}} diagnosis. Our objective was to report a patient with nontuberculous granulomatous hypophysitis. An HIV-negative 45 -year old man with confusional state, subacute ophthalmoplegia, and clinical and laboratory findings of panhypopituitarism {{was seen in the}} emergency unit. A cranial MRI showed a sellar mass suggestive of hypophysitis. After an unsuccessful attempt with steroids and antituberculous drugs the patient died. Post-mortem histopathology revealed granulomatous lesions and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium gordonaeâ€™s DNA. In conclusion, we should consider granulomatous hypophysitis in the differential diagnosis of non-secreting <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>tumors.</b> The etiology of a pituitary granuloma by a non-tuberculous mycobacteria is best reached by histopathological techniques and molecular assays. The optimal therapy is yet to be established. and inflammatory processes. 1 Granulomatous hypophysitis (GH) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by the formation of granulomas frequently associated with tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, syphilis, and lymphocytic adenohypophysitis. This entity usually presents with systemic symptoms such as high fever and hormonal disturbances. 2 We describe a post-mortem case of granulomatous hypophysitis secondary to infection caused by Mycobacterium gordonae. To our knowledge, only two other cases of GH caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection (Mycobacterium malmoense and Mycobacterium tokaiense) in non-compromised hosts have been reported to date. 3,...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{analyzed}} {{the expression of}} the intracellular marker protein neuron specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin (SYN) and of the cell surface marker NCAM (neural cell adhesion molecule) in both normal human hypophysis and in pituitary adenomas in order to explore their potential use as diagnostic tools. All adenomas (4 prolactinomas, 3 growth hormone (GH) producing adenomas and 4 inactive adenomas) showed SYN and NSE immunoreactivity on tissue sections and this was confirmed by immunoblots. NCAM 140 (an isoform of NCAM with molecular mass 140 kDa) was detected by immunoblotting in normal human adenohypophysis, in all GH adenomas, and in three out of four inactive adenomas, but not in prolactinomas. Using highly sensitive techniques, NCAM immunoreactivity was observed by electron microscopy in all adenomas. These data indicate that NCAM 140 is a constituent of the cell surface of endocrine cells in both normal human adenohypophysis and its tumors. Since prolactinomas express very low levels of NCAM 140 compared to other <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>tumors</b> its virtual absence could be used for differential diagnosis. A combined analysis of NCAM, SYN and NSE could be useful to characterize inactive adenomas which are not immunoreactive for pituitary hormones and which may contain no or only low levels of the alpha chain of the glycoprotein hormones...|$|R
