In many practical cases certain margins of this table are readily available in constant prices, whereas the entire table is not. This reduces the problem to estimating the matrix of sectoral intermediate deliveries in constant prices. The traditional approach for this purpose is based on the <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> method. Since <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> is sensitive to aggregation, however, it typically does not provide correct answers. Therefore, a heuristic approach is proposed as an alternative. It is based on the biproportional projection method. An empirical evaluation indicates that the heuristic approach clearly performs better...|$|E
40|$|Published input - output {{tables in}} {{constant}} prices are relatively scarce. Therefore, input - output tables often have to be deflated by the practitioners themselves. The method of <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> is used predominantly for this purpose. The present paper shows that the double-deflation method is subject to aggregation problems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the double-deflation method to provide the correct answers are derived. The conditions {{are found to be}} stringent and unlikely to be met in empirical cases. The results for aggregation in the case of <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> are shown to be dual to the traditional results for aggregation {{in the case of a}} quantity model, which have been extensively discussed in the literature. ...|$|E

The key problem is that changes in prices of goods purchased for resale are not accounted for. We outline a consistent accounting framework for measuring trade productivity and provide new estimates, taking into account purchase prices of goods sold in a <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> procedure. We find strong productivity improvements in the UK and US compared to France, Germany and The Netherlands since the mid- 1990 s. This finding is robust for various productivity measurement models...|$|E

For this study, the nominal World Input–Output Tables for 1995 – 2009 were converted into deflated World Input–Output Tables based on 2009 prices using the <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> method (United Nations 1999). The deflators were obtained from the output prices of the nominal World Input–Output Tables and of the real World Input–Output Tables in previous year’s prices.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{estimate}} of Anglo-German manufacturing {{output and productivity}} levels by industry for 1935 / 36. It is based on newly explored archival data on German manufacturing together with published British census data. We calculate comparative levels of value added, correcting for differences in prices for outputs and inputs. This so-called <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> procedure provides new insights into productivity comparisons because output- and input price structures differed greatly between the two countries. Although the new calculations confirm existing results at an aggregate level, they reveal important differences at the industry level and show how Germany was striving for autarky as it prepared its economy for war. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper revises Swiss GDP {{emphasizing}} {{the difference between}} single and <b>double</b> <b>deflation,</b> which depends on trading gains: i. e. gains from terms of trade and from the real exchange rate. These gains contributed significantly to Swiss economic growth between 1930 and 1990. Earlier series of Swiss GDP have neglected trading gains. In backward projections, this leads to overestimation of GDP (per capita) levels. The Maddison database (Bolt & Zanden 2014), for example, suggests that Swiss GDP per capita was 38 percent above that of the USA in 1875.

40|$|Input-output tables {{deflated}} by chained prices {{indices are}} not additive over product rows. This paper discusses the reasons and suggests a remedy. The new method proposed {{is based on}} a distinction, in concept, between 'real value', on the one hand, and variation in 'volume', on the other. The first corrects for the monetary variation of the unit of account resulting from inflation, while the latter isolates the variation of one product price relative to the other products, caused by the forces of supply and demand on each individual commodity market. An example of the resulting growth analysis is compiled for the Dutch economy between years 1990 and 2000. Index numbers, <b>double</b> <b>deflation,</b> additivity, value added,...|$|E
40|$|Literary {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} the majority of researchers are using classical efficiency criteria for construction of an optimization model for production process: profit maximization; cost minimization; maximization of commercial product output; minimization of back-log for product demand; minimization of total time consumption due to production change. The paper proposes to use an index of added value as an efficiency criterion because it combines economic and social interests of all main interested subjects of the business activity: national government, property owners, employees, investors. The following types of added value have been considered in the paper: joint-stock, market, monetary, economic, notional (gross), net, real. The paper makes suggestion to use an index of real value added as an efficiency criterion. Such approach permits to bring notional added value in comparable variant because added value can be increased not only due to efficiency improvement of enterprise activity but also due to environmental factors – excess in rate of export price increases over rate of import growth. An analysis of methods for calculation of real value added has been made on a country-by-country basis (extrapolation, simple and <b>double</b> <b>deflation).</b> A method of <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> has been {{selected on the basis of}} the executed analysis and it is counted according to the Laspeyires, Paasche, Fischer indices. A conclusion has been made that the used expressions do not take into account fully economic peculiarities of the Republic of Belarus: they are considered as inappropriate in the case when product cost is differentiated according to marketing outlets; they do not take account of difference in rate of several currencies and such approach is reflected in export price of a released product and import price for raw material, supplies and component parts. Taking this into consideration expressions for calculation of real value added have been specified in the paper.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the impact of applying <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> methods to the measurement of productivity growth in UK manufacturing between 1979 and 1989. A number of alternative indicators of output growth are considered and it is argued that double deflated value added is the superior concept to employ for the measurement of productivity. It is shown that output measured by double deflated value added fell by 0. 05 % over the period between 1979 and 1989 whereas the official series indicates that output rose by 12. 2 % over the period. Measuring productivity as output per person employed, the double deflated value added measure indicates that between 1979 and 1989 productivity increased by 34 %> whereas the official series indicates an increase of 51 %.

40|$|Abstract. We derive {{industry}} and aggregate level measures of TFP growth {{in an open}} economy {{as well as the}} aggregation/decomposition rules from/to the industry level. Net taxes on products in intermediate uses are assumed to be nonzero also at the economy level and different industries are allowed to face different tax rates for the same intermediate inputs. The economy is assumed to be maximizing either the value of deliv-eries to final demand or value added. In the final demand approach the aggregation equation includes, besides terms representing reallocation of labour and capital, also terms representing reallocation of products in in-termediate uses. In the case of Törnqvist indices, if <b>double</b> <b>deflation</b> is used, even reallocation of deliveries final demand between industries contributes to the aggregate TFP growth. For value added there are two al-ternatives, the approach based on the production possibilities frontier of the industries value added and the one based on the economy level production function. In the latter case also reallocation of value added be-tween industries contributes to the aggregate TFP growth. When the Divisia and Laspeyres indices are used reallocation terms disappear if tax rates / prices are identical across industries. In the case of the Törnqvis...|$|E
40|$|Sweden {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in constructing historical national accounts. Recently, the fifth reconstruction was completed after {{a long period of time}} 1 which means that there are comprehensive accounts for the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Thereby, well founded analyses of long-term patterns of change and transformation can be carried out. In this paper such an analysis is made. First, a short overview is provided of earlier efforts to construct historical national accounts and comparisons are made between the new series and some previous ones. After that, effects of the deflation techniques, i. e. <b>double</b> <b>deflation,</b> are analysed. The new deflators are compared with those resulting from single deflation, i. e. output deflators. A periodisation of the Swedish economic change is then analysed using modern time series analysis. Previous work on Swedish historical national accounts The first construction of Swedish historical national product series was initiated by Gösta Bagge, professor of economics in Stockholm, and published in the 1930 s. The work on national income was performed by a team headed by Erik Lindahl, also professor of economics. Lindahl elaborated the theoretical framework and wrote the theoretical parts of the volumes, where the outcome of the project was published. The empirical work was, to a large extent, performed by Einar Dahlgren, a very diligent statistician. Karin Kock, later professo...|$|E
