5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} {{eyesight}} {{at the age}} of two months. On 24 March 1950, his <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> infected by trachoma. There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since. He cannot read or write, as he does not use Braille; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes.|$|E
5|$|Some figurines {{have been}} defaced with profanity or Satanic symbols. In December 2008, for example, a {{fiberglass}} Baby Jesus valued at US$375 {{was stolen from}} a Eureka Springs, Arkansas park and later recovered, but had been defaced by racial slurs, a swastika, and a Hitler mustache. The <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> also blacked out and pieces had been broken off, rendering it damaged beyond repair.|$|E
50|$|Odd-clawed spiders {{have eight}} eyes {{arranged}} in {{two rows of}} four. The front row curves slightly backward, while the back row curves slightly forward. The anterior and posterior lateral (left and right) <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> clustered closely together, while the median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> spaced further from each other. In females, the anterior and posterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest pairs, with a diameter of 0.35 mm. The anterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the smallest with a diameter of 0.23 mm. The posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> slightly smaller than the lateral eyes, at a diameter of 0.32 mm. In males, the anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest pair, with a diameter of 0.29 mm. Their posterior median eyes and posterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> about the same size, with a diameter of 0.25 mm. As with the female, the anterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the smallest pair, with a diameter of only 0.15 mm. All of the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> white in color, except for the anterior median <b>eyes</b> which <b>are</b> black.|$|R

The flap is replaced and the speculum is removed. The dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> treated next. The software data for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> stored in the Carl Zeiss Meditc MEL 80 laser and delivered by the eye-tracker controlled computer generated excimer laser pulses. The laser time for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> usually under 30 seconds. The dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> mainly corrected for distance and intermediate vision and the non-dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> corrected for intermediate and near vision, by increasing the depth of focus for each eye.|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{hurricane}} on black migrant workers were dramatized in African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 seminal novel, Their <b>Eyes</b> <b>Were</b> Watching God, her best known work and a selection on TIME magazine's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.|$|E
5|$|The {{well-developed}} compound <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> stalked. The striking morphological similarities of {{the eyes}} of Waptia fieldensis to that of extant mysid shrimp make it very likely that they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye may have also been present. Nervous tissue, including a putative brain, has been identified.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the race, all <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> on {{the battle}} for third place, as Häkkinen's pace was so slow that Karl Wendlinger was {{catching}} him in the Sauber, aiming to give Sauber their first podium finish. However, Häkkinen was able to resist Wendlinger's challenge and finish in third place, with Wendlinger fourth. Ukyo Katayama finished fifth for Tyrrell and Hill was able to battle back to finish sixth, the last of the points-scorers.|$|E
50|$|Pupillary {{diameter}}. Light {{falling in}} one eye affects {{the diameter of the}} pupils in both eyes. One can easily see this by looking at a friend's eye while he or she closes the other: when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> small; when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> closed, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> large.|$|R
50|$|Aprusia veddah is {{only known}} from the female of the species. The females are 18.5mm long. The {{cephalothorax}} is pale orange and broadly oval in shape. The anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest and circular, the posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> oval, as are the posterior lateral eyes; the posterior <b>eye</b> row <b>is</b> procurved from the front; the anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> separated by less than their radius, the anterior lateral eye and the posterior lateral <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> separated by less than the anterior lateral eye's radius, the posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> touching, the posterior lateral eye and posterior median <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> touching.

5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> on Ferrari {{whether they would}} be able to continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation in the heat of Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). The <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis {{were among}} the {{audience}} members attacked as they left a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, whose <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> struck by glass from a broken windshield. The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.|$|E

5|$|Her green <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> {{meant to}} symbolize nature and {{also served as}} another {{contrast}} to Tifa's brown eyes. Nomura did not change much of Aerith's design for Advent Children, but her design was updated in Kingdom Hearts with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified her dress in Before Crisis, adding white and green colors, and this version was also {{used as the basis}} for her design in Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E
5|$|Her {{next film}} {{appearance}} {{was in the}} Oprah Winfrey-produced ABC television movie Their <b>Eyes</b> <b>Were</b> Watching God (2005), an adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston's novel, in which Berry portrayed Janie Crawford, a free-spirited woman whose unconventional sexual mores upset her 1920s contemporaries in a small community. She was nominated for another Primetime Emmy Award for this TV film. Meanwhile, she voiced the character of Cappy, {{one of the many}} mechanical beings in the animated feature Robots (2005).|$|E
5|$|The {{coat was}} a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly, {{which was not}} contrasted on the flanks. The limbs had a faint dark line along their front surface. The {{forehead}} was brown, darker than the face, and the upper lip and patch {{in front of the}} <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> lighter than the body. The neck-mane was directed forwards and not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes, and the throat-mane was almost absent. Other differences between the bluebuck and its extant relatives included its shorter and blunter ears not tipped with black, a darker tail tuft (though little darker than its general colour), and smaller teeth. The bluebuck also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives.|$|E

50|$|The {{relative}} {{strength of}} these two forces depends on which way the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> looking. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> adducted (looking toward the nose), the force of depression increases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> abducted (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> in the primary position (looking straight ahead), contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts.|$|R
5|$|The crew took {{advantage}} of both natural and practical light at filming locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.|$|E
5|$|Astaroth {{is shown}} to be a large, muscular, bald, dark-skinned {{humanoid}} with solid white eyes. A black mask wraps around and covers the lower portion of his head, while a black open gorget covers the nape of his neck and spiked spaulders cover his shoulders. Black spiked braces and boots cover his hands to the elbows and feet to the knees respectively, and black garters wrap around the middle of each thigh. A large black belt surrounds his abdomen supporting a fauld and cloth loincloth.s character creation mode, in which they exist as components of Astaroth's secondary outfit Two black straps of leather crisscross the vertical center of his chest from the gorget to the belt, in between which lies his exposed, protruding heart. During development of the design, a flame positioned over his head alongside flaming <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> considered, but were cut from the finished product. Astaroth stands 7 feet 3 inches tall, making him the largest character with a recorded height in the series.|$|E
5|$|D'Amory was supplanted in the king's favour by Hugh Despenser the Younger, and d'Amory {{fought against}} the king in the Despenser War of 1321-22. After the war, Edward placed the Marches {{under the control of}} the Despensers, with Hugh Despenser the Elder taking {{particular}} responsibility for St Briavels. The Despensers appointed Robert Sapy as the keeper of St Briavels and the other confiscated castles across the Marches. Violence began to break out across the region in response to the Despenser's harsh rule, and Sapy's deputy was attacked in July 1325 on his way back from St Briavels Castle to London; his <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> torn out, his arms and legs broken and all his records and money stolen. Edward and the Despensers were deposed shortly afterwards by Edward's wife, Isabella of France. Isabella set about expanding her own lands after her victory, and took St Briavels Castle and various other royal castles into her own possession. When Isabella herself was overthrown by her son, Edward III, in 1330 the castle then reverted to the crown.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} several decades, the mass African American burial site in West Palm Beach was largely {{forgotten}} by the public. The city later sold the property, which switched ownership over the years. In 1991, the property was owned by a private individual when the Sankofa Society conducted a blessing ceremony at the site, well-publicized by the local media. Around that time, Robert Hazard, a resident of West Palm Beach, established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm. In December2000, the city of West Palm Beach purchased the land back for $180,000. Plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers is dramatized in Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their <b>Eyes</b> <b>Were</b> Watching God.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
5|$|Multiple eyewalls {{had been}} {{detected}} in very strong hurricanes before, including Typhoon Sarah and Hurricane Donna, although the double <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> usually seen in very intense systems. Double eyewalls were also seen post-seeding {{in some of}} the seeded storms. At the time however, the only known times that rapid changes in eyewall diameter, other than during presumably successful seedings, was during rapid changes in intensity. It remained controversial whether the seedings caused the secondary eyewalls or whether it was just a natural cycle. Basically, if eyewall changes similar to those observed in seeded hurricanes were rare in unseeded tropical cyclones, it would provide powerful evidence that Project Stormfury was successful. Conversely, if such changes were common in unseeded systems, it would throw doubt on the very hypothesis and assumptions driving Project Stormfury.|$|E
50|$|These minions {{frequently}} wear {{a special}} magical gem called a hag eye. A hag <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{made from the}} real eye of a coven's previous victim.
