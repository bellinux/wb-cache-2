5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> chain.|$|E
5|$|The left {{mandible}} is used {{briefly to}} cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> plant; saliva is injected and the maxillary stylets, which form a tube, are then inserted and the semi-digested food pumped from ruptured cells.

5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to being shaped by aspects of climate, intertidal habitats—especially intertidal zonation patterns—are strongly influenced by species interactions, such as predation, competition, facilitation, and indirect interactions. Ultimately, these interactions feed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> web structure, described above. Intertidal habitats have been a model system for many classic ecological studies, including those introduced below, because the resident communities are particularly amenable to experimentation.|$|E
25|$|All {{members of}} the family Sarcophagidae are larviparous or ovoviviparous. Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Bercaea cruentata) gives live birth to larvae with the female {{retaining}} the egg case in her abdomen. Flesh flies are strongly attracted to carrion or dry flesh. The female has a strong desire to lay larvae on the flesh and have even been noted to larviposit on the sleeve of a garment that has been previously soiled with blood. Oldroyd states that the larvae of Sarcophaga spp are voracious and will take anything of animal origin be it alive or dead. A larva is forced out of the larvipositor usually head first and soon disappears <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> material. Once larvae are deposited as 1st stage instars, rapid development follows with 3rd instars usually being achieved by three to four days. Larviposition to adulthood generally takes around two weeks.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{contamination}} {{can occur}} {{during the process}} of constructing the Olympic venues. In the case of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy, negative environmental impacts were observed, including impacts on soil. Before the Games, researchers studied four areas which the Games would likely affect: a floodplain, a highway, the motorway connecting the city to Lyon, France, and a landfill. They performed an extensive analysis in the types of chemicals found in the soils in these areas {{both before and after the}} Games. Their findings revealed an increase in the number of metals in the topsoils post-Games, and indicated that soil was capable, as part of an ecosystem, of negating, or “buffering,” the effects of many heavy metals. However, their findings also revealed that this was not the case for all metals, and that mercury, lead, and arsenic may have been transferred <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> chain on a massive scale.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, {{the company}} began {{expansion}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> service and institutional industries due {{to a decline in}} the home-baking products market. In 2015, this expansion effort was significantly increased, in order to better-enable the company to fulfill the needs of these industries and markets. Expansion plans were in part based upon company projections predicting that many company employees will be retiring between 2006 and 2018. In 2015, 173 of the company's employees are qualified for retirement. Expansion plans include the introduction and implementation of more modern equipment, which requires fewer personnel to operate, and an increased capacity for storage. In 2013, as part of the plans to keep the company moving forward into the future, a new research and development facility was built that cost over $6 million. The company plans for the expansions to conclude by fall 2017. In 2013, Chelsea Milling Company produced 180 million boxes of Jiffy mix during their busy season, which runs from September through January.|$|E

2500|$|Enameled {{cast iron}} {{cookware}} {{was developed in}} the 1920s. In 1934, the French [...] company Cousances designed the enameled cast iron Doufeu to reduce excessive evaporation and scorching in cast iron Dutch ovens. [...] Modeled on old braising pans in which glowing charcoal was heaped on the lids (to mimic two-fire ovens), the Doufeu has a deep recess in its lid which instead is filled with ice cubes. [...] This keeps the lid at a lower temperature than the pot bottom. [...] Further, little notches {{on the inside of the}} lid allow the moisture to collect and drop back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> during the cooking. [...] Although the Doufeu (literally, [...] "gentlefire") can be used in an oven (without the ice, as a casserole pan), it is chiefly designed for stove top use.|$|E

[...] Then a thick layer of wet vegetation (perhaps moss, fern fronds, skunk cabbage leaves, bark, grass, or conifer needles) is used to cover the rocks and line the pit. [...] The wila is piled on top of this vegetation, almost always with layers of root vegetables or other food. [...] The lichen is then covered with more wet vegetation. [...] Often a barrier of large leaves, bark, reed mats, or burlap sacks is placed on top of all the vegetation to stop any detritus from falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>food.</b> [...] The entire thing is then covered over with a layer of dirt.|$|E
