40|$|AbstractPerceptual fading of texture targets on {{similarly}} textured backgrounds was {{studied in}} relation to stimulus salience using texture patterns defined by orientation contrast, shape contrast, and order contrast. In two independent experiments, perceptual salience of the targets was determined. In the first, the textural contrast of the stimuli was varied and their salience quantified using magnitude estimation; in the second, reaction time was measured for the same stimulus patterns. In a third experiment, stimulus <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> was determined. Whereas magnitude estimates and <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> increased, reaction time decreased with increasing textural contrast strength, {{the shape of the}} curves depending on the kind of texture pattern used. When <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> was plotted against target salience, the slopes of the regression lines for shape and order contrast were similar, while the slope for orientation contrast was steeper, indicating longer <b>fading</b> <b>times</b> at equal stimulus salience. A control experiment using short oriented bars instead of gratings revealed that this difference may be attributed to the abutting contour between the target and its surround. With this contour removed, the <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> was largely the same for all three kinds of texture patterns. In the absence of a border (no cancellation), the unconnected target areas appeared to change gradually in orientation, shape, and spatial arrangement, thereby assuming the properties of the background (substitution) ...|$|R

While existing Kodachrome materials from before Kodak simplified the development process in 1938 are almost always faded, images on Kodachrome slides and motion picture films made after this point retain accurate color and density to this day. It has been calculated that the yellow dye, the least stable, would suffer a 20% loss of dye in 185 years. This is because developed Kodachrome does not retain unused color couplers.

50|$|In a theatre, a {{specialty}} panel {{known as a}} dimmer rack is used to feed stage lighting instruments. A U.S. style dimmer rack has a 208Y/120 volt 3-phase feed. Instead of just circuit breakers, the rack has a solid state electronic dimmer with its own circuit breaker for each stage circuit. This {{is known as a}} dimmer-per-circuit arrangement. The dimmers are equally divided across the three incoming phases. In a 96 dimmer rack, there are 32 dimmers on phase A, 32 dimmers on phase B, and 32 on phase C to spread out the lighting load as equally as possible. In addition to the power feed from the supply transformer in the building, a control cable from the lighting desk carries information to the dimmers in a control protocol such as DMX-512. The information includes lighting level information for each channel, by which it controls which dimmer circuits come up and go out during the lighting changes of the show (light cues), and over what <b>fade</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first characterization and modeling of dynamic propagation channels for human body communication (HBC). In-situ experiments were performed using customized transceivers in an anechoic chamber. Three HBC propagation channels, i. e., from right leg to left leg, from {{right hand to}} left hand and from right hand to left leg, were investigated under thirty-three motion scenarios. Snapshots of data (2, 800, 000) were acquired from five volunteers. Various path gains caused by different locations and movements were quantified and the statistical distributions were estimated. In general, for a given reference threshold &# 232; = &# 8722; 10 dB, the maximum average level crossing rate of the HBC was approximately 1. 99 Hz, the maximum average <b>fade</b> <b>time</b> was 59. 4 ms, {{and the percentage of}} bad channel duration time was less than 4. 16 %. The HBC exhibited a fade depth of &# 8722; 4 dB at 90 % complementary cumulative probability. The statistical parameters were observed to be centered for each propagation channel. Subsequently a Fritchman model was implemented to estimate the burst characteristics of the on-body fading. It was concluded that the HBC is motion-insensitive, which is sufficient for reliable communication link during motions, and therefore it has great potential for body sensor/area networks...|$|E

Each independent variable (temperature, humidity, and time) was interactive with the other two variables. Under the specific conditions tested, as a significant interaction existed between light and dark fading reactions. For example, both the light and dark cyan dye reactions inhibit each other. However, in the case of the magenta and yellow dyes, a synergistic, or catalytic, effect occurs when light fading precedes dark fading. Agfapan Vario-XL is extremely light stable when irradiated by a conventional enlarger light source. An intermittency effect was noted.

40|$|The wave-guide formed {{between the}} lower {{ionosphere}} and the earth’s surface {{is good for}} very low frequency (VLF) and low frequency (LF) propagation round the earth. The conductivity parameter determining {{the status of the}} ionospheric radio propagation is controlled by solar conditions. The conductivity is affected due to extra-ionization in the ionosphere during enhancement of solar flare effect. This, in turn, causes a variation in attenuation factor. The variation of attenuation causes variation of amplitude of the LF 40 -kHz signal (call sign: JG 2 AS) modulated by 1 Hz, transmitted from Sanwa, Japan (36011 / N, 139051 /E) continuously. The signal received at Agartala (230 N, 910 E) exhibits the sunrise and sunset effects. The sunrise fades follow the sunrise time over the propagation path.

Here propagation is unusual because frequencies below 100 kHz have an additional characteristic of being able to travel long distance guided between earth and ionosphere. The wave guide forme...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{measured}} the <b>fading</b> <b>times</b> of peripheral targets {{as a function}} of whether viewing was monocular or binocular, and of brightness contrast. Data from a binocularly normal group showed Troxler fading to be significantly faster with monocular (i. e., patched) than with binocular viewing. In contrast, one-eyed observers showed significantly longer <b>fading</b> <b>times</b> than the two-eyed observers viewing monocularly and equivalent times to their binocular viewing. A control experiment showed that these findings were not due to worse fixation stability, larger pupil sizes, or an unusually large blinking rate in the enucleated group. The enucleated group actually exhibited a slight miosis, equivalent fixation stability, and a normal blinking rate. In both experiments, the <b>times</b> to <b>fading</b> of all observers were a function of brightness contrast. We conclude that in binocularly normal observers patching or closing one eye does not produce monocular vision but rather a condition of weak binocular rivalry, and that the absence of inhibitory binocular interactions in the enucleated group may explain, in part, their resistance to fading and their superior performance in other contrast-defined tasks...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the effects of non-linear propagation on a proposed digital microwave radio link which employs MSK modulation, in order to specify a suitable form of adaptive equalization. MSK is a coherent modulation technique, having improved spectral roll-off over FSK because it avoids the abrupt phase changes at the bit transitions. However computer simulations and field results indicate that MSK digital radio links do suffer from intersymbol interference and crosstalk. Software and hardware simulations of multipath propagation are based on Rummlers simplified three path model and statistics. The results obtained from the computer simulations of the MSK link and multipath propagation confirm {{that there is no}} simple relationship between the multipath parameters and the BER degradation which could be used in the design of an equalizer. The choice of adaptive equalizer is made based on criteria such as construction cost, circuit complexity, and performance improvement. It is known from ray model analysis that at a transmitting frequency of 23 GHz deep fading will only occur on links longer than 5. 24 kms. However even on hops of length 5 km' s the <b>fade</b> <b>time</b> is-in the order of 1612 seconds/month (calculated using Rummlers model). A ldB increase in theoretical Eb/No will also be required to overcome potential modem imperfections. It is necessary to have a time domain equalizer which can compensate for both amplitude and phase distortions simultaneously by acting directly on the ISI. The equalizer structure chosen is a 2 -by- 2, fractionally spaced, decision feedback, complex adaptive equalizer with zero forcing control algorithm...|$|E

The latter product {{appeared to be a}} mixture of several compounds, including water, dimethylsulfite, and dimethylsulfone, and was found to cause unfatigued solutions to fatigue with no exposure. In leucocyanide in reagent alcohol solutions, the leucohydroxide and leucoethoxide forms of the dyes were found in fatigued solutions. The Rf values of these compounds were used to identify the fatigue products of the leucocyanide solutions. These compounds were found to have worse photochromism than the leucocyanide forms of the dyes. The photochromic properties of the leucocyanides were determined for up to 200 exposures. The maximum density was found to decrease linearly for a number of exposures and then level off. The <b>fade</b> <b>time</b> stayed constant and then increased exponentially. The yellow fatigue product concentration in DMSO increased exponentially and then leveled off, and the leucoethoxide fatigue product in reagent alcohol concentration increased linearly. A three factor ANOVA was performed on malachite green and crystal violet leucocyanide in DMSO, with oxygen level, water level, and tempurature as the factors. Some water was found to be beneficial to photochromism and fatigue. Temperature had an adverse effect on maximum density and fatigue, and oxygen had little effect by itself, but did interact with water to increase photochromism and fatigue. A subsequent investigation showed an optimum level of water for both photochromism and fatigue at fifteen percent water...|$|E
