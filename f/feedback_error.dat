50|$|The {{classical}} {{definition of}} a closed loop system for human movement comes from Jack A. Adams (1971) : „ A closed loop system has <b>feedback,</b> <b>error</b> detection and error correction as key elements. There is a reference that specifies the desired value for the system, and {{the output of the}} system is fed back and compared to the reference for error detection and, if necessary corrected..... A closed loop system is self regulating by compensating for deviating from the reference.”Most movements that are carried out during day-to-day activity are formed using a continual process of accessing sensory information and using it to more accurately continue the motion. This type of motor control is called feedback control, as it relies on sensory feedback to control movements. Feedback control is a situated form of motor control, relying on sensory information about performance and specific sensory input from the environment in which the movement is carried out. This sensory input, while processed, does not necessarily cause conscious awareness of the action. Closed loop control is a feedback based mechanism of motor control, where any act on the environment creates some sort of change that affects future performance through feedback. Closed loop motor control is best suited to continuously controlled actions, but does not work quickly enough for ballistic actions. Ballistic actions are actions that continue to the end without thinking about it, even when they no longer are appropriate.Because feedback control relies on sensory information, it is as slow as sensory processing. These movements are subject to a speed/accuracy trade-off, because sensory processing is being used to control the movement, the faster the movement is carried out, the less accurate it becomes.|$|E

30|$|<b>Feedback</b> <b>errors</b> inevitably degrade {{performance}} of both frameworks because some useful information is lost by {{the intervention of}} bit errors in the fed back CSI. This is because scheduling performance is degraded due to the corrupted CSI information, and also precoding matrix design is affected due to the same corrupted CSI. The decentralised framework can {{be more sensitive to}} scheduling degradation as imperfect CSI might result in a selection of different users by some of the cooperating BSs, depending on the scheduling algorithm employed, which will inevitably increase interuser interference. However, round-robin scheduling is robust to CSI <b>feedback</b> <b>errors</b> as scheduling decisions are not made based on CSI. This scheduling algorithm is selected for the present evaluation which focuses on the impact of <b>feedback</b> <b>errors</b> on the design of precoding matrices.

30|$|In [14] a {{framework}} for decentralising MCP has been proposed which aims at keeping the necessary infrastructural overheads and costs for accommodating MCP to a minimum. It is assumed that each BS collects local together with nonlocal CSI; each MS sends its CSI estimate to all cooperating BSs. In this case, each BS can perform scheduling, and design the transmission parameters independently without the need of any CSI exchange with a central entity; the same scheduling decisions are made by each BS. The proposed framework has a potential sensitivity to <b>feedback</b> <b>errors</b> since MSs utilise several radio links in order to communicate their CSI to the collaborating BSs. This was not fully evaluated in [14] which only assumed unquantized (unlimited) feedback. However, limited feedback schemes are of practical importance [15]. Therefore in this paper a more realistic quantized feedback model is considered, and its sensitivity to <b>feedback</b> <b>errors</b> under the proposed framework is investigated. It is shown that the proposed decentralized framework is robust against <b>feedback</b> <b>errors</b> under a realistic digital feedback model.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The {{asymmetric}} {{nature of}} bit errors in several practical applications provides grounds for efficient error control techniques. The Z-channel model and special classes of codes like asymmetric error detection codes and t-asymmetric error correcting/d-asymmetric error detecting codes can be successfully used in ARQ protocols for <b>feedback</b> <b>error</b> control enhancement.

The undetected error probability and the expected number of retransmissions are calculated for this protocol. Then the Bose-Lin codes are analyzed and <b>feedback</b> <b>error</b> control specific parameters are derived for them. Finally, a type I hybrid ARQ one-code scheme is proposed and analyzed.

40|$|In this study, a new {{theoretical}} {{foundation for}} the Discrete-Time <b>Feedback</b> <b>Error</b> Learning (DTFEL) method is proposed. This method {{is analogous to the}} original Continuous-Time <b>Feedback</b> <b>Error</b> Learning (FEL) originally proposed as a control model of the cerebellum in the field of computational neuroscience. DTFEL is superior to FEL since it is applicable for digital controllers which are commonly used nowadays. Based on the strictly positive realness, the stability of DTFEL has been validated. However, from the viewpoint of adaptive control, this condition is restricted since some required assumptions cannot be satisfied in real systems, such as the direct input-output transmission gain is required to be large. Moreover, the stability of the system is guaranteed by selecting a sufficiently large positive constant feedback gain, which is a vague requirement from the viewpoint of control system design. This study proposes another scheme for the DTFEL method which does not require any positive real condition and overcomes the direct input-output transmission gain requirement. This can be achieved by utilizing the error signal more effectively.

40|$|In marked {{contrast}} with the ideal error-free feedback assumption that is common in the literature, practical systems {{are likely to have}} severely bandwidth-limited, error-prone feedback channels. We consider the scenario where feedback from the receiver is used by the transmitter to select the best antenna, out of many available antennas, for data transmission. <b>Feedback</b> <b>errors</b> cause the transmitter to select an antenna different from the one signaled by the receiver. We show that optimizing the signaling assignment, which maps the antenna indices to the feedback codewords, improves performance without introducing any additional redundancy. For a system that uses error-prone feedback to transmit quadrature-phase-shift-keying-modulated data from a single antenna selected from many available spatially correlated antennas, we derive closed-form approximations for the data symbol error probability for an arbitrary number of receive antennas. We use these to systematically find the optimal signaling assignments using a low-complexity algorithm. The optimal signaling is intimately coupled to how the receiver performs selection verification, i. e., how it decodes the data signal when, due to <b>feedback</b> <b>errors,</b> it does not always know which antenna was used for data transmission.
