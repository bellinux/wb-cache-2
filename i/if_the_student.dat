25|$|Foreign {{citizens}} and stateless students are enrolled {{on the same}} principle as Serbian citizens are. The {{only difference is that}} they are provided free Serbian classes (in case they don't already know Serbian) prior to enrollment so they could understand lectures in school. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> is from a European country, they can be provided the lectures of mother tongue and culture, free or with compensation.|$|E
25|$|To {{yield the}} final grade {{for the student}} taking the language, all of the students' {{examination}} scores for that language are added; as the maximum total score is 200, the total is divided by 200% to yield the students' percentage score for the language subject. The format described is the format of 2013; it varies slightly in weight for each section, with deletions of some sections <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> is taking Foundation English {{as part of the}} foundational stream.|$|E
25|$|Shaping {{involves}} gradually {{modifying the}} existing behavior into the desired behavior. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> engages {{with a dog}} by hitting it, then {{he or she could}} have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which he or she touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of operant conditioning principles and extinction. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.|$|E

25|$|After each exam, {{results are}} {{immediately}} {{given to the}} students. In case of the road test, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> meets all the required criteria, the licence is handed over by the inspector. Should the student, for any reason, {{not be allowed to}} hold the licence at the time of a successful test (for example because he has not yet reached the minimum age), the licence will be sent to the Kraftfahrzeug-Zulassungsbehörde (compare DMV DVLA) of the student's place of residence where it can be picked up as soon as the person becomes eligible.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tradition}} is the homecoming cane toss, which {{dates from the}} 1930s. Before the university's homecoming football game, third-year law students run from {{the north end of}} the football field at Camp Randall Stadium to the south end wearing bowler hats and carrying canes. When the students reach the goalpost on the south end of the field, they attempt to throw their canes over the goalpost. Legend has it that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> successfully throws the cane over the goalpost and catches it, she will win her first case; if she fails to catch it, the opposite will hold true.|$|E
25|$|Cheating {{differs from}} most {{other forms of}} {{academic}} dishonesty, in that people can engage in it without benefiting themselves academically at all. For example, a student who illicitly telegraphed answers to a friend during a test would be cheating, even though the student's own work {{is in no way}} affected. Another example of academic dishonesty is a dialogue between students in the same class but in two different time periods, both of which a test is scheduled for that day. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> in the earlier time period informs the other student in the later period about the test; that is considered academic dishonesty, even though the first student has not benefited himself.|$|E

25|$|However, {{from the}} autumn of 2011, a new grading scale has been {{introduced}} into the Swedish school system: A, B, C, D, and E as passing grades and F as failing. B and D work as filling grades, for when a student hasn't reached all objectives for C or A but has reached most of them. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> can't be graded, e.g. extensive truancy, the student will receive a dash instead of an F. If a student {{is on the verge}} of receiving an F in a certain subject/course, the teacher responsible for that subject will notify the student and the student's parents. If a student is given an F, they will receive a written review of how to improve themselves.|$|E
25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways {{may not be the}} focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. Instructors are faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E
25|$|The {{obligatory}} {{subjects for}} all students are: classical studies (oldtidskundskab) (level C), religious studies (C), Danish (A), English (B), history (A), mathematics (B), physics (C), physical education (C), and social studies (C). In addition, while English is compulsory for all, each student also has to study another modern foreign language at either A or B level depending on whether it is taken continued or as beginner (the most common are German, French, Spanish and Italian). Continued language courses on B level are only available for German and French. The student is also required to study an artistic subject (e.g. music or visual arts) at level C, {{and two of the}} subjects biology (C), chemistry (C) and physical geography (C). Most of the obligatory subjects can be studied at a higher level <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> elects to do so.|$|E

50|$|A {{discrete}} trial usually {{consists of}} the following: the antecedent, the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> and a consequence. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>student's</b> behavior matches what is desired the consequence is something positive: food, candy, a game, praise, etc. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> behavior was not correct the teacher offers the correct answer then repeats the trial possibly with more prompting, if needed.|$|R

25|$|The college's dining {{services}} have been featured on numerous national publications. In 2015, the college's dining program was ranked 6th by The Princeton Review, and 8th by Usatoday in the United States. The college's dining services received the grade of 'A+' by Niche in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The college holds one main dining area and offers two floors of seating. The college also institutes 'The Napkin Board' where students may leave comments or suggestions written on napkins for the dining program and its staff. All meals and catered events on campus {{are served by}} Bates Dining Services, which makes a concentrated effort to purchase foods from suppliers and producers within the state of Maine, like Oakhurst Dairy and others. The Den serves as an on-campus restaurant and is open until 1 AM Sun-Thurs. and 2 AM on Friday and Saturday nights. While on campus, enrolled students and faculty have access to round-the-clock emergency medical services and security protection that only stops <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> or faculty leaves the physical campus or withdraws from the college.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge was {{considered}} too sacred to be bartered for money, and hence any stipulation that fees {{ought to be}} paid was vigorously condemned. Financial support came from the society at large, {{as well as from}} rich merchants and wealthy parents. Though the number of students studying under a single Guru sometimes numbered in the hundreds, teachers did not deny education even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> was poor; free boarding and lodging was provided, and students had to do manual work in the household. Paying students, such as princes, were taught during the day, while non-paying ones were taught at night. Gurudakshina was usually expected at the completion of a student's studies, but it was essentially a mere token of respect and gratitude - many times being nothing more than a turban, a pair of sandals, or an umbrella. In cases of poor students being unable to afford even that, they could approach the king, who would then step in and provide something. Not providing a poor student a means to supply his Guru's Dakshina {{was considered}} the greatest slur on a King's reputation.|$|E
25|$|The Jesuits {{who founded}} St. Ignatius College were exiles from Germany, forced out by Bismarck's Kulturkampf. They {{brought with them}} the {{traditional}} structure of the Jesuit college {{as an extension of}} the apostolate of the religious community to prepare the student morally as well as intellectually. The principal instrument of this education was the classical course of seven years, in which the first three years were devoted to learning languages as necessary tools. The student was then considered prepared for university work. The next four years were devoted to the study of classical literature and Latin and Greek prose and poetry, and to developing the ability to express one's self in these languages, as well as in the vernacular, orally and in writing. The final year was devoted to philosophy. There were also electives in the sciences, history, and geography, as well as other subjects. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> completed only six years, a certificate was given. Completion of the year of philosophy made the student eligible for the baccalaureate degree, which the college was empowered to grant when it was chartered in 1890. The first two degrees were awarded in 1895.|$|E

500|$|Although public {{universities}} were integrated by court decree, selective colleges and graduate programs, and the professions which stemmed from them, remained almost all white. [...] Many African-Americans had attended inferior schools and were ill-prepared {{to compete in}} the admissions process. [...] This was unsatisfactory to many activists of the late 1960s, who protested that given the African-American's history of discrimination and poverty, some preference should be given to minorities. [...] This became a commonly held liberal position, and large numbers of public and private universities began affirmative action programs. Among these were the University of California, Davis School of Medicine (UC Davis or [...] "the university"), which was founded in 1968 and had an all-white inaugural class. [...] The faculty was concerned by this, and the school began a special admissions program [...] "to compensate victims of unjust societal discrimination". The application form contained a question asking <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> wished to be considered disadvantaged, and, if so, these candidates were screened by a special committee, on which more than half the members were from minority groups. Initially, the entering class was 50 students, and eight seats were put aside for minorities; when the class size doubled in 1971, there were 16 seats which were to be filled by candidates recommended by the special committee. While nominally open to whites, no one of that race was admitted under the program, which was unusual in that a specific number of seats were to be filled by candidates through this program.|$|E

5000|$|The {{new part}} of {{educator}} effectiveness policies is {{the integration of}} outcome data into the evaluation process.

Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate <b>the</b> growth in <b>student</b> learning that {{can be attributed to}} individual teachers. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, the teacher is said to be effective; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> score below <b>the</b> predicted scores, the teacher is said to be ineffective.
