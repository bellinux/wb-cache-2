50|$|The Thác Bà Hydropower Plant {{is a major}} {{hydropower}} project {{located within}} the province on the Chay River, built between 1964 and 1971 with assistance from the Soviet Union. Construction began on August 19, 1964. Despite frequent air strikes by the United States Air Force during this period, the first unit of the power plant was commissioned on October 5, 1971; the second unit followed on August 1972, and the third unit on May 19, 1972. The power plant currently has a capacity of 120 MW, and has an energy generating potential of 400 million kWh/year. The project as built has a dam 48 m high and 657 m long, creating a gross storage capacity of 2.49 cubic kilometres with a live storage of 2.16 cubic kilometres on the Chay River draining a catchment of 6430 km at the dam site. The reservoir is 60 km with a water spread of 235 km at the Full Reservoir Level of +58 m. The project has been designed for a maximum flood discharge of 3,650 m/s. The other ruling levels of the project are: <b>dead</b> <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> in the reservoir +46.0m and maximum flood level of +59.65 for a thousand-year flood.|$|E

In this paper, hotspots of agricultural change were mapped {{and put in}} the context of hydrology and water management. Time series of MODIS imagery taken every eight days before (2001 - 2002) and during (2002 - 2003) the supply shock were combined with agricultural census data to document changes in cropping patterns in four large irrigation projects in the downstream sections of the Krishna and Godavari River basins (total command area 18, 287 km 2). The area cropped in rice in the four irrigated command areas decreased by 32 % during the drought year, and rice production in the two districts that experienced the largest flow reductions fell below production levels of 1980. The irrigation project that showed the largest change in double cropped area (- 90 %) was upstream of the Krishna Delta. In the Krishna Delta, large areas changed from rice-rice to rice-gram double cropping. Historical water management contributed to the vulnerability of rice production to drought: the main reservoir in the system was drained to <b>dead</b> <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> by the end of each growing season over 1968 - 2000, with little carryover storage. The land cover change maps suggested that the lower Krishna Basin has experienced a "hard landing" during basin closure, and revised management strategies that account for the new flow regime will be required to maintain agricultural production during droughts.

In this study, thesedimentation characteristics of Mosul dam reservoir have been evaluated using two topographic mapsof the reservoir area at different times (1986 and 2011) via Arc/GIS software. The dam is located on theTigris River {{in the northern part}} of Iraq and started operating in 1986. The water surface area of itsreservoir is 380 km 2 with a designed storage capacity of 11. 11 km 3 at a maximum operating level (330 m a. s. l). The results showed that the annual sediment deposition rate is 45. 72 × 106 m 3 year- 1 of which 23. 2 × 106 and 22. 52 × 106 m 3 year- 1 are in the dead storage and live storage zones respectively. As aconsequence, the live and dead storage zones lost 6. 9 % and 19. 66 % respectively of their storagecapacity during the 25 year of operation of the dam. The water-spread area (water surface area) of thereservoir at <b>dead</b> <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> (300 m a. s. l) was reduced annually by about 1. 34 km 2.

40|$|The {{need for}} high performance, highly {{reliable}} storage for very large on-line databases, coupled with rapid advances in storage device technology, {{has made the}} study of generalized storage hierarchies an important area of research. This paper analyzes properties of a data storage hierarchy system specifically designed for handling very large on-line databases. To attain high performance and high reliability, the data storage hierarchy makes use of multiple page sizes in different <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> and maintains multiple copies of the same information across the <b>storage</b> <b>levels.</b> Such a <b>storage</b> hierarchy system is currently being designed {{as part of the}} INFOPLEX database computer project. Previous studies of storage hierarchies have primarily focused on virtual memories for program storage and hierarchies with a single page size across all <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> and/or a single copy of infprmation in the hierarchy. In the INFOPLEX design, extensions to the least recently used (LRU) algorithm are used to manage the <b>storage</b> <b>levels.</b> The read-through technique is used to initially load a referenced page of the appropriate size into all <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> above the one in which the page is found. Since each <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> is viewed {{as an extension of the}} immediate higher level, an overflow page from level i is always placed in level i + 1. Important properties of these algorithms are derived. It is shown that depending on the types of algorithms used and the relative sizes of the <b>storage</b> <b>levels,</b> it is not always possible to guarantee that the contents of a given <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> i is always a superset of the contents of its immediate higher <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> i- 1. The necessary and sufficient conditions for this property to hold are identified and proved. Furthermore, it is possible that increasing the size of intermediate <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> may actually increase the number of references to lower <b>storage</b> <b>levels,</b> resulting in reduced performance. Conditions necessary to avoid such an anomaly are also identified and proved...|$|R
