During the winter of 1990 - 1991, between 35 and 66 cm of rainfall and intensities up to 10 em per hour for a five minute period were recorded. During the winter of 1991 - 1992, between 48 and 74 cm of rainfall and intensities up to 8 cm per hour were recorded. Even though there was moderate rainfall on barren, saturated soils, no major debris flows occurred in burned areas. The winter of 1992 - 1993 recorded total precipitation of about 170 % of normal. Intensities were relatively low and no debris flows were observed.

40|$|The {{urbanization}} of the Los Angeles Basin {{area has}} resulted {{the construction of}} extensive water storage, flood control, and water distribution systems over the past 100 years. Dams, <b>debris</b> <b>basins,</b> and detention basins were built within the Los Angeles River watershed to minimize sediment transport through the main river and control peak flood flows through the greater Los Angeles area. Levees were built along the river to convey flood flows {{and most of the}} river was lined with concrete to fix the position of the river and eliminate channel erosion.

A prescribed burn in the San Dimas Experimental Forest provided an opportunity to quantify the effects of fire on soil hydrologic properties and sediment fluxes in chaparral-covered steeplands. Located in the San Gabriel Mountains about 50 km northeast of Los Angeles, a 1. 28 ha watershed was instrumented with hillslope sediment collectors and a <b>debris</b> <b>basin.</b> Sediment fluxes were measured for seven {{years prior to the}} fire and through the first post-fire winter.

Although extremely variable, non-wettability generally increased after the fire. Post-fire hillslope erosion was twice as great as pre-burn levels during the dry season and increased by 10 -fold in the wet season, despite a record drought year.

40|$|During recent years, most open feedlot {{operators}} {{have found}} it desirable and, in some cases, necessary to install runoff control facilities. Even though {{the primary purpose of}} feedlot runoff control systems is the prevention of water pollution, many producers have found that good management of these systems also offers limited economic benefits in the form of fertilizer nutrients and supplemental irrigation water. Well managed runoff control systems also reduce weeds, odors, insects and muddy areas at or near feedlot edges. The runoff control system that has proved most satisfactory for all areas of the country is one consisting of clean water diversion, runoff collection, a solids settling facility (or <b>debris</b> <b>basin),</b> a runoff holding pond and pond dewatering equipment (Figure l). Management consists of cleaning solids from the settling facility and pumping out the holding pond when necessary. The amount of labor required for proper management of runoff control systems is not excessive, but this type task usually has a low priority in a general farming situation and, therefore, is often not accomplished when it should be. A lack of cattle lot maintenance can lead to undrained muddy areas and to nuisance conditions such as fly and odor problems. Such conditions have also been shown to decrease animal performance. If the settling basin is not cleaned when solids build-up reaches the design-full level, the outlet clogs and more solids carry through to the holding pond. Allowing solids to reach the holding pond reduces its capacity and shortens its useful life unless periodic sludge removal is practiced. Additionally, an excessive accumulation of solids and undrained liquids in the basin frequently results in odor and insect problems. Failure to pump out the holding pond on a timely basis may lead to overflows with dubsequent loss of crop nutrients, water pollution, and potentially to a lawsuit. Clean Water Diversion To minimize the amount of water which must be handled through a runoff-control system; diversion terraces, channels and roof gutters should be utilized and kept in good repair. Keeping clean water diverted away from feedlots decreases the quantity ofliquids to be separated in the settling basin and subsequently stored in the holding pond. Control of clean water effectively reduces the required size of the holding pond or can increase the time between dewatering operations. In· situations where clean water is to be collected for use as irrigation water, it should be diverted around the settling basin directly to the holding pond. Careful sizing and design of the holding pond is essential to ensure adequate capacity for storing both the diverted clean water and feedlot runoff. Runoff can be collected from feedlot areas and diverted to settling basins and holding ponds by using curbs, channels, terraces, pipes or combinations of these. All parts of the runoff control facilities need to be kept free of obstructions such as weeds, tree limbs, and accumulations of solids. Obstructions in runoff collection devices may cause overflows with resultant pollution or nuisance conditions due to unconfined feedlot runoff. Obstructions can also cause solids to settle in areas where removal may be difficult, or impossible. Routine moving and clean-up supplemented with periodic grading and shaping of earthen runoff collection devices will effectively minimize the development of erosive or low, soggy areas...|$|E
40|$|Sediment flux from hillslopes to {{channels}} commonly increases following wildfires, with {{implications for}} the carbon cycle, river habitats, and debris-flow hazards. Although much of this material is transported via dry ravel, existing ravel models are not applicable to hillslopes with gradients greater than the angle of repose, which can constitute the majority of mountainous terrain. To fill this knowledge gap, we develop a continuity model for sediment storage by vegetation dams on steep hillslopes to predict sediment yields following wildfire. The maximum volume of sediment stored prior to wildfire is set to {{be a function of}} vegetation density, the capacity of plants to impound sediment, and the contributing hillslope area. Time is required after fire to establish vegetation and replenish hillslope sediment storage, which introduces vegetation regrowth rate, soil production rate, and fire recurrence interval as important variables that affect ravel yield. Model results for the San Gabriel Mountains, California, predict that sediment yield can increase by several orders of magnitude following fire. These results are consistent with field data of ravel yield (~ 30 mm per contributing area of hillslope in 5 months) we collected following the 2009 Station Fire, as well as postfire sediment flux recorded by 93 <b>debris</b> <b>basins.</b> In contrast to previous work, our model shows that heightened postfire sediment yields can be explained by a change in hillslope sediment storage independent of major changes in the soil production rate and landscape form over geomorphic timescales...|$|R
