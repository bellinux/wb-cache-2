500|$|The {{queen and}} her husband (and co-sovereign) Philip II of Spain then set about {{granting}} the College a new house called Derby Place or Derby House, under a new charter, dated 18 July 1555 at Hampton Court Palace. The house was built by Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, who married Lady Margaret Beaufort in 1482 and was created the 1st Earl of Derby in 1485. The house was built in 1503 and {{was given to the}} Crown by the 3rd Earl in 1552/3 in exchange for some land. The charter stated that the house would: [...] "enable them [...] to assemble together, and consult, and agree amongst themselves, for the good of their faculty, and that the records and rolls might be more safely and conveniently deposited." [...] The charter also reincorporated the three kings of arms, six heralds and all other heralds and pursuivants, and their successors, into a corporation with perpetual succession. A new seal of authority, with the College's <b>full</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> was also engraved. On 16 May 1565, the name [...] "the House of the Office of Arms" [...] was used, thereafter in May 1566 [...] "our Colledge of Armes", and in January 1567 [...] "our House of the College of the office of arms".|$|E

Just as each shield should be unique, so too should each crest. In Scotland, however, it is permissible, and not uncommon, {{for two or}} more different families to bear the same crest. [...] As Scottish heraldry joins the crest and motto in the crest badge, however, the combination of crest and motto should, in each case, be unique.|$|E

50|$|In 1855-57, in {{the course}} of a general heraldic reform, the eagle's {{appearance}} was changed, mirroring German patterns, while St George was made to look to the left, in accordance with the rules of Western heraldry. At the same time, the <b>full</b> set <b>of</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Great, Medium and Minor Arms, was laid down and approved.

6000|$|I now {{began to}} {{question}} the Chainbearer concerning the condition in which he found the 'Nest-house and farm, over which I had given him full authority, {{when he came to}} the place, by a special letter to the agent. The people in possession were of very humble pretensions, and had been content to occupy the kitchen and servants' rooms ever since my grandfather's death, as indeed, they had done long before that event. It was owing to this moderation, as well as to their perfect honesty, that I found nothing embezzled, and most of the articles in good condition. As for the farm, it had flourished, on the [...] "let alone" [...] principle. The orchards had grown, as a matter of course; and if the fields had not been improved by judicious culture, neither had they been exhausted by covetous croppings. In these particulars, there was nothing of which to complain. Things might have been better, Andries thought; but he also thought it was exceedingly fortunate they were no worse. While we were conversing on this theme, Dus moved about the room silently, but with collected activity, having arranged the tea-table with her own hands. When invited to take our seats at it--everybody drew near to a tea-table in that day, unless when there was too large a party to be accommodated--I was surprised to find everything so perfectly neat, and some things rich. The plates, knives, etc., were of good quality, but the tray was actually garnished with a set of old-fashioned silver, such as was made when tea was first used, of small size, but very highly chased. The handle of the spoons represented the stem of the tea-plant, and there was a crest on each of them; while a <b>full</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> was engraved on the different vessels of the service, which were four in all. I looked at the crest, in a vague, but surprised expectation of finding my own. It was entirely new to me. Taking the cream-jug in my hand, I could recall no arms resembling those that were engraved on it.|$|E

5000|$|The Kingdom of Fiji {{became a}} crown colony of the British Empire on 10 October 1874. [...] About 34 years later, the islands were accorded {{with their own}} <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> through a royal warrant issued on 4 July 1908.

When it was granted independence on 10 October 1970, Fiji decided to retain its <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> from the colonial era. [...] This was partly because of its links to Seru Epenisa Cakobau, the first and last King of Fiji (Tui Viti) who relinquished control of the country to Britain. [...] However, the <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> featured on the flag was modified, which involved removing the crest, supporters, and motto, thus leaving only the escutcheon untouched.

50|$|The {{pattern in}} {{service at the}} start of the wars was the 1780 pattern {{introduced}} by Joseph II to reflect his policy of moving away from reliance on the Holy Roman Empire to focusing on Habsburg Lands. The black Doppeladler eagle carried a large shield, which displayed the <b>full</b> Habsburg <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and really expressed his policy of relying on the Austrian resources and no longer those of the Holy Roman Empire. To the sides on the wings were the Imperial Buchstaben (cipher initials), starting with 'JII' for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1765-1790). Due to the end of the Turkish War and the ongoing Belgian rebellion, the new Emperor Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, issued a proclamation on 17 March 1790 ordering the Hofkriegsrat that for reasons of economy, all flags were to remain unchanged. His brief reign only lasted until April 1792, so, the flags only changed in 1792 when the Buchstaben (initials) received a bar through the ‘J’, so it became an ‘F’ to display the cipher of the new Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor: ‘FII’, either side of the complicated central shield (this addition of a bar through the J for existing flags distinguishes flags initially issued under Joseph from post-1792 issued flags). With its many quarterings, the shield carried all the <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the territories held or claimed by the Habsburgs: On the top line are: the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Old & New Hungary, Spain (made up of Castille, Leon, Aragon, Navarre), Bohemia; on the second line: Burgundy, Austria/Lorraine under the Archduke's coronet, Tuscany; on the third line: Transylvania (or Siebenbürgen) Lombardy, Mantua; on the bottom line: Habsburg, Flanders, Tyrol. Around the shield are the chains and emblems of the Orders of St. Stephen of Hungary and of Maria Theresa. Above is the red and gold crown of Austria. On the obverse of the white Leibfahne was the Madonna and Child on a cloud with rays of light streaming to the right and left.|$|R
