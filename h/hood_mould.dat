5|$|The east {{window in}} the chancel is {{in the shape of}} a pointed arch and dates from the 15th century; it has three lights topped with cinquefoils and a <b>hood</b> <b>mould.</b> On the north side of the nave there is a {{rectangular}} window from 1865. The 16th-century south transept has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th-century arch, and the east window is small and rectangular, using some dressings from the 14th century. The wide opening between the transept and the rest of the church is spanned with a large wooden beam.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey façade to Viaduct Road is E-shaped and regular, with a {{symmetrical}} seven-bay plan. The {{first and}} seventh bays project further forward than the centre (fourth) bay, which is formed by an elevated entrance porch. This has lancet {{windows on the}} sides, grouped under single hood moulds and with a string course. The doorway is under a segmental arch which is topped by a gable. The rest of the ground floor has larger lancets arranged in pairs and with a small trefoil above. The south-facing walls have two pairs together, while on the inward-facing walls {{of the first and}} seventh bays there are two sets of paired windows placed some distance apart. At first-floor level, similar paired lancets and trefoils rise as gabled dormers above the roofline. The south walls of the first and seventh bays have prominent five-light oriel windows, canted to form a 1–3–1 pattern of trefoil-headed panes. These oriel windows are supported on ornate corbels. Above these at first-floor level, and also above the entrance porch, there are three-light trefoil-headed windows set under a segmental arch-shaped <b>hood</b> <b>mould.</b> Many of the windows on the south side have plate tracery.|$|E
5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of <b>hood</b> <b>mould</b> on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E
50|$|The masonry of {{the windows}} on the North side, like the doorways at the West, forms curious <b>hood</b> <b>moulds,</b> to {{be seen from the}} outside of the buildings.|$|R

25|$|The church south porch is 15th-century. It is a gabled {{structure}} with a cross finial at the centre, and crocketed pinnacles at each corner of its south face. It {{is set on}} a plinth which runs over diagonal buttresses at the south corners. A string course runs into a <b>hood</b> <b>mould</b> surrounding a blocked pointed window opening at both {{the east and west}} side. The pointed doorway arch is hood moulded, and has a continuous chamfered surround meeting a flat reveal, which in turn holds a further roll mould arch ending at the spring with capitals unsupported by piers.

[...] It has a marble floor and mosaics.|$|R
25|$|Within the verandah, four bays are {{organized}} into an ABA rhythm of two paired, central bays flanked by singular bays at the extremes.

25|$|The 13th-century north aisle is of {{limestone}} and ironstone work, {{with a string}} course at the eaves, and a plinthdefined by a simple raised band below {{the line of the}} windowsbroken by an blocked chamfered and arched doorway to the west end. Both ends of the aisle are supported by clasping buttresses terminated with gables. An angled buttress of the same style sits between the two identical rectangular north windows, each of three lights with cusped ogee heads. The north aisle pointed west window opening has a chamfered reveal and a <b>hood</b> <b>mould,</b> with an inset window of two simple pointed lights. The pointed east window with <b>hood</b> <b>mould</b> is of four lightstwo central lights, with cusped heads with quatrefoil device above, define a dropped section of the cill below, with a simple raised pointed light each side.

25|$|On {{the east}} {{face of the}} tower there are three carved crests under a <b>hood</b> <b>mould.</b> Although they are not clearly interpretable, the upper two are almost {{certainly}} those of the king of France and the Abbey of Saint-André. The third crest, which has {{what appears to be}} an oblique row of three roses, is probably that of Pope Clement VI who purchased the town of Avignon from Joanna I of Naples in 1348.|$|E

25|$|A string-course runs {{between the}} tower lower and belfry stages. Each belfry side {{contains}} a pointed arch opening of same style {{surrounded by a}} <b>hood</b> <b>mould.</b> A straight reveal leads to a louvered twin-light window with trefoiled ogee head, and a quatrefoil device above. The south belfry window also contains the tower clock: circular, blue, with gold numerals and hands. The tower parapet is embattled with a pinnacle at each corner. It projects slightly at the eaves and contains one gargoyle each side offset to the right.|$|E
25|$|The south aisle {{south and}} west windows reflect {{completely}} the style and date {{of those in the}} north aisle. Attached to the south aisle, and opposite the porch on the north, is a 19th-century gabled vestry—not evident in an 1806 plan—partly set behind a wall and iron fence enclosure.

25|$|The {{tower is}} of three stages. The lower stages might {{be part of}} an 11th-century {{previously}} unbuttressed tower, and contains at its west side an early 15th-century chamfered reveal window opening with pointed arch surrounded by a <b>hood</b> <b>mould</b> with label stops in human form.

A church clock is just below the belfry stage. Between the window and clock is a hooded slit window, a repeat slit window is on the north and south sides. The Belfry stage was added in the 13th century and is defined at its base by a string course with repeating dentils. Central to each side of the belfry stage is a chamfered window opening with a plain <b>hood</b> <b>mould</b> following a semi-circular head. Within the opening are louvered and pointed twin-lights, these separated by a central octagonal shaft with a trefoil opening above in the north and south windows. The roof line is defined by a further string course with repeated grotesque bosses, and pairs of gargoyle drains on each side. An embattled roof parapet with crocketed corner pinnacles sits above. The tower is partially clasped at the north and south by the church aisles, and on the north side by an ashlar three-stepped angled buttress against the lower stages.|$|E

There are five windows: one at the east end; one at the west end; and three at the south with two of these at the west separated by the church porch. The east window is of concave chamfered intersecting 'Y' tracery, creating three lights set within a chamfered pointed arch with <b>hood</b> <b>mould.</b> The west window is similar, but narrower, and of two lights.
