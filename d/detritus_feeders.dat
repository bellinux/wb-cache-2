50|$|A {{characteristic}} type of {{food chain}} called the detritus cycle takes place involving <b>detritus</b> <b>feeders</b> (detritivores), detritus and the microorganisms that multiply on it. For example, mud flats are inhabited by many univalves which are <b>detritus</b> <b>feeders,</b> such as moon shells. When these <b>detritus</b> <b>feeders</b> take in detritus with microorganisms multiplying on it, they mainly {{break down and}} absorb the microorganisms, which are rich in proteins, and excrete the detritus, which is mostly complex carbohydrates, having hardly broken it down at all. At first this dung is a poor source of nutrition, and so univalves {{pay no attention to}} it, but after several days, microorganisms begin to multiply on it again, its nutritional balance improves, and so they eat it again. Through this process of eating the detritus many times over and harvesting the microorganisms from it, the detritus thins out, becomes fractured and becomes easier for the microorganisms to use, and so the complex carbohydrates are also steadily broken down and disappear over time.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that {{biological}} introductions can affect invaded habitats. The global extent of these impacts is, however, {{a matter of}} continuous discussion. The invasive isopod Cirolana harfordi is found in great abundances in oyster-beds in Australia. This species {{is reported to be}} a <b>detritus</b> <b>feeder,</b> a scavenger and a predator in its native range. Therefore, a major concern for managers {{is the extent to which}} this species impacts local habitats and the identification of the mechanisms driving its invasion. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of C. harfordi on the invaded habitat and the characteristics of the invaded habitat that affect its colonisation. As a predator, C. harfordi may affect resident assemblages. Observational and manipulative studies showed no evidence of impacts of C. harfordi on the assemblage. In addition, as a scavenger and a <b>detritus</b> <b>feeder,</b> C. harfordi may affect the amounts of organic matter. Observational studies showed no significant relationships between densities of C. harfordi and accumulated organic matter. Colonisation of oyster-beds by C. harfordi can be affected by the habitat provider and/or the receiving assemblage. To examine the effects of architectural vs. biological characteristics of oysters, a field experiment examining colonisation of different types of experimental oyster-beds by C. harfordi was done. Colonisation by C. harfordi showed no significant differences between treatments, but a trend suggesting facilitation by the chemical composition of the oysters was observed. A mesocosm experiment evaluating the effect of the receiving assemblage on colonisation by C. harfordi suggested that organisms in the receiving assemblage are facilitating and resisting the colonisation by C. harfordi at the same time. The results of this study provide information on the ecological processes affecting community assembly and are crucial to design efficient management strategies for C. harfordi.

50|$|The diet of {{gastropods}} differs {{according to}} the group considered. Marine gastropods include some that are herbivores, <b>detritus</b> <b>feeders,</b> predatory carnivores, scavengers, parasites, and also a few ciliary feeders, in which the radula is reduced or absent. Land-dwelling species can chew up leaves, bark, fruit and decomposing animals while marine species can scrape algae off the rocks on the sea floor. In some species that have evolved into endoparasites, such as the eulimid Thyonicola doglieli, many of the standard gastropod features are strongly reduced or absent.|$|E
5000|$|Detritivores, {{also known}} as detrivores, detritophages, <b>{{detritus}}</b> <b>feeders,</b> or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably.|$|E

40|$|The {{seasonal}} population structure (copepodite- 2 stage through adults) and diel vertical migration pattern of Scolecithricella minor in Toyama Bay, southern Japan Sea, were investigated. Eggs and nauplii were reared {{in the laboratory}} at three different temperatures (0. 5, 5 and 10 °C) as a basis to estimate generation length. Most copepodite stages occurred throughout the year; young copepodites (C 2 to C 5) were most abundant in May-October, while adults were most abundant in March-August. Reproduction continued throughout the year, with a peak in April-August. All copepodite stages were consistently distributed at 100 - 400 m depth. Limited nocturnal ascent was seen in adults, but not always for younger copepodites. Based on habitat temperature, development times of eggs and nauplii expressed {{as a function of}} temperature, and assumed proportion of these developmental times in one life cycle of calanoid copepods, the generation length of S. minor was estimated to be 44 - 76 d. Using this estimated generation length range as a guide, the sequential development of five cohorts was identified. An additional two extra cohorts, which were not clearly traceable, are considered to have occurred for a total of 7 cohorts per year for S. minor in Toyama Bay. The present data on the vertical distribution of S. minor are compared with those reported from other regions for the same species. Since S. minor {{is considered to be a}} typical <b>detritus</b> <b>feeder,</b> trophic-type-related sequences in major reproduction seasons are discussed by comparing the data of other calanoid copepods reported from Toyama Bay...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{introductions}} {{can alter}} the ecology of local assemblages and are an important driver of global environmental change. The first step towards understanding {{the impact of a}} non-indigenous species is to study its distribution and associations in the invaded area. In Sydney Harbour, the non-indigenous isopod Cirolana harfordi has been reported in densities up to 0. 5 individuals per cm(2) in mussel-beds. Abundances of this species have, however, been largely overlooked in other key habitats. The first aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the abundances and distribution of C. harfordi across different habitats representative of Sydney Harbour. Results showed that C. harfordi occurred in oyster and mussel-beds, being particularly abundant in oyster-beds. We also aimed to determine the role of C. harfordi as a predator, scavenger and <b>detritus</b> <b>feeder</b> by investigating the relationships between densities of C. harfordi and (i) the structure of the resident assemblages, and (ii) deposited organic matter in oyster-beds. Densities of C. harfordi were not related to the structure of the assemblages, nor amounts of deposited organic matter. These findings suggested little or no ecological impacts of C. harfordi in oyster-beds. These relationships may, however, affect other variables such as growth of individuals, or be disguised by high variability of assemblages among different locations. Future studies should, therefore, test the impacts of C. harfordi on the size of organisms in the assemblage and use manipulative experiments to control for spatial variation. This study is the first published work on the ecology of the invasion of C. harfordi and provides the starting-point for the study of the impacts of this species in Sydney Harbour...|$|R
50|$|Evidence {{of early}} {{terrestrial}} animal life had, until this discovery, been {{found only in}} northern Pangaea or Laurasia, currently comprising North America and Asia. Some 416 million {{years ago at the}} end of the Silurian period and during the Devonian period, primitive insects of Laurasia were being preyed upon by early scorpions and spiders, whose ancestors had also come from aquatic and marine environments. Initial life on Earth was restricted to marine environments and migration onto land at first was confined to plants, which evolved into relatively complex organisms during the Devonian period. This plant colonisation was followed by plant and <b>detritus</b> <b>feeders</b> such as primitive insects and millipedes. With the Carboniferous period, early vertebrates emerged from the water and were feeding on the invertebrates already there.|$|E
5000|$|Exploited - {{the second}} phase. Exploited is the phase we are {{currently}} in. It is characterized by declines in the biomass of large predator fish, declines in the diversity, size and trophic level of captured fish, and declines in the benthos. Bottom trawlers progressively destroy the biogenic structures built over many years on the seafloor by the filter and <b>detritus</b> <b>feeders.</b> As these structures and animals that were filtering the phytoplankton and consuming the detritus (marine snow) disappear, they are replaced with the polyp stages of jellyfish and other small errant benthic animals. Storms resuspend the marine snow, and the water column gradually eutrophies. In {{the early part of}} this phase, cascade effects compensate these declines with the emergence of new fisheries for opportunistic feeders, such as squid, shrimp and other invertebrates. But eventually this decline also.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in the study on vertical partitioning, ontogenetic vertical migration and life cycles of meso- and bathypelagic copepods in the western subarctic Pacific is reviewed {{from the viewpoint of}} prey-predator interactions. Gaidius variabilis and Pleuromamma scutullata are particle feeders, and their spawning seasons were well synchronized with that of the phytoplankton bloom. Judging from their vertical distribution depth (G. variabilis; 600 - 1500 m, P. scutullata; 200 - 600 m), it is suggested that they are depending on directly sinking particles from the euphotic zone. Scolecithricella minor is known to be a <b>detritus</b> <b>feeder,</b> and their reproduction/active growth season was closely associated with high abundance of appendicularians. It implies that discarded 'house' of appendicularians is a major food source for S. minor. As a typical carnivore, Heterorhabdus tanneri is characterized by intermolt growth of young copepodids being 3 times greater than those of other species, and they achieve a langeorganicmatter deposition during high the abundance season of their potential food (other zooplankton). The vertical distribution of congener species is never overlapped. In the subarctic Pacific, four Metridia spp. and three Paraeuchaeta spp. are predominant. For Metridia species, M pacifica distributed mainly at 0 - 250 m, M okhotensis at 250 - 1000 m, M asymmetrica at 1000 - 2000 m and M curticauda at > 2000 m depths. For Paraeuchaeta, P. elongata was at 0 - 500 m, P. birostrata at 250 - 1000 m and P. rubra at 500 - 2000 m depths. Since feeding modes of congener species are similar, vertical partitioning of their habitats within the genus is advantageous to reduce feeding competition between the species. The ontogenetic vertical migration patterns of meso- and bathypelagic copepods are characterized by developmental ascent. In the subarctic Pacific, three Paraeuchaeta species, Gaidius variabilis and Metridia asymmetrica exhibited the ontogenetic vertical migration pattern. Since their lifetime fecundity is low, starting the early life at depth is advantageous to reduce their predation mortalities. This explanation appears to be consistent with the observation that the fecundity of these copepods decreases with increasing depth. At the same time, developmental ascent is considered to be advantageous to achieve better growth in food-rich upper layers...|$|R
40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{determined the}} impact of food source type on turnover rate and trophic enrichment factors (TEFs or ∆) of δ 13 C and δ 15 N, {{as well as on}} respiration rate, in captive populations of the marine amphipod Gammarus aequicauda. Gammarus aequicauda (318 individuals) were fed ad libitum with three food sources animal, algae, and dead Posidonia oceanica leaves (also called “litter”), varying in palatability, digestibility, nutritional qualities and isotopic compositions, for between four and six weeks in a controlled feeding experiment. The resulting death rate was lower for the amphipods fed with animal treatment (30. 9 %) than for individuals fed with algal (65. 9 %) or litter treatment (64. 4 %), indicating a better fitness of the individuals fed with the animal food source. Respiration rates also differed highly among the treatments. Animal treatment showed higher respiration rates than algal and litter treatments, potentially due to the toxicity of the algae and the very low nutritional quality of the litter. Amphipods fed with these treatments might have entered in a “low activity state” to cope with these unsuitable food sources, inducing low respiration rates. Due to the very low assimilation and toxicity of the algae source, turnover rate for δ 13 C was impossible to determine. Turnover rate for δ 13 C was much faster (half-life = 12. 55 days) for amphipods fed with the animal food source than for amphipods fed with litter (half-life = 51. 62 days), showing the faster assimilation of the most nutritionally optimal food sources by G. aequicauda. Turnover for δ 15 N was impossible to determine because the amphipods were already at isotopic equilibrium {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. Despite the <b>detritus</b> <b>feeder</b> status of Gammarus aequicauda, TEFs for the animal treatments were in accordance with values generally found for carnivorous organisms (∆ 13 C = 0. 9 ± 0. 7 ‰; ∆ 15 N = 2. 9 ± 0. 6 ‰). TEFs for the litter treatment were in accordance with values generally corresponding to detritivorous organisms (∆ 13 C = 1. 2 ‰; ∆ 15 N = 1. 0 ± 0. 4 ‰). SIAR mixing model outputs obtained with these new TEF values were more constrained and coherent than outputs obtained with general literature TEFs. This study thus demonstrated the non-negligible impact of the food source on Gammarus aequicauda physiological status, fitness and turnover rates, but also on TEFs—highlighting the importance of TEF experimental calculations for every potential food source of a given organism to ensure more robust isotopic data interpretation.

Additionally, by comparing the taxonomic resolution reached in live versus fossil chironomid studies in this lake, we appraised the general information content of African fossil chironomid assemblages and, therefore, the quality of African chironomid-based palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.
