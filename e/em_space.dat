25|$|Historical style guides {{before the}} 20th century {{typically}} indicated that wider spaces {{were to be}} used between sentences. Standard word spaces were about one-third of an <b>em</b> <b>space,</b> but sentences were to be divided by a full em-space. With {{the arrival of the}} typewriter in the late 19th century, style guides for writers began diverging from printer's manuals, indicating that writers should double-space between sentences. This held for most of the 20th century until the computer began replacing the typewriter as the primary means of creating text. In the 1990s, style guides reverted to recommending a single-space between sentences. However, instead of a slightly larger sentence space, style guides simply indicated a standard word space. This is now the convention for publishers.|$|E

50|$|Sentence spacing {{in digital}} media is the {{horizontal}} space between sentences in computer and web-based media. Digital media allow sentence spacing variations not {{possible with the}} typewriter. Most digital fonts {{permit the use of}} a variable space or a no-break space. Some modern font specifications, such as OpenType, have the ability to automatically add or reduce space after punctuation, and users may be able to choose sentence spacing variations. Modern fonts that allow spacing variations will allow the average user the ability to easily manipulate the following spaces: non-breaking short spaces (thin spaces), non-breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), and breaking long <b>spaces</b> (<b>em</b> <b>spaces).</b>|$|R

The official 1959 Style Manual specifically prescribed double spaces after concluding punctuation. It indicated that sentences should use the <b>em</b> <b>space</b> evenly when typeset, defining a double-space as a synonym for an <b>em</b> <b>space.</b> The 1967 edition, however, states that [...] "to conform with trade practice, a single justification space (close spacing) will be used between sentences." ...|$|E
50|$|Other large {{compartments}} in the California job case hold spaces used {{to separate}} words or {{to fill out}} lines of type, including em and en spaces. An <b>em</b> <b>space</b> is {{the width of the}} point size of the type (i.e., as wide as it is high); an en space is half that width (i.e., half as wide as it is high; in most types, the numerals are the same width as an en space, to allow easy alignment of numerical data in columns). Typically, a 3-to-em space is used between words (three of these spaces placed side by side are the width of an <b>em</b> <b>space).</b>|$|E

25|$|The en dash – {{always with}} spaces in running text when, as {{discussed}} in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause – and the <b>spaced</b> <b>em</b> dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support full justification. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the not <b>spaced</b> <b>em</b> dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated {{by the use of}} thin spaces, hair spaces, or even zero-width spaces {{on the sides of the}} em dash. This provides the appearance of a not <b>spaced</b> <b>em</b> dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The <b>spaced</b> <b>em</b> dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.|$|R

50|$|Early style {{guides for}} {{typesetting}} used a wider space between sentences than between words—"traditional spacing", {{as shown in}} the illustration to the right. During the 20th century, style guides commonly mandated two spaces between sentences for typewritten manuscripts, which were used prior to professionally typesetting the work. As computer desktop publishing became commonplace, typewritten manuscripts became less relevant and most style guides stopped making distinctions between manuscripts and final typeset products. In the same period, style guides began changing their guidance on sentence spacing. The 1969 edition of the Chicago Manual of Style used <b>em</b> <b>spaces</b> between sentences in its text; by the 2003 edition it had changed to single sentence spacing for both manuscript and print.

5000|$|The {{names of}} the letters are rarely spelled out, except when used in derivations or {{compound}} words (for example tee-shirt, deejay, emcee, okay, aitchless, etc.), derived forms (for example exed out, effing, to eff and blind, etc.), and {{in the names of}} objects named after letters (for example <b>em</b> (<b>space)</b> in printing and wye (junction) in railroading). The forms listed below are from the Oxford English Dictionary. Vowels stand for themselves, and consonants usually have the form consonant + ee or e + consonant (e.g. bee and ef). The exceptions are the letters aitch, jay, kay, cue, ar, ess (but es- in compounds [...] ), double u, wye, and zed. Plurals of consonants end in -s (bees, efs, ems) or, in the cases of aitch, ess, and ex, in -es (aitches, esses, exes). Plurals of vowels end in -es (aes, ees, ies, oes, ues); these are rare. All letters may stand for themselves, generally in capitalized form (okay or OK, emcee or MC), and plurals may be based on these (aes or As, cees or Cs, etc.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Variations in the {{operational}} definitions {{of how to}} count the words can occur (namely, what [...] "counts as" [...] a word, and which words [...] "don't count" [...] toward the total). However, especially {{since the advent of}} widespread word processing, there is a broad consensus on these operational definitions (and hence the bottom-line integer result). The consensus is to accept the text segmentation rules generally found in most word processing software (including how word boundaries are determined, which depends on how word dividers are defined). The first trait of that definition is that a space (any of various whitespace characters, such as a [...] "regular" [...] word space, an <b>em</b> <b>space,</b> or a tab character) is a word divider. Usually a hyphen or a slash is, too. Different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the text segmentation rule details, and on whether words outside the main text (such as footnotes, endnotes, or hidden text) are counted. But the behavior of most major word processing applications is broadly similar.|$|E

40|$|Metasurfaces offered great {{opportunities}} to control electromagnetic (EM) waves, but currently available meta-devices typically work either in pure reflection or pure transmission mode, leaving half of <b>EM</b> <b>space</b> completely unexplored. Here, we propose {{a new type}} of metasurface, composed by specifically designed meta-atoms with polarization-dependent transmission and reflection properties, to efficiently manipulate EM waves in the full space. As a proof of concept, three microwave meta-devices are designed, fabricated and experimentally characterized. The first two can bend or focus EM waves at different sides (i. e., transmission/reflection sides) of the metasurfaces depending on the incident polarization, while the third one changes from a wave bender for reflected wave to a focusing lens for transmitted wave as the excitation polarization is rotated, with all these functionalities exhibiting very high efficiencies (in the range of 85 %- 91 %). Our findings significantly expand the capabilities of metasurfaces in controlling EM waves, and can stimulate high-performance multi-functional meta-devices facing more challenging and diversified application demands.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the potential of}} the four-image spectral endmember (<b>EM)</b> <b>space</b> comprising sand (SL), green vegetation (GV), saline land (SA), and dark materials (DA), unmixed from Landsat TM/ETM+ to map dryland agricultural soil alkalinity and salinity (i. e., soil alkalinity (pH) and soil electrical conductivity (EC)) in the shallow root zone (0 – 20 cm) using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and an artificial neural network (ANN). The results reveal that SA, SL, and GV fractions at the subpixel level, and land surface temperature (LST) are necessary independent variables for soil EC modeling in Minqin Oasis, a temperate-arid system in China. The R 2 (coefficient of determination) of the optimized parameters with the ANN model was 0. 79, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0. 13, and the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) was 1. 95 when evaluated against all sampled data. In addition to the aforementioned four variables, the DA fraction and the recent historical SA fraction (SAH) in the spring dry season in 2008 were also helpful for soil pH modeling. The model performance is R 2 = 0. 76, RMSE = 0. 24, and RPD = 1. 96 for all sampled data. In summary, the stable EMs and LST space of TM imagery with an ANN approach can generate near-real-time regional soil alkalinity and salinity estimations in the cropping period. This is the case even in the critical agronomic range (EC of 0 – 20 dS·m− 1 and pH of 7 – 9) at which researchers and policy-makers require near-real-time crop management information...|$|E
