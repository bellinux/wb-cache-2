40|$|How can {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) advance cognitive theory? Some have argued that fMRI can do little beyond localizing brain regions that carry out certain cognitive functions (and may not even be able to do that). However, in this article, we argue that fMRI can inform theories of cognition by helping to answer at least four distinct kinds of questions. Which mental functions are performed in brain regions specialized for just that function (and which are performed in more <b>general-purpose</b> brain <b>machinery)</b> ? When fMRI markers of a particular Mental Process X are found, is Mental Process X engaged when people perform Task Y? How distinct are the representations of different stimulus classes? Do specific pairs of tasks engage common or distinct processing mechanisms? Thus, fMRI data can be used to address theoretical debates {{that have nothing to do}} with where in the brain a particular process is carried out...|$|R
40|$|Before {{the modern}} {{computing}} era, the word `computers' referred {{to human beings}} as living calculators [...] -in fact, still Turing (1950) proposed his test for A. I. referring to `computing machinery', not `computers'. From the advent of general-purpose, Turing-complete machines the relation between operators, programmers and users with computers [...] -inforgs, in Floridi's terms [...] -can be seen in terms of levels of abstraction (LoA) (Floridi 2010, 2008). For example, the modern concept of `operating system' (Donovan 1974) by Ken Thompson from Multics to Unix {{can be seen as}} a level of abstraction: some computational tasks are hidden in an abstract machine put into the computer system so that humans can forget it instead of manually perform the task as living operators: information got hidden, without being lost. In this paper an analysis of LoA throughout history is proposed, in order to find the minimal number of LoAs needed to explain the epistemology of informational organisms (inforgs) [...] -from early modern <b>general-purpose</b> computing <b>machineries</b> until the so-called `cloud computing'. This epistemological levellism uses Category Theory as the methodological reference, treating information as structure-preserving functions instead of Cartesian products, i. e., a domain mapped into a codomain where the inner structure is preserved; a comparison with the method of LoA by Floridi (2008) is then proposed...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} on probabilistic modeling and statistical learning, {{coupled with the}} availability of large training datasets, has led to remarkable progress in computer vision. Generative probabilistic models, or “analysis-by-synthesis” approaches, can capture rich scene structure but have been less widely applied than their discriminative counterparts, as they often require considerable problem-specific engineering in modeling and inference, and inference is typically seen as requiring slow, hypothesize-and-test Monte Carlo methods. Here we present Picture, a probabilistic programming language for scene understanding that allows researchers to express complex generative vision models, while automatically solving them using fast <b>general-purpose</b> inference <b>machinery.</b> Picture provides a stochastic scene language that can express generative models for arbitrary 2 D/ 3 D scenes, {{as well as a}} hierarchy of representation layers for comparing scene hypotheses with observed images by matching not simply pixels, but also more abstract features (e. g., contours, deep neural network activations). Inference can flexibly integrate advanced Monte Carlo strategies with fast bottom-up data-driven methods. Thus both representations and inference strategies can build directly on progress in discriminatively trained systems to make generative vision more robust and efficient. We use Picture to write programs for 3 D face analysis, 3 D human pose estimation, and 3 D object reconstruction – each competitive with specially engineered baselines. Norman B.

30|$|Secondly, {{although}} the overall benefits to Taiwan from TPP membership would outweigh the overall negative impact, the benefits {{will not be}} evenly distributed. Estimates compiled by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) that were cited in the United Daily News in 2015 (see also Table  1 in this paper) indicate that the industries that would benefit most from TPP membership are the man-made fiber, textile-weaving and oil-refining industries. By contrast, TPP membership would have a pronounced negative impact on Taiwan’s semiconductor, <b>general-purpose</b> <b>machinery</b> and other machinery-related industries. In addition, the agricultural and processing sectors, and various service industries oriented towards the domestic market, will also be negatively affected.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to increase}} the academic debate on which indicators and approaches capture more appropriately the phenomenon of economic clustering (see, for instance, Arbia & Piras, 2007). A composite measure is proposed combining discrete and continuous space indicators {{in order to identify}} spatial localization more effectively as proposed by several authors such as Arbia (2001), Guillain and Le Gallo (2007), and Sohn (2004). The paper is devoted to unfolding the localization patterns of employment within three-digit manufacturing industries by Italian provinces in 2007 employing the location quotient, the locational Gini, the global Moran’s I, and the local indicator of spatial associations since they provide complementary information (see, for instance, Guillain & Le Gallo, 2007). Evidence shows that the manufacture of military fighting vehicles has the highest localization with almost full concentration; whereas the industry of other <b>general-purpose</b> <b>machinery</b> holds the highest global Moran’s I. Moreover, the five three-digit industries within the two-digit manufacture of machinery and equipment n. e. c. show a relatively high global autocorrelation and concentration. It emerged that these five three-digit medium-high technology intensity industries showed numerous hot-spots clusters in the North of Italy, whereas the South of Italy and Islands were characterized by low-low values associationsa mong Italian provinces in 2007...|$|E
40|$|Is {{visual cortex}} {{made up of}} <b>general-purpose</b> {{information}} processing <b>machinery,</b> or does it consist {{of a collection of}} specialized modules? If prior knowledge, acquired from learning a set of objects is only transferable to new objects that share properties with the old, then the recognition system’s optimal organization must be one containing specialized modules for different object classes. Our analysis starts from a premise we call the invariance hypothesis: that the computational goal of the ventral stream is to compute an invariant-to-transformations and discriminative signature for recognition. The key condition enabling approximate transfer of invariance without sacrificing discriminability turns out to be that the learned and novel objects transform similarly. This implies that the optimal recognition system must contain subsystems trained only with data from similarly-transforming objects and suggests a novel interpretation of domain-specific regions like the fusiform face area (FFA). Furthermore, we can define an index of transformation-compatibility, computable from videos, that can be combined with information about the statistics of natural vision to yield predictions for which object categories ought to have domain-specific regions in agreement with the available data. The result is a unifying account linking the large literature on view-based recognition with the wealth of experimental evidence concerning domain-specific regions. National Science Foundation (U.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is {{research}} and development concerning a fatigue tester of shock absorber seal systems. Design/methodology/approach: Analytical approach {{has been applied to}} get an understanding of a heat exchange process. The mathematical model has been formulated and validated based on the available measurements. Numerical simulation has been carried out to illustrate a heat exchange process performance. Findings: It is possible to control a seal temperature and mechanical friction related to the rod movement into the seal at the specified velocity. The model accuracy is sufficient to perform sensitivity analysis and optimize the design. Research limitations/implications: The components of a fatigue tester have to withstand the significant temperature differences in the range  30; + 140 ˚C, e. g. hydraulic hoses, fittings, and pumps. Practical implications: We combine the analytical and experimental approach to provide customized and reliable engineering solution in the area of damper component seal development. A typical seal has a lip-like design protecting the moving parts against the leakage. It can be tested in a shock absorber or externally with use of a customized test rigs. Seal tests inside a shock absorber have numerous disadvantages. A shock absorber temperature rises during longer tests and cooling phase is required. This dramatically increases tests duration performed with the use of an expensive <b>general-purpose</b> hydraulic testing <b>machinery.</b> A compressed air or water jacket is used to accelerate the cooling process. Nevertheless, there are limitations related to the physics behind the cooling process. A seal component fatigue tester allows to perform the seal component tests out of the shock absorber. Originality/value: A new testing method provides possibility to quantify the main contributors of seal usage...|$|R
40|$|Transaction delegation, as {{introduced}} in ACTA, allows a transaction to transfer {{responsibility for the}} operations that it has performed on an object to another transaction. Delegation {{can be used to}} broaden the visibility of the delegatee, and to tailor the recovery properties of a transaction model. Delegation {{has been shown to be}} useful in synthesizing Advanced Transaction Models. Withan efficient implementationof delegation it becomes practicable to realize various Advanced Transaction Models whose requirements are specified at a high level language instead of the current expensive practice of building them from scratch. In this paper we identify the issues in efficiently supporting delegation and hence advanced transaction models, and illustrate this with our solution in ARIES, an industrial-quality system that uses UNDO/REDO recovery. Since delegation is tantamount to rewriting history, a naïve implementationcan entail frequent, costly log accesses, and can result in complicated recovery protocols. Our algorithm achieves the effect of rewriting history without rewriting the log, resulting in an implementation that realizes the semantics of delegation at minimal additionaloverhead and incurs no overhead when delegation is not used. Our work indicates that it is feasible to build efficient and robust, <b>general-purpose</b> <b>machinery</b> for Advanced Transaction Models. It also leads toward making recovery a firstclass concept within Advanced Transaction Models. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{transaction}} delegation, as introduced in ACTA, {{has been shown}} to be useful in synthesizing Extended Transaction Models. Delegation allows a transaction to transfer responsibilityover an object, and its operations, to another transaction. Delegation can be used to broaden the visibilityofthe delegatee, and to tailor the recovery properties of a transaction model. The broadening of visibilityisuseful in allowing a delegator to selectively maketentative and partial results, as well as hints suchascoordination information, accessible to other transactions. The control of the recovery makes it possible to decouple the fate of an update from that of the transaction that made the updates# for instance, a transaction may delegate some operations that will remain uncommitted but valid after the delegator transaction aborted. In this paper, weshowhowtoimplementdelegation in the context of ARIES, arobust recovery algorithm for industrial-strength transaction management systems. The resulting version of ARIES is called ARIES/RH since delegation is tantamounttoRewriting History. The modifications to ARIES are non trivial but small enough to efficiently support delegation. Although a naiveimplementation of delegation would entail frequentand costly log accesses, our careful design has minimal cost during normal processing and involves only constant-time operations, and some stable storage access overhead, during recovery. With our implementation of delegation, we suggest it is feasible to build efficient, robust, industrial-quality <b>general-purpose</b> <b>machinery</b> for Extended Transaction Models.

40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{difference}} between US and European manufacturing {{before and during the}} World War II, focusing on the key technology in the metal-working sector: machine tools. We present a new data set covering the installed capacity of metal-working tools in the United States and Germany for the period 1930 - 1945. The existing literature is heavily dependent on assumptions about the different type of machine tools in use {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. So far, systematic comparison has been limited to case studies. This is the first attempt to quantify the differences in this key technology for the entirety of metal-working in both economies. The enormous detail of the statistical sources we have uncovered allows us to combine aggregation and a degree of specificity, which exceeds that of any previous case study. In the German case, the original data is divided into well over a hundred sub-categories. For comparative purposes, we have identified 19 major classes of machines, which aggregate over 50 sub-categories. Our results suggest the need for a far more nuanced understanding of metal-working than the dichotomous picture of American mass manufacture, reliant on special-purpose tools, and European craft manufacturing employing <b>general-purpose</b> <b>machinery.</b> For 1930, we find a remarkable similarity in machine to worker ratios between Germany and the United States. There are differences in certain key areas. However, the US stock of metal-working tools is not yet distinguished by a clear commitment to mass production technology. For the period after 1935, until the early 1940 s, our data suggest a remarkable degree of convergence. The American stock stagnated. In some areas, there was disinvestment. And the average age of machinery rose dramatically. By contrast, Germany entered a period of rapid catch-up, which appears to have continued into the early years of the war. By 1940, German metal-working came close to matching its American counterpart in terms of the number of workers employed and the quantity and types of machines installed. German machines were, on average, far younger. This process of catching-up, however, was dramatically reversed during World War II. Over a period of no more than four years the American stock expanded by over eighty percent and growth was markedly concentrated in key categories of mass production equipment. It appears that it was only in this period that mass production machinery came to truly dominate US metal-working. German investment, albeit moving in the same direction, failed to match the new intensity of American commitment to mass production in some key machinery classe...|$|E
