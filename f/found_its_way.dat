Neubronner's mobile dovecote <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were {{used on a}} larger scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E
5|$|The Reserve Bank issued Special Agro (Agricultural) cheques from 15 May to 31 July 2008. Although of a {{different}} design and with the intention for use only by farmers, it had <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into regular use because of the parallel functions with bearer Cheques and the exponential rise of food prices. Following the 2008 currency reform, Agro and bearer cheques were phased out on 1 January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one-two with Michael Evans, but his first touch let him down and the opportunity was not taken. Darlington's main threat was coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E

50|$|The Maidan {{was where}} the Shah and the people met. Built as a two story row of shops, flanked by {{impressive}} architecture, and eventually {{leading up to the}} northern end, where the Imperial Bazaar was situated, the square was a busy arena of entertainment and business, exchanged between people from all corners of the world. As Isfahan was a vital stop along the Silk Road, goods from all the civilized countries of the world, spanning from Portugal in the West, to the Middle Kingdom in the East, <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>ways</b> to the hands of gifted merchants, who knew how to make the best profits out of them.|$|R
5000|$|Tubi 60 is most {{commonly}} {{served as a}} shot or a shooter. Upon its arrival to export markets, it <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>ways</b> into cocktails. Co-founder Hilal Tubi has been quoted to say that [...] "The benefits of serving Tubi are such that if you mix it with other alcohols you are lessening its positive effects and increasing the likelihood of having a hangover, {{which is one of}} the best reasons to drink Tubi as it was designed”. It can also be consumed as part of a cocktail, adding juices or other non-alcoholic mixers. Tubi and Tonic or Tubi and Soda has become quite popular, as well as TubiLibre’s - Tubi 60 mixed with Coca-Cola.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} by Paul I {{to play down}} Potemkin's role in Russian history, his name <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into numerous items of common parlance. The phrase Potemkin village entered common usage in Russia and globally, despite its fictional origin. A century after Potemkin's death, the Battleship Potemkin was named in his honour. The ship became famous for its involvement in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and subsequent dramatization in The Battleship Potemkin, a Soviet movie by Sergey Eisenstein, which at one point was named the greatest film of all time. The name of the giant seaside staircase in Odessa, featured in the movie, eventually {{became known as the}} Potemkin Stairs.|$|E
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked {{out of the window}} and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it.|$|E

50|$|The quartet's early {{style was}} very much similar to Mills Brothers's, with jazz and swing vocal arrangements. The group then <b>found</b> <b>its</b> own <b>way</b> with a {{combination}} of songs and entertainment: catchy tunes with funny lyrics yet with sophisticated arrangements, performed in comedy acts. The audience loved that, and Quartetto Cetra soon became very popular at first on the radio, then on stage and on the TV as well.|$|R

One of the focuses {{of his work}} at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary of Plant Names and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed a revision of his original Epimedium monograph.|$|E
5|$|Historian Luis Alberto Sánchez writes that, after Morris {{closed his}} bar, {{some of his}} {{bartender}}s left to work in other locales. Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby Grand Hotel Maury, where he continued to serve his pisco sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the pisco sour. As other former apprentices of Morris found other work, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into California, reaching bars {{as far north as}} the city of San Francisco. By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to New York.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August 1941, Berryman became Brigadier, General Staff (chief of staff) of I Corps under Lieutenant General John Lavarack, {{again in}} {{succession}} to Rowell, who became Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS). Berryman arrived in Jakarta by air with the advanced party of the I Corps headquarters staff on 26 January 1942 to plan its defence. Berryman reconnoitred Java and prepared {{an appreciation of the}} situation. Berryman also attempted to find out as much as possible about Japanese tactics through interviewing Colonel Ian MacAlister Stewart. This information <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into papers circulated throughout the Army in Australia. It soon became apparent that the situation was hopeless and any troops committed to the defence of Java would be lost.|$|E

5|$|Anfield hosted Manchester City in {{the fifth}} round. It {{was the start of}} a decisive week for Liverpool, as they faced Roma midweek in the UEFA Cup, then Birmingham City in the 2001 Football League Cup Final. Liverpool were awarded a penalty after five minutes, as goalkeeper Nicky Weaver fouled Vladimír Šmicer inside the 18-yard box. Jari Litmanen {{converted}} the spot kick to give Liverpool the lead, which quickly became 2–0 when Heskey's shot <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> past Weaver. Andrei Kanchelskis' goal in the 28th minute halved the scoreline, but Šmicer and Markus Babbel each scored in the second half to put Liverpool in a commanding lead. City persisted and in stoppage time scored their second goal of the match; Shaun Goater's deflected shot did enough to beat goalkeeper Sander Westerveld.|$|E

However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid {{in the history of the}} state. The final demo, completed in 1988, was named The Treehouse Tapes and <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band Soundgarden. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records' A representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Ienner.

5|$|Material {{assigned}} to Plateosaurus {{has been found}} at over 50 localities in Germany (mainly along the Neckar and Pegnitz river valleys), Switzerland (Frick) and France. Three localities are of special importance, because they yielded specimens in large numbers and of unusually good quality: near Halberstadt in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany; Trossingen in Baden-Württemberg, Germany; and Frick. Between the 1910s and 1930s, excavations in a clay pit in Saxony-Anhalt revealed between 39 and 50 skeletons that belonged to Plateosaurus, along with teeth and {{a small number of}} bones of the theropod Liliensternus, and two skeletons and some fragments of the turtle Proganochelys. Some of the plateosaur material was {{assigned to}} P.longiceps, a species described by palaeontologist Otto Jaekel in 1914 but now considered a junior synonym of P.engelhardti. Most of the material <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, where much of it was destroyed during World War II. The Halberstadt quarry today is covered by a housing development.|$|E
30|$|The fourth Kondratieff cycle saw {{the advent}} of the T-Model Ford and the entire auto industry, {{strengthened}} by the growth of the petrochemical industry. Much of the increase in labour productivity in this period derived from this development. Ford’s idea of factory organization represented a novel idea of the way a company should be led like a highly performing machine. The fourth wave, with long period of cheap oil and stable economy, collapsed with the oil crisis of the early 1970 s. At the same time, however, certain key innovations saw daylight, such as the microprocessor, which ushered in the fifth wave. The first microcomputer was built in a garage in California, and a little later the first wireless NMT telephone network was set up in the Finnish archipelago. In the years that followed, these basic innovations were developed and refined and distributed around the globe, creating entire branches of new industry. As this new technology <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>ways</b> gradually to every corner of human life, it brought gradually forward a new idea of a more distributed power and intelligence. Yet, as we observe in this article, leadership mostly remained centrally organized and shareholder value creation most often represented the highest goal for business.|$|R
5000|$|From {{this point}} of view {{globalization}} and Westernization are no longer counterparts. Islamist movements are themselves the driving forces behind globalization [...] influencing its direction and final outcome. Probably {{one of the most important}} outcomes of this process has been the creation of a standard understanding for what the words “Islam” and “Islamic” mean. Prior to the changes that accompanied globalization each community had the opportunity to determine its own interpretation of the Islamic message, whereas now the norms are increasingly imposed by conservative Islamic groups. Given the circumstances, it seems that rather than opposing globalization, the Islamic world has <b>found</b> <b>its</b> own <b>way</b> of leading the process in a totally different direction.

40|$|Abstract: On {{the basis}} of {{analyzing}} the newly time sequence research achievement nowadays, several definitions on seismological zone relativity are put forward in this paper for integrating {{the large amount of}} history earthquake source data and the experimental expert knowledge in seismological field. At the same time, the time sequence similarity-matching model of the relevant seismological zone is presented, and then it is implemented through several correlative experimental simulations. Based on the sequence similarity-matching model, a sequence-matching algorithm is given with seismological similarity. Furthermore, by discovering the history earthquake database (EQDB) in recent 20 years, some experiments are provided to analyze longitudinal thick-granularity sequential similarity and thin-granularity sequential similarity. Finally, the experimental result has <b>found</b> <b>its</b> satisfactory <b>way</b> out by using the proposed algorithm to support earthquake prediction.

5|$|Prior to {{the first}} half, Chelsea {{continued}} to dominate possession and round-up more opportunities – the ball was given to Wise, after cooperation between Petrescu and Vialli, whose shot went just across the left goal. It did not take long, before Granville generated another endeavor for Chelsea to make Wohlfahrt throw himself to the right {{in order to prevent}} the shot. The club made its first substitute change in the 71st minute, which saw Flo being replaced by Zola. He made an effect immediately, picking up the ball after a well-timed pass by Wise, and finishing with a half volley in the penalty box, past Wohlfahrt, which <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> straight in the top right corner. As the match went on, Petrescu was sent off for an illegal tackle on Yakin. It did not affect Chelsea as Stuttgart failed to produce anything to turn the final in their favour. Stuttgart's situation proved worse when they were also reduced to ten men, as Poschner was dismissed after quarrels with referee Braschi.|$|E
5|$|The 1938 {{performance}} of the suite by Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, recorded on 78rpm discs, provided the only commercially available recording until {{the advent of the}} LP era in the 1950s; a performance by the Cleveland Orchestra under Fritz Reiner in December 1945 was not issued until many years later. In 1951 Capitol issued Hermann Scherchen's recording of the suite with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, since which many recordings of the work have been issued under a variety of labels. A 2008 edition of the Muze survey of recordings lists 19 available versions by orchestras from Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and the US.

Simultaneously, the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, which named it Tropical Storm Weng. Meteorologically, the storm began to exhibit improved outflow and deepening convection as it neared the central Philippines. At around 1600 UTC on November 13, Nepartak made landfall on northern Samar Island in the Philippines before traversing {{the remainder of the}} archipelago from east to west.

Soon it <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>ways</b> into the carnivals traveling the country and there it became the wrestling that we know today. Two men, screaming and bragging how good and strong they are, trying to convince its audience that it shall pay to see the fight. The purpose of this essay is to look at two of wrestling’s biggest names in Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair from a rhetorical standpoint and see what they do to convince their audience to buy their matches. The basics of rhetoric can be used to analyze speeches using the terms ethos, pathos and logos. The two wrestlers analyzed where known for their good and engaging speeches, in wrestling their called promos, and their different personas made them interesting to analyze. Hulk Hogan was known to be the good guy, the all-american who trained, said his prayers and ate his vitamins and cared for kids and other people in general. Ric Flair was known to cheat in the ring to get his victories. He always dressed in suits and bragged about woman, fast cars and how good he was in the ring. The results show that Hulk Hogan used the entire spectra of basic rhetoric. He would build his ethos by talking in terms that he represented, not only himself but the whole audience. He used pathos the get audience to feel fear for something that he said he would fight by represent the audience. Ric Flair mainly used pathos and the feeling of hatred. A hatred directed at himself by himself that would hopefully upset the audience to a degree where they would pay to see the match he was promoting...|$|R
